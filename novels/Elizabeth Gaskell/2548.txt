the poor clare by elizabeth gaskell chapter i december th my life has been strangely bound up with extraordinary incidents some of which occurred before i had any connection with the principal actors in them or indeed before i even knew of their existence i suppose most old men are like me more given to looking back upon their own career with a kind of fond interest and affectionate remembrance than to watching the eventsthough these may have far more interest for the multitudeimmediately passing before their eyes if this should be the case with the generality of old people how much more so with me if i am to enter upon that strange story connected with poor lucy i must begin a long way back i myself only came to the knowledge of her family history after i knew her but to make the tale clear to any one else i must arrange events in the order in which they occurrednot that in which i became acquainted with them there is a great old hall in the northeast of lancashire in a part they called the trough of bolland adjoining that other district named craven starkey manorhouse is rather like a number of rooms clustered round a gray massive old keep than a regularlybuilt hall indeed i suppose that the house only consisted of a great tower in the centre in the days when the scots made their raids terrible as far south as this and that after the stuarts came in and there was a little more security of property in those parts the starkeys of that time added the lower building which runs two stories high all round the base of the keep there has been a grand garden laid out in my days on the southern slope near the house but when i first knew the place the kitchengarden at the farm was the only piece of cultivated ground belonging to it the deer used to come within sight of the drawingroom windows and might have browsed quite close up to the house if they had not been too wild and shy starkey manorhouse itself stood on a projection or peninsula of high land jutting out from the abrupt hills that form the sides of the trough of bolland these hills were rocky and bleak enough towards their summit lower down they were clothed with tangled copsewood and green depths of fern out of which a gray giant of an ancient foresttree would tower here and there throwing up its ghastly white branches as if in imprecation to the sky these trees they told me were the remnants of that forest which existed in the days of the heptarchy and were even then noted as landmarks no wonder that their upper and more exposed branches were leafless and that the dead bark had peeled away from sapless old age not far from the house there were a few cottages apparently of the same date as the keep probably built for some retainers of the family who sought shelterthey and their families and their small flocks and herdsat the hands of their feudal lord some of them had pretty much fallen to decay they were built in a strange fashion strong beams had been sunk firm in the ground at the requisite distance and their other ends had been fastened together two and two so as to form the shape of one of those rounded waggonheaded gipsytents only very much larger the spaces between were filled with mud stones osiers rubbish mortaranything to keep out the weather the fires were made in the centre of these rude dwellings a hole in the roof forming the only chimney no highland hut or irish cabin could be of rougher construction the owner of this property at the beginning of the present century was a mr patrick byrne starkey his family had kept to the old faith and were stanch roman catholics esteeming it even a sin to marry any one of protestant descent however willing he or she might have been to embrace the romish religion mr patrick starkeys father had been a follower of james the second and during the disastrous irish campaign of that monarch he had fallen in love with an irish beauty a miss byrne as zealous for her religion and for the stuarts as himself he had returned to ireland after his escape to france and married her bearing her back to the court at st germains but some licence on the part of the disorderly gentlemen who surrounded king james in his exile had insulted his beautiful wife and disgusted him so he removed from st germains to antwerp whence in a few years time he quietly returned to starkey manorhousesome of his lancashire neighbours having lent their good offices to reconcile him to the powers that were he was as firm a catholic as ever and as stanch an advocate for the stuarts and the divine rights of kings but his religion almost amounted to asceticism and the conduct of these with whom he had been brought in such close contact at st germains would little bear the inspection of a stern moralist so he gave his allegiance where he could not give his esteem and learned to respect sincerely the upright and moral character of one whom he yet regarded as an usurper king williams government had little need to fear such a one so he returned as i have said with a sobered heart and impoverished fortunes to his ancestral house which had fallen sadly to ruin while the owner had been a courtier a soldier and an exile the roads into the trough of bolland were little more than cartruts indeed the way up to the house lay along a ploughed field before you came to the deerpark madam as the countryfolk used to call mrs starkey rode on a pillion behind her husband holding on to him with a light hand by his leather ridingbelt little master he that was afterwards squire patrick byrne starkey was held on to his pony by a servingman a woman past middle age walked with a firm and strong step by the cart that held much of the baggage and high up on the mails and boxes sat a girl of dazzling beauty perched lightly on the topmost trunk and swaying herself fearlessly to and fro as the cart rocked and shook in the heavy roads of late autumn the girl wore the antwerp faille or black spanish mantle over her head and altogether her appearance was such that the old cottager who described the possession to me many years after said that all the countryfolk took her for a foreigner some dogs and the boy who held them in charge made up the company they rode silently along looking with grave serious eyes at the people who came out of the scattered cottages to bow or curtsy to the real squire come back at last and gazed after the little procession with gaping wonder not deadened by the sound of the foreign language in which the few necessary words that passed among them were spoken one lad called from his staring by the squire to come and help about the cart accompanied them to the manorhouse he said that when the lady had descended from her pillion the middleaged woman whom i have described as walking while the others rode stepped quickly forward and taking madam starkey who was of a slight and delicate figure in her arms she lifted her over the threshold and set her down in her husbands house at the same time uttering a passionate and outlandish blessing the squire stood by smiling gravely at first but when the words of blessing were pronounced he took off his fine feathered hat and bent his head the girl with the black mantle stepped onward into the shadow of the dark hall and kissed the ladys hand and that was all the lad could tell to the group that gathered round him on his return eager to hear everything and to know how much the squire had given him for his services from all i could gather the manorhouse at the time of the squires return was in the most dilapidated state the stout gray walls remained firm and entire but the inner chambers had been used for all kinds of purposes the great withdrawingroom had been a barn the state tapestrychamber had held wool and so on but byandby they were cleared out and if the squire had no money to spend on new furniture he and his wife had the knack of making the best of the old he was no despicable joiner she had a kind of grace in whatever she did and imparted an air of elegant picturesqueness to whatever she touched besides they had brought many rare things from the continent perhaps i should rather say things that were rare in that part of englandcarvings and crosses and beautiful pictures and then again wood was plentiful in the trough of bolland and great logfires danced and glittered in all the dark old rooms and gave a look of home and comfort to everything why do i tell you all this i have little to do with the squire and madame starkey and yet i dwell upon them as if i were unwilling to come to the real people with whom my life was so strangely mixed up madam had been nursed in ireland by the very woman who lifted her in her arms and welcomed her to her husbands home in lancashire excepting for the short period of her own married life bridget fitzgerald had never left her nursling her marriageto one above her in rankhad been unhappy her husband had died and left her in even greater poverty than that in which she was when he had first met with her she had one child the beautiful daughter who came riding on the waggonload of furniture that was brought to the manorhouse madame starkey had taken her again into her service when she became a widow she and her daughter had followed the mistress in all her fortunes they had lived at st germains and at antwerp and were now come to her home in lancashire as soon as bridget had arrived there the squire gave her a cottage of her own and took more pains in furnishing it for her than he did in anything else out of his own house it was only nominally her residence she was constantly up at the great house indeed it was but a short cut across the woods from her own home to the home of her nursling her daughter mary in like manner moved from one house to the other at her own will madam loved both mother and child dearly they had great influence over her and through her over her husband whatever bridget or mary willed was sure to come to pass they were not disliked for though wild and passionate they were also generous by nature but the other servants were afraid of them as being in secret the ruling spirits of the household the squire had lost his interest in all secular things madam was gentle affectionate and yielding both husband and wife were tenderly attached to each other and to their boy but they grew more and more to shun the trouble of decision on any point and hence it was that bridget could exert such despotic power but if everyone else yielded to her magic of a superior mind her daughter not unfrequently rebelled she and her mother were too much alike to agree there were wild quarrels between them and wilder reconciliations there were times when in the heat of passion they could have stabbed each other at all other times they bothbridget especiallywould have willingly laid down their lives for one another bridgets love for her child lay very deepdeeper than that daughter ever knew or i should think she would never have wearied of home as she did and prayed her mistress to obtain for her some situationas waiting maidbeyond the seas in that more cheerful continental life among the scenes of which so many of her happiest years had been spent she thought as youth thinks that life would last for ever and that two or three years were but a small portion of it to pass away from her mother whose only child she was bridget thought differently but was too proud ever to show what she felt if her child wished to leave her whyshe should go but people said bridget became ten years older in the course of two months at this time she took it that mary wanted to leave her the truth was that mary wanted for a time to leave the place and to seek some change and would thankfully have taken her mother with her indeed when madam starkey had gotten her a situation with some grand lady abroad and the time drew near for her to go it was mary who clung to her mother with passionate embrace and with floods of tears declared that she would never leave her and it was bridget who at last loosened her arms and grave and tearless herself bade her keep her word and go forth into the wide world sobbing aloud and looking back continually mary went away bridget was still as death scarcely drawing her breath or closing her stony eyes till at last she turned back into her cottage and heaved a ponderous old settle against the door there she sat motionless over the gray ashes of her extinguished fire deaf to madams sweet voice as she begged leave to enter and comfort her nurse deaf stony and motionless she sat for more than twenty hours till for the third time madam came across the snowy path from the great house carrying with her a young spaniel which had been marys pet up at the hall and which had not ceased all night long to seek for its absent mistress and to whine and moan after her with tears madam told this story through the closed doortears excited by the terrible look of anguish so steady so immovableso the same today as it was yesterdayon her nurses face the little creature in her arms began to utter its piteous cry as it shivered with the cold bridget stirred she movedshe listened again that long whine she thought it was for her daughter and what she had denied to her nursling and mistress she granted to the dumb creature that mary had cherished she opened the door and took the dog from madams arms then madam came in and kissed and comforted the old woman who took but little notice of her or anything and sending up master patrick to the hall for fire and food the sweet young lady never left her nurse all that night next day the squire himself came down carrying a beautiful foreign pictureour lady of the holy heart the papists call it it is a picture of the virgin her heart pierced with arrows each arrow representing one of her great woes that picture hung in bridgets cottage when i first saw her i have that picture now years went on mary was still abroad bridget was still and stern instead of active and passionate the little dog mignon was indeed her darling i have heard that she talked to it continually although to most people she was so silent the squire and madam treated her with the greatest consideration and well they might for to them she was as devoted and faithful as ever mary wrote pretty often and seemed satisfied with her life but at length the letters ceasedi hardly know whether before or after a great and terrible sorrow came upon the house of the starkeys the squire sickened of a putrid fever and madam caught it in nursing him and died you may be sure bridget let no other woman tend her but herself and in the very arms that had received her at her birth that sweet young woman laid her head down and gave up her breath the squire recovered in a fashion he was never stronghe had never the heart to smile again he fasted and prayed more than ever and people did say that he tried to cut off the entail and leave all the property away to found a monastery abroad of which he prayed that some day little squire patrick might be the reverend father but he could not do this for the strictness of the entail and the laws against the papists so he could only appoint gentlemen of his own faith as guardians to his son with many charges about the lads soul and a few about the land and the way it was to be held while he was a minor of course bridget was not forgotten he sent for her as he lay on his deathbed and asked her if she would rather have a sum down or have a small annuity settled upon her she said at once she would have a sum down for she thought of her daughter and how she could bequeath the money to her whereas an annuity would have died with her so the squire left her her cottage for life and a fair sum of money and then he died with as ready and willing a heart as i suppose ever any gentleman took out of this world with him the young squire was carried off by his guardians and bridget was left alone i have said that she had not heard from mary for some time in her last letter she had told of travelling about with her mistress who was the english wife of some great foreign officer and had spoken of her chances of making a good marriage without naming the gentlemans name keeping it rather back as a pleasant surprise to her mother his station and fortune being as i had afterwards reason to know far superior to anything she had a right to expect then came a long silence and madam was dead and the squire was dead and bridgets heart was gnawed by anxiety and she knew not whom to ask for news of her child she could not write and the squire had managed her communication with her daughter she walked off to hurst and got a good priest thereone whom she had known at antwerpto write for her but no answer came it was like crying into the awful stillness of night one day bridget was missed by those neighbours who had been accustomed to mark her goingsout and comingsin she had never been sociable with any of them but the sight of her had become a part of their daily lives and slow wonder arose in their minds as morning after morning came and her housedoor remained closed her window dead from any glitter or light of fire within at length some one tried the door it was locked two or three laid their heads together before daring to look in through the blank unshuttered window but at last they summoned up courage and then saw that bridgets absence from their little world was not the result of accident or death but of premeditation such small articles of furniture as could be secured from the effects of time and damp by being packed up were stowed away in boxes the picture of the madonna was taken down and gone in a word bridget had stolen away from her home and left no trace whither she was departed i knew afterwards that she and her little dog had wandered off on the long search for her lost daughter she was too illiterate to have faith in letters even had she had the means of writing and sending many but she had faith in her own strong love and believed that her passionate instinct would guide her to her child besides foreign travel was no new thing to her and she could speak enough of french to explain the object of her journey and had moreover the advantage of being from her faith a welcome object of charitable hospitality at many a distant convent but the country people round starkey manorhouse knew nothing of all this they wondered what had become of her in a torpid lazy fashion and then left off thinking of her altogether several years passed both manorhouse and cottage were deserted the young squire lived far away under the direction of his guardians there were inroads of wool and corn into the sittingrooms of the hall and there was some low talk from time to time among the hinds and country people whether it would not be as well to break into old bridgets cottage and save such of her goods as were left from the moth and rust which must be making sad havoc but this idea was always quenched by the recollection of her strong character and passionate anger and tales of her masterful spirit and vehement force of will were whispered about till the very thought of offending her by touching any article of hers became invested with a kind of horror it was believed that dead or alive she would not fail to avenge it suddenly she came home with as little noise or note of preparation as she had departed one day some one noticed a thin blue curl of smoke ascending from her chimney her door stood open to the noonday sun and ere many hours had elapsed some one had seen an old travelandsorrowstained woman dipping her pitcher in the well and said that the dark solemn eyes that looked up at him were more like bridget fitzgeralds than any one elses in this world and yet if it were she she looked as if she had been scorched in the flames of hell so brown and scared and fierce a creature did she seem byandby many saw her and those who met her eye once cared not to be caught looking at her again she had got into the habit of perpetually talking to herself nay more answering herself and varying her tones according to the side she took at the moment it was no wonder that those who dared to listen outside her door at night believed that she held converse with some spirit in short she was unconsciously earning for herself the dreadful reputation of a witch her little dog which had wandered half over the continent with her was her only companion a dumb remembrancer of happier days once he was ill and she carried him more than three miles to ask about his management from one who had been groom to the last squire and had then been noted for his skill in all diseases of animals whatever this man did the dog recovered and they who heard her thanks intermingled with blessings that were rather promises of good fortune than prayers looked grave at his good luck when next year his ewes twinned and his meadowgrass was heavy and thick now it so happened that about the year seventeen hundred and eleven one of the guardians of the young squire a certain sir philip tempest bethought him of the good shooting there must be on his wards property and in consequence he brought down four or five gentlemen of his friends to stay for a week or two at the hall from all accounts they roystered and spent pretty freely i never heard any of their names but one and that was squire gisbornes he was hardly a middleaged man then he had been much abroad and there i believe he had known sir philip tempest and done him some service he was a daring and dissolute fellow in those days careless and fearless and one who would rather be in a quarrel than out of it he had his fits of illtemper besides when he would spare neither man nor beast otherwise those who knew him well used to say he had a good heart when he was neither drunk nor angry nor in any way vexed he had altered much when i came to know him one day the gentlemen had all been out shooting and with but little success i believe anyhow mr gisborne had none and was in a black humour accordingly he was coming home having his gun loaded sportsmanlike when little mignon crossed his path just as he turned out of the wood by bridgets cottage partly for wantonness partly to vent his spleen upon some living creature mr gisborne took his gun and firedhe had better have never fired gun again than aimed that unlucky shot he hit mignon and at the creatures sudden cry bridget came out and saw at a glance what had been done she took mignon up in her arms and looked hard at the wound the poor dog looked at her with his glazing eyes and tried to wag his tail and lick her hand all covered with blood mr gisborne spoke in a kind of sullen penitence you should have kept the dog out of my waya little poaching varmint at this very moment mignon stretched out his legs and stiffened in her armsher lost marys dog who had wandered and sorrowed with her for years she walked right into mr gisbornes path and fixed his unwilling sullen look with her dark and terrible eye those never throve that did me harm said she im alone in the world and helpless the more do the saints in heaven hear my prayers hear me ye blessed ones hear me while i ask for sorrow on this bad cruel man he has killed the only creature that loved methe dumb beast that i loved bring down heavy sorrow on his head for it o ye saints he thought that i was helpless because he saw me lonely and poor but are not the armies of heaven for the like of me come come said he half remorseful but not one whit afraid heres a crown to buy thee another dog take it and leave off cursing i care none for thy threats dont you said she coming a step closer and changing her imprecatory cry for a whisper which made the gamekeepers lad following mr gisborne creep all over you shall live to see the creature you love best and who alone loves youay a human creature but as innocent and fond as my poor dead darlingyou shall see this creature for whom death would be too happy become a terror and a loathing to all for this bloods sake hear me o holy saints who never fail them that have no other help she threw up her right hand filled with poor mignons lifedrops they spirted one or two of them on his shootingdressan ominous sight to the follower but the master only laughed a little forced scornful laugh and went on to the hall before he got there however he took out a gold piece and bade the boy carry it to the old woman on his return to the village the lad was afeared as he told me in after years he came to the cottage and hovered about not daring to enter he peeped through the window at last and by the flickering woodflame he saw bridget kneeling before the picture of our lady of the holy heart with dead mignon lying between her and the madonna she was praying wildly as her outstretched arms betokened the lad shrunk away in redoubled terror and contented himself with slipping the gold piece under the illfitting door the next day it was thrown out upon the midden and there it lay no one daring to touch it meanwhile mr gisborne half curious half uneasy thought to lessen his uncomfortable feelings by asking sir philip who bridget was he could only describe herhe did not know her name sir philip was equally at a loss but an old servant of the starkeys who had resumed his livery at the hall on this occasiona scoundrel whom bridget had saved from dismissal more than once during her palmy dayssaid it will be the old witch that his worship means she needs a ducking if ever a woman did does that bridget fitzgerald fitzgerald said both the gentlemen at once but sir philip was the first to continue i must have no talk of ducking her dickon why she must be the very woman poor starkey bade me have a care of but when i came here last she was gone no one knew where ill go and see her tomorrow but mind you sirrah if any harm comes to her or any more talk of her being a witchive a pack of hounds at home who can follow the scent of a lying knave as well as ever they followed a dogfox so take care how you talk about ducking a faithful old servant of your dead masters had she ever a daughter asked mr gisborne after a while i dont knowyes ive a notion she had a kind of waiting woman to madam starkey please your worship said humbled dickon mistress bridget had a daughterone mistress marywho went abroad and has never been heard on since and folk do say that has crazed her mother mr gisborne shaded his eyes with his hand i could wish she had not cursed me he muttered she may have powerno one else could after a while he said aloud no one understanding rightly what he meant tush it is impossibleand called for claret and he and the other gentlemen setto to a drinkingbout chapter ii i now come to the time in which i myself was mixed up with the people that i have been writing about and to make you understand how i became connected with them i must give you some little account of myself my father was the younger son of a devonshire gentleman of moderate property my eldest uncle succeeded to the estate of his forefathers my second became an eminent attorney in london and my father took orders like most poor clergymen he had a large family and i have no doubt was glad enough when my london uncle who was a bachelor offered to take charge of me and bring me up to be his successor in business in this way i came to live in london in my uncles house not far from grays inn and to be treated and esteemed as his son and to labour with him in his office i was very fond of the old gentleman he was the confidential agent of many country squires and had attained to his present position as much by knowledge of human nature as by knowledge of law though he was learned enough in the latter he used to say his business was law his pleasure heraldry from his intimate acquaintance with family history and all the tragic courses of life therein involved to hear him talk at leisure times about any coat of arms that came across his path was as good as a play or a romance many cases of disputed property dependent on a love of genealogy were brought to him as to a great authority on such points if the lawyer who came to consult him was young he would take no fee only give him a long lecture on the importance of attending to heraldry if the lawyer was of mature age and good standing he would mulct him pretty well and abuse him to me afterwards as negligent of one great branch of the profession his house was in a stately new street called ormond street and in it he had a handsome library but all the books treated of things that were past none of them planned or looked forward into the future i worked awaypartly for the sake of my family at home partly because my uncle had really taught me to enjoy the kind of practice in which he himself took such delight i suspect i worked too hard at any rate in seventeen hundred and eighteen i was far from well and my good uncle was disturbed by my ill looks one day he rang the bell twice into the clerks room at the dingy office in greys inn lane it was the summons for me and i went into his private room just as a gentlemanwhom i knew well enough by sight as an irish lawyer of more reputation than he deservedwas leaving my uncle was slowly rubbing his hands together and considering i was there two or three minutes before he spoke then he told me that i must pack up my portmanteau that very afternoon and start that night by posthorse for west chester i should get there if all went well at the end of five days time and must then wait for a packet to cross over to dublin from thence i must proceed to a certain town named kildoon and in that neighbourhood i was to remain making certain inquiries as to the existence of any descendants of the younger branch of a family to whom some valuable estates had descended in the female line the irish lawyer whom i had seen was weary of the case and would willingly have given up the property without further ado to a man who appeared to claim them but on laying his tables and trees before my uncle the latter had foreseen so many possible prior claimants that the lawyer had begged him to undertake the management of the whole business in his youth my uncle would have liked nothing better than going over to ireland himself and ferreting out every scrap of paper or parchment and every word of tradition respecting the family as it was old and gouty he deputed me accordingly i went to kildoon i suspect i had something of my uncles delight in following up a genealogical scent for i very soon found out when on the spot that mr rooney the irish lawyer would have got both himself and the first claimant into a terrible scrape if he had pronounced his opinion that the estates ought to be given up to him there were three poor irish fellows each nearer of kin to the last possessor but a generation before there was a still nearer relation who had never been accounted for nor his existence ever discovered by the lawyers i venture to think till i routed him out from the memory of some of the old dependants of the family what had become of him i travelled backwards and forwards i crossed over to france and came back again with a slight clue which ended in my discovering that wild and dissipated himself he had left one child a son of yet worse character than his father that this same hugh fitzgerald had married a very beautiful servingwoman of the byrnesa person below him in hereditary rank but above him in character that he had died soon after his marriage leaving one child whether a boy or a girl i could not learn and that the mother had returned to live in the family of the byrnes now the chief of this latter family was serving in the duke of berwicks regiment and it was long before i could hear from him it was more than a year before i got a short haughty letteri fancy he had a soldiers contempt for a civilian an irishmans hatred for an englishman an exiled jacobites jealousy of one who prospered and lived tranquilly under the government he looked upon as an usurpation bridget fitzgerald he said had been faithful to the fortunes of his sisterhad followed her abroad and to england when mrs starkey had thought fit to return both his sister and her husband were dead he knew nothing of bridget fitzgerald at the present time probably sir philip tempest his nephews guardian might be able to give me some information i have not given the little contemptuous terms the way in which faithful service was meant to imply more than it saidall that has nothing to do with my story sir philip when applied to told me that he paid an annuity regularly to an old woman named fitzgerald living at coldholme the village near starkey manorhouse whether she had any descendants he could not say one bleak march evening i came in sight of the places described at the beginning of my story i could hardly understand the rude dialect in which the direction to old bridgets house was given yo see yon furleets all run together gave me no idea that i was to guide myself by the distant lights that shone in the windows of the hall occupied for the time by a farmer who held the post of steward while the squire now four or five and twenty was making the grand tour however at last i reached bridgets cottagea low mossgrown place the palings that had once surrounded it were broken and gone and the underwood of the forest came up to the walls and must have darkened the windows it was about seven oclocknot late to my london notionsbut after knocking for some time at the door and receiving no reply i was driven to conjecture that the occupant of the house was gone to bed so i betook myself to the nearest church i had seen three miles back on the road i had come sure that close to that i should find an inn of some kind and early the next morning i set off back to coldholme by a fieldpath which my host assured me i should find a shorter cut than the road i had taken the night before it was a cold sharp morning my feet left prints in the sprinkling of hoarfrost that covered the ground nevertheless i saw an old woman whom i instinctively suspected to be the object of my search in a sheltered covert on one side of my path i lingered and watched her she must have been considerably above the middle size in her prime for when she raised herself from the stooping position in which i first saw her there was something fine and commanding in the erectness of her figure she drooped again in a minute or two and seemed looking for something on the ground as with bent head she turned off from the spot where i gazed upon her and was lost to my sight i fancy i missed my way and made a round in spite of the landlords directions for by the time i had reached bridgets cottage she was there with no semblance of hurried walk or discomposure of any kind the door was slightly ajar i knocked and the majestic figure stood before me silently awaiting the explanation of my errand her teeth were all gone so the nose and chin were brought near together the gray eyebrows were straight and almost hung over her deep cavernous eyes and the thick white hair lay in silvery masses over the low wide wrinkled forehead for a moment i stood uncertain how to shape my answer to the solemn questioning of her silence your name is bridget fitzgerald i believe she bowed her head in assent i have something to say to you may i come in i am unwilling to keep you standing you cannot tire me she said and at first she seemed inclined to deny me the shelter of her roof but the next momentshe had searched the very soul in me with her eyes during that instantshe led me in and dropped the shadowing hood of her gray draping cloak which had previously hid part of the character of her countenance the cottage was rude and bare enough but before the picture of the virgin of which i have made mention there stood a little cup filled with fresh primroses while she paid her reverence to the madonna i understood why she had been out seeking through the clumps of green in the sheltered copse then she turned round and bade me be seated the expression of her face which all this time i was studying was not bad as the stories of my last nights landlord had led me to expect it was a wild stern fierce indomitable countenance seamed and scarred by agonies of solitary weeping but it was neither cunning nor malignant my name is bridget fitzgerald said she by way of opening our conversation and your husband was hugh fitzgerald of knock mahon near kildoon in ireland a faint light came into the dark gloom of her eyes he was may i ask if you had any children by him the light in her eyes grew quick and red she tried to speak i could see but something rose in her throat and choked her and until she could speak calmly she would fain not speak at all before a stranger in a minute or so she saidi had a daughterone mary fitzgeraldthen her strong nature mastered her strong will and she cried out with a trembling wailing cry oh man what of herwhat of her she rose from her seat and came and clutched at my arm and looked in my eyes there she read as i suppose my utter ignorance of what had become of her child for she went blindly back to her chair and sat rocking herself and softly moaning as if i were not there i not daring to speak to the lone and awful woman after a little pause she knelt down before the picture of our lady of the holy heart and spoke to her by all the fanciful and poetic names of the litany o rose of sharon o tower of david o star of the sea have ye no comfort for my sore heart am i for ever to hope grant me at least despairand so on she went heedless of my presence her prayers grew wilder and wilder till they seemed to me to touch on the borders of madness and blasphemy almost involuntarily i spoke as if to stop her have you any reason to think that your daughter is dead she rose from her knees and came and stood before me mary fitzgerald is dead said she i shall never see her again in the flesh no tongue ever told me but i know she is dead i have yearned so to see her and my hearts will is fearful and strong it would have drawn her to me before now if she had been a wanderer on the other side of the world i wonder often it has not drawn her out of the grave to come and stand before me and hear me tell her how i loved her for sir we parted unfriends i knew nothing but the dry particulars needed for my lawyers quest but i could not help feeling for the desolate woman and she must have read the unusual sympathy with her wistful eyes yes sir we did she never knew how i loved her and we parted unfriends and i fear me that i wished her voyage might not turn out well only meaningo blessed virgin you know i only meant that she should come home to her mothers arms as to the happiest place on earth but my wishes are terribletheir power goes beyond my thoughtand there is no hope for me if my words brought mary harm but i said you do not know that she is dead even now you hoped she might be alive listen to me and i told her the tale i have already told you giving it all in the driest manner for i wanted to recall the clear sense that i felt almost sure she had possessed in her younger days and by keeping up her attention to details restrain the vague wildness of her grief she listened with deep attention putting from time to time such questions as convinced me i had to do with no common intelligence however dimmed and shorn by solitude and mysterious sorrow then she took up her tale and in few brief words told me of her wanderings abroad in vain search after her daughter sometimes in the wake of armies sometimes in camp sometimes in city the lady whose waitingwoman mary had gone to be had died soon after the date of her last letter home her husband the foreign officer had been serving in hungary whither bridget had followed him but too late to find him vague rumours reached her that mary had made a great marriage and this sting of doubt was addedwhether the mother might not be close to her child under her new name and even hearing of her every day and yet never recognizing the lost one under the appellation she then bore at length the thought took possession of her that it was possible that all this time mary might be at home at coldholme in the trough of bolland in lancashire in england and home came bridget in that vain hope to her desolate hearth and empty cottage here she had thought it safest to remain if mary was in life it was here she would seek for her mother i noted down one or two particulars out of bridgets narrative that i thought might be of use to me for i was stimulated to further search in a strange and extraordinary manner it seemed as if it were impressed upon me that i must take up the quest where bridget had laid it down and this for no reason that had previously influenced me such as my uncles anxiety on the subject my own reputation as a lawyer and so on but from some strange power which had taken possession of my will only that very morning and which forced it in the direction it chose i will go said i i will spare nothing in the search trust to me i will learn all that can be learnt you shall know all that money or pains or wit can discover it is true she may be long dead but she may have left a child a child she cried as if for the first time this idea had struck her mind hear him blessed virgin he says she may have left a child and you have never told me though i have prayed so for a sign waking or sleeping nay said i i know nothing but what you tell me you say you heard of her marriage but she caught nothing of what i said she was praying to the virgin in a kind of ecstasy which seemed to render her unconscious of my very presence from coldholme i went to sir philip tempests the wife of the foreign officer had been a cousin of his fathers and from him i thought i might gain some particulars as to the existence of the count de la tour dauvergne and where i could find him for i knew questions de vive voix aid the flagging recollection and i was determined to lose no chance for want of trouble but sir philip had gone abroad and it would be some time before i could receive an answer so i followed my uncles advice to whom i had mentioned how wearied i felt both in body and mind by my willothewisp search he immediately told me to go to harrogate there to await sir philips reply i should be near to one of the places connected with my search coldholme not far from sir philip tempest in case he returned and i wished to ask him any further questions and in conclusion my uncle bade me try to forget all about my business for a time this was far easier said than done i have seen a child on a common blown along by a high wind without power of standing still and resisting the tempestuous force i was somewhat in the same predicament as regarded my mental state something resistless seemed to urge my thoughts on through every possible course by which there was a chance of attaining to my object i did not see the sweeping moors when i walked out when i held a book in my hand and read the words their sense did not penetrate to my brain if i slept i went on with the same ideas always flowing in the same direction this could not last long without having a bad effect on the body i had an illness which although i was racked with pain was a positive relief to me as it compelled me to live in the present suffering and not in the visionary researches i had been continually making before my kind uncle came to nurse me and after the immediate danger was over my life seemed to slip away in delicious languor for two or three months i did not askso much did i dread falling into the old channel of thoughtwhether any reply had been received to my letter to sir philip i turned my whole imagination right away from all that subject my uncle remained with me until nigh midsummer and then returned to his business in london leaving me perfectly well although not completely strong i was to follow him in a fortnight when as he said we would look over letters and talk about several things i knew what this little speech alluded to and shrank from the train of thought it suggested which was so intimately connected with my first feelings of illness however i had a fortnight more to roam on those invigorating yorkshire moors in those days there was one large rambling inn at harrogate close to the medicinal spring but it was already becoming too small for the accommodation of the influx of visitors and many lodged round about in the farmhouses of the district it was so early in the season that i had the inn pretty much to myself and indeed felt rather like a visitor in a private house so intimate had the landlord and landlady become with me during my long illness she would chide me for being out so late on the moors or for having been too long without food quite in a motherly way while he consulted me about vintages and wines and taught me many a yorkshire wrinkle about horses in my walks i met other strangers from time to time even before my uncle had left me i had noticed with halftorpid curiosity a young lady of very striking appearance who went about always accompanied by an elderly companionhardly a gentlewoman but with something in her look that prepossessed me in her favour the younger lady always put her veil down when any one approached so it had been only once or twice when i had come upon her at a sudden turn in the path that i had even had a glimpse at her face i am not sure if it was beautiful though in afterlife i grew to think it so but it was at this time overshadowed by a sadness that never varied a pale quiet resigned look of intense suffering that irresistibly attracted menot with love but with a sense of infinite compassion for one so young yet so hopelessly unhappy the companion wore something of the same look quiet melancholy hopeless yet resigned i asked my landlord who they were he said they were called clarke and wished to be considered as mother and daughter but that for his part he did not believe that to be their right name or that there was any such relationship between them they had been in the neighbourhood of harrogate for some time lodging in a remote farmhouse the people there would tell nothing about them saying that they paid handsomely and never did any harm so why should they be speaking of any strange things that might happen that as the landlord shrewdly observed showed there was something out of the common way he had heard that the elderly woman was a cousin of the farmers where they lodged and so the regard existing between relations might help to keep them quiet what did he think then was the reason for their extreme seclusion asked i nay he could not tellnot he he had heard that the young lady for all as quiet as she seemed played strange pranks at times he shook his head when i asked him for more particulars and refused to give them which made me doubt if he knew any for he was in general a talkative and communicative man in default of other interests after my uncle left i set myself to watch these two people i hovered about their walks drawn towards them with a strange fascination which was not diminished by their evident annoyance at so frequently meeting me one day i had the sudden good fortune to be at hand when they were alarmed by the attack of a bull which in those unenclosed grazing districts was a particularly dangerous occurrence i have other and more important things to relate than to tell of the accident which gave me an opportunity of rescuing them it is enough to say that this event was the beginning of an acquaintance reluctantly acquiesced in by them but eagerly prosecuted by me i can hardly tell when intense curiosity became merged in love but in less than ten days after my uncles departure i was passionately enamoured of mistress lucy as her attendant called her carefullyfor this i noted wellavoiding any address which appeared as if there was an equality of station between them i noticed also that mrs clarke the elderly woman after her first reluctance to allow me to pay them any attentions had been overcome was cheered by my evident attachment to the young girl it seemed to lighten her heavy burden of care and she evidently favoured my visits to the farmhouse where they lodged it was not so with lucy a more attractive person i never saw in spite of her depression of manner and shrinking avoidance of me i felt sure at once that whatever was the source of her grief it rose from no fault of her own it was difficult to draw her into conversation but when at times for a moment or two i beguiled her into talk i could see a rare intelligence in her face and a grave trusting look in the soft gray eyes that were raised for a minute to mine i made every excuse i possibly could for going there i sought wild flowers for lucys sake i planned walks for lucys sake i watched the heavens by night in hopes that some unusual beauty of sky would justify me in tempting mrs clarke and lucy forth upon the moors to gaze at the great purple dome above it seemed to me that lucy was aware of my love but that for some motive which i could not guess she would fain have repelled me but then again i saw or fancied i saw that her heart spoke in my favour and that there was a struggle going on in her mind which at times i loved so dearly i could have begged her to spare herself even though the happiness of my whole life should have been the sacrifice for her complexion grew paler her aspect of sorrow more hopeless her delicate frame yet slighter during this period i had written i should say to my uncle to beg to be allowed to prolong my stay at harrogate not giving any reason but such was his tenderness towards me that in a few days i heard from him giving me a willing permission and only charging me to take care of myself and not use too much exertion during the hot weather one sultry evening i drew near the farm the windows of their parlour were open and i heard voices when i turned the corner of the house as i passed the first window there were two windows in their little groundfloor room i saw lucy distinctly but when i had knocked at their doorthe housedoor stood always ajarshe was gone and i saw only mrs clarke turning over the workthings lying on the table in a nervous and purposeless manner i felt by instinct that a conversation of some importance was coming on in which i should be expected to say what was my object in paying these frequent visits i was glad of the opportunity my uncle had several times alluded to the pleasant possibility of my bringing home a young wife to cheer and adorn the old house in ormond street he was rich and i was to succeed him and had as i knew a fair reputation for so young a lawyer so on my side i saw no obstacle it was true that lucy was shrouded in mystery her name i was convinced it was not clarke birth parentage and previous life were unknown to me but i was sure of her goodness and sweet innocence and although i knew that there must be something painful to be told to account for her mournful sadness yet i was willing to bear my share in her grief whatever it might be mrs clarke began as if it was a relief to her to plunge into the subject we have thought sirat least i have thoughtthat you knew very little of us nor we of you indeed not enough to warrant the intimate acquaintance we have fallen into i beg your pardon sir she went on nervously i am but a plain kind of woman and i mean to use no rudeness but i must say straight out that iwethink it would be better for you not to come so often to see us she is very unprotected and why should i not come to see you dear madam asked i eagerly glad of the opportunity of explaining myself i come i own because i have learnt to love mistress lucy and wish to teach her to love me mistress clarke shook her head and sighed dont sirneither love her nor for the sake of all you hold sacred teach her to love you if i am too late and you love her already forget herforget these last few weeks o i should never have allowed you to come she went on passionately but what am i to do we are forsaken by all except the great god and even he permits a strange and evil power to afflict uswhat am i to do where is it to end she wrung her hands in her distress then she turned to me go away sir go away before you learn to care any more for her i ask it for your own sakei implore you have been good and kind to us and we shall always recollect you with gratitude but go away now and never come back to cross our fatal path indeed madam said i i shall do no such thing you urge it for my own sake i have no fear so urgednor wish except to hear moreall i cannot have seen mistress lucy in all the intimacy of this last fortnight without acknowledging her goodness and innocence and without seeingpardon me madamthat for some reason you are two very lonely women in some mysterious sorrow and distress now though i am not powerful myself yet i have friends who are so wise and kind that they may be said to possess power tell me some particulars why are you in griefwhat is your secretwhy are you here i declare solemnly that nothing you have said has daunted me in my wish to become lucys husband nor will i shrink from any difficulty that as such an aspirant i may have to encounter you say you are friendlesswhy cast away an honest friend i will tell you of people to whom you may write and who will answer any questions as to my character and prospects i do not shun inquiry she shook her head again you had better go away sir you know nothing about us i know your names said i and i have heard you allude to the part of the country from which you came which i happen to know as a wild and lonely place there are so few people living in it that if i chose to go there i could easily ascertain all about you but i would rather hear it from yourself you see i wanted to pique her into telling me something definite you do not know our true names sir said she hastily well i may have conjectured as much but tell me then i conjure you give me your reasons for distrusting my willingness to stand by what i have said with regard to mistress lucy oh what can i do exclaimed she if i am turning away a true friend as he saysstay coming to a sudden decisioni will tell you somethingi cannot tell you allyou would not believe it but perhaps i can tell you enough to prevent your going on in your hopeless attachment i am not lucys mother so i conjectured i said go on i do not even know whether she is the legitimate or illegitimate child of her father but he is cruelly turned against her and her mother is long dead and for a terrible reason she has no other creature to keep constant to her but me sheonly two years agosuch a darling and such a pride in her fathers house why sir there is a mystery that might happen in connection with her any moment and then you would go away like all the rest and when you next heard her name you would loathe her others who have loved her longer have done so before now my poor child whom neither god nor man has mercy uponor surely she would die the good woman was stopped by her crying i confess i was a little stunned by her last words but only for a moment at any rate till i knew definitely what was this mysterious stain upon one so simple and pure as lucy seemed i would not desert her and so i said and she made me answer if you are daring in your heart to think harm of my child sir after knowing her as you have done you are no good man yourself but i am so foolish and helpless in my great sorrow that i would fain hope to find a friend in you i cannot help trusting that although you may no longer feel toward her as a lover you will have pity upon us and perhaps by your learning you can tell us where to go for aid i implore you to tell me what this mystery is i cried almost maddened by this suspense i cannot said she solemnly i am under a deep vow of secrecy if you are to be told it must be by her she left the room and i remained to ponder over this strange interview i mechanically turned over the few books and with eyes that saw nothing at the time examined the tokens of lucys frequent presence in that room when i got home at night i remembered how all these trifles spoke of a pure and tender heart and innocent life mistress clarke returned she had been crying sadly yes said she it is as i feared she loves you so much that she is willing to run the fearful risk of telling you all herselfshe acknowledges it is but a poor chance but your sympathy will be a balm if you give it tomorrow come here at ten in the morning and as you hope for pity in your hour of agony repress all show of fear or repugnance you may feel towards one so grievously afflicted i half smiled have no fear i said it seemed too absurd to imagine my feeling dislike to lucy her father loved her well said she gravely yet he drove her out like some monstrous thing just at this moment came a peal of ringing laughter from the garden it was lucys voice it sounded as if she were standing just on one side of the open casementand as though she were suddenly stirred to merrimentmerriment verging on boisterousness by the doings or sayings of some other person i can scarcely say why but the sound jarred on me inexpressibly she knew the subject of our conversation and must have been at least aware of the state of agitation her friend was in she herself usually so gentle and quiet i half rose to go to the window and satisfy my instinctive curiosity as to what had provoked this burst of illtimed laughter but mrs clarke threw her whole weight and power upon the hand with which she pressed and kept me down for gods sake she said white and trembling all over sit still be quiet oh be patient tomorrow you will know all leave us for we are all sorely afflicted do not seek to know more about us again that laughso musical in sound yet so discordant to my heart she held me tighttighter without positive violence i could not have risen i was sitting with my back to the window but i felt a shadow pass between the suns warmth and me and a strange shudder ran through my frame in a minute or two she released me go repeated she be warned i ask you once more i do not think you can stand this knowledge that you seek if i had had my own way lucy should never have yielded and promised to tell you all who knows what may come of it i am firm in my wish to know all i return at ten tomorrow morning and then expect to see mistress lucy herself i turned away having my own suspicions i confess as to mistress clarkes sanity conjectures as to the meaning of her hints and uncomfortable thoughts connected with that strange laughter filled my mind i could hardly sleep i rose early and long before the hour i had appointed i was on the path over the common that led to the old farmhouse where they lodged i suppose that lucy had passed no better a night than i for there she was also slowly pacing with her even step her eyes bent down her whole look most saintly and pure she started when i came close to her and grew paler as i reminded her of my appointment and spoke with something of the impatience of obstacles that seeing her once more had called up afresh in my mind all strange and terrible hints and giddy merriment were forgotten my heart gave forth words of fire and my tongue uttered them her colour went and came as she listened but when i had ended my passionate speeches she lifted her soft eyes to me and said but you know that you have something to learn about me yet i only want to say this i shall not think less of youless well of you i meanif you too fall away from me when you know all stop said she as if fearing another burst of mad words listen to me my father is a man of great wealth i never knew my mother she must have died when i was very young when first i remember anything i was living in a great lonely house with my dear and faithful mistress clarke my father even was not there he washe isa soldier and his duties lie aboard but he came from time to time and every time i think he loved me more and more he brought me rarities from foreign lands which prove to me now how much he must have thought of me during his absences i can sit down and measure the depth of his lost love now by such standards as these i never thought whether he loved me or not then it was so natural that it was like the air i breathed yet he was an angry man at times even then but never with me he was very reckless too and once or twice i heard a whisper among the servants that a doom was over him and that he knew it and tried to drown his knowledge in wild activity and even sometimes sir in wine so i grew up in this grand mansion in that lonely place everything around me seemed at my disposal and i think every one loved me i am sure i loved them till about two years agoi remember it wellmy father had come to england to us and he seemed so proud and so pleased with me and all i had done and one day his tongue seemed loosened with wine and he told me much that i had not known till thenhow dearly he had loved my mother yet how his wilful usage had caused her death and then he went on to say how he loved me better than any creature on earth and how some day he hoped to take me to foreign places for that he could hardly bear these long absences from his only child then he seemed to change suddenly and said in a strange wild way that i was not to believe what he said that there was many a thing he loved betterhis horsehis dogi know not what and twas only the next morning that when i came into his room to ask his blessing as was my wont he received me with fierce and angry words why had i so he asked been delighting myself in such wanton mischiefdancing over the tender plants in the flowerbeds all set with the famous dutch bulbs he had brought from holland i had never been out of doors that morning sir and i could not conceive what he meant and so i said and then he swore at me for a liar and said i was of no true blood for he had seen me doing all that mischief himselfwith his own eyes what could i say he would not listen to me and even my tears seemed only to irritate him that day was the beginning of my great sorrows not long after he reproached me for my undue familiarityall unbecoming a gentlewomanwith his grooms i had been in the stableyard laughing and talking he said now sir i am something of a coward by nature and i had always dreaded horses besides that my fathers servantsthose whom he brought with him from foreign partswere wild fellows whom i had always avoided and to whom i had never spoken except as a lady must needs from time to time speak to her fathers people yet my father called me by names of which i hardly know the meaning but my heart told me they were such as shame any modest woman and from that day he turned quite against menay sir not many weeks after that he came in with a ridingwhip in his hand and accusing me harshly of evil doings of which i knew no more than you sir he was about to strike me and i all in bewildering tears was ready to take his stripes as great kindness compared to his harder words when suddenly he stopped his arm midway gasped and staggered crying out the cursethe curse i looked up in terror in the great mirror opposite i saw myself and right behind another wicked fearful self so like me that my soul seemed to quiver within me as though not knowing to which similitude of body it belonged my father saw my double at the same moment either in its dreadful reality whatever that might be or in the scarcely less terrible reflection in the mirror but what came of it at that moment i cannot say for i suddenly swooned away and when i came to myself i was lying in my bed and my faithful clarke sitting by me i was in my bed for days and even while i lay there my double was seen by all flitting about the house and gardens always about some mischievous or detestable work what wonder that every one shrank from me in dreadthat my father drove me forth at length when the disgrace of which i was the cause was past his patience to bear mistress clarke came with me and here we try to live such a life of piety and prayer as may in time set me free from the curse all the time she had been speaking i had been weighing her story in my mind i had hitherto put cases of witchcraft on one side as mere superstitions and my uncle and i had had many an argument he supporting himself by the opinion of his good friend sir matthew hale yet this sounded like the tale of one bewitched or was it merely the effect of a life of extreme seclusion telling on the nerves of a sensitive girl my scepticism inclined me to the latter belief and when she paused i said i fancy that some physician could have disabused your father of his belief in visions just at that instant standing as i was opposite to her in the full and perfect morning light i saw behind her another figurea ghastly resemblance complete in likeness so far as form and feature and minutest touch of dress could go but with a loathsome demon soul looking out of the gray eyes that were in turns mocking and voluptuous my heart stood still within me every hair rose up erect my flesh crept with horror i could not see the grave and tender lucymy eyes were fascinated by the creature beyond i know not why but i put out my hand to clutch it i grasped nothing but empty air and my whole blood curdled to ice for a moment i could not see then my sight came back and i saw lucy standing before me alone deathly pale and i could have fancied almost shrunk in size it has been near me she said as if asking a question the sound seemed taken out of her voice it was husky as the notes on an old harpsichord when the strings have ceased to vibrate she read her answer in my face i suppose for i could not speak her look was one of intense fear but that died away into an aspect of most humble patience at length she seemed to force herself to face behind and around her she saw the purple moors the blue distant hills quivering in the sunlight but nothing else will you take me home she said meekly i took her by the hand and led her silently through the budding heatherwe dared not speak for we could not tell but that the dread creature was listening although unseenbut that it might appear and push us asunder i never loved her more fondly than now whenand that was the unspeakable miserythe idea of her was becoming so inextricably blended with the shuddering thought of it she seemed to understand what i must be feeling she let go my hand which she had kept clasped until then when we reached the garden gate and went forwards to meet her anxious friend who was standing by the window looking for her i could not enter the house i needed silence society leisure changei knew not whatto shake off the sensation of that creatures presence yet i lingered about the gardeni hardly know why i partly suppose because i feared to encounter the resemblance again on the solitary common where it had vanished and partly from a feeling of inexpressible compassion for lucy in a few minutes mistress clarke came forth and joined me we walked some paces in silence you know all now said she solemnly i saw it said i below my breath and you shrink from us now she said with a hopelessness which stirred up all that was brave or good in me not a whit said i human flesh shrinks from encounter with the powers of darkness and for some reason unknown to me the pure and holy lucy is their victim the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the children she said who is her father asked i knowing as much as i do i may surely know moreknow all tell me i entreat you madam all that you can conjecture respecting this demoniac persecution of one so good i will but not now i must go to lucy now come this afternoon i will see you alone and oh sir i will trust that you may yet find some way to help us in our sore trouble i was miserably exhausted by the swooning affright which had taken possession of me when i reached the inn i staggered in like one overcome by wine i went to my own private room it was some time before i saw that the weekly post had come in and brought me my letters there was one from my uncle one from my home in devonshire and one redirected over the first address sealed with a great coat of arms it was from sir philip tempest my letter of inquiry respecting mary fitzgerald had reached him at lige where it so happened that the count de la tour dauvergne was quartered at the very time he remembered his wifes beautiful attendant she had had high words with the deceased countess respecting her intercourse with an english gentleman of good standing who was also in the foreign service the countess augured evil of his intentions while mary proud and vehement asserted that he would soon marry her and resented her mistresss warnings as an insult the consequence was that she had left madame de la tour dauvergnes service and as the count believed had gone to live with the englishman whether he had married her or not he could not say but added sir philip tempest you may easily hear what particulars you wish to know respecting mary fitzgerald from the englishman himself if as i suspect he is no other than my neighbour and former acquaintance mr gisborne of skipford hall in the west riding i am led to the belief that he is no other by several small particulars none of which are in themselves conclusive but which taken together furnish a mass of presumptive evidence as far as i could make out from the counts foreign pronunciation gisborne was the name of the englishman i know that gisborne of skipford was abroad and in the foreign service at that timehe was a likely fellow enough for such an exploit and above all certain expressions recur to my mind which he used in reference to old bridget fitzgerald of coldholme whom he once encountered while staying with me at starkey manorhouse i remember that the meeting seemed to have produced some extraordinary effect upon his mind as though he had suddenly discovered some connection which she might have had with his previous life i beg you to let me know if i can be of any further service to you your uncle once rendered me a good turn and i will gladly repay it so far as in me lies to his nephew i was now apparently close on the discovery which i had striven so many months to attain but success had lost its zest i put my letters down and seemed to forget them all in thinking of the morning i had passed that very day nothing was real but the unreal presence which had come like an evil blast across my bodily eyes and burnt itself down upon my brain dinner came and went away untouched early in the afternoon i walked to the farmhouse i found mistress clarke alone and i was glad and relieved she was evidently prepared to tell me all i might wish to hear you asked me for mistress lucys true name it is gisborne she began not gisborne of skipford i exclaimed breathless with anticipation the same said she quietly not regarding my manner her father is a man of note although being a roman catholic he cannot take that rank in this country to which his station entitles him the consequence is that he lives much abroadhas been a soldier i am told and lucys mother i asked she shook her head i never knew her said she lucy was about three years old when i was engaged to take charge of her her mother was dead but you know her nameyou can tell if it was mary fitzgerald she looked astonished that was her name but sir how came you to be so well acquainted with it it was a mystery to the whole household at skipford court she was some beautiful young woman whom he lured away from her protectors while he was abroad i have heard said he practised some terrible deceit upon her and when she came to know it she was neither to have nor to hold but rushed off from his very arms and threw herself into a rapid stream and was drowned it stung him deep with remorse but i used to think the remembrance of the mothers cruel death made him love the child yet dearer i told her as briefly as might be of my researches after the descendant and heir of the fitzgeralds of kildoon and addedsomething of my old lawyer spirit returning into me for the momentthat i had no doubt but that we should prove lucy to be by right possessed of large estates in ireland no flush came over her gray face no light into her eyes and what is all the wealth in the whole world to that poor girl she said it will not free her from the ghastly bewitchment which persecutes her as for money what a pitiful thing it is it cannot touch her no more can the evil creature harm her i said her holy nature dwells apart and cannot be defiled or stained by all the devilish arts in the whole world true but it is a cruel fate to know that all shrink from her sooner or later as from one possessedaccursed how came it to pass i asked nay i know not old rumours there are that were bruited through the household at skipford tell me i demanded they came from servants who would fain account for every thing they say that many years ago mr gisborne killed a dog belonging to an old witch at coldholme that she cursed with a dreadful and mysterious curse the creature whatever it might be that he should love best and that it struck so deeply into his heart that for years he kept himself aloof from any temptation to love aught but who could help loving lucy you never heard the witchs name i gasped yesthey called her bridget they said he would never go near the spot again for terror of her yet he was a brave man listen said i taking hold of her arm the better to arrest her full attention if what i suspect holds true that man stole bridgets only childthe very mary fitzgerald who was lucys mother if so bridget cursed him in ignorance of the deeper wrong he had done her to this hour she yearns after her lost child and questions the saints whether she be living or not the roots of that curse lie deeper than she knows she unwittingly banned him for a deeper guilt than that of killing a dumb beast the sins of the fathers are indeed visited upon the children but said mistress clarke eagerly she would never let evil rest on her own grandchild surely sir if what you say be true there are hopes for lucy let us gogo at once and tell this fearful woman all that you suspect and beseech her to take off the spell she has put upon her innocent grandchild it seemed to me indeed that something like this was the best course we could pursue but first it was necessary to ascertain more than what mere rumour or careless hearsay could tell my thoughts turned to my unclehe could advise me wiselyhe ought to know all i resolved to go to him without delay but i did not choose to tell mistress clarke of all the visionary plans that flitted through my mind i simply declared my intention of proceeding straight to london on lucys affairs i bade her believe that my interest on the young ladys behalf was greater than ever and that my whole time should be given up to her cause i saw that mistress clarke distrusted me because my mind was too full of thoughts for my words to flow freely she sighed and shook her head and said well it is all right in such a tone that it was an implied reproach but i was firm and constant in my heart and i took confidence from that i rode to london i rode long days drawn out into the lovely summer nights i could not rest i reached london i told my uncle all though in the stir of the great city the horror had faded away and i could hardly imagine that he would believe the account i gave him of the fearful double of lucy which i had seen on the lonely moorside but my uncle had lived many years and learnt many things and in the deep secrets of family history that had been confided to him he had heard of cases of innocent people bewitched and taken possession of by evil spirits yet more fearful than lucys for as he said to judge from all i told him that resemblance had no power over hershe was too pure and good to be tainted by its evil haunting presence it had in all probability so my uncle conceived tried to suggest wicked thoughts and to tempt to wicked actions but she in her saintly maidenhood had passed on undefiled by evil thought or deed it could not touch her soul but true it set her apart from all sweet love or common human intercourse my uncle threw himself with an energy more like sixandtwenty than sixty into the consideration of the whole case he undertook the proving lucys descent and volunteered to go and find out mr gisborne and obtain firstly the legal proofs of her descent from the fitzgeralds of kildoon and secondly to try and hear all that he could respecting the working of the curse and whether any and what means had been taken to exorcise that terrible appearance for he told me of instances where by prayers and long fasting the evil possessor had been driven forth with howling and many cries from the body which it had come to inhabit he spoke of those strange new england cases which had happened not so long before of mr defoe who had written a book wherein he had named many modes of subduing apparitions and sending them back whence they came and lastly he spoke low of dreadful ways of compelling witches to undo their witchcraft but i could not endure to hear of those tortures and burnings i said that bridget was rather a wild and savage woman than a malignant witch and above all that lucy was of her kith and kin and that in putting her to the trial by water or by fire we should be torturingit might be to the deaththe ancestress of her we sought to redeem my uncle thought awhile and then said that in this last matter i was rightat any rate it should not be tried with his consent till all other modes of remedy had failed and he assented to my proposal that i should go myself and see bridget and tell her all in accordance with this i went down once more to the wayside inn near coldholme it was late at night when i arrived there and while i supped i inquired of the landlord more particulars as to bridgets ways solitary and savage had been her life for many years wild and despotic were her words and manner to those few people who came across her path the countryfolk did her imperious bidding because they feared to disobey if they pleased her they prospered if on the contrary they neglected or traversed her behests misfortune small or great fell on them and theirs it was not detestation so much as an indefinable terror that she excited in the morning i went to see her she was standing on the green outside her cottage and received me with the sullen grandeur of a throneless queen i read in her face that she recognized me and that i was not unwelcome but she stood silent till i had opened my errand i have news of your daughter said i resolved to speak straight to all that i knew she felt of love and not to spare her she is dead the stern figure scarcely trembled but her hand sought the support of the doorpost i knew that she was dead said she deep and low and then was silent for an instant my tears that should have flowed for her were burnt up long years ago young man tell me about her not yet said i having a strange power given me of confronting one whom nevertheless in my secret soul i dreaded you had once a little dog i continued the words called out in her more show of emotion than the intelligence of her daughters death she broke in upon my speech i had it was hersthe last thing i had of hersand it was shot for wantonness it died in my arms the man who killed that dog rues it to this day for that dumb beasts blood his bestbeloved stands accursed her eyes distended as if she were in a trance and saw the working of her curse again i spoke o woman i said that bestbeloved standing accursed before men is your dead daughters child the life the energy the passion came back to the eyes with which she pierced through me to see if i spoke truth then without another question or word she threw herself on the ground with fearful vehemence and clutched at the innocent daisies with convulsed hands bone of my bone flesh of my flesh have i cursed theeand art thou accursed so she moaned as she lay prostrate in her great agony i stood aghast at my own work she did not hear my broken sentences she asked no more but the dumb confirmation which my sad looks had given that one fact that her curse rested on her own daughters child the fear grew on me lest she should die in her strife of body and soul and then might not lucy remain under the spell as long as she lived even at this moment i saw lucy coming through the woodland path that led to bridgets cottage mistress clarke was with her i felt at my heart that it was she by the balmy peace which the look of her sent over me as she slowly advanced a glad surprise shining out of her soft quiet eyes that was as her gaze met mine as her looks fell on the woman lying stiff convulsed on the earth they became full of tender pity and she came forward to try and lift her up seating herself on the turf she took bridgets head into her lap and with gentle touches she arranged the dishevelled gray hair streaming thick and wild from beneath her mutch god help her murmured lucy how she suffers at her desire we sought for water but when we returned bridget had recovered her wandering senses and was kneeling with clasped hands before lucy gazing at that sweet sad face as though her troubled nature drank in health and peace from every moments contemplation a faint tinge on lucys pale cheeks showed me that she was aware of our return otherwise it appeared as if she was conscious of her influence for good over the passionate and troubled woman kneeling before her and would not willingly avert her grave and loving eyes from that wrinkled and careworn countenance suddenlyin the twinkling of an eyethe creature appeared there behind lucy fearfully the same as to outward semblance but kneeling exactly as bridget knelt and clasping her hands in jesting mimicry as bridget clasped hers in her ecstasy that was deepening into a prayer mistress clarke cried outbridget arose slowly her gaze fixed on the creature beyond drawing her breath with a hissing sound never moving her terrible eyes that were steady as stone she made a dart at the phantom and caught as i had done a mere handful of empty air we saw no more of the creatureit vanished as suddenly as it came but bridget looked slowly on as if watching some receding form lucy sat still white trembling droopingi think she would have swooned if i had not been there to uphold her while i was attending to her bridget passed us without a word to any one and entering her cottage she barred herself in and left us without all our endeavours were now directed to get lucy back to the house where she had tarried the night before mistress clarke told me that not hearing from me some letter must have miscarried she had grown impatient and despairing and had urged lucy to the enterprise of coming to seek her grandmother not telling her indeed of the dread reputation she possessed or how we suspected her of having so fearfully blighted that innocent girl but at the same time hoping much from the mysterious stirring of blood which mistress clarke trusted in for the removal of the curse they had come by a different route from that which i had taken to a village inn not far from coldholme only the night before this was the first interview between ancestress and descendant all through the sultry noon i wandered along the tangled brushwood of the old neglected forest thinking where to turn for remedy in a matter so complicated and mysterious meeting a countryman i asked my way to the nearest clergyman and went hoping to obtain some counsel from him but he proved to be a coarse and commonminded man giving no time or attention to the intricacies of a case but dashing out a strong opinion involving immediate action for instance as soon as i named bridget fitzgerald he exclaimed the coldholme witch the irish papist id have had her ducked long since but for that other papist sir philip tempest he has had to threaten honest folk about here over and over again or theyd have had her up before the justices for her black doings and its the law of the land that witches should be burnt ay and of scripture too sir yet you see a papist if hes a rich squire can overrule both law and scripture id carry a faggot myself to rid the country of her such a one could give me no help i rather drew back what i had already said and tried to make the parson forget it by treating him to several pots of beer in the village inn to which we had adjourned for our conference at his suggestion i left him as soon as i could and returned to coldholme shaping my way past deserted starkey manorhouse and coming upon it by the back at that side were the oblong remains of the old moat the waters of which lay placid and motionless under the crimson rays of the setting sun with the foresttrees lying straight along each side and their deepgreen foliage mirrored to blackness in the burnished surface of the moat belowand the broken sundial at the end nearest the halland the heron standing on one leg at the waters edge lazily looking down for fishthe lonely and desolate house scarce needed the broken windows the weeds on the doorsill the broken shutter softly flapping to and fro in the twilight breeze to fill up the picture of desertion and decay i lingered about the place until the growing darkness warned me on and then i passed along the path cut by the orders of the last lady of starkey manorhouse that led me to bridgets cottage i resolved at once to see her and in spite of closed doorsit might be of resolved willshe should see me so i knocked at her door gently loudly fiercely i shook it so vehemently that a length the old hinges gave way and with a crash it fell inwards leaving me suddenly face to face with bridgeti red heated agitated with my so long baffled effortsshe stiff as any stone standing right facing me her eyes dilated with terror her ashen lips trembling but her body motionless in her hands she held her crucifix as if by that holy symbol she sought to oppose my entrance at sight of me her whole frame relaxed and she sank back upon a chair some mighty tension had given way still her eyes looked fearfully into the gloom of the outer air made more opaque by the glimmer of the lamp inside which she had placed before the picture of the virgin is she there asked bridget hoarsely no who i am alone you remember me yes replied she still terror stricken but shethat creaturehas been looking in upon me through that window all day long i closed it up with my shawl and then i saw her feet below the door as long as it was light and i knew she heard my very breathingnay worse my very prayers and i could not pray for her listening choked the words ere they rose to my lips tell me who is shewhat means that double girl i saw this morning one had a look of my dead mary but the other curdled my blood and yet it was the same she had taken hold of my arm as if to secure herself some human companionship she shook all over with the slight neverceasing tremor of intense terror i told her my tale as i have told it you sparing none of the details how mistress clarke had informed me that the resemblance had driven lucy forth from her fathers househow i had disbelieved until with mine own eyes i had seen another lucy standing behind my lucy the same in form and feature but with the demonsoul looking out of the eyes i told her all i say believing that shewhose curse was working so upon the life of her innocent grandchildwas the only person who could find the remedy and the redemption when i had done she sat silent for many minutes you love marys child she asked i do in spite of the fearful working of the cursei love her yet i shrink from her ever since that day on the moorside and men must shrink from one so accompanied friends and lovers must stand afar off oh bridget fitzgerald loosen the curse set her free where is she i eagerly caught at the idea that her presence was needed in order that by some strange prayer or exorcism the spell might be reversed i will go and bring her to you i exclaimed bridget tightened her hold upon my arm not so said she in a low hoarse voice it would kill me to see her again as i saw her this morning and i must live till i have worked my work leave me said she suddenly and again taking up the cross i defy the demon i have called up leave me to wrestle with it she stood up as if in an ecstasy of inspiration from which all fear was banished i lingeredwhy i can hardly telluntil once more she bade me begone as i went along the forest way i looked back and saw her planting the cross in the empty threshold where the door had been the next morning lucy and i went to seek her to bid her join her prayers with ours the cottage stood open and wide to our gaze no human being was there the cross remained on the threshold but bridget was gone chapter iii what was to be done next was the question that i asked myself as for lucy she would fain have submitted to the doom that lay upon her her gentleness and piety under the pressure of so horrible a life seemed overpassive to me she never complained mrs clarke complained more than ever as for me i was more in love with the real lucy than ever but i shrunk from the false similitude with an intensity proportioned to my love i found out by instinct that mrs clarke had occasional temptations to leave lucy the good ladys nerves were shaken and from what she said i could almost have concluded that the object of the double was to drive away from lucy this last and almost earliest friend at times i could scarcely bear to own it but i myself felt inclined to turn recreant and i would accuse lucy of being too patienttoo resigned one after another she won the little children of coldholme mrs clarke and she had resolved to stay there for was it not as good a place as any other to such as they and did not all our faint hopes rest on bridgetnever seen or heard of now but still we trusted to come back or give some token so as i say one after another the little children came about my lucy won by her soft tones and her gentle smiles and kind actions alas one after another they fell away and shrunk from her path with blanching terror and we too surely guessed the reason why it was the last drop i could bear it no longer i resolved no more to linger around the spot but to go back to my uncle and among the learned divines of the city of london seek for some power whereby to annul the curse my uncle meanwhile had obtained all the requisite testimonials relating to lucys descent and birth from the irish lawyers and from mr gisborne the latter gentleman had written from abroad he was again serving in the austrian army a letter alternately passionately selfreproachful and stoically repellant it was evident that when he thought of maryher short lifehow he had wronged her and of her violent death he could hardly find words severe enough for his own conduct and from this point of view the curse that bridget had laid upon him and his was regarded by him as a prophetic doom to the utterance of which she was moved by a higher power working for the fulfilment of a deeper vengeance than for the death of the poor dog but then again when he came to speak of his daughter the repugnance which the conduct of the demoniac creature had produced in his mind was but illdisguised under a show of profound indifference as to lucys fate one almost felt as if he would have been as content to put her out of existence as he would have been to destroy some disgusting reptile that had invaded his chamber or his couch the great fitzgerald property was lucys and that was allwas nothing my uncle and i sat in the gloom of a london november evening in our house in ormond street i was out of health and felt as if i were in an inextricable coil of misery lucy and i wrote to each other but that was little and we dared not see each other for dread of the fearful third who had more than once taken her place at our meetings my uncle had on the day i speak of bidden prayers to be put up on the ensuing sabbath in many a church and meetinghouse in london for one grievously tormented by an evil spirit he had faith in prayersi had none i was fast losing faith in all things so we sat he trying to interest me in the old talk of other days i oppressed by one thoughtwhen our old servant anthony opened the door and without speaking showed in a very gentlemanly and prepossessing man who had something remarkable about his dress betraying his profession to be that of the roman catholic priesthood he glanced at my uncle first then at me it was to me he bowed i did not give my name said he because you would hardly have recognised it unless sir when in the north you heard of father bernard the chaplain at stoney hurst i remembered afterwards that i had heard of him but at the time i had utterly forgotten it so i professed myself a complete stranger to him while my everhospitable uncle although hating a papist as much as it was in his nature to hate anything placed a chair for the visitor and bade anthony bring glasses and a fresh jug of claret father bernard received this courtesy with the graceful ease and pleasant acknowledgement which belongs to a man of the world then he turned to scan me with his keen glance after some alight conversation entered into on his part i am certain with an intention of discovering on what terms of confidence i stood with my uncle he paused and said gravely i am sent here with a message to you sir from a woman to whom you have shown kindness and who is one of my penitents in antwerpone bridget fitzgerald bridget fitzgerald exclaimed i in antwerp tell me sir all that you can about her there is much to be said he replied but may i inquire if this gentlemanif your uncle is acquainted with the particulars of which you and i stand informed all that i know he knows said i eagerly laying my hand on my uncles arm as he made a motion as if to quit the room then i have to speak before two gentlemen who however they may differ from me in faith are yet fully impressed with the fact that there are evil powers going about continually to take cognizance of our evil thoughts and if their master gives them power to bring them into overt action such is my theory of the nature of that sin which i dare not disbelieveas some sceptics would have us dothe sin of witchcraft of this deadly sin you and i are aware bridget fitzgerald has been guilty since you saw her last many prayers have been offered in our churches many masses sung many penances undergone in order that if god and the holy saints so willed it her sin might be blotted out but it has not been so willed explain to me said i who you are and how you come connected with bridget why is she at antwerp i pray you sir tell me more if i am impatient excuse me i am ill and feverish and in consequence bewildered there was something to me inexpressibly soothing in the tone of voice with which he began to narrate as it were from the beginning his acquaintance with bridget i had known mr and mrs starkey during their residence abroad and so it fell out naturally that when i came as chaplain to the sherburnes at stoney hurst our acquaintance was renewed and thus i became the confessor of the whole family isolated as they were from the offices of the church sherburne being their nearest neighbour who professed the true faith of course you are aware that facts revealed in confession are sealed as in the grave but i learnt enough of bridgets character to be convinced that i had to do with no common woman one powerful for good as for evil i believe that i was able to give her spiritual assistance from time to time and that she looked upon me as a servant of that holy church which has such wonderful power of moving mens hearts and relieving them of the burden of their sins i have known her cross the moors on the wildest nights of storm to confess and be absolved and then she would return calmed and subdued to her daily work about her mistress no one witting where she had been during the hours that most passed in sleep upon their beds after her daughters departureafter marys mysterious disappearancei had to impose many a long penance in order to wash away the sin of impatient repining that was fast leading her into the deeper guilt of blasphemy she set out on that long journey of which you have possibly heardthat fruitless journey in search of maryand during her absence my superiors ordered my return to my former duties at antwerp and for many years i heard no more of bridget not many months ago as i was passing homewards in the evening along one of the streets near st jacques leading into the meer straet i saw a woman sitting crouched up under the shrine of the holy mother of sorrows her hood was drawn over her head so that the shadow caused by the light of the lamp above fell deep over her face her hands were clasped round her knees it was evident that she was some one in hopeless trouble and as such it was my duty to stop and speak i naturally addressed her first in flemish believing her to be one of the lower class of inhabitants she shook her head but did not look up then i tried french and she replied in that language but speaking it so indifferently that i was sure she was either english or irish and consequently spoke to her in my own native tongue she recognized my voice and starting up caught at my robes dragging me before the blessed shrine and throwing herself down and forcing me as much by her evident desire as by her action to kneel beside her she exclaimed o holy virgin you will never hearken to me again but hear him for you know him of old that he does your bidding and strives to heal broken hearts hear him she turned to me she will hear you if you will only pray she never hears me she and all the saints in heaven cannot hear my prayers for the evil one carries them off as he carried that first away o father bernard pray for me i prayed for one in sore distress of what nature i could not say but the holy virgin would know bridget held me fast gasping with eagerness at the sound of my words when i had ended i rose and making the sign of the cross over her i was going to bless her in the name of the holy church when she shrank away like some terrified creature and said i am guilty of deadly sin and am not shriven arise my daughter said i and come with me and i led the way into one of the confessionals of st jaques she knelt i listened no words came the evil powers had stricken her dumb as i heard afterwards they had many a time before when she approached confession she was too poor to pay for the necessary forms of exorcism and hitherto those priests to whom she had addressed herself were either so ignorant of the meaning of her broken french or her irishenglish or else esteemed her to be one crazedas indeed her wild and excited manner might easily have led any one to thinkthat they had neglected the sole means of loosening her tongue so that she might confess her deadly sin and after due penance obtain absolution but i knew bridget of old and felt that she was a penitent sent to me i went through those holy offices appointed by our church for the relief of such a case i was the more bound to do this as i found that she had come to antwerp for the sole purpose of discovering me and making confession to me of the nature of that fearful confession i am forbidden to speak much of it you know possibly all it now remains for her to free herself from mortal guilt and to set others free from the consequences thereof no prayers no masses will ever do it although they may strengthen her with that strength by which alone acts of deepest love and purest selfdevotion may be performed her words of passion and cries for revengeher unholy prayers could never reach the ears of the holy saints other powers intercepted them and wrought so that the curses thrown up to heaven have fallen on her own flesh and blood and so through her very strength of love have brused and crushed her heart henceforward her former self must be buriedyea buried quick if need bebut never more to make sign or utter cry on earth she has become a poor clare in order that by perpetual penance and constant service of others she may at length so act as to obtain final absolution and rest for her soul until then the innocent must suffer it is to plead for the innocent that i come to you not in the name of the witch bridget fitzgerald but of the penitent and servant of all men the poor clare sister magdalen sir said i i listen to your request with respect only i may tell you it is not needed to urge me to do all that i can on behalf of one love for whom is part of my very life if for a time i have absented myself from her it is to think and work for her redemption i a member of the english churchmy uncle a puritanpray morning and night for her by name the congregations of london on the next sabbath will pray for one unknown that she may be set free from the powers of darkness moreover i must tell you sir that those evil ones touch not the great calm of her soul she lives her own pure and loving life unharmed and untainted though all men fall off from her i would i could have her faith my uncle now spoke nephew said he it seems to me that this gentleman although professing what i consider an erroneous creed has touched upon the right point in exhorting bridget to acts of love and mercy whereby to wipe out her sin of hate and vengeance let us strive after our fashion by almsgiving and visiting of the needy and fatherless to make our prayers acceptable meanwhile i myself will go down into the north and take charge of the maiden i am too old to be daunted by man or demon i will bring her to this house as to a home and let the double come if it will a company of godly divines shall give it the meeting and we will try issue the kindly brave old man but father bernard sat on musing all hate said he cannot be quenched in her heart all christian forgiveness cannot have entered into her soul or the demon would have lost its power you said i think that her grandchild was still tormented still tormented i replied sadly thinking of mistress clarkes last letterhe rose to go we afterwards heard that the occasion of his coming to london was a secret political mission on behalf of the jacobites nevertheless he was a good and a wise man months and months passed away without any change lucy entreated my uncle to leave her where she wasdreading as i learnt lest if she came with her fearful companion to dwell in the same house with me that my love could not stand the repeated shocks to which i should be doomed and this she thought from no distrust of the strength of my affection but from a kind of pitying sympathy for the terror to the nerves which she clearly observed that the demoniac visitation caused in all i was restless and miserable i devoted myself to good works but i performed them from no spirit of love but solely from the hope of reward and payment and so the reward was never granted at length i asked my uncles leave to travel and i went forth a wanderer with no distincter end than that of many another wandererto get away from myself a strange impulse led me to antwerp in spite of the wars and commotions then raging in the low countriesor rather perhaps the very craving to become interested in something external led me into the thick of the struggle then going on with the austrians the cities of flanders were all full at that time of civil disturbances and rebellions only kept down by force and the presence of an austrian garrison in every place i arrived in antwerp and made inquiry for father bernard he was away in the country for a day or two then i asked my way to the convent of poor clares but being healthy and prosperous i could only see the dim pentup gray walls shut closely in by narrow streets in the lowest part of the town my landlord told me that had i been stricken by some loathsome disease or in desperate case of any kind the poor clares would have taken me and tended me he spoke of them as an order of mercy of the strictest kind dressing scantily in the coarsest materials going barefoot living on what the inhabitants of antwerp chose to bestow and sharing even those fragments and crumbs with the poor and helpless that swarmed all around receiving no letters or communication with the outer world utterly dead to everything but the alleviation of suffering he smiled at my inquiring whether i could get speech of one of them and told me that they were even forbidden to speak for the purposes of begging their daily food while yet they lived and fed others upon what was given in charity but exclaimed i supposing all men forgot them would they quietly lie down and die without making sign of their extremity if such were the rule the poor clares would willingly do it but their founder appointed a remedy for such extreme cases as you suggest they have a belltis but a small one as i have heard and has yet never been rung in the memory man when the poor clares have been without food for twentyfour hours they may ring this bell and then trust to our good people of antwerp for rushing to the rescue of the poor clares who have taken such blessed care of us in all our straits it seemed to me that such rescue would be late in the day but i did not say what i thought i rather turned the conversation by asking my landlord if he knew or had ever heard anything of a certain sister magdalen yes said he rather under his breath news will creep out even from a convent of poor clares sister magdalen is either a great sinner or a great saint she does more as i have heard than all the other nuns put together yet when last month they would fain have made her mothersuperior she begged rather that they would place her below all the rest and make her the meanest servant of all you never saw her asked i never he replied i was weary of waiting for father bernard and yet i lingered in antwerp the political state of things became worse than ever increased to its height by the scarcity of food consequent on many deficient harvests i saw groups of fierce squalid men at every corner of the street glaring out with wolfish eyes at my sleek skin and handsome clothes at last father bernard returned we had a long conversation in which he told me that curiously enough mr gisborne lucys father was serving in one of the austrian regiments then in garrison at antwerp i asked father bernard if he would make us acquainted which he consented to do but a day or two afterwards he told me that on hearing my name mr gisborne had declined responding to any advances on my part saying he had adjured his country and hated his countrymen probably he recollected my name in connection with that of his daughter lucy anyhow it was clear enough that i had no chance of making his acquaintance father bernard confirmed me in my suspicions of the hidden fermentation for some coming evil working among the blouses of antwerp and he would fain have had me depart from out the city but i rather craved the excitement of danger and stubbornly refused to leave one day when i was walking with him in the place verte he bowed to an austrian officer who was crossing towards the cathedral that is mr gisborne said he as soon as the gentleman was past i turned to look at the tall slight figure of the officer he carried himself in a stately manner although he was past middle age and from his years might have had some excuse for a slight stoop as i looked at the man he turned round his eyes met mine and i saw his face deeply lined sallow and scathed was that countenance scarred by passion as well as by the fortunes of war twas but a moment our eyes met we each turned round and went on our separate way but his whole appearance was not one to be easily forgotten the thorough appointment of the dress and evident thought bestowed on it made but an incongruous whole with the dark gloomy expression of his countenance because he was lucys father i sought instinctively to meet him everywhere at last he must have become aware of my pertinacity for he gave me a haughty scowl whenever i passed him in one of these encounters however i chanced to be of some service to him he was turning the corner of a street and came suddenly on one of the groups of discontented flemings of whom i have spoken some words were exchanged when my gentleman out with his sword and with a slight but skilful cut drew blood from one of those who had insulted him as he fancied though i was too far off to hear the words they would all have fallen upon him had i not rushed forwards and raised the cry then well known in antwerp of rally to the austrian soldiers who were perpetually patrolling the streets and who came in numbers to the rescue i think that neither mr gisborne nor the mutinous group of plebeians owed me much gratitude for my interference he had planted himself against a wall in a skilful attitude of fence ready with his bright glancing rapier to do battle with all the heavy fierce unarmed men some six or seven in number but when his own soldiers came up he sheathed his sword and giving some careless word of command sent them away again and continued his saunter all alone down the street the workmen snarling in his rear and more than halfinclined to fall on me for my cry for rescue i cared not if they did my life seemed so dreary a burden just then and perhaps it was this daring loitering among them that prevented their attacking me instead they suffered me to fall into conversation with them and i heard some of their grievances sore and heavy to be borne were they and no wonder the sufferers were savage and desperate the man whom gisborne had wounded across his face would fain have got out of me the name of his aggressor but i refused to tell it another of the group heard his inquiry and made answeri know the man he is one gisborne aidedecamp to the generalcommandant i know him well he began to tell some story in connection with gisborne in a low and muttering voice and while he was relating a tale which i saw excited their evil blood and which they evidently wished me not to hear i sauntered away and back to my lodgings that night antwerp was in open revolt the inhabitants rose in rebellion against their austrian masters the austrians holding the gates of the city remained at first pretty quiet in the citadel only from time to time the boom of the great cannon swept sullenly over the town but if they expected the disturbance to die away and spend itself in a few hours fury they were mistaken in a day or two the rioters held possession of the principal municipal buildings then the austrians poured forth in bright flaming array calm and smiling as they marched to the posts assigned as if the fierce mob were no more to them then the swarms of buzzing summer flies their practised manuvres their wellaimed shot told with terrible effect but in the place of one slain rioter three sprang up of his blood to avenge his loss but a deadly foe a ghastly ally of the austrians was at work food scarce and dear for months was now hardly to be obtained at any price desperate efforts were being made to bring provisions into the city for the rioters had friends without close to the city port nearest to the scheldt a great struggle took place i was there helping the rioters whose cause i had adopted we had a savage encounter with the austrians numbers fell on both sides i saw them lie bleeding for a moment then a volley of smoke obscured them and when it cleared away they were deadtrampled upon or smothered pressed down and hidden by the freshlywounded whom those last guns had brought low and then a grayrobed and greyveiled figure came right across the flashing guns and stooped over some one whose lifeblood was ebbing away sometimes it was to give him drink from cans which they carried slung at their sides sometimes i saw the cross held above a dying man and rapid prayers were being uttered unheard by men in that hellish din and clangour but listened to by one above i saw all this as in a dream the reality of that stern time was battle and carnage but i knew that these gray figures their bare feet all wet with blood and their faces hidden by their veils were the poor claressent forth now because dire agony was abroad and imminent danger at hand therefore they left their cloistered shelter and came into that thick and evil mle close to medriven past me by the struggle of many fighterscame the antwerp burgess with the scarcehealed scar upon his face and in an instant more he was thrown by the press upon the austrian officer gisborne and ere either had recovered the shock the burgess had recognized his opponent ha the englishman gisborne he cried and threw himself upon him with redoubled fury he had struck him hardthe englishman was down when out of the smoke came a darkgray figure and threw herself right under the uplifted flashing sword the burgesss arm stood arrested neither austrians nor anversois willingly harmed the poor clares leave him to me said a low stern voice he is mine enemymine for many years those words were the last i heard i myself was struck down by a bullet i remember nothing more for days when i came to myself i was at the extremity of weakness and was craving for food to recruit my strength my landlord sat watching me he too looked pinched and shrunken he had heard of my wounded state and sought me out yes the struggle still continued but the famine was sore and some he had heard had died for lack of food the tears stood in his eyes as he spoke but soon he shook off his weakness and his natural cheerfulness returned father bernard had been to see meno one else who should indeed father bernard would come back that afternoonhe had promised but father bernard never came although i was up and dressed and looking eagerly for him my landlord brought me a meal which he had cooked himself of what it was composed he would not say but it was most excellent and with every mouthful i seemed to gain strength the good man sat looking at my evident enjoyment with a happy smile of sympathy but as my appetite became satisfied i began to detect a certain wistfulness in his eyes as if craving for the food i had so nearly devouredfor indeed at that time i was hardly aware of the extent of the famine suddenly there was a sound of many rushing feet past our window my landlord opened one of the sides of it the better to learn what was going on then we heard a faint cracked tinkling bell coming shrill upon the air clear and distinct from all other sounds holy mother exclaimed my landlord the poor clares he snatched up the fragments of my meal and crammed them into my hands bidding me follow down stairs he ran clutching at more food as the women of his house eagerly held it out to him and in a moment we were in the street moving along with the great current all tending towards the convent of the poor clares and still as if piercing our ears with its inarticulate cry came the shrill tinkle of the bell in that strange crowd were old men trembling and sobbing as they carried their little pittance of food women with tears running down their cheeks who had snatched up what provisions they had in the vessels in which they stood so that the burden of these was in many cases much greater than that which they contained children with flushed faces grasping tight the morsel of bitten cake or bread in their eagerness to carry it safe to the help of the poor clares strong menyea both anversois and austrianspressing onward with set teeth and no word spoken and over all and through all came that sharp tinklethat cry for help in extremity we met the first torrent of people returning
