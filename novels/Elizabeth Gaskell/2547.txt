half a lifetime ago by elizabeth gaskell contents chapter i chapter ii chapter iii chapter iv chapter v chapter i half a lifetime ago there lived in one of the westmoreland dales a single woman of the name of susan dixon she was owner of the small farmhouse where she resided and of some thirty or forty acres of land by which it was surrounded she had also an hereditary right to a sheepwalk extending to the wild fells that overhang blea tarn in the language of the country she was a stateswoman her house is yet to be seen on the oxenfell road between skelwith and coniston you go along a moorland track made by the carts that occasionally came for turf from the oxenfell a brook babbles and brattles by the wayside giving you a sense of companionship which relieves the deep solitude in which this way is usually traversed some miles on this side of coniston there is a farmsteada gray stone house and a square of farmbuildings surrounding a green space of rough turf in the midst of which stands a mighty funereal umbrageous yew making a solemn shadow as of death in the very heart and centre of the light and heat of the brightest summer day on the side away from the house this yard slopes down to a darkbrown pool which is supplied with fresh water from the overflowings of a stone cistern into which some rivulet of the brook beforementioned continually and melodiously falls bubbling the cattle drink out of this cistern the household bring their pitchers and fill them with drinkingwater by a dilatory yet pretty process the watercarrier brings with her a leaf of the houndstongue fern and inserting it in the crevice of the gray rock makes a cool green spout for the sparkling stream the house is no specimen at the present day of what it was in the lifetime of susan dixon then every small diamond pane in the windows glittered with cleanliness you might have eaten off the floor you could see yourself in the pewter plates and the polished oaken awmry or dresser of the state kitchen into which you entered few strangers penetrated further than this room once or twice wandering tourists attracted by the lonely picturesqueness of the situation and the exquisite cleanliness of the house itself made their way into this houseplace and offered money enough as they thought to tempt the hostess to receive them as lodgers they would give no trouble they said they would be out rambling or sketching all day long would be perfectly content with a share of the food which she provided for herself or would procure what they required from the waterhead inn at coniston but no liberal sumno fair wordsmoved her from her stony manner or her monotonous tone of indifferent refusal no persuasion could induce her to show any more of the house than that first room no appearance of fatigue procured for the weary an invitation to sit down and rest and if one more bold and less delicate did so without being asked susan stood by cold and apparently deaf or only replying by the briefest monosyllables till the unwelcome visitor had departed yet those with whom she had dealings in the way of selling her cattle or her farm produce spoke of her as keen after a bargaina hard one to have to do with and she never spared herself exertion or fatigue at market or in the field to make the most of her produce she led the haymakers with her swift steady rake and her noiseless evenness of motion she was about among the earliest in the market examining samples of oats pricing them and then turning with grim satisfaction to her own cleaner corn she was served faithfully and long by those who were rather her fellowlabourers than her servants she was even and just in her dealings with them if she was peculiar and silent they knew her and knew that she might be relied on some of them had known her from her childhood and deep in their hearts was an unspokenalmost unconsciouspity for her for they knew her story though they never spoke of it yes the time had been when that tall gaunt hardfeatured angular womanwho never smiled and hardly ever spoke an unnecessary wordhad been a finelooking girl brightspirited and rosy and when the hearth at the yew nook had been as bright as she with family love and youthful hope and mirth fifty or fiftyone years ago william dixon and his wife margaret were alive and susan their daughter was about eighteen years oldten years older than the only other child a boy named after his father william and margaret dixon were rather superior people of a character belongingas far as i have seenexclusively to the class of westmoreland and cumberland statesmenjust independent upright not given to much speaking kindhearted but not demonstrative disliking change and new ways and new people sensible and shrewd each household selfcontained and its members having little curiosity as to their neighbours with whom they rarely met for any social intercourse save at the stated times of sheepshearing and christmas having a certain kind of sober pleasure in amassing money which occasionally made them miserable as they call miserly people up in the north in their old age reading no light or ephemeral literature but the grave solid books brought round by the pedlars such as the paradise lost and regained the death of abel the spiritual quixote and the pilgrims progress were to be found in nearly every house the men occasionally going off laking ie playing ie drinking for days together and having to be hunted up by anxious wives who dared not leave their husbands to the chances of the wild precipitous roads but walked miles and miles lantern in hand in the dead of night to discover and guide the solemnlydrunken husband home who had a dreadful headache the next day and the day after that came forth as grave and sober and virtuous looking as if there were no such thing as malt and spirituous liquors in the world and who were seldom reminded of their misdoings by their wives to whom such occasional outbreaks were as things of course when once the immediate anxiety produced by them was over such weresuch arethe characteristics of a class now passing away from the face of the land as their compeers the yeomen have done before them of such was william dixon he was a shrewd clever farmer in his day and generation when shrewdness was rather shown in the breeding and rearing of sheep and cattle than in the cultivation of land owing to this character of his statesmen from a distance from beyond kendal or from borrowdale of greater wealth than he would send their sons to be farmservants for a year or two with him in order to learn some of his methods before setting up on land of their own when susan his daughter was about seventeen one michael hurst was farmservant at yew nook he worked with the master and lived with the family and was in all respects treated as an equal except in the field his father was a wealthy statesman at wythburne up beyond grasmere and through michaels servitude the families had become acquainted and the dixons went over to the high beck sheepshearing and the hursts came down by red bank and loughrig tarn and across the oxenfell when there was the christmastide feasting at yew nook the fathers strolled round the fields together examined cattle and sheep and looked knowing over each others horses the mothers inspected the dairies and household arrangements each openly admiring the plans of the other but secretly preferring their own both fathers and mothers cast a glance from time to time at michael and susan who were thinking of nothing less than farm or dairy but whose unspoken attachment was in all ways so suitable and natural a thing that each parent rejoiced over it although with characteristic reserve it was never spoken aboutnot even between husband and wife susan had been a strong independent healthy girl a clever help to her mother and a spirited companion to her father more of a man in her as he often said than her delicate little brother ever would have he was his mothers darling although she loved susan well there was no positive engagement between michael and susani doubt whether even plain words of love had been spoken when one wintertime margaret dixon was seized with inflammation consequent upon a neglected cold she had always been strong and notable and had been too busy to attend to the early symptoms of illness it would go off she said to the woman who helped in the kitchen or if she did not feel better when they had got the hams and bacon out of hand she would take some herbtea and nurse up a bit but death could not wait till the hams and bacon were cured he came on with rapid strides and shooting arrows of portentous agony susan had never seen illnessnever knew how much she loved her mother till now when she felt a dreadful instinctive certainty that she was losing her her mind was thronged with recollections of the many times she had slighted her mothers wishes her heart was full of the echoes of careless and angry replies that she had spoken what would she not now give to have opportunities of service and obedience and trials of her patience and love for that dear mother who lay gasping in torture and yet susan had been a good girl and an affectionate daughter the sharp pain went off and delicious ease came on yet still her mother sunk in the midst of this languid peace she was dying she motioned susan to her bedside for she could only whisper and then while the father was out of the room she spoke as much to the eager hungering eyes of her daughter by the motion of her lips as by the slow feeble sounds of her voice susan lass thou must not fret it is gods will and thou wilt have a deal to do keep father straight if thou canst and if he goes out ulverstone ways see that thou meet him before he gets to the old quarry its a dree bit for a man who has had a drop as for lile willhere the poor womans face began to work and her fingers to move nervously as they lay on the bedquiltlile will will miss me most of all fathers often vexed with him because hes not a quick strong lad he is not my poor lile chap and father thinks hes saucy because he cannot always stomach oatcake and porridge theres better than three pound in th old black teapot on the top shelf of the cupboard just keep a piece of loafbread by you susan dear for will to come to when hes not taken his breakfast i have may be spoilt him but therell be no one to spoil him now she began to cry a low feeble cry and covered up her face that susan might not see her that dear face those precious moments while yet the eyes could look out with love and intelligence susan laid her head down close by her mothers ear mother ill take tent of will mother do you hear he shall not want ought i can give or get for him least of all the kind words which you had ever ready for us both bless you bless you my own mother thoult promise me that susan wilt thou i can die easy if thoult take charge of him but hes hardly like other folk he tries father at times though i think fatherll be tender of him when im gone for my sake and susan theres one thing more i never spoke on it for fear of the bairn being called a telltale but i just comforted him up he vexes michael at times and michael has struck him before now i did not want to make a stir but hes not strong and a word from thee susan will go a long way with michael susan was as red now as she had been pale before it was the first time that her influence over michael had been openly acknowledged by a third person and a flash of joy came athwart the solemn sadness of the moment her mother had spoken too much and now came on the miserable faintness she never spoke again coherently but when her children and her husband stood by her bedside she took lile wills hand and put it into susans and looked at her with imploring eyes susan clasped her arms round will and leaned her head upon his little curly one and vowed within herself to be as a mother to him henceforward she was all in all to her brother she was a more spirited and amusing companion to him than his mother had been from her greater activity and perhaps also from her originality of character which often prompted her to perform her habitual actions in some new and racy manner she was tender to lile will when she was prompt and sharp with everybody elsewith michael most of all for somehow the girl felt that unprotected by her mother she must keep up her own dignity and not allow her lover to see how strong a hold he had upon her heart he called her hard and cruel and left her so and she smiled softly to herself when his back was turned to think how little he guessed how deeply he was loved for susan was merely comely and fine looking michael was strikingly handsome admired by all the girls for miles round and quite enough of a country coxcomb to know it and plume himself accordingly he was the second son of his father the eldest would have high beck farm of course but there was a good penny in the kendal bank in store for michael when harvest was over he went to chapel langdale to learn to dance and at night in his merry moods he would do his steps on the flag floor of the yew nook kitchen to the secret admiration of susan who had never learned dancing but who flouted him perpetually even while she admired in accordance with the rule she seemed to have made for herself about keeping him at a distance so long as he lived under the same roof with her one evening he sulked at some saucy remark of hers he sitting in the chimney corner with his arms on his knees and his head bent forwards lazily gazing into the woodfire on the hearth and luxuriating in rest after a hard days labour she sitting among the geraniums on the long low windowseat trying to catch the last slanting rays of the autumnal light to enable her to finish stitching a shirtcollar for will who lounged full length on the flags at the other side of the hearth to michael poking the burning wood from time to time with a long hazelstick to bring out the leap of glittering sparks and if you can dance a threesome reel what good does it do ye asked susan looking askance at michael who had just been vaunting his proficiency does it help you plough reap or even climb the rocks to take a ravens nest if i were a man id be ashamed to give in to such softness if you were a man youd be glad to do anything which made the pretty girls stand round and admire as they do to you eh ho michael that would not be my way o being a man what would then asked he after a pause during which he had expected in vain that she would go on with her sentence no answer i should not like you as a man susy youd be too hard and headstrong am i hard and headstrong asked she with as indifferent a tone as she could assume but which yet had a touch of pique in it his quick ear detected the inflexion no susy youre wilful at times and thats right enough i dont like a girl without spirit theres a mighty pretty girl comes to the dancing class but she is all milk and water her eyes never flash like yours when youre put out why i can see them flame across the kitchen like a cats in the dark now if you were a man i should feel queer before those looks of yours as it is i rather like them because because what asked she looking up and perceiving that he had stolen close up to her because i can make all right in this way said he kissing her suddenly can you said she wrenching herself out of his grasp and panting half with rage take that by way of proof that making right is none so easy and she boxed his ears pretty sharply he went back to his seat discomfited and out of temper she could no longer see to look even if her face had not burnt and her eyes dazzled but she did not choose to move her seat so she still preserved her stooping attitude and pretended to go on sewing eleanor hebthwaite may be milkandwater muttered he butconfound thee lad what art thou doing exclaimed michael as a great piece of burning wood was cast into his face by an unlucky poke of wills thou great lounging clumsy chap ill teach thee better and with one or two good round kicks he sent the lad whimpering away into the backkitchen when he had a little recovered himself from his passion he saw susan standing before him her face looking strange and almost ghastly by the reversed position of the shadows arising from the firelight shining upwards right under it i tell thee what michael said she that lads motherless but not friendless his own father leathers him and why should not i when hes given me such a burn on my face said michael putting up his hand to his cheek as if in pain his fathers his father and there is nought more to be said but if he did burn thee it was by accident and not o purpose as thou kicked him its a mercy if his ribs are not broken he howls loud enough im sure i might ha kicked many a lad twice as hard and theyd neer ha said ought but damn ye but yon lad must needs cry out like a stuck pig if one touches him replied michael sullenly susan went back to the windowseat and looked absently out of the window at the drifting clouds for a minute or two while her eyes filled with tears then she got up and made for the outer door which led into the backkitchen before she reached it however she heard a low voice whose music made her thrill say susan susan her heart melted within her but it seemed like treachery to her poor boy like faithlessness to her dead mother to turn to her lover while the tears which he had caused to flow were yet unwiped on wills cheeks so she seemed to take no heed but passed into the darkness and guided by the sobs she found her way to where willie sat crouched among the disused tubs and churns come out wi me lad and they went out into the orchard where the fruittrees were bare of leaves but ghastly in their tattered covering of gray moss and the soughing november wind came with long sweeps over the fells till it rattled among the crackling boughs underneath which the brother and sister sat in the dark he in her lap and she hushing his head against her shoulder thou shouldst na play wi fire its a naughty trick thoult suffer for it in worse ways nor this before thoust done im afeared i should ha hit thee twice as lungeous kicks as mike if id been in his place he did na hurt thee i am sure she assumed half as a question yes but he did he turned me quite sick and he let his head fall languidly down on his sisters breast come lad come lad said she anxiously be a man it was not much that i saw why when first the red cow came she kicked me far harder for offering to milk her before her legs were tied see thee heres a peppermintdrop and ill make thee a pasty tonight only dont give way so for it hurts me sore to think that michael has done thee any harm my pretty willie roused himself up and put back the wet and ruffled hair from his heated face and he and susan rose up and handinhand went towards the house walking slowly and quietly except for a kind of sob which willie could not repress susan took him to the pump and washed his tearstained face till she thought she had obliterated all traces of the recent disturbance arranging his curls for him and then she kissed him tenderly and led him in hoping to find michael in the kitchen and make all straight between them but the blaze had dropped down into darkness the wood was a heap of gray ashes in which the sparks ran hither and thither but even in the groping darkness susan knew by the sinking at her heart that michael was not there she threw another brand on the hearth and lighted the candle and sat down to her work in silence willie cowered on his stool by the side of the fire eyeing his sister from time to time and sorry and oppressed he knew not why by the sight of her grave almost stern face no one came they two were in the house alone the old woman who helped susan with the household work had gone out for the night to some friends dwelling william dixon the father was up on the fells seeing after his sheep susan had no heart to prepare the evening meal susy darling are you angry with me said willie in his little piping gentle voice he had stolen up to his sisters side i wont never play with the fire again and ill not cry if michael does kick me only dont look so like dead motherdontdontplease dont he exclaimed hiding his face on her shoulder im not angry willie said she dont be feared on me you want your supper and you shall have it and dont you be feared on michael he shall give reason for every hair of your head that he toucheshe shall when william dixon came home he found susan and willie sitting together handinhand and apparently pretty cheerful he bade them go to bed for that he would sit up for michael and the next morning when susan came down she found that michael had started an hour before with the cart for lime it was a long days work susan knew it would be late perhaps later than on the preceding night before he returnedat any rate past her usual bedtime and on no account would she stop up a minute beyond that hour in the kitchen whatever she might do in her bedroom here she sat and watched till past midnight and when she saw him coming up the brow with the carts she knew full well even in that faint moonlight that his gait was the gait of a man in liquor but though she was annoyed and mortified to find in what way he had chosen to forget her the fact did not disgust or shock her as it would have done many a girl even at that day who had not been brought up as susan had among a class who considered it no crime but rather a mark of spirit in a man to get drunk occasionally nevertheless she chose to hold herself very high all the next day when michael was perforce obliged to give up any attempt to do heavy work and hung about the outbuildings and farm in a very disconsolate and sickly state willie had far more pity on him than susan before evening willie and he were fast and on his side ostentatious friends willie rode the horses down to water willie helped him to chop wood susan sat gloomily at her work hearing an indistinct but cheerful conversation going on in the shippon while the cows were being milked she almost felt irritated with her little brother as if he were a traitor and had gone over to the enemy in the very battle that she was fighting in his cause she was alone with no one to speak to while they prattled on regardless if she were glad or sorry soon willie burst in susan susan come with me ive something so pretty to show you round the corner of the barnrun run he was dragging her along half reluctant half desirous of some change in that weary day round the corner of the barn and caught hold of by michael who stood there awaiting her o willie cried she you naughty boy there is nothing prettywhat have you brought me here for let me go i wont be held only one word nay if you wish it so much you may go said michael suddenly loosing his hold as she struggled but now she was free she only drew off a step or two murmuring something about willie you are going then said michael with seeming sadness you wont hear me say a word of what is in my heart how can i tell whether it is what i should like to hear replied she still drawing back that is just what i want you to tell me i want you to hear it and then to tell me whether you like it or not well you may speak replied she turning her back and beginning to plait the hem of her apron he came close to her ear im sorry i hurt willie the other night he has forgiven me can you you hurt him very badly she replied but you are right to be sorry i forgive you stop stop said he laying his hand upon her arm there is something more ive got to say i want you to be mywhat is it they call it susan i dont know said she halflaughing but trying to get away with all her might now and she was a strong girl but she could not manage it you do mywhat is it i want you to be i tell you i dont know and you had best be quiet and just let me go in or i shall think youre as bad now as you were last night and how did you know what i was last night it was past twelve when i came home were you watching ah susan be my wife and you shall never have to watch for a drunken husband if i were your husband i would come straight home and count every minute an hour till i saw your bonny face now you know what i want you to be i ask you to be my wife will you my own dear susan she did not speak for some time then she only said ask father and now she was really off like a lapwing round the corner of the barn and up in her own little room crying with all her might before the triumphant smile had left michaels face where he stood the ask father was a mere form to be gone though old daniel hurst and william dixon had talked over what they could respectively give their children before this and that was the parental way of arranging such matters when the probable amount of worldly gear that he could give his child had been named by each father the young folk as they said might take their own time in coming to the point which the old men with the prescience of experience saw they were drifting to no need to hurry them for they were both young and michael though active enough was too thoughtless old daniel said to be trusted with the entire management of a farm meanwhile his father would look about him and see after all the farms that were to be let michael had a shrewd notion of this preliminary understanding between the fathers and so felt less daunted than he might otherwise have done at making the application for susans hand it was all right there was not an obstacle only a deal of good advice which the lover thought might have as well been spared and which it must be confessed he did not much attend to although he assented to every part of it then susan was called down stairs and slowly came dropping into view down the steps which led from the two family apartments into the houseplace she tried to look composed and quiet but it could not be done she stood side by side with her lover with her head drooping her cheeks burning not daring to look up or move while her father made the newlybetrothed a somewhat formal address in which he gave his consent and many a piece of worldly wisdom beside susan listened as well as she could for the beating of her heart but when her father solemnly and sadly referred to his own lost wife she could keep from sobbing no longer but throwing her apron over her face she sat down on the bench by the dresser and fairly gave way to pentup tears oh how strangely sweet to be comforted as she was comforted by tender caress and many a lowwhispered promise of love her father sat by the fire thinking of the days that were gone willie was still out of doors but susan and michael felt no ones presence or absencethey only knew they were together as betrothed husband and wife in a week or two they were formally told of the arrangements to be made in their favour a small farm in the neighbourhood happened to fall vacant and michaels father offered to take it for him and be responsible for the rent for the first year while william dixon was to contribute a certain amount of stock and both fathers were to help towards the furnishing of the house susan received all this information in a quiet indifferent way she did not care much for any of these preparations which were to hurry her through the happy hours she cared least of all for the money amount of dowry and of substance it jarred on her to be made the confidante of occasional slight repinings of michaels as one by one his future fatherinlaw set aside a beast or a pig for susans portion which were not always the best animals of their kind upon the farm but he also complained of his own fathers stinginess which somewhat though not much alleviated susans dislike to being awakened out of her pure dream of love to the consideration of worldly wealth but in the midst of all this bustle willie moped and pined he had the same chord of delicacy running through his mind that made his body feeble and weak he kept out of the way and was apparently occupied in whittling and carving uncouth heads on hazelsticks in an outhouse but he positively avoided michael and shrunk away even from susan she was too much occupied to notice this at first michael pointed it out to her saying with a laugh look at willie he might be a castoff lover and jealous of me he looks so dark and downcast at me michael spoke this jest out loud and willie burst into tears and ran out of the house let me go let me go said susan for her lovers arm was round her waist i must go to him if hes fretting i promised mother i would she pulled herself away and went in search of the boy she sought in byre and barn through the orchard where indeed in this leafless wintertime there was no great concealment up into the room where the wool was usually stored in the later summer and at last she found him sitting at bay like some hunted creature up behind the woodstack what are ye gone for lad and me seeking you everywhere asked she breathless i did not know you would seek me ive been away many a time and no one has cared to seek me said he crying afresh nonsense replied susan dont be so foolish ye little goodfornought but she crept up to him in the hole he had made underneath the great brown sheafs of wood and squeezed herself down by him what for should folk seek after you when you get away from them whenever you can asked she they dont want me to stay nobody wants me if i go with father he says i hinder more than i help you used to like to have me with you but now youve taken up with michael and youd rather i was away and i can just bide away but i cannot stand michael jeering at me hes got you to love him and that might serve him but i love you too dearly lad said she putting her arm round his neck which one of us do you like best said he wistfully after a little pause putting her arm away so that he might look in her face and see if she spoke truth she went very red you should not ask such questions they are not fit for you to ask nor for me to answer but mother bade you love me said he plaintively and so i do and so i ever will do lover nor husband shall come betwixt thee and me ladneer a one of them that i promise thee as i promised mother before in the sight of god and with her hearkening now if ever she can hearken to earthly word again only i cannot abide to have thee fretting just because my heart is large enough for two and thoult love me always always and ever and the morethe more thoult love michael said she dropping her voice ill try said the boy sighing for he remembered many a harsh word and blow of which his sister knew nothing she would have risen up to go away but he held her tight for here and now she was all his own and he did not know when such a time might come again so the two sat crouched up and silent till they heard the horn blowing at the fieldgate which was the summons home to any wanderers belonging to the farm and at this hour of the evening signified that supper was ready then the two went in chapter ii susan and michael were to be married in april he had already gone to take possession of his new farm three or four miles away from yew nookbut that is neighbouring according to the acceptation of the word in that thinlypopulated districtwhen william dixon fell ill he came home one evening complaining of headache and pains in his limbs but seemed to loathe the posset which susan prepared for him the treacleposset which was the homely country remedy against an incipient cold he took to his bed with a sensation of exceeding weariness and an odd unusual lookingback to the days of his youth when he was a lad living with his parents in this very house the next morning he had forgotten all his life since then and did not know his own children crying like a newlyweaned baby for his mother to come and soothe away his terrible pain the doctor from coniston said it was the typhusfever and warned susan of its infectious character and shook his head over his patient there were no near friends to come and share her anxiety only good kind old peggy who was faithfulness itself and one or two labourers wives who would fain have helped her had not their hands been tied by their responsibility to their own families but somehow susan neither feared nor flagged as for fear indeed she had no time to give way to it for every energy of both body and mind was required besides the young have had too little experience of the danger of infection to dread it much she did indeed wish from time to time that michael had been at home to have taken willie over to his fathers at high beck but then again the lad was docile and useful to her and his fecklessness in many things might make him harshly treated by strangers so perhaps it was as well that michael was away at appleby fair or even beyond thatgone into yorkshire after horses her father grew worse and the doctor insisted on sending over a nurse from coniston not a professed nurseconiston could not have supported such a one but a widow who was ready to go where the doctor sent her for the sake of the payment when she came susan suddenly gave way she was felled by the fever herself and lay unconscious for long weeks her consciousness returned to her one spring afternoon early spring aprilher weddingmonth there was a little fire burning in the small cornergrate and the flickering of the blaze was enough for her to notice in her weak state she felt that there was some one sitting on the windowside of her bed behind the curtain but she did not care to know who it was it was even too great a trouble for her languid mind to consider who it was likely to be she would rather shut her eyes and melt off again into the gentle luxury of sleep the next time she wakened the coniston nurse perceived her movement and made her a cup of tea which she drank with eager relish but still they did not speak and once more susan lay motionlessnot asleep but strangely pleasantly conscious of all the small chamber and household sounds the fall of a cinder on the hearth the fitful singing of the halfempty kettle the cattle tramping out to field again after they had been milked the aged step on the creaking stairold peggys as she knew it came to her door it stopped the person outside listened for a moment and then lifted the wooden latch and looked in the watcher by the bedside arose and went to her susan would have been glad to see peggys face once more but was far too weak to turn so she lay and listened how is she whispered one trembling aged voice better replied the other shes been awake and had a cup of tea shell do now has she asked after him hush no she has not spoken a word poor lass poor lass the door was shut a weak feeling of sorrow and selfpity came over susan what was wrong whom had she loved and dawning dawning slowly rose the sun of her former life and all particulars were made distinct to her she felt that some sorrow was coming to her and cried over it before she knew what it was or had strength enough to ask in the dead of nightand she had never slept againshe softly called to the watcher and asked who who what replied the woman with a conscious affright illveiled by a poor assumption of ease lie still theres a darling and go to sleep sleeps better for you than all the doctors stuff who repeated susan something is wrong who oh dear said the woman theres nothing wrong willie has taken the turn and is doing nicely father well hes all right now she answered looking another way as if seeking for something then its michael oh me oh me she set up a succession of weak plaintive hysterical cries before the nurse could pacify her by declaring that michael had been at the house not three hours before to ask after her and looked as well and as hearty as ever man did and you heard of no harm to him since inquired susan bless the lass no for sure ive neer heard his name named since i saw him go out of the yard as stout a man as ever trod shoeleather it was well as the nurse said afterwards to peggy that susan had been so easily pacified by the equivocating answer in respect to her father if she had pressed the questions home in his case as she did in michaels she would have learnt that he was dead and buried more than a month before it was well too that in her weak state of convalescence which lasted long after this first day of consciousness her perceptions were not sharp enough to observe the sad change that had taken place in willie his bodily strength returned his appetite was something enormous but his eyes wandered continually his regard could not be arrested his speech became slow impeded and incoherent people began to say that the fever had taken away the little wit willie dixon had ever possessed and that they feared that he would end in being a natural as they call an idiot in the dales the habitual affection and obedience to susan lasted longer than any other feeling that the boy had had previous to his illness and perhaps this made her be the last to perceive what every one else had long anticipated she felt the awakening rude when it did come it was in this wise one june evening she sat out of doors under the yewtree knitting she was pale still from her recent illness and her languor joined to the fact of her black dress made her look more than usually interesting she was no longer the buoyant selfsufficient susan equal to every occasion the men were bringing in the cows to be milked and michael was about in the yard giving orders and directions with somewhat the air of a master for the farm belonged of right to willie and susan had succeeded to the guardianship of her brother michael and she were to be married as soon as she was strong enoughso perhaps his authoritative manner was justified but the labourers did not like it although they said little they remembered a stripling on the farm knowing far less than they did and often glad to shelter his ignorance of all agricultural matters behind their superior knowledge they would have taken orders from susan with far more willingness nay willie himself might have commanded them and from the old hereditary feeling toward the owners of land they would have obeyed him with far greater cordiality than they now showed to michael but susan was tired with even three rounds of knitting and seemed not to notice or to care how things went on around her and williepoor williethere he stood lounging against the doorsill enormously grown and developed to be sure but with restless eyes and everopen mouth and every now and then setting up a strange kind of howling cry and then smiling vacantly to himself at the sound he had made as the two old labourers passed him they looked at each other ominously and shook their heads willie darling said susan dont make that noiseit makes my head ache she spoke feebly and willie did not seem to hear at any rate he continued his howl from time to time hold thy noise wilta said michael roughly as he passed near him and threatening him with his fist susans back was turned to the pair the expression of willies face changed from vacancy to fear and he came shambling up to susan who put her arm round him and as if protected by that shelter he began making faces at michael susan saw what was going on and as if now first struck by the strangeness of her brothers manner she looked anxiously at michael for an explanation michael was irritated at willies defiance of him and did not mince the matter its just that the fever has left him sillyhe never was as wise as other folk and now i doubt if he will ever get right susan did not speak but she went very pale and her lip quivered she looked long and wistfully at willies face as he watched the motion of the ducks in the great stablepool he laughed softly to himself every now and then willie likes to see the ducks go overhead said susan instinctively adopting the form of speech she would have used to a young child willie boo willie boo he replied clapping his hands and avoiding her eye speak properly willie said susan making a strong effort at selfcontrol and trying to arrest his attention you know who i amtell me my name she grasped his arm almost painfully tight to make him attend now he looked at her and for an instant a gleam of recognition quivered over his face but the exertion was evidently painful and he began to cry at the vainness of the effort to recall her name he hid his face upon her shoulder with the old affectionate trick of manner she put him gently away and went into the house into her own little bedroom she locked the door and did not reply at all to michaels calls for her hardly spoke to old peggy who tried to tempt her out to receive some homely sympathy and through the open easement there still came the idiotic sound of willie boo willie boo chapter iii after the stun of the blow came the realization of the consequences susan would sit for hours trying patiently to recall and piece together fragments of recollection and consciousness in her brothers mind she would let him go and pursue some senseless bit of play and wait until she could catch his eye or his attention again when she would resume her selfimposed task michael complained that she never had a word for him or a minute of time to spend with him now but she only said she must try while there was yet a chance to bring back her brothers lost wits as for marriage in this state of uncertainty she had no heart to think of it then michael stormed and absented himself for two or three days but it was of no use when he came back he saw that she had been crying till her eyes were all swollen up and he gathered from peggys scoldings which she did not spare him that susan had eaten nothing since he went away but she was as inflexible as ever not just yet only not just yet and dont say again that i do not love you said she suddenly hiding herself in his arms and so matters went on through august the crop of oats was gathered in the wheatfield was not ready as yet when one fine day michael drove up in a borrowed shandry and offered to take willie a ride his manner when susan asked him where he was going to was rather confused but the answer was straight and clear enough he had business in ambleside he would never lose sight of the lad and have him back safe and sound before dark so susan let him go before night they were at home again willie in high delight at a little rattling paper windmill that michael had bought for him in the street and striving to imitate this new sound with perpetual buzzings michael too looked pleased susan knew the look although afterwards she remembered that he had tried to veil it from her and had assumed a grave appearance of sorrow whenever he caught her eye he put up his horse for although he had three miles further to go the moon was upthe bonny harvestmoonand he did not care how late he had to drive on such a road by such a light after the supper which susan had prepared for the travellers was over peggy went upstairs to see willie safe in bed for he had to have the same care taken of him that a little child of four years old requires michael drew near to susan susan said he i took will to see dr preston at kendal hes the first doctor in the county i thought it were better for usfor youto know at once what chance there were for him well said susan looking eagerly up she saw the same strange glance of satisfaction the same instant change to apparent regret and pain what did he say said she speak cant you he said he would never get better of his weakness never no never its a long word and hard to bear and theres worse to come dearest the doctor thinks he will get badder from year to year and he said if he was usyouhe would send him off in time to lancaster asylum theyve ways there both of keeping such people in order and making them happy i only tell you what he said continued he seeing the gathering storm in her face there was no harm in his saying it she replied with great selfconstraint forcing herself to speak coldly instead of angrily folk is welcome to their opinions they sat silent for a minute or two her breast heaving with suppressed feeling hes counted a very clever man said michael at length he may be hes none of my clever men nor am i going to be guided by him whatever he may think and i dont thank them that went and took my poor lad to have such harsh notions formed about him if id been there i could have called out the sense that is in him well ill not say more tonight susan youre not taking it rightly and id best be gone and leave you to think it over ill not deny they are hard words to hear but theres sense in them as i take it and i reckon youll have to come to em anyhow its a bad way of thanking me for my pains and i dont take it well in you susan said he getting up as if offended michael im beside myself with sorrow dont blame me if i speak sharp he and me is the only ones you see and mother did so charge me to have a care of him and this is what hes come to poor lile chap she began to cry and michael to comfort her with caresses dont said she its no use trying to make me forget poor willie is a natural i could hate myself for being happy with you even for just a little minute go away and leave me to face it out and youll think it over susan and remember what the doctor says i cant forget said she she meant she could not forget what the doctor had said about the hopelessness of her brothers case michael had referred to the plan of sending willie to an asylum or madhouse as they were called in that day and place the idea had been gathering force in michaels mind for some time he had talked it over with his father and secretly rejoiced over the possession of the farm and land which would then be his in fact if not in law by right of his wife he had always considered the good penny her father could give her in his catalogue of susans charms and attractions but of late he had grown to esteem her as the heiress of yew nook he too should have land like his brotherland to possess to cultivate to make profit from to bequeath for some time he had wondered that susan had been so much absorbed in willies present that she had never seemed to look forward to his future state michael had long felt the boy to be a trouble but of late he had absolutely loathed him his gibbering his uncouth gestures his loose shambling gait all irritated michael inexpressibly he did not come near the yew nook for a couple of days he thought that he would leave her time to become anxious to see him and reconciled to his plan they were strange lonely days to susan they were the first she had spent face to face with the sorrows that had turned her from a girl into a woman for hitherto michael had never let twentyfour hours pass by without coming to see her since she had had the fever now that he was absent it seemed as though some cause of irritation was removed from will who was much more gentle and tractable than he had been for many weeks susan thought that she observed him making efforts at her bidding and there was something piteous in the way in which he crept up to her and looked wistfully in her face as if asking her to restore him the faculties that he felt to be wanting i never will let thee go lad never theres no knowing where they would take thee to or what they would do with thee as it says in the bible nought but death shall part thee and me the countryside was full in those days of stories of the brutal treatment offered to the insane stories that were in fact but too well founded and the truth of one of which only would have been a sufficient reason for the strong prejudice existing against all such places each succeeding hour that susan passed alone or with the poor affectionate lad for her sole companion served to deepen her solemn resolution never to part with him so when michael came he was annoyed and surprised by the calm way in which she spoke as if following dr prestons advice was utterly and entirely out of the question he had expected nothing less than a consent reluctant it might be but still a consent and he was extremely irritated he could have repressed his anger but he chose rather to give way to it thinking that he could thus best work upon susans affection so as to gain his point but somehow he overreached himself and now he was astonished in his turn at the passion of indignation that she burst into thou wilt not bide in the same house with him sayst thou theres no need for thy biding as far as i can tell theres solemn reason why i should bide with my own flesh and blood and keep to the word i pledged my mother on her deathbed but as for thee theres no tie that i know on to keep thee fro going to america or botany bay this very night if that were thy inclination i will have no more of your threats to make me send my bairn away if thou marry me thoult help me to take charge of willie if thou doesnt choose to marry me on those termswhy i can snap my fingers at thee never fear im not so far gone in love as that but i will not have thee if thou sayst in such a hectoring way that willie must go out of the houseand the house his own toobefore thoult set foot in it willie bides here and i bide with him thou hast maybe spoken a word too much said michael pale with rage if i am free as thou sayst to go to canada or botany bay i reckon im free to live where i like and that will not be with a natural who may turn into a madman some day for aught i know choose between him and me susy for i swear to thee thou shant have both i have chosen said susan now perfectly composed and still whatever comes of it i bide with willie very well replied michael trying to assume an equal composure of manner then ill wish you a very good night he went out of the house door halfexpecting to be called back again but instead he heard a hasty step inside and a bolt drawn whew said he to himself i think i must leave my lady alone for a week or two and give her time to come to her senses shell not find it so easy as she thinks to let me go so he went past the kitchenwindow in nonchalant style and was not seen again at yew nook for some weeks how did he pass the time for the first day or two he was unusually cross with all things and people that came athwart him then wheatharvest began and he was busy and exultant about his heavy crop then a man came from a distance to bid for the lease of his farm which by his fathers advice had been offered for sale as he himself was so soon likely to remove to the yew nook he had so little idea that susan really would remain firm to her determination that he at once began to haggle with the man who came after his farm showed him the crop just got in and managed skilfully enough to make a good bargain for himself of course the bargain had to be sealed at the publichouse and the companions he met with there soon became friends enough to tempt him into langdale where again he met with eleanor hebthwaite how did susan pass the time for the first day or so she was too angry and offended to cry she went about her household duties in a quick sharp jerking yet absent way shrinking one moment from will overwhelming him with remorseful caresses the next the third day of michaels absence she had the relief of a good fit of crying and after that she grew softer and more tender she felt how harshly she had spoken to him and remembered how angry she had been she made excuses for him it was no wonder she said to herself that he had been vexed with her and no wonder he would not give in when she had never tried to speak gently or to reason with him she was to blame and she would tell him so and tell him once again all that her mother had bade her to be to willie and all the horrible stories she had heard about madhouses and he would be on her side at once and so she watched for his coming intending to apologise as soon as ever she saw him she hurried over her household work in order to sit quietly at her sewing and hear the first distant sound of his wellknown step or whistle but even the sound of her flying needle seemed too loudperhaps she was losing an exquisite instant of anticipation so she stopped sewing and looked longingly out through the geranium leaves in order that her eye might catch the first stir of the branches in the woodpath by which he generally came now and then a bird might spring out of the covert otherwise the leaves were heavily still in the sultry weather of early autumn then she would take up her sewing and with a spasm of resolution she would determine that a certain task should be fulfilled before she would again allow herself the poignant luxury of expectation sick at heart was she when the evening closed in and the chances of that day diminished yet she stayed up longer than usual thinking that if he were comingif he were only passing along the distant roadthe sight of a light in the window might encourage him to make his appearance even at that late hour while seeing the house all darkened and shut up might quench any such intention very sick and weary at heart she went to bed too desolate and despairing to cry or make any moan but in the morning hope came afresh another dayanother chance and so it went on for weeks peggy understood her young mistresss sorrow full well and respected it by her silence on the subject willie seemed happier now that the irritation of michaels presence was removed for the poor idiot had a sort of antipathy to michael which was a kind of hearts echo to the repugnance in which the latter held him altogether just at this time willie was the happiest of the three as susan went into coniston to sell her butter one saturday some inconsiderate person told her that she had seen michael hurst the night before i said inconsiderate but i might rather have said unobservant for any one who had spent halfanhour in susan dixons company might have seen that she disliked having any reference made to the subjects nearest her heart were they joyous or grievous now she went a little paler than usual and she had never recovered her colour since she had had the fever and tried to keep silence but an irrepressible pang forced out the question where at thomas applethwaites in langdale they had a kind of harvesthome and he were there among the young folk and very thick wi nelly hebthwaite old thomass niece thoult have to look after him a bit susan she neither smiled nor sighed the neighbour who had been speaking to her was struck with the gray stillness of her face susan herself felt how well her selfcommand was obeyed by every little muscle and said to herself in her spartan manner i can bear it without either wincing or blenching she went home early at a tearing passionate pace trampling and breaking through all obstacles of briar or bush willie was moping in her absencehanging listlessly on the farmyard gate to watch for her when he saw her he set up one of his strange inarticulate cries of which she was now learning the meaning and came towards her with his loose galloping run head and limbs all shaking and wagging with pleasant excitement suddenly she turned from him and burst into tears she sat down on a stone by the wayside not a hundred yards from home and buried her face in her hands and gave way to a passion of pentup sorrow so terrible and full of agony were her low cries that the idiot stood by her aghast and silent all his joy gone for the time but not like her joy turned into ashes some thought struck him yes the sight of her woe made him think great as the exertion was he ran and stumbled and shambled home buzzing with his lips all the time she never missed him he came back in a trice bringing with him his cherished paper windmill bought on that fatal day when michael had taken him into kendal to have his doom of perpetual idiocy pronounced he thrust it into susans face her hands her lap regardless of the injury his frail plaything thereby received he leapt before her to think how he had cured all heartsorrow buzzing louder than ever susan looked up at him and that glance of her sad eyes sobered him he began to whimper he knew not why and she now comforter in her turn tried to soothe him by twirling his windmill but it was broken it made no noise it would not go round this seemed to afflict susan more than him she tried to make it right although she saw the task was hopeless and while she did so the tears rained down unheeded from her bent head on the paper toy it wont do said she at last it will never do again and somehow she took the accident and her words as omens of the love that was broken and that she feared could never be pieced together more she rose up and took willies hand and the two went slowly into the house to her surprise michael hurst sat in the houseplace houseplace is a sort of better kitchen where no cookery is done but which is reserved for state occasions michael had gone in there because he was accompanied by his only sister a woman older than himself who was well married beyond keswick and who now came for the first time to make acquaintance with susan michael had primed his sister with his wishes regarding will and the position in which he stood with susan and arriving at yew nook in the absence of the latter he had not scrupled to conduct his sister into the guestroom as he held mrs gales worldly position in respect and admiration and therefore wished her to be favourably impressed with all the signs of property which he was beginning to consider as susans greatest charms he had secretly said to himself that if eleanor hebthwaite and susan dixon were equal in point of riches he would sooner have eleanor by far he had begun to consider susan as a termagant and when he thought of his intercourse with her recollections of her somewhat warm and hasty temper came far more readily to his mind than any remembrance of her generous loving nature and now she stood face to face with him her eyes tearswollen her garments dusty and here and there torn in consequence of her rapid progress through the bushy bypaths she did not make a favourable impression on the wellclad mrs gale dressed in her best silk gown and therefore unusually susceptible to the appearance of another nor were susans manners gracious or cordial how could they be when she remembered what had passed between michael and herself the last time they met for her penitence had faded away under the daily disappointment of these last weary weeks but she was hospitable in substance she bade peggy hurry on the kettle and busied herself among the teacups thankful that the presence of mrs gale as a stranger would prevent the immediate recurrence to the one subject which she felt must be present in michaels mind as well as in her own but mrs gale was withheld by no such feelings of delicacy she had come readyprimed with the case and had undertaken to bring the girl to reason there was no time to be lost it had been prearranged between the brother and sister that he was to stroll out into the farmyard before his sister introduced the subject but she was so confident in the success of her arguments that she must needs have the triumph of a victory as soon as possible and accordingly she brought a hailstorm of good reasons to bear upon susan susan did not reply for a long time she was so indignant at this intermeddling of a stranger in the deep family sorrow and shame mrs gale thought she was gaining the day and urged her arguments more pitilessly even michael winced for susan and wondered at her silence he shrank out of sight and into the shadow hoping that his sister might prevail but annoyed at the hard way in which she kept putting the case suddenly susan turned round from the occupation she had pretended to be engaged in and said to him in a low voice which yet not only vibrated itself but made its hearers thrill through all their obtuseness michael hurst does your sister speak truth think you both women looked at him for his answer mrs gale without anxiety for had she not said the very words they had spoken together before had she not used the very arguments that he himself had suggested susan on the contrary looked to his answer as settling her doom for life and in the gloom of her eyes you might have read more despair than hope he shuffled his position he shuffled in his words what is it you ask my sister has said many things i ask you said susan trying to give a crystal clearness both to her expressions and her pronunciation if knowing as you do how will is afflicted you will help me to take that charge of him which i promised my mother on her deathbed that i would do and which means that i shall keep him always with me and do all in my power to make his life happy if you will do this i will be your wife if not i remain unwed but he may get dangerous he can be but a trouble his being here is a pain to you susan not a pleasure i ask you for either yes or no said she a little contempt at his evading her question mingling with her tone he perceived it and it nettled him and i have told you i answered your question the last time i was here i said i would neer keep house with an idiot no more i will so now youve gotten your answer i have said susan and she sighed deeply come now said mrs gale encouraged by the sigh one would think you dont love michael susan to be so stubborn in yielding to what im sure would be best for the lad oh she does not care for me said michael i dont believe she ever did dont i havent i asked susan her eyes blazing out fire she left the room directly and sent peggy in to make the tea and catching at will who was lounging about in the kitchen she went upstairs with him and bolted herself in straining the boy to her heart and keeping almost breathless lest any noise she made might cause him to break out into the howls and sounds which she could not bear that those below should hear a knock at the door it was peggy he wants for to see you to wish you goodbye i cannot come oh peggy send them away it was her only cry for sympathy and the old servant understood it she sent them away somehow not politely as i have been given to understand good go with them said peggy as she grimly watched their retreating figures were rid of bad rubbish anyhow and she turned into the house with the intention of making ready some refreshment for susan after her hard day at the market and her harder evening but in the kitchen to which she passed through the empty houseplace making a face of contemptuous dislike at the used teacups and fragments of a meal yet standing there she found susan with her sleeves tucked up and her working apron on busied in preparing to make clapbread one of the hardest and hottest domestic tasks of a daleswoman she looked up and first met and then avoided peggys eye it was too full of sympathy her own cheeks were flushed and her own eyes were dry and burning wheres the board peggy we need clapbread and i reckon ive time to get through with it tonight her voice had a sharp dry tone in it and her motions a jerking angularity about them peggy said nothing but fetched her all that she needed susan beat her cakes thin with vehement force as she stooped over them regardless even of the task in which she seemed so much occupied she was surprised by a touch on her mouth of somethingwhat she did not see at first it was a cup of tea delicately sweetened and cooled and held to her lips when exactly ready by the faithful old woman susan held it off a hands breath and looked into peggys eyes while her own filled with the strange relief of tears lass said peggy solemnly thou hast done well it is not long to bide and then the end will come but you are very old peggy said susan quivering it is but a day sin i were young replied peggy but she stopped the conversation by again pushing the cup with gentle force to susans dry and thirsty lips when she had drunken she fell again to her labour peggy heating the hearth and doing all that she knew would be required but never speaking another word willie basked close to the fire enjoying the animal luxury of warmth for the autumn evenings were beginning to be chilly it was one oclock before they thought of going to bed on that memorable night chapter iv the vehemence with which susan dixon threw herself into occupation could not last for ever times of languor and remembrance would cometimes when she recurred with a passionate yearning to bygone days the recollection of which was so vivid and delicious that it seemed as though it were the reality and the present bleak bareness the dream she smiled anew at the magical sweetness of some touch or tone which in memory she felt and heard and drank the delicious cup of poison although at the very time she knew what the consequences of racking pain would be this time last year thought she we went nutting togetherthis very day last year just such a day as today purple and gold were the lights on the hills the leaves were just turning brown here and there on the sunny slopes the stubblefields looked tawny down in a cleft of yon purple slaterock the beck fell like a silver glancing thread all just as it is today and he climbed the slender swaying nuttrees and bent the branches for me to gather or made a passage through the hazel copses from time to time claiming a toll who could have thought he loved me so littlewhowho or as the evening closed in she would allow herself to imagine that she heard his coming step just that she might recall time feeling of exquisite delight which had passed by without the due and passionate relish at the time then she would wonder how she could have had strength the cruel selfpiercing strength to say what she had done to stab himself with that stern resolution of which the sear would remain till her dying day it might have been right but as she sickened she wished she had not instinctively chosen the right how luxurious a life haunted by no stern sense of duty must be and many led this kind of life why could not she o for one hour again of his sweet company if he came now she would agree to whatever he proposed it was a fever of the mind she passed through it and came out healthy if weak she was capable once more of taking pleasure in following an unseen guide through briar and brake she returned with tenfold affection to her protecting care of willie she acknowledged to herself that he was to be her allinall in life she made him her constant companion for his sake as the real owner of yew nook and she as his steward and guardian she began that course of careful saving and that love of acquisition which afterwards gained for her the reputation of being miserly she still thought that he might regain a scanty portion of senseenough to require some simple pleasures and excitement which would cost money and money should not be wanting peggy rather assisted her in the formation of her parsimonious habits than otherwise economy was the order of the district and a certain degree of respectable avarice the characteristic of her age only willie was never stinted nor hindered of anything that the two women thought could give him pleasure for want of money there was one gratification which susan felt was needed for the restoration of her mind to its more healthy state after she had passed through the whirling fever when duty was as nothing and anarchy reigned a gratification that somehow was to be her last burst of unreasonableness of which she knew and recognised pain as the sure consequence she must see him once moreherself unseen the week before the christmas of this memorable year she went out in the dusk of the early winter evening wrapped close in shawl and cloak she wore her dark shawl under her cloak putting it over her head in lieu of a bonnet for she knew that she might have to wait long in concealment then she tramped over the wet fellpath shut in by misty rain for miles and miles till she came to the place where he was lodging a farmhouse in langdale with a steep stony lane leading up to it this lane was entered by a gate out of the main road and by the gate were a few bushesthorns but of them the leaves had fallen and they offered no concealment an old wreck of a yewtree grew among them however and underneath that susan cowered down shrouding her face of which the colour might betray her with a corner of her shawl long did she wait cold and cramped she became too damp and stiff to change her posture readily and after all he might never come but she would wait till daylight if need were and she pulled out a crust with which she had providently supplied herself the rain had ceaseda dull still brooding weather had succeeded it was a night to hear distant sounds she heard horses hoofs striking and splashing in the stones and in the pools of the road at her back two horses not wellridden or evenly guided as she could tell michael hurst and a companion drew near not tipsy but not sober they stopped at the gate to bid each other a maudlin farewell michael stooped forward to catch the latch with the hook of the stick which he carried he dropped the stick and it fell with one end close to susanindeed with the slightest change of posture she could have opened the gate for him he swore a great oath and struck his horse with his closed fist as if that animal had been to blame then he dismounted opened the gate and fumbled about for his stick when he had found it susan had touched the other end his first use of it was to flog his horse well and she had much ado to avoid its kicks and plunges then still swearing he staggered up the lane for it was evident he was not sober enough to remount by daylight susan was back and at her daily labours at yew nook when the spring came michael hurst was married to eleanor hebthwaite others too were married and christenings made their firesides merry and glad or they travelled and came back after long years with many wondrous tales more rarely perhaps a dalesman changed his dwelling but to all households more change came than to yew nook there the seasons came round with monotonous sameness or if they brought mutation it was of a slow and decaying and depressing kind old peggy died her silent sympathy concealed under much roughness was a loss to susan dixon susan was not yet thirty when this happened but she looked a middleaged not to say an elderly woman people affirmed that she had never recovered her complexion since that fever a dozen years ago which killed her father and left will dixon an idiot but besides her gray sallowness the lines in her face were strong and deep and hard the movements of her eyeballs were slow and heavy the wrinkles at the corners of her mouth and eyes were planted firm and sure not an ounce of unnecessary flesh was there on her bonesevery muscle started strong and ready for use she needed all this bodily strength to a degree that no human creature now peggy was dead knew of for willie had grown up large and strong in body and in general docile enough in mind but every now and then he became first moody and then violent these paroxysms lasted but a day or two and it was susans anxious care to keep their very existence hidden and unknown it is true that occasional passersby on that lonely road heard sounds at night of knocking about of furniture blows and cries as of some tearing demon within the solitary farmhouse but these fits of violence usually occurred in the night and whatever had been their consequence susan had tidied and redded up all signs of aught unusual before the morning for above all she dreaded lest some one might find out in what danger and peril she occasionally was and might assume a right to take away her brother from her care the one idea of taking charge of him had deepened and deepened with years it was graven into her mind as the object for which she lived the sacrifice she had made for this object only made it more precious to her besides she separated the idea of the docile affectionate loutish indolent will and kept it distinct from the terror which the demon that occasionally possessed him inspired her with the one was her flesh and her bloodthe child of her dead mother the other was some fiend who came to torture and convulse the creature she so loved she believed that she fought her brothers battle in holding down those tearing hands in binding whenever she could those uplifted restless arms prompt and prone to do mischief all the time she subdued him with her cunning or her strength she spoke to him in pitying murmurs or abused the third person the fiendish enemy in no unmeasured tones towards morning the paroxysm was exhausted and he would fall asleep perhaps only to waken with evil and renewed vigour but when he was laid down she would sally out to taste the fresh air and to work off her wild sorrow in cries and mutterings to herself the early labourers saw her gestures at a distance and thought her as crazed as the idiotbrother who made the neighbourhood a haunted place but did any chance person call at yew nook later on in the day he would find susan dixon cold calm collected her manner curt her wits keen once this fit of violence lasted longer than usual susans strength both of mind and body was nearly worn out she wrestled in prayer that somehow it might end before she too was driven mad or worse might be obliged to give up lifes aim and consign willie to a madhouse from that moment of prayer as she afterwards superstitiously thought willie calmedand then he droopedand then he sankand last of all he died in reality from physical exhaustion but he was so gentle and tender as he lay on his dying bed such strange childlike gleams of returning intelligence came over his face long after the power to make his dull inarticulate sounds had departed that susan was attracted to him by a stronger tie than she had ever felt before it was something to have even an idiot loving her with dumb wistful animal affection something to have any creature looking at her with such beseeching eyes imploring protection from the insidious enemy stealing on and yet she knew that to him death was no enemy but a true friend restoring light and health to his poor clouded mind it was to her that death was an enemy to her the survivor when willie died there was no one to love her worse doom still there was no one left on earth for her to love you now know why no wandering tourist could persuade her to receive him as a lodger why no tired traveller could melt her heart to afford him rest and refreshment why long habits of seclusion had given her a moroseness of manner and how care for the interests of another had rendered her keen and miserly but there was a third act in the drama of her life chapter v in spite of peggys prophecy that susans life should not seem long it did seem wearisome and endless as the years slowly uncoiled their monotonous circles to be sure she might have made change for herself but she did not care to do it it was indeed more than not caring which merely implies a certain degree of vis inerti to be subdued before an object can be attained and that the object itself does not seem to be of sufficient importance to call out the requisite energy on the contrary susan exerted herself to avoid change and variety she had a morbid dread of new faces which originated in her desire to keep poor dead willies state a profound secret she had a contempt for new customs and indeed her old ways prospered so well under her active hand and vigilant eye that it was difficult to know how they could be improved upon she was regularly present in coniston market with the best butter and the earliest chickens of the season those were the common farm produce that every farmers wife about had to sell but susan after she had disposed of the more feminine articles turned to on the mans side a better judge of a horse or cow there was not in all the country round yorkshire itself might have attempted to jockey her and would have failed her corn was sound and clean her potatoes well preserved to the latest spring people began to talk of the hoards of money susan dixon must have laid up somewhere and one young neerdoweel of a farmers son undertook to make love to the woman of forty who looked fiftyfive if a day he made up to her by opening a gate on the roadpath home as she was riding on a barebacked horse her purchase not an hour ago she was off before him refusing his civility but the remounting was not so easy and rather than fail she did not choose to attempt it she walked and he walked alongside improving his opportunity which as he vainly thought had been consciously granted to him as they drew near yew nook he ventured on some expression of a wish to keep company with her his words were vague and clumsily arranged susan turned round and coolly asked him to explain himself he took courage as he thought of her reputed wealth and expressed his wishes this second time pretty plainly to his surprise the reply she made was in a series of smart strokes across his shoulders administered through the medium of a supple hazelswitch take that said she almost breathless to teach thee how thou darest make a fool of an honest woman old enough to be thy mother if thou comst a step nearer the house theres a good horsepool and theres two stout fellows wholl like no better fun than ducking thee be off wi thee and she strode into her own premises never looking round to see whether he obeyed her injunction or not sometimes three or four years would pass over without her hearing michael hursts name mentioned she used to wonder at such times whether he were dead or alive she would sit for hours by the dying embers of her fire on a winters evening trying to recall the scenes of her youth trying to bring up living pictures of the faces she had then knownmichaels most especially she thought it was possible so long had been the lapse of years that she might now pass by him in the street unknowing and unknown his outward form she might not recognize but himself she should feel in the thrill of her whole being he could not pass her unawares what little she did hear about him all testified a downward tendency he dranknot at stated times when there was no other work to be done but continually whether it was seedtime or harvest his children were all ill at the same time then one died while the others recovered but were poor sickly things no one dared to give susan any direct intelligence of her former lover many avoided all mention of his name in her presence but a few spoke out either in indifference to or ignorance of those bygone days susan heard every word every whisper every sound that related to him but her eye never changed nor did a muscle of her face move late one november night she sat over her fire not a human being besides herself in the house none but she had ever slept there since willies death the farmlabourers had foddered the cattle and gone home hours before there were crickets chirping all round the warm hearthstones there was the clock ticking with the peculiar beat susan had known from her childhood and which then and ever since she had oddly associated within the idea of a mother and child talking together one loud tick and quicka feeble sharp one following the day had been keen and piercingly cold the whole lift of heaven seemed a dome of iron black and frostbound was the earth under the cruel east wind now the wind had dropped and as the darkness had gathered in the weatherwise old labourers prophesied snow the sounds in the air arose again as susan sat still and silent they were of a different character to what they had been during the prevalence of the east wind then they had been shrill and piping now they were like low distant growling not unmusical but strangely threatening susan went to the window and drew aside the little curtain the whole world was whitethe air was blinded with the swift and heavy fall of snow at present it came down straight but susan knew those distant sounds in the hollows and gulleys of the hills portended a driving wind and a more cruel storm she thought of her sheep were they all folded the newborn calf was it bedded well before the drifts were formed too deep for her to pass in and outand by the morning she judged that they would be six or seven feet deepshe would go out and see after the comfort of her beasts she took a lantern and tied a shawl over her head and went out into the open air she had tenderly provided for all her animals and was returning when borne on the blast as if some spiritcryfor it seemed to come rather down from the skies than from any creature standing on earths levelshe heard a voice of agony she could not distinguish words it seemed rather as if some bird of prey was being caught in the whirl of the icy wind and torn and tortured by its violence again up high above susan put down her lantern and shouted loud in return it was an instinct for if the creature were not human which she had doubted but a moment before what good could her responding cry do and her cry was seized on by the tyrannous wind and borne farther away in the opposite direction to that from which the call of agony had proceeded again she listened no sound then again it rang through space and this time she was sure it was human she turned into the house and heaped turf and wood on the fire which careless of her own sensations she had allowed to fade and almost die out she put a new candle in her lantern she changed her shawl for a maud and leaving the door on latch she sallied out just at the moment when her ear first encountered the weird noises of the storm on issuing forth into the open air she thought she heard the words o god o help they were a guide to her if words they were for they came straight from a rock not a quarter of a mile from yew nook but only to be reached on account of its precipitous character by a roundabout path thither she steered defying wind and snow guided by here a thorntree there an old doddered oak which had not quite lest their identity under the whelming mask of snow now and then she stopped to listen but never a word or sound heard she till right from where the copsewood grew thick and tangled at the base of the rock round which she was winding she heard a moan into the brakeall snow in appearancealmost a plain of snow looked on from the little eminence where she stoodshe plunged breaking down the bush stumbling bruising herself fighting her way her lantern held between her teeth and she herself using head as well as hands to butt away a passage at whatever cost of bodily injury as she climbed or staggered owing to the unevenness of the snowcovered ground where the briars and weeds of years were tangled and matted together her foot felt something strangely soft and yielding she lowered her lantern there lay a man prone on his face nearly covered by the fastfalling flakes he must have fallen from the rock above as not knowing of the circuitous path he had tried to descend its steep slippery face who could tell it was no time for thinking susan lifted him up with her wiry strength he gave no helpno sign of life but for all that he might be alive he was still warm she tied her maud round him she fastened the lantern to her apronstring she held him tight halfcarrying halfdraggingwhat did a few bruises signify to him compared to dear life to precious life she got him through the brake and down the path there for an instant she stopped to take breath but as if stung by the furies she pushed on again with almost superhuman strength clasping him round the waist and leaning his dead weight against the lintel of the door she tried to undo the latch but now just at this moment a trembling faintness came over her and a fearful dread took possession of herthat here on the very threshold of her home she might be found dead and buried under the snow when the farmservants came in the morning this terror stirred her up to one more effort then she and her companion were in the warmth of the quiet haven of that kitchen she laid him on the settle and sank on the floor by his side how long she remained in this swoon she could not tell not very long she judged by the fire which was still red and sullenly glowing when she came to herself she lighted the candle and bent over her late burden to ascertain if indeed he were dead she stood long gazing the man lay dead there could be no doubt about it his filmy eyes glared at her unshut but susan was not one to be affrighted by the stony aspect of death it was not that it was the bitter woeful recognition of michael hurst she was convinced he was dead but after a while she refused to believe in her conviction she stripped off his wet outergarments with trembling hurried hands she brought a blanket down from her own bed she made up the fire she swathed him in fresh warm wrappings and laid him on the flags before the fire sitting herself at his head and holding it in her lap while she tenderly wiped his loose wet hair curly still although its colour had changed from nutbrown to irongray since she had seen it last from time to time she bent over the face afresh sick and fain to believe that the flicker of the firelight was some slight convulsive motion but the dim staring eyes struck chill to her heart at last she ceased her delicate busy cares but she still held the head softly as if caressing it she thought over all the possibilities and chances in the mingled yarn of their lives that might by so slight a turn have ended far otherwise if her mothers cold had been early tended so that the responsibility as to her brothers weal or woe had not fallen upon her if the fever had not taken such rough cruel hold on will nay if mrs gale that hard worldly sister had not accompanied him on his last visit to yew nookhis very last before this fatal stormy might if she had heard his crycry uttered by these pale dead lips with such wild despairing agony not yet three hours agoo if she had but heard it sooner he might have been saved before that blind false step had precipitated him down the rock in going over this weary chain of unrealized possibilities susan learnt the force of peggys words life was short looking back upon it it seemed but yesterday since all the love of her being had been poured out and run to waste the intervening yearsthe long monotonous years that had turned her into an old woman before her timewere but a dream the labourers coming in the dawn of the winters day were surprised to see the firelight through the low kitchenwindow they knocked and hearing a moaning answer they entered fearing that something had befallen their mistress for all explanation they got these words it is michael hurst he was belated and fell down the ravens crag where does eleanor his wife live how michael hurst got to yew nook no one but susan ever knew they thought he had dragged himself there with some sore internal bruise sapping away his minuted life they could not have believed the superhuman exertion which had first sought him out and then dragged him hither only susan knew of that she gave him into the charge of her servants and went out and saddled her horse where the wind had drifted the snow on one side and the road was clear and bare she rode and rode fast where the soft deceitful heaps were massed up she dismounted and led her steed plunging in deep with fierce energy the pain at her heart urging her onwards with a sharp digging spur the gray solemn winters noon was more nightlike than the depth of summers night dimpurple brooded the low skies over the white earth as susan rode up to what had been michael hursts abode while living it was a small farmhouse carelessly kept outside slatternly tended within the pretty nelly hebthwaite was pretty still her delicate face had never suffered from any longenduring feeling if anything its expression was that of plaintive sorrow but the soft light hair had scarcely a tinge of gray the woodrose tint of complexion yet remained if not so brilliant as in youth the straight nose the small mouth were untouched by time susan felt the contrast even at that moment she knew that her own skin was weatherbeaten furrowed brownthat her teeth were gone and her hair gray and ragged and yet she was not two years older than nellyshe had not been in youth when she took account of these things nelly stood wondering at the strangeenough horsewoman who stopped and panted at the door holding her horses bridle and refusing to enter where is michael hurst asked susan at last well i cant rightly say he should have been at home last night but he was off seeing after a publichouse to be let at ulverstone for our farm does not answer and we were thinking he did not come home last night said susan cutting short the story and halfaffirming halfquestioning by way of letting in a ray of the awful light before she let it full in in its consuming wrath no hell be stopping somewhere out ulverstone ways im sure weve need of him at home for ive no one but lile tommy to help me tend the beasts things have not gone well with us and we dont keep a servant now but youre trembling all over maam youd better come in and take something warm while your horse rests thats the stabledoor to your left susan took her horse there loosened his girths and rubbed him down with a wisp of straw then she hooked about her for hay but the place was bare of feed and smelt damp and unused she went to the house thankful for the respite and got some clapbread which she mashed up in a pailful of lukewarm water every moment was a respite and yet every moment made her dread the more the task that lay before her it would be longer than she thought at first she took the saddle off and hung about her horse which seemed somehow more like a friend than anything else in the world she laid her cheek against its neck and rested there before returning to the house for the last time eleanor had brought down one of her own gowns which hung on a chair against the fire and had made her unknown visitor a cup of hot tea susan could hardly bear all these little attentions they choked her and yet she was so wet so weak with fatigue and excitement that she could neither resist by voice or by action two children stood awkwardly about puzzled at the scene and even eleanor began to wish for some explanation of who her strange visitor was youve maybe heard him speaking of me im called susan dixon nelly coloured and avoided meeting susans eye ive heard other folk speak of you he never named your name this respect of silence came like balm to susan balm not felt or heeded at the time it was applied but very grateful in its effects for all that he is at my house continued susan determined not to stop or quaver in the operationthe pain which must be inflicted at your house yew nook questioned eleanor surprised how came he therehalf jealously did he take shelter from the coming storm tell methere is somethingtell me woman he took no shelter would to god he had o would to god would to god shrieked out eleanor learning all from the woful import of those dreary eyes her cries thrilled through the house the childrens piping wailings and passionate cries on daddy daddy pierced into susans very marrow but she remained as still and tearless as the great round face upon the clock at last in a lull of crying she saidnot exactly questioning but as if partly to herself you loved him then loved him he was my husband he was the father of three bonny bairns that lie dead in grasmere churchyard i wish youd go susan dixon and let me weep without your watching me i wish youd never come near the place alas alas it would not have brought him to life i would have laid down my own to save his my life has been so very sad no one would have cared if i had died alas alas the tone in which she said this was so utterly mournful and despairing that it awed nelly into quiet for a time but byandby she said i would not turn a dog out to do it harm but the night is clear and tommy shall guide you to the red cow but oh i want to be alone if youll come back tomorrow ill be better and ill hear all and thank you for every kindness you have shown himand i do believe youve showed him kindnessthough i dont know why susan moved heavily and strangely she said somethingher words came thick and unintelligible she had had a paralytic stroke since she had last spoken she could not go even if she would nor did eleanor when she became aware of the state of the case wish her to leave she had her laid on her own bed and weeping silently all the while for her last husband she nursed susan like a sister she did not know what her guests worldly position might be and she might never be repaid but she sold many a little trifle to purchase such small comforts as susan needed susan lying still and motionless learnt much it was not a severe stroke it might be the forerunner of others yet to come but at some distance of time but for the present she recovered and regained much of her former health on her sickbed she matured her plans when she returned to yew nook she took michael hursts widow and children with her to live there and fill up the haunted hearth with living forms that should banish the ghosts and so it fell out that the latter days of susan dixons life were better than the former
