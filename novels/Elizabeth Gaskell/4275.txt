through my tears phineas fletcher chapter i the dressmakers apprentice at work there is an assizetown in one of the eastern counties which was much distinguished by the tudor sovereigns and in consequence of their favour and protection attained a degree of importance that surprises the modern traveller a hundred years ago its appearance was that of picturesque grandeur the old houses which were the temporary residences of such of the countyfamilies as contented themselves with the gaieties of a provincial town crowded the streets and gave them the irregular but noble appearance yet to be seen in the cities of belgium the sides of the streets had a quaint richness from the effect of the gables and the stacks of chimneys which cut against the blue sky above while if the eye fell lower down the attention was arrested by all kinds of projections in the shape of balcony and oriel and it was amusing to see the infinite variety of windows that had been crammed into the walls long before mr pitts days of taxation the streets below suffered from all these projections and advanced stories above they were dark and illpaved with large round jolting pebbles and with no sidepath protected by kerbstones there were no lampposts for long winter nights and no regard was paid to the wants of the middle class who neither drove about in coaches of their own nor were carried by their own men in their own sedans into the very halls of their friends the professional men and their wives the shopkeepers and their spouses and all such people walked about at considerable peril both night and day the broad unwieldy carriages hemmed them up against the houses in the narrow streets the inhospitable houses projected their flights of steps almost into the carriageway forcing pedestrians again into the danger they had avoided for twenty or thirty paces then at night the only light was derived from the glaring flaring oillamps hung above the doors of the more aristocratic mansions just allowing space for the passersby to become visible before they again disappeared into the darkness where it was no uncommon thing for robbers to be in waiting for their prey the traditions of those bygone times even to the smallest social particular enable one to understand more clearly the circumstances which contributed to the formation of character the daily life into which people are born and into which they are absorbed before they are well aware forms chains which only one in a hundred has moral strength enough to despise and to break when the right time comeswhen an inward necessity for independent individual action arises which is superior to all outward conventionalities therefore it is well to know what were the chains of daily domestic habit which were the natural leadingstrings of our forefathers before they learnt to go alone the picturesqueness of those ancient streets has departed now the astleys the dunstans the waverhamsnames of power in that districtgo up duly to london in the season and have sold their residences in the countytown fifty years ago or more and when the countytown lost its attraction for the astleys the dunstans the waverhams how could it be supposed that the domvilles the bextons and the wildes would continue to go and winter there in their secondrate houses and with their increased expenditure so the grand old houses stood empty awhile and then speculators ventured to purchase and to turn the deserted mansions into many smaller dwellings fitted for professional men or even bend your ear lower lest the shade of marmaduke first baron waverham hear into shops even that was not so very bad compared with the next innovation on the old glories the shopkeepers found out that the once fashionable street was dark and that the dingy light did not show off their goods to advantage the surgeon could not see to draw his patients teeth the lawyer had to ring for candles an hour earlier than he was accustomed to do when living in a more plebeian street in short by mutual consent the whole front of one side of the street was pulled down and rebuilt in the flat mean unrelieved style of george the third the body of the houses was too solidly grand to submit to alteration so people were occasionally surprised after passing through a commonplacelooking shop to find themselves at the foot of a grand carved oaken staircase lighted by a window of stained glass storied all over with armorial bearings up such a stairpast such a window through which the moonlight fell on her with a glory of many coloursruth hilton passed wearily one january night now many years ago i call it night but strictly speaking it was morning two oclock in the morning chimed forth the old bells of st saviours and yet more than a dozen girls still sat in the room into which ruth entered stitching away as if for very life not daring to gape or show any outward manifestation of sleepiness they only sighed a little when ruth told mrs mason the hour of the night as the result of her errand for they knew that stay up as late as they might the workhours of the next day must begin at eight and their young limbs were very weary mrs mason worked away as hard as any of them but she was older and tougher and besides the gains were hers but even she perceived that some rest was needed young ladies there will be an interval allowed of half an hour ring the bell miss sutton martha shall bring you up some bread and cheese and beer you will be so good as to eat it standingaway from the dressesand to have your hands washed ready for work when i return in half an hour said she once more very distinctly and then she left the room it was curious to watch the young girls as they instantaneously availed themselves of mrs masons absence one fat particularly heavylooking damsel laid her head on her folded arms and was asleep in a moment refusing to be wakened for her share in the frugal supper but springing up with a frightened look at the sound of mrs masons returning footstep even while it was still far off on the echoing stairs two or three others huddled over the scanty fireplace which with every possible economy of space and no attempt whatever at anything of grace or ornament was inserted in the slight flatlooking wall that had been run up by the present owner of the property to portion off this division of the grand old drawingroom of the mansion some employed the time in eating their bread and cheese with as measured and incessant a motion of the jaws and almost as stupidly placid an expression of countenance as you may see in cows ruminating in the first meadow you happen to pass some held up admiringly the beautiful balldress in progress while others examined the effect backing from the object to be criticised in the true artistic manner others stretched themselves into all sorts of postures to relieve the weary muscles one or two gave vent to all the yawns coughs and sneezes that had been pent up so long in the presence of mrs mason but ruth hilton sprang to the large old window and pressed against it as a bird presses against the bars of its cage she put back the blind and gazed into the quiet moonlight night it was doubly lightalmost as much so as dayfor everything was covered with the deep snow which had been falling silently ever since the evening before the window was in a square recess the old strange little panes of glass had been replaced by those which gave more light a little distance off the feathery branches of a larch waved softly to and fro in the scarcely perceptible nightbreeze poor old larch the time had been when it had stood in a pleasant lawn with the tender grass creeping caressingly up to its very trunk but now the lawn was divided into yards and squalid back premises and the larch was pent up and girded about with flagstones the snow lay thick on its boughs and now and then fell noiselessly down the old stables had been added to and altered into a dismal street of meanlooking houses back to back with the ancient mansions and over all these changes from grandeur to squalor bent down the purple heavens with their unchanging splendour ruth pressed her hot forehead against the cold glass and strained her aching eyes in gazing out on the lovely sky of a winters night the impulse was strong upon her to snatch up a shawl and wrapping it round her head to sally forth and enjoy the glory and time was when that impulse would have been instantly followed but now ruths eyes filled with tears and she stood quite still dreaming of the days that were gone some one touched her shoulder while her thoughts were far away remembering past january nights which had resembled this and were yet so different ruth love whispered a girl who had unwillingly distinguished herself by a long hard fit of coughing come and have some supper you dont know yet how it helps one through the night one runone blow of the fresh air would do me more good said ruth not such a night as this replied the other shivering at the very thought and why not such a night as this jenny answered ruth oh at home i have many a time run up the lane all the way to the mill just to see the icicles hang on the great wheel and when i was once out i could hardly find in my heart to come in even to mother sitting by the fireeven to mother she added in a low melancholy tone which had something of inexpressible sadness in it why jenny said she rousing herself but not before her eyes were swimming with tears own now that you never saw those dismal hateful tumbledown old houses there look half sowhat shall i call them almost beautifulas they do now with that soft pure exquisite covering and if they are so improved think of what trees and grass and ivy must be on such a night as this jenny could not be persuaded into admiring the winters night which to her came only as a cold and dismal time when her cough was more troublesome and the pain in her side worse than usual but she put her arm round ruths neck and stood by her glad that the orphan apprentice who was not yet inured to the hardship of a dressmakers workroom should find so much to give her pleasure in such a common occurrence as a frosty night they remained deep in separate trains of thought till mrs masons step was heard when each returned supperless but refreshed to her seat ruths place was the coldest and the darkest in the room although she liked it the best she had instinctively chosen it for the sake of the wall opposite to her on which was a remnant of the beauty of the old drawingroom which must once have been magnificent to judge from the faded specimen left it was divided into panels of pale seagreen picked out with white and gold and on these panels were paintedwere thrown with the careless triumphant hand of a masterthe most lovely wreaths of flowers profuse and luxuriant beyond description and so reallooking that you could almost fancy you smelt their fragrance and heard the south wind go softly rustling in and out among the crimson rosesthe branches of purple and white lilacthe floating goldentressed laburnum boughs besides these there were stately white lilies sacred to the virginhollyhocks fraxinella monkshood pansies primroses every flower which blooms profusely in charming oldfashioned country gardens was there depicted among its graceful foliage but not in the wild disorder in which i have enumerated them at the bottom of the panel lay a hollybranch whose stiff straightness was ornamented by a twining drapery of english ivy and mistletoe and winter aconite while down either side hung pendant garlands of spring and autumn flowers and crowning all came gorgeous summer with the sweet muskroses and the richcoloured flowers of june and july surely monnoyer or whoever the dead and gone artist might be would have been gratified to know the pleasure his handiwork even in its wane had power to give to the heavy heart of a young girl for they conjured up visions of other sisterflowers that grew and blossomed and withered away in her early home mrs mason was particularly desirous that her workwomen should exert themselves tonight for on the next the annual huntball was to take place it was the one gaiety of the town since the assizeballs had been discontinued many were the dresses she had promised should be sent home without fail the next morning she had not let one slip through her fingers for fear if it did it might fall into the hands of the rival dressmaker who had just established herself in the very same street she determined to administer a gentle stimulant to the flagging spirits and with a little preliminary cough to attract attention she began i may as well inform you young ladies that i have been requested this year as on previous occasions to allow some of my young people to attend in the antechamber of the assemblyroom with sandal ribbon pins and such little matters and to be ready to repair any accidental injury to the ladies dresses i shall send fourof the most diligent she laid a marked emphasis on the last words but without much effect they were too sleepy to care for any of the pomps and vanities or indeed for any of the comforts of this world excepting one sole thingtheir beds mrs mason was a very worthy woman but like many other worthy women she had her foibles and one very natural to her calling was to pay an extreme regard to appearances accordingly she had already selected in her own mind the four girls who were most likely to do credit to the establishment and these were secretly determined upon although it was very well to promise the reward to the most diligent she was really not aware of the falseness of this conduct being an adept in that species of sophistry with which people persuade themselves that what they wish to do is right at last there was no resisting the evidence of weariness they were told to go to bed but even that welcome command was languidly obeyed slowly they folded up their work heavily they moved about until at length all was put away and they trooped up the wide dark staircase oh how shall i get through five years of these terrible nights in that close room and in that oppressive stillness which lets every sound of the thread be heard as it goes eternally backwards and forwards sobbed out ruth as she threw herself on her bed without even undressing herself nay ruth you know it wont be always as it has been tonight we often get to bed by ten oclock and byandby you wont mind the closeness of the room youre worn out tonight or you would not have minded the sound of the needle i never hear it come let me unfasten you said jenny what is the use of undressing we must be up again and at work in three hours and in those three hours you may get a great deal of rest if you will but undress yourself and fairly go to bed come love jennys advice was not resisted but before ruth went to sleep she said oh i wish i was not so cross and impatient i dont think i used to be no i am sure not most new girls get impatient at first but it goes off and they dont care much for anything after awhile poor child shes asleep already said jenny to herself she could not sleep or rest the tightness at her side was worse than usual she almost thought she ought to mention it in her letters home but then she remembered the premium her father had struggled hard to pay and the large family younger than herself that had to be cared for and she determined to bear on and trust that when the warm weather came both the pain and the cough would go away she would be prudent about herself what was the matter with ruth she was crying in her sleep as if her heart would break such agitated slumber could be no rest so jenny wakened her ruth ruth oh jenny said ruth sitting up in bed and pushing back the masses of hair that were heating her forehead i thought i saw mamma by the side of the bed coming as she used to do to see if i were asleep and comfortable and when i tried to take hold of her she went away and left me alonei dont know where so strange it was only a dream you know youd been talking about her to me and youre feverish with sitting up late go to sleep again and ill watch and waken you if you seem uneasy but youll be so tired oh dear dear ruth was asleep again even while she sighed morning came and though their rest had been short the girls arose refreshed miss sutton miss jennings miss booth and miss hilton you will see that you are ready to accompany me to the shirehall by eight oclock one or two of the girls looked astonished but the majority having anticipated the selection and knowing from experience the unexpressed rule by which it was made received it with the sullen indifference which had become their feeling with regard to most eventsa deadened sense of life consequent upon their unnatural mode of existence their sedentary days and their frequent nights of late watching but to ruth it was inexplicable she had yawned and loitered and looked off at the beautiful panel and lost herself in thoughts of home until she fully expected the reprimand which at any other time she would have been sure to receive and now to her surprise she was singled out as one of the most diligent much as she longed for the delight of seeing the noble shirehallthe boast of the countyand of catching glimpses of the dancers and hearing the band much as she longed for some variety to the dull monotonous life she was leading she could not feel happy to accept a privilege granted as she believed in ignorance of the real state of the case so she startled her companions by rising abruptly and going up to mrs mason who was finishing a dress which ought to have been sent home two hours before if you please mrs mason i was not one of the most diligent i am afraidi believei was not diligent at all i was very tired and i could not help thinking and when i think i cant attend to my work she stopped believing she had sufficiently explained her meaning but mrs mason would not understand and did not wish for any further elucidation well my dear you must learn to think and work too or if you cant do both you must leave off thinking your guardian you know expects you to make great progress in your business and i am sure you wont disappoint him but that was not to the point ruth stood still an instant although mrs mason resumed her employment in a manner which any one but a new girl would have known to be intelligible enough that she did not wish for any more conversation just then but as i was not diligent i ought not to go maam miss wood was far more industrious than i and many of the others tiresome girl muttered mrs mason ive half a mind to keep her at home for plaguing me so but looking up she was struck afresh with the remarkable beauty which ruth possessed such a credit to the house with her waving outline of figure her striking face with dark eyebrows and dark lashes combined with auburn hair and a fair complexion no diligent or idle ruth hilton must appear tonight miss hilton said mrs mason with stiff dignity i am not accustomed as these young ladies can tell you to have my decisions questioned what i say i mean and i have my reasons so sit down if you please and take care and be ready by eight not a word more as she fancied she saw ruth again about to speak jenny you ought to have gone not me said ruth in no low voice to miss wood as she sat down by her hush ruth i could not go if i might because of my cough i would rather give it up to you than any one if it were mine to give and suppose it is and take the pleasure as my present and tell me every bit about it when you come home tonight well i shall take it in that way and not as if id earned it which i havent so thank you you cant think how i shall enjoy it now i did work diligently for five minutes last night after i heard of it i wanted to go so much but i could not keep it up oh dear and i shall really hear a band and see the inside of that beautiful shirehall chapter ii ruth goes to the shirehall in due time that evening mrs mason collected her young ladies for an inspection of their appearance before proceeding to the shirehall her eager important hurried manner of summoning them was not unlike that of a hen clucking her chickens together and to judge from the close investigation they had to undergo it might have been thought that their part in the evenings performance was to be far more important than that of temporary ladiesmaids is that your best frock miss hilton asked mrs mason in a halfdissatisfied tone turning ruth about for it was only her sunday black silk and was somewhat worn and shabby yes maam answered ruth quietly oh indeed then it will do still the halfsatisfied tone dress young ladies you know is a very secondary consideration conduct is everything still miss hilton i think you should write and ask your guardian to send you money for another gown i am sorry i did not think of it before i do not think he would send any if i wrote answered ruth in a low voice he was angry when i wanted a shawl when the cold weather set in mrs mason gave her a little push of dismissal and ruth fell into the ranks by her friend miss wood never mind ruthie youre prettier than any of them said a merry goodnatured girl whose plainness excluded her from any of the envy of rivalry yes i know i am pretty said ruth sadly but i am sorry i have no better gown for this is very shabby i am ashamed of it myself and i can see mrs mason is twice as much ashamed i wish i need not go i did not know we should have to think about our own dress at all or i should not have wished to go never mind ruth said jenny youve been looked at now and mrs mason will soon be too busy to think about you and your gown did you hear ruth hilton say she knew she was pretty whispered one girl to another so loudly that ruth caught the words i could not help knowing answered she simply for many people have told me so at length these preliminaries were over and they were walking briskly through the frosty air the free motion was so inspiriting that ruth almost danced along and quite forgot all about shabby gowns and grumbling guardians the shirehall was even more striking than she had expected the sides of the staircase were painted with figures that showed ghostly in the dim light for only their faces looked out of the dark dingy canvas with a strange fixed stare of expression the young milliners had to arrange their wares on tables in the anteroom and make all ready before they could venture to peep into the ballroom where the musicians were already tuning their instruments and where one or two charwomen strange contrast with their dirty loose attire and their incessant chatter to the grand echoes of the vaulted room were completing the dusting of benches and chairs they quitted the place as ruth and her companions entered they had talked lightly and merrily in the anteroom but now their voices were hushed awed by the old magnificence of the vast apartment it was so large that objects showed dim at the further end as through a mist fulllength figures of county worthies hung around in all varieties of costume from the days of holbein to the present time the lofty roof was indistinct for the lamps were not fully lighted yet while through the richlypainted gothic window at one end the moonbeams fell manytinted on the floor and mocked with their vividness the struggles of the artificial light to illuminate its little sphere high above sounded the musicians fitfully trying some strain of which they were not certain then they stopped playing and talked and their voices sounded goblinlike in their dark recess where candles were carried about in an uncertain wavering manner reminding ruth of the flickering zigzag motion of the willothewisp suddenly the room sprang into the full blaze of light and ruth felt less impressed with its appearance and more willing to obey mrs masons sharp summons to her wandering flock than she had been when it was dim and mysterious they had presently enough to do in rendering offices of assistance to the ladies who thronged in and whose voices drowned all the muffled sound of the band ruth had longed so much to hear still if one pleasure was less another was greater than she had anticipated on condition of such a number of little observances that ruth thought mrs mason would never have ended enumerating them they were allowed during the dances to stand at a sidedoor and watch and what a beautiful sight it was floating away to that bounding musicnow far away like garlands of fairies now near and showing as lovely women with every ornament of graceful dressthe elite of the county danced on little caring whose eyes gazed and were dazzled outside all was cold and colourless and uniform one coating of snow over all but inside it was warm and glowing and vivid flowers scented the air and wreathed the head and rested on the bosom as if it were midsummer bright colours flashed on the eye and were gone and succeeded by others as lovely in the rapid movement of the dance smiles dimpled every face and low tones of happiness murmured indistinctly through the room in every pause of the music ruth did not care to separate the figures that formed a joyous and brilliant whole it was enough to gaze and dream of the happy smoothness of the lives in which such music and such profusion of flowers of jewels elegance of every description and beauty of all shapes and hues were everyday things she did not want to know who the people were although to hear a catalogue of names seemed to be the great delight of most of her companions in fact the enumeration rather disturbed her and to avoid the shock of too rapid a descent into the commonplace world of miss smiths and mr thomsons she returned to her post in the anteroom there she stood thinking or dreaming she was startled back to actual life by a voice close to her one of the dancing young ladies had met with a misfortune her dress of some gossamer material had been looped up by nosegays of flowers and one of these had fallen off in the dance leaving her gown to trail to repair this she had begged her partner to bring her to the room where the assistants should have been none were there but ruth shall i leave you asked the gentleman is my absence necessary oh no replied the lady a few stitches will set all to rights besides i dare not enter that room by myself so far she spoke sweetly and prettily but now she addressed ruth make haste dont keep me an hour and her voice became cold and authoritative she was very pretty with long dark ringlets and sparkling black eyes these had struck ruth in the hasty glance she had taken before she knelt down to her task she also saw that the gentleman was young and elegant oh that lovely galop how i long to dance to it will it never be done what a frightful time you are taking and im dying to return in time for this galop by way of showing a pretty childlike impatience she began to beat time with her feet to the spirited air the band was playing ruth could not darn the rent in her dress with this continual motion and she looked up to remonstrate as she threw her head back for this purpose she caught the eye of the gentleman who was standing by it was so expressive of amusement at the airs and graces of his pretty partner that ruth was infected by the feeling and had to bend her face down to conceal the smile that mantled there but not before he had seen it and not before his attention had been thereby drawn to consider the kneeling figure that habited in black up to the throat with the noble head bent down to the occupation in which she was engaged formed such a contrast to the flippant bright artificial girl who sat to be served with an air as haughty as a queen on her throne oh mr bellingham im ashamed to detain you so long i had no idea any one could have spent so much time over a little tear no wonder mrs mason charges so much for dressmaking if her workwomen are so slow it was meant to be witty but mr bellingham looked grave he saw the scarlet colour of annoyance flush to that beautiful cheek which was partially presented to him he took a candle from the table and held it so that ruth had more light she did not look up to thank him for she felt ashamed that he should have seen the smile which she had caught from him i am sorry i have been so long maam said she gently as she finished her work i was afraid it might tear out again if i did not do it carefully she rose i would rather have had it torn than have missed that charming galop said the young lady shaking out her dress as a bird shakes its plumage shall we go mr bellingham looking up at him he was surprised that she gave no word or sign of thanks to the assistant he took up a camellia that some one had left on the table allow me miss duncombe to give this in your name to this young lady as thanks for her dexterous help ohof course said she ruth received the flower silently but with a grave modest motion of her head they had gone and she was once more alone presently her companions returned what was the matter with miss duncombe did she come here asked they only her lace dress was torn and i mended it answered ruth quietly did mr bellingham come with her they say hes going to be married to her did he come ruth yes said ruth and relapsed into silence mr bellingham danced on gaily and merrily through the night and flirted with miss duncombe as he thought good but he looked often to the sidedoor where the milliners apprentices stood and once he recognised the tall slight figure and the rich auburn hair of the girl in black and then his eye sought for the camellia it was there snowy white in her bosom and he danced on more gaily than ever the cold grey dawn was drearily lighting up the streets when mrs mason and her company returned home the lamps were extinguished yet the shutters of the shops and dwellinghouses were not opened all sounds had an echo unheard by day one or two houseless beggars sat on doorsteps and shivering slept with heads bowed on their knees or resting against the cold hard support afforded by the wall ruth felt as if a dream had melted away and she were once more in the actual world how long it would be even in the most favourable chance before she should again enter the shirehall or hear a band of music or even see again those bright happy peopleas much without any semblance of care or woe as if they belonged to another race of beings had they ever to deny themselves a wish much less a want literally and figuratively their lives seemed to wander through flowery pleasurepaths here was cold biting midwinter for her and such as herfor those poor beggars almost a season of death but to miss duncombe and her companions a happy merry time when flowers still bloomed and fires crackled and comforts and luxuries were piled around them like fairy gifts what did they know of the meaning of the word so terrific to the poor what was winter to them but ruth fancied that mr bellingham looked as if he could understand the feelings of those removed from him by circumstance and station he had drawn up the windows of his carriage it is true with a shudder ruth then had been watching him yet she had no idea that any association made her camellia precious to her she believed it was solely on account of its exquisite beauty that she tended it so carefully she told jenny every particular of its presentation with open straightlooking eye and without the deepening of a shade of colour was it not kind of him you cant think how nicely he did it just when i was a little bit mortified by her ungracious ways it was very nice indeed replied jenny such a beautiful flower i wish it had some scent i wish it to be exactly as it is it is perfect so pure said ruth almost clasping her treasure as she placed it in water who is mr bellingham he is son to that mrs bellingham of the priory for whom we made the grey satin pelisse answered jenny sleepily that was before my time said ruth but there was no answer jenny was asleep it was long before ruth followed her example even on a winter day it was clear morning light that fell upon her face as she smiled in her slumber jenny would not waken her but watched her face with admiration it was so lovely in its happiness she is dreaming of last night thought jenny it was true she was but one figure flitted more than all the rest through her visions he presented flower after flower to her in that baseless morning dream which was all too quickly ended the night before she had seen her dead mother in her sleep and she wakened weeping and now she dreamed of mr bellingham and smiled and yet was this a more evil dream than the other the realities of life seemed to cut more sharply against her heart than usual that morning the late hours of the preceding nights and perhaps the excitement of the evening before had indisposed her to bear calmly the rubs and crosses which beset all mrs masons young ladies at times for mrs mason though the first dressmaker in the county was human after all and suffered like her apprentices from the same causes that affected them this morning she was disposed to find fault with everything and everybody she seemed to have risen with the determination of putting the world and all that it contained her world at least to rights before night and abuses and negligences which had long passed unreproved or winked at were today to be dragged to light and sharply reprimanded nothing less than perfection would satisfy mrs mason at such times she had her ideas of justice too but they were not divinely beautiful and true ideas they were something more resembling a grocers or teadealers ideas of equal right a little overindulgence last night was to be balanced by a good deal of overseverity today and this manner of rectifying previous errors fully satisfied her conscience ruth was not inclined for or capable of much extra exertion and it would have tasked all her powers to have pleased her superior the workroom seemed filled with sharp calls miss hilton where have you put the blue persian whenever things are mislaid i know it has been miss hiltons evening for siding away miss hilton was going out last night so i offered to clear the workroom for her i will find it directly maam answered one of the girls oh i am well aware of miss hiltons custom of shuffling off her duties upon any one who can be induced to relieve her replied mrs mason ruth reddened and tears sprang to her eyes but she was so conscious of the falsity of the accusation that she rebuked herself for being moved by it and raising her head gave a proud look round as if in appeal to her companions where is the skirt of lady farnhams dress the flounces not put on i am surprised may i ask to whom this work was entrusted yesterday inquired mrs mason fixing her eyes on ruth i was to have done it but i made a mistake and had to undo it i am very sorry i might have guessed certainly there is little difficulty to be sure in discovering when work has been neglected or spoilt into whose hands it has fallen such were the speeches which fell to ruths share on this day of all days when she was least fitted to bear them with equanimity in the afternoon it was necessary for mrs mason to go a few miles into the country she left injunctions and orders and directions and prohibitions without end but at last she was gone and in the relief of her absence ruth laid her arms on the table and burying her head began to cry aloud with weak unchecked sobs dont cry miss hiltonruthie never mind the old dragonhow will you bear on for five years if you dont spirit yourself up not to care a straw for what she sayswere some of the modes of comfort and sympathy administered by the young workwomen jenny with a wiser insight into the grievance and its remedy said suppose ruth goes out instead of you fanny barton to do the errands the fresh air will do her good and you know you dislike the cold east winds while ruth says she enjoys frost and snow and all kinds of shivery weather fanny barton was a great sleepylooking girl huddling over the fire no one so willing as she to relinquish the walk on this bleak afternoon when the east wind blew keenly down the street drying up the very snow itself there was no temptation to come abroad for those who were not absolutely obliged to leave their warm rooms indeed the dusk hour showed that it was the usual teatime for the humble inhabitants of that part of the town through which ruth had to pass on her shopping expedition as she came to the high ground just above the river where the street sloped rapidly down to the bridge she saw the flat country beyond all covered with snow making the black dome of the cloudladen sky appear yet blacker as if the winters night had never fairly gone away but had hovered on the edge of the world all through the short bleak day down by the bridge where there was a little shelving bank used as a landingplace for any pleasureboats that could float on that shallow stream some children were playing and defying the cold one of them had got a large washingtub and with the use of a broken oar kept steering and pushing himself hither and thither in the little creek much to the admiration of his companions who stood gravely looking on immovable in their attentive observation of the hero although their faces were blue with cold and their hands crammed deep into their pockets with some faint hope of finding warmth there perhaps they feared that if they unpacked themselves from their lumpy attitudes and began to move about the cruel wind would find its way into every cranny of their tattered dress they were all huddled up and still with eyes intent on the embryo sailor at last one little man envious of the reputation that his playfellow was acquiring by his daring called out ill set thee a craddy tom thou darnt go over yon black line in the water out into the real river of course the challenge was not to be refused and tom paddled away towards the dark line beyond which the river swept with smooth steady current ruth a child in years herself stood at the top of the declivity watching the adventurer but as unconscious of any danger as the group of children below at their playfellows success they broke through the calm gravity of observation into boisterous marks of applause clapping their hands and stamping their impatient little feet and shouting well done tom thou hast done it rarely tom stood in childish dignity for a moment facing his admirers then in an instant his washingtub boat was whirled round and he lost his balance and fell out and both he and his boat were carried away slowly but surely by the strong full river which eternally moved onwards to the sea the children shrieked aloud with terror and ruth flew down to the little bay and far into its shallow waters before she felt how useless such an action was and that the sensible plan would have been to seek for efficient help hardly had this thought struck her when louder and sharper than the sullen roar of the stream that was ceaselessly and unrelentingly flowing on came the splash of a horse galloping through the water in which she was standing past her like lightningdown in the stream swimming along with the currenta stooping rideran outstretched grasping arma little life redeemed and a child saved to those who loved it ruth stood dizzy and sick with emotion while all this took place and when the rider turned his swimming horse and slowly breasted up the river to the landingplace she recognised him as the mr bellingham of the night before he carried the unconscious child across his horse the body hung in so lifeless a manner that ruth believed it was dead and her eyes were suddenly blinded with tears she waded back to the beach to the point towards which mr bellingham was directing his horse is he dead asked she stretching out her arms to receive the little fellow for she instinctively felt that the position in which he hung was not the most conducive to returning consciousness if indeed it would ever return i think not answered mr bellingham as he gave the child to her before springing off his horse is he your brother do you know who he is look said ruth who had sat down upon the ground the better to prop the poor lad his hand twitches he lives oh sir he lives whose boy is he to the people who came hurrying and gathering to the spot at the rumour of an accident hes old nelly brownsons said they her grandson we must take him into a house directly said she is his home far off no no its just close by one of you go for a doctor at once said mr bellingham authoritatively and bring him to the old womans without delay you must not hold him any longer he continued speaking to ruth and remembering her face now for the first time your dress is dripping wet already here you fellow take him up dye see but the childs hand had nervously clenched ruths dress and she would not have him disturbed she carried her heavy burden very tenderly towards a mean little cottage indicated by the neighbours an old crippled woman was coming out of the door shaking all over with agitation dear heart said she hes the last of em all and hes gone afore me nonsense said mr bellingham the boy is alive and likely to live but the old woman was helpless and hopeless and insisted on believing that her grandson was dead and dead he would have been if it had not been for ruth and one or two of the more sensible neighbours who under mr bellinghams directions bustled about and did all that was necessary until animation was restored what a confounded time these people are in fetching the doctor said mr bellingham to ruth between whom and himself a sort of silent understanding had sprung up from the circumstance of their having been the only two besides mere children who had witnessed the accident and also the only two to whom a certain degree of cultivation had given the power of understanding each others thoughts and even each others words it takes so much to knock an idea into such stupid peoples heads they stood gaping and asking which doctor they were to go for as if it signified whether it was brown or smith so long as he had his wits about him i have no more time to waste here either i was on the gallop when i caught sight of the lad and now he has fairly sobbed and opened his eyes i see no use in my staying in this stifling atmosphere may i trouble you with one thing will you be so good as to see that the little fellow has all that he wants if youll allow me ill leave you my purse continued he giving it to ruth who was only too glad to have this power entrusted to her of procuring one or two requisites which she had perceived to be wanted but she saw some gold between the network she did not like the charge of such riches i shall not want so much really sir one sovereign will be plentymore than enough may i take that out and i will give you back what is left of it when i see you again or perhaps i had better send it to you sir i think you had better keep it all at present oh what a horrid dirty place this is insufferable two minutes longer you must not stay here youll be poisoned with this abominable air come towards the door i beg well if you think one sovereign will be enough i will take my purse only remember you apply to me if you think they want more they were standing at the door where some one was holding mr bellinghams horse ruth was looking at him with her earnest eyes mrs mason and her errands quite forgotten in the interest of the afternoons event her whole thoughts bent upon rightly understanding and following out his wishes for the little boys welfare and until now this had been the first object in his own mind but at this moment the strong perception of ruths exceeding beauty came again upon him he almost lost the sense of what he was saying he was so startled into admiration the night before he had not seen her eyes and now they looked straight and innocently full at him grave earnest and deep but when she instinctively read the change in the expression of his countenance she dropped her large white veiling lids and he thought her face was lovelier still the irresistible impulse seized him to arrange matters so that he might see her again before long no said he i see it would be better that you should keep the purse many things may be wanted for the lad which we cannot calculate upon now if i remember rightly there are three sovereigns and some loose change i shall perhaps see you again in a few days when if there be any money left in the purse you can restore it to me oh yes sir said ruth alive to the magnitude of the wants to which she might have to administer and yet rather afraid of the responsibility implied in the possession of so much money is there any chance of my meeting you again in this house asked he i hope to come whenever i can sir but i must run in errandtimes and i dont know when my turn may be ohhe did not fully understand this answeri should like to know how you think the boy is going on if it is not giving you too much trouble do you ever take walks not for walkings sake sir well said he you go to church i suppose mrs mason does not keep you at work on sundays i trust oh no sir i go to church regularly then perhaps you will be so good as to tell me what church you go to and i will meet you there next sunday afternoon i go to st nicholas sir i will take care and bring you word how the boy is and what doctor they get and i will keep an account of the money i spend very well thank you remember i trust to you he meant that he relied on her promise to meet him but ruth thought that he was referring to the responsibility of doing the best she could for the child he was going away when a fresh thought struck him and he turned back into the cottage once more and addressed ruth with a half smile on his countenance it seems rather strange but we have no one to introduce us my name is bellinghamyours is ruth hilton sir she answered in a low voice for now that the conversation no longer related to the boy she felt shy and restrained he held out his hand to shake hers and just as she gave it to him the old grandmother came tottering up to ask some question the interruption jarred upon him and made him once more keenly alive to the closeness of the air and the squalor and dirt by which he was surrounded my good woman said he to nelly brownson could you not keep your place a little neater and cleaner it is more fit for pigs than human beings the air in this room is quite offensive and the dirt and filth is really disgraceful by this time he was mounted and bowing to ruth he rode away then the old womans wrath broke out who may you be that knows no better manners than to come into a poor womans house to abuse itfit for pigs indeed what dye call yon fellow he is mr bellingham said ruth shocked at the old womans apparent ingratitude it was he that rode into the water to save your grandson he would have been drowned but for mr bellingham i thought once they would both have been swept away by the current it was so strong the river is none so deep either the old woman said anxious to diminish as much as possible the obligation she was under to one who had offended her some one else would have saved him if this fine young spark had never been near hes an orphan and god watches over orphans they say id rather it had been any one else as had picked him out than one who comes into a poor bodys house only to abuse it he did not come in only to abuse it said ruth gently he came with little tom he only said it was not quite so clean as it might be what youre taking up the cry are you wait till you are an old woman like me crippled with rheumatiz and a lad to see after like tom who is always in mud when he isnt in water and his food and mine to scrape together god knows were often short and do the best i can and water to fetch up that steep brow she stopped to cough and ruth judiciously changed the subject and began to consult the old woman as to the wants of her grandson in which consultation they were soon assisted by the medical man when ruth had made one or two arrangements with a neighbour whom she asked to procure the most necessary things and had heard from the doctor that all would be right in a day or two she began to quake at the recollection of the length of time she had spent at nelly brownsons and to remember with some affright the strict watch kept by mrs mason over her apprentices outgoings and incomings on working days she hurried off to the shops and tried to recall her wandering thoughts to the respective merits of pink and blue as a match to lilac found she had lost her patterns and went home with illchosen things and in a fit of despair at her own stupidity the truth was that the afternoons adventure filled her mind only the figure of tom who was now safe and likely to do well was receding into the background and that of mr bellingham becoming more prominent than it had been his spirited and natural action of galloping into the water to save the child was magnified by ruth into the most heroic deed of daring his interest about the boy was tender thoughtful benevolence in her eyes and his careless liberality of money was fine generosity for she forgot that generosity implies some degree of selfdenial she was gratified too by the power of dispensing comfort he had entrusted to her and was busy with alnaschar visions of wise expenditure when the necessity of opening mrs masons housedoor summoned her back into actual present life and the dread of an immediate scolding for this time however she was spared but spared for such a reason that she would have been thankful for some blame in preference to her impunity during her absence jennys difficulty of breathing had suddenly become worse and the girls had on their own responsibility put her to bed and were standing round her in dismay when mrs masons return home only a few minutes before ruth arrived fluttered them back into the workroom and now all was confusion and hurry a doctor to be sent for a mind to be unburdened of directions for a dress to a forewoman who was too ill to understand scoldings to be scattered with no illiberal hand amongst a group of frightened girls hardly sparing the poor invalid herself for her inopportune illness in the middle of all this turmoil ruth crept quietly to her place with a heavy saddened heart at the indisposition of the gentle forewoman she would gladly have nursed jenny herself and often longed to do it but she could not be spared hands unskilful in fine and delicate work would be well enough qualified to tend the sick until the mother arrived from home meanwhile extra diligence was required in the workroom and ruth found no opportunity of going to see little tom or to fulfil the plans for making him and his grandmother more comfortable which she had proposed to herself she regretted her rash promise to mr bellingham of attending to the little boys welfare all that she could do was done by means of mrs masons servant through whom she made inquiries and sent the necessary help the subject of jennys illness was the prominent one in the house ruth told of her own adventure to be sure but when she was at the very crisis of the boys fall into the river the more fresh and vivid interest of some tidings of jenny was brought into the room and ruth ceased almost blaming herself for caring for anything besides the question of life or death to be decided in that very house then a pale gentlelooking woman was seen moving softly about and it was whispered that this was the mother come to nurse her child everybody liked her she was so sweetlooking and gave so little trouble and seemed so patient and so thankful for any inquiries about her daughter whose illness it was understood although its severity was mitigated was likely to be long and tedious while all the feelings and thoughts relating to jenny were predominant sunday arrived mrs mason went the accustomed visit to her fathers making some little show of apology to mrs wood for leaving her and her daughter the apprentices dispersed to the various friends with whom they were in the habit of spending the day and ruth went to st nicholas with a sorrowful heart depressed on account of jenny and selfreproachful at having rashly undertaken what she had been unable to perform as she came out of church she was joined by mr bellingham she had half hoped that he might have forgotten the arrangement and yet she wished to relieve herself of her responsibility she knew his step behind her and the contending feelings made her heart beat hard and she longed to run away miss hilton i believe said he overtaking her and bowing forward so as to catch a sight of her rosered face how is our little sailor going on well i trust from the symptoms the other day i believe sir he is quite well now i am very sorry but i have not been able to go and see him i am so sorryi could not help it but i have got one or two things through another person i have put them down on this slip of paper and here is your purse sir for i am afraid i can do nothing more for him we have illness in the house and it makes us very busy ruth had been so much accustomed to blame of late that she almost anticipated some remonstrance or reproach now for not having fulfilled her promise better she little guessed that mr bellingham was far more busy trying to devise some excuse for meeting her again during the silence that succeeded her speech than displeased with her for not bringing a more particular account of the little boy in whom he had ceased to feel any interest she repeated after a minutes pause i am very sorry i have done so little sir oh yes i am sure you have done all you could it was thoughtless in me to add to your engagements he is displeased with me thought ruth for what he believes to have been neglect of the boy whose life he risked his own to save if i told all he would see that i could not do more but i cannot tell him all the sorrows and worries that have taken up my time and yet i am tempted to give you another little commission if it is not taking up too much of your time and presuming too much on your goodnature said he a bright idea having just struck him mrs mason lives in heneage place does not she my mothers ancestors lived there and once when the house was being repaired she took me in to show me the old place there was an old huntingpiece painted on a panel over one of the chimneypieces the figures were portraits of my ancestors i have often thought i should like to purchase it if it still remained there can you ascertain this for me and bring me word next sunday oh yes sir said ruth glad that this commission was completely within her power to execute and anxious to make up for her previous seeming neglect ill look directly i get home and ask mrs mason to write and let you know thank you said he only half satisfied i think perhaps however it might be as well not to trouble mrs mason about it you see it would compromise me and i am not quite determined to purchase the picture if you would ascertain whether the painting is there and tell me i would take a little time to reflect and afterwards i could apply to mrs mason myself very well sir i will see about it so they parted before the next sunday mrs wood had taken her daughter to her distant home to recruit in that quiet place ruth watched her down the street from an upper window and sighing deep and long returned to the workroom whence the warning voice and the gentle wisdom had departed chapter iii sunday at mrs masons mr bellingham attended afternoon service at st nicholas church the next sunday his thoughts had been far more occupied by ruth than hers by him although his appearance upon the scene of her life was more an event to her than it was to him he was puzzled by the impression she had produced on him though he did not in general analyse the nature of his feelings but simply enjoyed them with the delight which youth takes in experiencing new and strong emotion he was old compared to ruth but young as a man hardly threeandtwenty the fact of his being an only child had given him as it does to many a sort of inequality in those parts of the character which are usually formed by the number of years that a person has lived the unevenness of discipline to which only children are subjected the thwarting resulting from overanxiety the indiscreet indulgence arising from a love centred all in one object had been exaggerated in his education probably from the circumstance that his mother his only surviving parent had been similarly situated to himself he was already in possession of the comparatively small property he inherited from his father the estate on which his mother lived was her own and her income gave her the means of indulging or controlling him after he had grown to mans estate as her wayward disposition and her love of power prompted her had he been doubledealing in his conduct towards her had he condescended to humour her in the least her passionate love for him would have induced her to strip herself of all her possessions to add to his dignity or happiness but although he felt the warmest affection for her the regardlessness which she had taught him by example perhaps more than by precept of the feelings of others was continually prompting him to do things that she for the time being resented as mortal affronts he would mimic the clergyman she specially esteemed even to his very face he would refuse to visit her schools for months and months and when wearied into going at last revenge himself by puzzling the children with the most ridiculous questions gravely put that he could imagine all these boyish tricks annoyed and irritated her far more than the accounts which reached her of more serious misdoings at college and in town of these grave offences she never spoke of the smaller misdeeds she hardly ever ceased speaking still at times she had great influence over him and nothing delighted her more than to exercise it the submission of his will to hers was sure to be liberally rewarded for it gave her great happiness to extort from his indifference or his affection the concessions which she never sought by force of reason or by appeals to principleconcessions which he frequently withheld solely for the sake of asserting his independence of her control she was anxious for him to marry miss duncombe he cared little or nothing about itit was time enough to be married ten years hence and so he was dawdling through some months of his lifesometimes flirting with the nothingloath miss duncombe sometimes plaguing and sometimes delighting his mother at all times taking care to please himselfwhen he first saw ruth hilton and a new passionate hearty feeling shot through his whole being he did not know why he was so fascinated by her she was very beautiful but he had seen others equally beautiful and with many more agaceries calculated to set off the effect of their charms there was perhaps something bewitching in the union of the grace and loveliness of womanhood with the naivete simplicity and innocence of an intelligent child there was a spell in the shyness which made her avoid and shun all admiring approaches to acquaintance it would be an exquisite delight to attract and tame her wildness just as he had often allured and tamed the timid fawns in his mothers park by no overbold admiration or rash passionate word would he startle her and surely in time she might be induced to look upon him as a friend if not something nearer and dearer still in accordance with this determination he resisted the strong temptation of walking by her side the whole distance home after church he only received the intelligence she brought respecting the panel with thanks spoke a few words about the weather bowed and was gone ruth believed she should never see him again and in spite of sundry selfupbraidings for her folly she could not help feeling as if a shadow were drawn over her existence for several days to come mrs mason was a widow and had to struggle for the sake of the six or seven children left dependent on her exertions thus there was some reason and great excuse for the pinching economy which regulated her household affairs on sundays she chose to conclude that all her apprentices had friends who would be glad to see them to dinner and give them a welcome reception for the remainder of the day while she and those of her children who were not at school went to spend the day at her fathers house several miles out of the town accordingly no dinner was cooked on sundays for the young workwomen no fires were lighted in any rooms to which they had access on this morning they breakfasted in mrs masons own parlour after which the room was closed against them through the day by some understood though unspoken prohibition what became of such as ruth who had no home and no friends in that large populous desolate town she had hitherto commissioned the servant who went to market on saturdays for the family to buy her a bun or biscuit whereon she made her fasting dinner in the deserted workroom sitting in her walkingdress to keep off the cold which clung to her in spite of shawl and bonnet then she would sit at the window looking out on the dreary prospect till her eyes were often blinded by tears and partly to shake off thoughts and recollections the indulgence in which she felt to be productive of no good and partly to have some ideas to dwell upon during the coming week beyond those suggested by the constant view of the same room she would carry her bible and place herself in the windowseat on the wide landing which commanded the street in front of the house from thence she could see the irregular grandeur of the place she caught a view of the grey churchtower rising hoary and massive into midair she saw one or two figures loiter along on the sunny side of the street in all the enjoyment of their fine clothes and sunday leisure and she imagined histories for them and tried to picture to herself their homes and their daily doings and before long the bells swung heavily in the churchtower and struck out with musical clang the first summons to afternoon church after church was over she used to return home to the same windowseat and watch till the winter twilight was over and gone and the stars came out over the black masses of houses and then she would steal down to ask for a candle as a companion to her in the deserted workroom occasionally the servant would bring her up some tea but of late ruth had declined taking any as she had discovered she was robbing the kindhearted creature of part of the small provision left out for her by mrs mason she sat on hungry and cold trying to read her bible and to think the old holy thoughts which had been her childish meditations at her mothers knee until one after another the apprentices returned weary with their days enjoyment and their weeks late watching too weary to make her in any way a partaker of their pleasure by entering into details of the manner in which they had spent their day and last of all mrs mason returned and summoning her young people once more into the parlour she read a prayer before dismissing them to bed she always expected to find them all in the house when she came home but asked no questions as to their proceedings through the day perhaps because she dreaded to hear that one or two had occasionally nowhere to go and that it would be sometimes necessary to order a sundays dinner and leave a lighted fire on that day for five months ruth had been an inmate at mrs masons and such had been the regular order of the sundays while the forewoman stayed there it is true she was ever ready to give ruth the little variety of hearing of recreations in which she was no partaker and however tired jenny might be at night she had ever some sympathy to bestow on ruth for the dull length of day she had passed after her departure the monotonous idleness of the sunday seemed worse to bear than the incessant labour of the workdays until the time came when it seemed to be a recognised hope in her mind that on sunday afternoons she should see mr bellingham and hear a few words from him as from a friend who took an interest in her thoughts and proceedings during the past week ruths mother had been the daughter of a poor curate in norfolk and early left without parents or home she was thankful to marry a respectable farmer a good deal older than herself after their marriage however everything seemed to go wrong mrs hilton fell into a delicate state of health and was unable to bestow the everwatchful attention to domestic affairs so requisite in a farmers wife her husband had a series of misfortunesof a more important kind than the death of a whole brood of turkeys from getting among the nettles or the year of bad cheeses spoilt by a careless dairymaidwhich were the consequences so the neighbours said of mr hiltons mistake in marrying a delicate fine lady his crops failed his horses died his barn took fire in short if he had been in any way a remarkable character one might have supposed him to be the object of an avenging fate so successive were the evils which pursued him but as he was only a somewhat commonplace farmer i believe we must attribute his calamities to some want in his character of the one quality required to act as keystone to many excellences while his wife lived all worldly misfortunes seemed as nothing to him her strong sense and lively faculty of hope upheld him from despair her sympathy was always ready and the invalids room had an atmosphere of peace and encouragement which affected all who entered it but when ruth was about twelve one morning in the busy haytime mrs hilton was left alone for some hours this had often happened before nor had she seemed weaker than usual when they had gone forth to the field but on their return with merry voices to fetch the dinner prepared for the haymakers they found an unusual silence brooding over the house no low voice called out gently to welcome them and ask after the days progress and on entering the little parlour which was called mrs hiltons and was sacred to her they found her lying dead on her accustomed sofa quite calm and peaceful she lay there had been no struggle at last the struggle was for the survivors and one sank under it her husband did not make much ado at firstat least not in outward show her memory seemed to keep in check all external violence of grief but day by day dating from his wifes death his mental powers decreased he was still a halelooking elderly man and his bodily health appeared as good as ever but he sat for hours in his easychair looking into the fire not moving nor speaking unless when it was absolutely necessary to answer repeated questions if ruth with coaxings and draggings induced him to come out with her he went with measured steps around his fields his head bent to the ground with the same abstracted unseeing look never smilingnever changing the expression of his face not even to one of deeper sadness when anything occurred which might be supposed to remind him of his dead wife but in this abstraction from all outward things his worldly affairs went ever lower down he paid money away or received it as if it had been so much water the gold mines of potosi could not have touched the deep grief of his soul but god in his mercy knew the sure balm and sent the beautiful messenger to take the weary one home after his death the creditors were the chief people who appeared to take any interest in the affairs and it seemed strange to ruth to see people whom she scarcely knew examining and touching all that she had been accustomed to consider as precious and sacred her father had made his will at her birth with the pride of newly and lateacquired paternity he had considered the office of guardian to his little darling as one which would have been an additional honour to the lordlieutenant of the county but as he had not the pleasure of his lordships acquaintance he selected the person of most consequence amongst those whom he did know not any very ambitious appointment in those days of comparative prosperity but certainly the flourishing maltster of skelton was a little surprised when fifteen years later he learnt that he was executor to a will bequeathing many vanished hundreds of pounds and guardian to a young girl whom he could not remember ever to have seen he was a sensible hardheaded man of the world having a very fair proportion of conscience as consciences go indeed perhaps more than many people for he had some ideas of duty extending to the circle beyond his own family and did not as some would have done decline acting altogether but speedily summoned the creditors examined into the accounts sold up the farmingstock and discharged all the debts paid about l into the skelton bank for a week while he inquired for a situation or apprenticeship of some kind for poor heartbroken ruth heard of mrs masons arranged all with her in two short conversations drove over for ruth in his gig waited while she and the old servant packed up her clothes and grew very impatient while she ran with her eyes streaming with tears round the garden tearing off in a passion of love whole boughs of favourite china and damask roses late flowering against the casementwindow of what had been her mothers room when she took her seat in the gig she was little able even if she had been inclined to profit by her guardians lectures on economy and selfreliance but she was quiet and silent looking forward with longing to the nighttime when in her bedroom she might give way to all her passionate sorrow at being wrenched from the home where she had lived with her parents in that utter absence of any anticipation of change which is either the blessing or the curse of childhood but at night there were four other girls in her room and she could not cry before them she watched and waited till one by one they dropped off to sleep and then she buried her face in the pillow and shook with sobbing grief and then she paused to conjure up with fond luxuriance every recollection of the happy days so little valued in their uneventful peace while they lasted so passionately regretted when once gone for ever to remember every look and word of the dear mother and to moan afresh over the change caused by her deaththe first clouding in of ruths day of life it was jennys sympathy on this first night when awakened by ruths irrepressible agony that had made the bond between them but ruths loving disposition continually sending forth fibres in search of nutriment found no other object for regard among those of her daily life to compensate for the want of natural ties but almost insensibly jennys place in ruths heart was filled up there was some one who listened with tender interest to all her little revelations who questioned her about her early days of happiness and in return spoke of his own childhoodnot so golden in reality as ruths but more dazzling when recounted with stories of the beautiful creamcoloured arabian pony and the old picturegallery in the house and avenues and terraces and fountains in the garden for ruth to paint with all the vividness of imagination as scenery and background for the figure which was growing by slow degrees most prominent in her thoughts it must not be supposed that this was effected all at once though the intermediate stages have been passed over on sunday mr bellingham only spoke to her to receive the information about the panel nor did he come to st nicholas the next nor yet the following sunday but the third he walked by her side a little way and seeing her annoyance he left her and then she wished for him back again and found the day very dreary and wondered why a strange undefined feeling had made her imagine she was doing wrong in walking alongside of one so kind and good as mr bellingham it had been very foolish of her to be selfconscious all the time and if ever he spoke to her again she would not think of what people might say but enjoy the pleasure which his kind words and evident interest in her might give then she thought it was very likely he never would notice her again for she knew she had been very rude with her short answers it was very provoking that she had behaved so rudely she should be sixteen in another month and she was still childish and awkward thus she lectured herself after parting with mr bellingham and the consequence was that on the following sunday she was ten times as blushing and conscious and mr bellingham thought ten times more beautiful than ever he suggested that instead of going straight home through highstreet she should take the round by the leasowes at first she declined but then suddenly wondering and questioning herself why she refused a thing which was as far as reason and knowledge her knowledge went so innocent and which was certainly so tempting and pleasant she agreed to go the round and when she was once in the meadows that skirted the town she forgot all doubt and awkwardnessnay almost forgot the presence of mr bellinghamin her delight at the new tender beauty of an early spring day in february among the last years brown ruins heaped together by the wind in the hedgerows she found the fresh green crinkled leaves and pale starlike flowers of the primroses here and there a golden celandine made brilliant the sides of the little brook that full of water in february filldyke bubbled along by the side of the path the sun was low in the horizon and once when they came to a higher part of the leasowes ruth burst into an exclamation of delight at the evening glory of mellow light which was in the sky behind the purple distance while the brown leafless woods in the foreground derived an almost metallic lustre from the golden mist and haze of the sunset it was but threequarters of a mile round by the meadows but somehow it took them an hour to walk it ruth turned to thank mr bellingham for his kindness in taking her home by this beautiful way but his look of admiration at her glowing animated face made her suddenly silent and hardly wishing him goodbye she quickly entered the house with a beating happy agitated heart how strange it is she thought that evening that i should feel as if this charming afternoons walk were somehow not exactly wrong but yet as if it were not right why can it be i am not defrauding mrs mason of any of her time that i know would be wrong i am left to go where i like on sundays i have been to church so it cant be because i have missed doing my duty if i had gone this walk with jenny i wonder whether i should have felt as i do now there must be something wrong in me myself to feel so guilty when i have done nothing which is not right and yet i can thank god for the happiness i have had in this charming spring walk which dear mamma used to say was a sign when pleasures were innocent and good for us she was not conscious as yet that mr bellinghams presence had added any charm to the ramble and when she might have become aware of this as week after week sunday after sunday loitering ramble after loitering ramble succeeded each other she was too much absorbed with one set of thoughts to have much inclination for selfquestioning tell me everything ruth as you would to a brother let me help you if i can in your difficulties he said to her one afternoon and he really did try to understand and to realise how an insignificant and paltry person like mason the dressmaker could be an object of dread and regarded as a person having authority by ruth he flamed up with indignation when by way of impressing him with mrs masons power and consequence ruth spoke of some instance of the effects of her employers displeasure he declared his mother should never have a gown made again by such a tyrantsuch a mrs brownrigg that he would prevent all his acquaintances from going to such a cruel dressmaker till ruth was alarmed at the threatened consequences of her onesided account and pleaded for mrs mason as earnestly as if a young mans menace of this description were likely to be literally fulfilled indeed sir i have been very wrong if you please sir dont be so angry she is often very good to us it is only sometimes she goes into a passion and we are very provoking i dare say i know i am for one i have often to undo my work and you cant think how it spoils anything particularly silk to be unpicked and mrs mason has to bear all the blame oh i am sorry i said anything about it dont speak to your mother about it pray sir mrs mason thinks so much of mrs bellinghams custom well i wont this timerecollecting that there might be some awkwardness in accounting to his mother for the means by which he had obtained his very correct information as to what passed in mrs masons workroombut if ever she does so again ill not answer for myself i will take care and not tell again sir said ruth in a low voice nay ruth you are not going to have secrets from me are you dont you remember your promise to consider me as a brother go on telling me everything that happens to you pray you cannot think how much interest i take in all your interests i can quite fancy that charming home at milham you told me about last sunday i can almost fancy mrs masons workroom and that surely is a proof either of the strength of my imagination or of your powers of description ruth smiled it is indeed sir our workroom must be so different to anything you ever saw i think you must have passed through milham often on your way to lowford then you dont think it is any stretch of fancy to have so clear an idea as i have of milham grange on the left hand of the road is it ruth yes sir just over the bridge and up the hill where the elmtrees meet overhead and make a green shade and then comes the dear old grange that i shall never see again never nonsense ruthie it is only six miles off you may see it any day it is not an hours ride perhaps i may see it again when i am grown old i did not think exactly what never meant it is so very long since i was there and i dont see any chance of my going for years and years at any rate why ruth youwe may go next sunday afternoon if you like she looked up at him with a lovely light of pleasure in her face at the idea how sir can i walk it between afternoon service and the time mrs mason comes home i would go for only one glimpse but if i could get into the houseoh sir if i could just see mammas room again he was revolving plans in his head for giving her this pleasure and he had also his own in view if they went in any of his carriages the loitering charm of the walk would be lost and they must to a certain degree be encumbered by and exposed to the notice of servants are you a good walker ruth do you think you can manage six miles if we set off at two oclock we shall be there by four without hurrying or say halfpast four then we might stay two hours and you could show me all the old walks and old places you love and we could still come leisurely home oh its all arranged directly but do you think it would be right sir it seems as if it would be such a great pleasure that it must be in some way wrong why you little goose what can be wrong in it in the first place i miss going to church by setting out at two said ruth a little gravely only for once surely you dont see any harm in missing church for once you will go in the morning you know i wonder if mrs mason would think it rightif she would allow it no i dare say not but you dont mean to be governed by mrs masons notions of right and wrong she thought it right to treat that poor girl palmer in the way you told me about you would think that wrong you know and so would every one of sense and feeling come ruth dont pin your faith on any one but judge for yourself the pleasure is perfectly innocent it is not a selfish pleasure either for i shall enjoy it to the full as much as you will i shall like to see the places where you spent your childhood i shall almost love them as much as you do he had dropped his voice and spoke in low persuasive tones ruth hung down her head and blushed with exceeding happiness but she could not speak even to urge her doubts afresh thus it was in a manner settled how delightfully happy the plan made her through the coming week she was too young when her mother died to have received any cautions or words of advice respecting the subject of a womans lifeif indeed wise parents ever directly speak of what in its depth and power cannot be put into wordswhich is a brooding spirit with no definite form or shape that men should know it but which is there and present before we have recognised and realised its existence ruth was innocent and snowpure she had heard of falling in love but did not know the signs and symptoms thereof nor indeed had she troubled her head much about them sorrow had filled up her days to the exclusion of all lighter thoughts than the consideration of present duties and the remembrance of the happy time which had been but the interval of blank after the loss of her mother and during her fathers lifeindeath had made her all the more ready to value and cling to sympathyfirst from jenny and now from mr bellingham to see her home again and to see it with him to show him secure of his interest the haunts of former times each with its little tale of the pastof dead and gone eventsno coming shadow threw its gloom over this weeks dream of happinessa dream which was too bright to be spoken about to common and indifferent ears chapter iv treading in perilous places sunday came as brilliant as if there were no sorrow or death or guilt in the world a day or two of rain had made the earth fresh and brave as the blue heavens above ruth thought it was too strong a realisation of her hopes and looked for an overclouding at noon but the glory endured and at two oclock she was in the leasowes with a beating heart full of joy longing to stop the hours which would pass too quickly through the afternoon they sauntered through the fragrant lanes as if their loitering would prolong the time and check the fieryfooted steeds galloping apace towards the close of the happy day it was past five oclock before they came to the great millwheel which stood in sabbath idleness motionless in a brown mass of shade and still wet with yesterdays immersion in the deep transparent water beneath they clambered the little hill not yet fully shaded by the overarching elms and then ruth checked mr bellingham by a slight motion of the hand which lay within his arm and glanced up into his face to see what that face should express as it looked on milham grange now lying still and peaceful in its afternoon shadows it was a house of afterthoughts building materials were plentiful in the neighbourhood and every successive owner had found a necessity for some addition or projection till it was a picturesque mass of irregularityof broken light and shadowwhich as a whole gave a full and complete idea of a home all its gables and nooks were blended and held together by the tender green of the climbing roses and young creepers an old couple were living in the house until it should be let but they dwelt in the back part and never used the front door so the little birds had grown tame and familiar and perched upon the windowsills and porch and on the old stone cistern which caught the water from the roof they went silently through the untrimmed garden full of the palecoloured flowers of spring a spider had spread her web over the front door the sight of this conveyed a sense of desolation to ruths heart she thought it was possible the state entrance had never been used since her fathers dead body had been borne forth and without speaking a word she turned abruptly away and went round the house to another door mr bellingham followed without questioning little understanding her feelings but full of admiration for the varying expression called out upon her face the old woman had not yet returned from church or from the weekly gossip or neighbourly tea which succeeded the husband sat in the kitchen spelling the psalms for the day in his prayerbook and reading the words out alouda habit he had acquired from the double solitude of his life for he was deaf he did not hear the quiet entrance of the pair and they were struck with the sort of ghostly echo which seems to haunt halffurnished and uninhabited houses the verses he was reading were the following why art thou so vexed o my soul and why art thou so disquieted within me o put thy trust in god for i will yet thank him which is the help of my countenance and my god and when he had finished he shut the book and sighed with the satisfaction of having done his duty the words of holy trust though perhaps they were not fully understood carried a faithful peace down into the depths of his soul as he looked up he saw the young couple standing on the middle of the floor he pushed his ironrimmed spectacles on to his forehead and rose to greet the daughter of his old master and everhonoured mistress god bless thee lass god bless thee my old eyes are glad to see thee again ruth sprang forward to shake the horny hand stretched forward in the action of blessing she pressed it between both of hers as she rapidly poured out questions mr bellingham was not altogether comfortable at seeing one whom he had already begun to appropriate as his own so tenderly familiar with a hardfeatured meanlydressed daylabourer he sauntered to the window and looked out into the grassgrown farmyard but he could not help overhearing some of the conversation which seemed to him carried on too much in the tone of equality and whos yon asked the old labourer at last is he your sweetheart your mississ son i reckon hes a spruce young chap anyhow mr bellinghams blood of all the howards rose and tingled about his ears so that he could not hear ruths answer it began by hush thomas pray hush but how it went on he did not catch the idea of his being mrs masons son it was really too ridiculous but like most things which are too ridiculous it made him very angry he was hardly himself again when ruth shyly came to the windowrecess and asked him if he would like to see the houseplace into which the front door entered many people thought it very pretty she said half timidly for his face had unconsciously assumed a hard and haughty expression which he could not instantly soften down he followed her however but before he left the kitchen he saw the old man standing looking at ruths companion with a strange grave air of dissatisfaction they went along one or two zigzag dampsmelling stone passages and then entered the houseplace or common sittingroom for a farmers family in that part of the country the front door opened into it and several other apartments issued out of it such as the dairy the state bedroom which was halfparlour as well and a small room which had been appropriated to the late mrs hilton where she sat or more frequently lay commanding through the open door the comings and goings of her household in those days the houseplace had been a cheerful room full of life with the passing to and fro of husband child and servants with a great merry wood fire crackling and blazing away every evening and hardly let out in the very heat of summer for with the thick stone walls and the deep windowseats and the drapery of vineleaves and ivy that room with its flagfloor seemed always to want the sparkle and cheery warmth of a fire but now the green shadows from without seemed to have become black in the uninhabited desolation the oaken shovelboard the heavy dresser and the carved cupboards were now dull and damp which were formerly polished up to the brightness of a lookingglass where the fireblaze was for ever glinting they only added to the oppressive gloom the flagfloor was wet with heavy moisture ruth stood gazing into the room seeing nothing of what was present she saw a vision of former daysan evening in the days of her childhood her father sitting in the masters corner near the fire sedately smoking his pipe while he dreamily watched his wife and child her mother reading to her as she sat on a little stool at her feet it was goneall gone into the land of shadows but for the moment it seemed so present in the old room that ruth believed her actual life to be the dream then still silent she went on into her mothers parlour but there the bleak look of what had once been full of peace and mothers love struck cold on her heart she uttered a cry and threw herself down by the sofa hiding her face in her hands while her frame quivered with her repressed sobs dearest ruth dont give way so it can do no good it cannot bring back the dead said mr bellingham distressed at witnessing her distress i know it cannot murmured ruth and that is why i cry i cry because nothing will ever bring them back again she sobbed afresh but more gently for his kind words soothed her and softened if they could not take away her sense of desolation come away i cannot have you stay here full of painful associations as these rooms must be comeraising her with gentle violenceshow me your little garden you have often told me about near the window of this very room is it not see how well i remember everything you tell me he led her round through the back part of the house into the pretty oldfashioned garden there was a sunny border just under the windows and clipped box and yewtrees by the grassplat further away from the house and she prattled again of her childish adventures and solitary plays when they turned round they saw the old man who had hobbled out with the help of his stick and was looking at them with the same grave sad look of anxiety mr bellingham spoke rather sharply why does that old man follow us about in that way it is excessively impertinent of him i think oh dont call old thomas impertinent he is so good and kind he is like a father to me i remember sitting on his knee many and many a time when i was a child whilst he told me stories out of the pilgrims progress he taught me to suck up milk through a straw mamma was very fond of him too he used to sit with us always in the evenings when papa was away at market for mamma was rather afraid of having no man in the house and used to beg old thomas to stay and he would take me on his knee and listen just as attentively as i did while mamma read aloud you dont mean to say you have sat upon that old fellows knee oh yes many and many a time mr bellingham looked graver than he had done while witnessing ruths passionate emotion in her mothers room but he lost his sense of indignity in admiration of his companion as she wandered among the flowers seeking for favourite bushes or plants to which some history or remembrance was attached she wound in and out in natural graceful wavy lines between the luxuriant and overgrown shrubs which were fragrant with a leafy smell of spring growth she went on careless of watching eyes indeed unconscious for the time of their existence once she stopped to take hold of a spray of jessamine and softly kiss it it had been her mothers favourite flower old thomas was standing by the horsemount and was also an observer of all her goingson but while mr bellinghams feeling was that of passionate admiration mingled with a selfish kind of love the old man gazed with tender anxiety and his lips moved in words of blessing shes a pretty creature with a glint of her mother about her and shes the same kind lass as ever not a bit set up with yon fine mantymakers shop shes in i misdoubt that young fellow though for all she called him a real gentleman and checked me when i asked if he was her sweetheart if his are not sweethearts looks ive forgotten all my young days here theyre going i suppose look he wants her to go without a word to the old man but she is none so changed as that i reckon not ruth indeed she never perceived the dissatisfied expression of mr bellinghams countenance visible to the old mans keen eye but came running up to thomas to send her love to his wife and to shake him many times by the hand tell mary ill make her such a fine gown as soon as ever i set up for myself it shall be all in the fashion big gigot sleeves that she shall not know herself in them mind you tell her that thomas will you aye that i will lass and i reckon shell be pleased to hear thou hast not forgotten thy old merry ways the lord bless theethe lord lift up the light of his countenance upon thee ruth was halfway towards the impatient mr bellingham when her old friend called her back he longed to give her a warning of the danger that he thought she was in and yet he did not know how when she came up all he could think of to say was a text indeed the language of the bible was the language in which he thought whenever his ideas went beyond practical everyday life into expressions of emotion or feeling my dear remember the devil goeth about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour remember that ruth the words fell on her ear but gave no definite idea the utmost they suggested was the remembrance of the dread she felt as a child when this verse came into her mind and how she used to imagine a lions head with glaring eyes peering out of the bushes in a dark shady part of the wood which for this reason she had always avoided and even now could hardly think of without a shudder she never imagined that the grim warning related to the handsome young man who awaited her with a countenance beaming with love and tenderly drew her hand within his arm the old man sighed as he watched them away the lord may help her to guide her steps aright he may but im afeard shes treading in perilous places ill put my missis up to going to the town and getting speech of her and telling her a bit of her danger an old motherly woman like our mary will set about it better nor a stupid fellow like me the poor old labourer prayed long and earnestly that night for ruth he called it wrestling for her soul and i think his prayers were heard for god judgeth not as man judgeth ruth went on her way all unconscious of the dark phantoms of the future that were gathering around her her melancholy turned with the pliancy of childish years at sixteen not yet lost into a softened manner which was infinitely charming byandby she cleared up into sunny happiness the evening was still and full of mellow light and the newborn summer was so delicious that in common with all young creatures she shared its influence and was glad they stood together at the top of a steep ascent the hill of the hundred at the summit there was a level space sixty or seventy yards square of unenclosed and broken ground over which the golden bloom of the gorse cast a rich hue while its delicious scent perfumed the fresh and nimble air on one side of this common the ground sloped down to a clear bright pond in which were mirrored the rough sandcliffs that rose abrupt on the opposite bank hundreds of martens found a home there and were now wheeling over the transparent water and dipping in their wings in their evening sport indeed all sorts of birds seemed to haunt the lonely pool the waterwagtails were scattered around its margin the linnets perched on the topmost sprays of the gorsebushes and other hidden warblers sang their vespers on the uneven ground beyond on the far side of the green waste close by the road and well placed for the requirements of horses or their riders who might be weary with the ascent of the hill there was a publichouse which was more of a farm than an inn it was a long low building rich in dormerwindows on the weather side which were necessary in such an exposed situation and with odd projections and unlookedfor gables on every side there was a deep porch in front on whose hospitable benches a dozen persons might sit and enjoy the balmy air a noble sycamore grew right before the house with seats all round it such tents the patriarchs loved and a nondescript sign hung from a branch on the side next to the road which being wisely furnished with an interpretation was found to mean king charles in the oak near this comfortable quiet unfrequented inn there was another pond for household and farmyard purposes from which the cattle were drinking before returning to the fields after they had been milked their very motions were so lazy and slow that they served to fill up the mind with the sensation of dreamy rest ruth and mr bellingham plunged through the broken ground to regain the road near the wayside inn handinhand now pricked by the farspreading gorse now ankledeep in sand now pressing the soft thick heath which should make so brave an autumn show and now over wild thyme and other fragrant herbs they made their way with many a merry laugh once on the road at the summit ruth stood silent in breathless delight at the view before her the hill fell suddenly down into the plain extending for a dozen miles or more there was a clump of dark scotch firs close to them which cut clear against the western sky and threw back the nearest levels into distance the plain below them was richly wooded and was tinted by the young tender hues of the earliest summer for all the trees of the wood had donned their leaves except the cautious ash which here and there gave a soft pleasant greyness to the landscape far away in the champaign were spires and towers and stacks of chimneys belonging to some distant hidden farmhouse which were traced downwards through the golden air by the thin columns of blue smoke sent up from the evening fires the view was bounded by some rising ground in deep purple shadow against the sunset sky when first they stopped silent with sighing pleasure the air seemed full of pleasant noises distant churchbells made harmonious music with the little singingbirds near at hand nor were the lowings of the cattle nor the calls of the farmservants discordant for the voices seemed to be hushed by the brooding consciousness of the sabbath they stood loitering before the house quietly enjoying the view the clock in the little inn struck eight and it sounded clear and sharp in the stillness can it be so late asked ruth i should not have thought it possible answered mr bellingham but never mind you will be at home long before nine stay there is a shorter road i know through the fields just wait a moment while i go in and ask the exact way he dropped ruths arm and went into the publichouse a gig had been slowly toiling up the sandy hill behind unperceived by the young couple and now it reached the tableland and was close upon them as they separated ruth turned round when the sound of the horses footsteps came distinctly as he reached the level she faced mrs mason they were not tenno not five yards apart at the same moment they recognised each other and what was worse mrs mason had clearly seen with her sharp needlelike eyes the attitude in which ruth had stood with the young man who had just quitted her ruths hand had been lying in his arm and fondly held there by his other hand mrs mason was careless about the circumstances of temptation into which the girls entrusted to her as apprentices were thrown but severely intolerant if their conduct was in any degree influenced by the force of these temptations she called this intolerance keeping up the character of her establishment it would have been a better and more christian thing if she had kept up the character of her girls by tender vigilance and maternal care this evening too she was in an irritated state of temper her brother had undertaken to drive her round by henbury in order to give her the unpleasant information of the misbehaviour of her eldest son who was an assistant in a drapers shop in a neighbouring town she was full of indignation against want of steadiness though not willing to direct her indignation against the right objecther neerdowell darling while she was thus charged with anger for her brother justly defended her sons master and companions from her attacks she saw ruth standing with a lover far away from home at such a time in the evening and she boiled over with intemperate displeasure come here directly miss hilton she exclaimed sharply then dropping her voice to low bitter tones of concentrated wrath she said to the trembling guilty ruth dont attempt to show your face at my house again after this conduct i saw you and your spark too ill have no slurs on the character of my apprentices dont say a word i saw enough i shall write and tell your guardian tomorrow the horse started away for he was impatient to be off and ruth was left standing there stony sick and pale as if the lightning had torn up the ground beneath her feet she could not go on standing she was so sick and faint she staggered back to the broken sandbank and sank down and covered her face with her hands my dearest ruth are you ill speak darling my love my love do speak to me what tender words after such harsh ones they loosened the fountain of ruths tears and she cried bitterly oh did you see herdid you hear what she said she who my darling dont sob so ruth tell me what it is who has been near youwho has been speaking to you to make you cry so oh mrs mason and there was a fresh burst of sorrow you dont say so are you sure i was not away five minutes oh yes sir im quite sure she was so angry she said i must never show my face there again oh dear what shall i do it seemed to the poor child as if mrs masons words were irrevocable and that being so she was shut out from every house she saw how much she had done that was deserving of blame now when it was too late to undo it she knew with what severity and taunts mrs mason had often treated her for involuntary failings of which she had been quite unconscious and now she had really done wrong and shrank with terror from the consequences her eyes were so blinded by the fastfalling tears she did not see nor had she seen would she have been able to interpret the change in mr bellinghams countenance as he stood silently watching her he was silent so long that even in her sorrow she began to wonder that he did not speak and to wish to hear his soothing words once more it is very unfortunate he began at last and then he stopped then he began again it is very unfortunate for you see i did not like to name it to you before but i believei have business in fact which obliges me to go to town tomorrowto london i mean and i dont know when i shall be able to return to london cried ruth are you going away oh mr bellingham she wept afresh giving herself up to the desolate feeling of sorrow which absorbed all the terror she had been experiencing at the idea of mrs masons anger it seemed to her at this moment as though she could have borne everything but his departure but she did not speak again and after two or three minutes had elapsed he spokenot in his natural careless voice but in a sort of constrained agitated tone i can hardly bear the idea of leaving you my own ruth in such distress too for where you can go i do not know at all from all you have told me of mrs mason i dont think she is likely to mitigate her severity in your case no answer but tears quietly incessantly flowing mrs masons displeasure seemed a distant thing his going away was the present distress he went on ruth would you go with me to london my darling i cannot leave you here without a home the thought of leaving you at all is pain enough but in these circumstancesso friendless so homelessit is impossible you must come with me love and trust to me still she did not speak remember how young and innocent and motherless she was it seemed to her as if it would be happiness enough to be with him and as for the future he would arrange and decide for that the future lay wrapped in a golden mist which she did not care to penetrate but if he her sun was out of sight and gone the golden mist became dark heavy gloom through which no hope could come he took her hand will you not come with me do you not love me enough to trust me oh ruth reproachfully can you not trust me she had stopped crying but was sobbing sadly i cannot bear this love your sorrow is absolute pain to me but it is worse to feel how indifferent you arehow little you care about our separation he dropped her hand she burst into a fresh fit of crying i may have to join my mother in paris i dont know when i shall see you again oh ruth said he vehemently do you love me at all she said something in a very low voice he could not hear it though he bent down his headbut he took her hand again what was it you said love was it not that you did love me my darling you do i can tell it by the trembling of this little hand then you will not suffer me to go away alone and unhappy most anxious about you there is no other course open to you my poor girl has no friends to receive her i will go home directly and return in an hour with a carriage you make me too happy by your silence ruth oh what can i do exclaimed ruth mr bellingham you should help me and instead of that you only bewilder me how my dearest ruth bewilder you it seems so clear to me look at the case fairly here you are an orphan with only one person to love you poor childthrown off for no fault of yours by the only creature on whom you have a claim that creature a tyrannical inflexible woman what is more natural and being natural more right than that you should throw yourself upon the care of the one who loves you dearlywho would go through fire and water for youwho would shelter you from all harm unless indeed as i suspect you do not care for him if so ruth if you do not care for me we had better parti will leave you at once it will be better for me to go if you do not care for me he said this very sadly it seemed so to ruth at least and made as though he would have drawn his hand from hers but now she held it with soft force dont leave me please sir it is very true i have no friend but you dont leave me please but oh do tell me what i must do will you do it if i tell you if you will trust me i will do my very best for you i will give you my best advice you see your position mrs mason writes and gives her own exaggerated account to your guardian he is bound by no great love to you from what i have heard you say and throws you off i who might be able to befriend youthrough my mother perhapsi who could at least comfort you a little could not i ruth am away far away for an indefinite time that is your position at present now what i advise is this come with me into this little inn i will order tea for youi am sure you require it sadlyand i will leave you there and go home for the carriage i will return in an hour at the latest then we are together come what may that is enough for me is it not for you ruth say yessay it ever so low but give me the delight of hearing it ruth say yes low and soft with much hesitation came the yes the fatal word of which she so little imagined the infinite consequences the thought of being with him was all and everything how you tremble my darling you are cold love come into the house and ill order tea directly and be off she rose and leaning on his arm went into the house she was shaking and dizzy with the agitation of the last hour he spoke to the civil farmerlandlord who conducted them into a neat parlour with windows opening into the garden at the back of the house they had admitted much of the evenings fragrance through their open casements before they were hastily closed by the attentive host tea directly for this lady the landlord vanished dearest ruth i must go there is not an instant to be lost promise me to take some tea for you are shivering all over and deadly pale with the fright that abominable woman has given you i must go i shall be back in half an hourand then no more partings darling he kissed her pale cold face and went away the room whirled round before ruth it was a dreama strange varying shifting dreamwith the old home of her childhood for one scene with the terror of mrs masons unexpected appearance for another and then strangest dizziest happiest of all there was the consciousness of his love who was all the world to her and the remembrance of the tender words which still kept up their low soft echo in her heart her head ached so much that she could hardly see even the dusky twilight was a dazzling glare to her poor eyes and when the daughter of the house brought in the sharp light of the candles preparatory for tea ruth hid her face in the sofa pillows with a low exclamation of pain does your head ache miss asked the girl in a gentle sympathising voice let me make you some tea miss it will do you good manys the time poor mothers headaches were cured by good strong tea ruth murmured acquiescence the young girl about ruths own age but who was the mistress of the little establishment owing to her mothers death made tea and brought ruth a cup to the sofa where she lay ruth was feverish and thirsty and eagerly drank it off although she could not touch the bread and butter which the girl offered her she felt better and fresher though she was still faint and weak thank you said ruth dont let me keep you perhaps you are busy you have been very kind and the tea has done me a great deal of good the girl left the room ruth became as hot as she had previously been cold and went and opened the window and leant out into the still sweet evening air the bush of sweetbrier underneath the window scented the place and the delicious fragrance reminded her of her old home i think scents affect and quicken the memory more than either sights or sounds for ruth had instantly before her eyes the little garden beneath the window of her mothers room with the old man leaning on his stick watching her just as he had done not three hours before on that very afternoon dear old thomas he and mary would take me in i think they would love me all the more if i were cast off and mr bellingham would perhaps not be so very long away and he would know where to find me if i stayed at milham grange oh would it not be better to go to them i wonder if he would be very sorry i could not bear to make him sorry so kind as he has been to me but i do believe it would be better to go to them and ask their advice at any rate he would follow me there and i could talk over what i had better do with the three best friends i have in the worldthe only friends i have she put on her bonnet and opened the parlourdoor but then she saw the square figure of the landlord standing at the open housedoor smoking his evening pipe and looming large and distinct against the dark air and landscape beyond ruth remembered the cup of tea that she had drank it must be paid for and she had no money with her she feared that he would not let her quit the house without paying she thought that she would leave a note for mr bellingham saying where she was gone and how she had left the house in debt for like a child all dilemmas appeared of equal magnitude to her and the difficulty of passing the landlord while he stood there and of giving him an explanation of the circumstances as far as such explanation was due to him appeared insuperable and as awkward and fraught with inconvenience as far more serious situations she kept peeping out of her room after she had written her little pencilnote to see if the outer door was still obstructed there he stood motionless enjoying his pipe and looking out into the darkness which gathered thick with the coming night the fumes of the tobacco were carried by the air into the house and brought back ruths sick headache her energy left her she became stupid and languid and incapable of spirited exertion she modified her plan of action to the determination of asking mr bellingham to take her to milham grange to the care of her humble friends instead of to london and she thought in her simplicity that he would instantly consent when he had heard her reasons she started up a carriage dashed up to the door she hushed her beating heart and tried to stop her throbbing head to listen she heard him speaking to the landlord though she could not distinguish what he said heard the jingling of money and in another moment he was in the room and had taken her arm to lead her to the carriage oh sir i want you to take me to milham grange said she holding back old thomas would give me a home well dearest well talk of all that in the carriage i am sure you will listen to reason nay if you will go to milham you must go in the carriage said he hurriedly she was little accustomed to oppose the wishes of any oneobedient and docile by nature and unsuspicious and innocent of any harmful consequences she entered the carriage and drove towards london chapter v in north wales the june of had been glorious and sunny and full of flowers but july came in with pouring rain and it was a gloomy time for travellers and for weatherbound tourists who lounged away the days in touching up sketches dressing flies and reading over again for the twentieth time the few volumes they had brought with them a number of the times five days old had been in constant demand in all the sittingrooms of a certain inn in a little mountain village of north wales through a long july morning the valleys around were filled with thick cold mist which had crept up the hillsides till the hamlet itself was folded in its white dense curtain and from the innwindows nothing was seen of the beautiful scenery around the tourists who thronged the rooms might as well have been wi their dear little bairnies at hame and so some of them seemed to think as they stood with their faces flattened against the windowpanes looking abroad in search of an event to fill up the dreary time how many dinners were hastened that day by way of getting through the morning let the poor welsh kitchenmaid say the very village children kept indoors or if one or two more adventurous stole out into the land of temptation and puddles they were soon clutched back by angry and busy mothers it was only four oclock but most of the inmates of the inn thought it must be between six and seven the morning had seemed so longso many hours had passed since dinnerwhen a welsh car drawn by two horses rattled briskly up to the door every window of the ark was crowded with faces at the sound the leathern curtains were undrawn to their curious eyes and out sprang a gentleman who carefully assisted a wellcloakedup lady into the little inn despite the landladys assurances of not having a room to spare the gentleman it was mr bellingham paid no attention to the speeches of the hostess but quietly superintended the unpacking of the carriage and paid the postillion then turning round with his face to the light he spoke to the landlady whose voice had been rising during the last five minutes nay jenny youre strangely altered if you can turn out an old friend on such an evening as this if i remember right pen tre voelas is twenty miles across the bleakest mountain road i ever saw indeed sir and i did not know you mr bellingham i believe indeed sir pen tre voelas is not above eighteen mileswe only charge for eighteen it may not be much above seventeen and were quite full indeed mores the pity well but jenny to oblige me an old friend you can find lodgings out for some of your peoplethe house across for instance indeed sir and its at liberty perhaps you would not mind lodging there yourself i could get you the best rooms and send over a trifle or so of furniture if they wernt as youd wish them to be no jenny here i stay youll not induce me to venture over into those rooms whose dirt i know of old cant you persuade some one who is not an old friend to move across say if you like that i had written beforehand to bespeak the rooms oh i know you can manage iti know your goodnatured ways indeed sirwell ill see if you and the lady will just step into the back parlour sirtheres no one there just now the lady is keeping her bed today for a cold and the gentleman is having a rubber at whist in number three ill see what i can do thank you thank you is there a fire if not one must be lighted come ruthie come he led the way into a large bowwindowed room which looked gloomy enough that afternoon but which i have seen bright and buoyant with youth and hope within and sunny lights creeping down the purple mountain slope and stealing over the green soft meadows till they reached the little garden full of roses and lavenderbushes lying close under the window i have seenbut i shall see no more i did not know you had been here before said ruth as mr bellingham helped her off with her cloak oh yes three years ago i was here on a reading party we were here above two months attracted by jennys kind heart and oddities but driven away finally by the insufferable dirt however for a week or two it wont much signify but can she take us in sir i thought i heard her saying her house was full oh yesi dare say it is but i shall pay her well she can easily make excuses to some poor devil and send him over to the other side and for a day or two so that we have shelter it does not much signify could not we go to the house on the other side sir and have our meals carried across to us in a halfwarm state to say nothing of having no one to scold for bad cooking you dont know these outoftheway welsh inns yet ruthie no i only thought it seemed rather unfair said ruth gently but she did not end her sentence for mr bellingham formed his lips into a whistle and walked to the window to survey the rain the remembrance of his former good payment prompted many little lies of which mrs morgan was guilty that afternoon before she succeeded in turning out a gentleman and lady who were only planning to remain till the ensuing saturday at the outside so if they did fulfil their threat and leave on the next day she would be no very great loser these household arrangements complete she solaced herself with tea in her own little parlour and shrewdly reviewed the circumstances of mr bellinghams arrival indeed and shes not his wife thought jenny thats clear as day his wife would have brought her maid and given herself twice as many airs about the sittingrooms while this poor miss never spoke but kept as still as a mouse indeed and young men will be young men and as long as their fathers and mothers shut their eyes its none of my business to go about asking questions in this manner they settled down to a weeks enjoyment of that alpine country it was most true enjoyment to ruth it was opening a new sense vast ideas of beauty and grandeur filled her mind at the sight of the mountains now first beheld in full majesty she was almost overpowered by the vague and solemn delight but byandby her love for them equalled her awe and in the nighttime she would softly rise and steal to the window to see the white moonlight which gave a new aspect to the everlasting hills that girdle the mountain village their breakfasthour was late in accordance with mr bellinghams tastes and habits but ruth was up betimes and out and away brushing the dewdrops from the short crisp grass the lark sung high above her head and she knew not if she moved or stood still for the grandeur of this beautiful earth absorbed all idea of separate and individual existence even rain was a pleasure to her she sat in the windowseat of their parlour she would have gone out gladly but that such a proceeding annoyed mr bellingham who usually at such times lounged away the listless hours on a sofa and relieved himself by abusing the weather she saw the swiftfleeting showers come athwart the sunlight like a rush of silver arrows she watched the purple darkness on the heathery mountainside and then the pale golden gleam which succeeded there was no change or alteration of nature that had not its own peculiar beauty in the eyes of ruth but if she had complained of the changeable climate she would have pleased mr bellingham more her admiration and her content made him angry until her pretty motions and loving eyes soothed down his impatience really ruth he exclaimed one day when they had been imprisoned by rain a whole morning one would think you had never seen a shower of rain before it quite wearies me to see you sitting there watching this detestable weather with such a placid countenance and for the last two hours you have said nothing more amusing or interesting thanoh how beautiful or theres another cloud coming across moel wynn ruth left her seat very gently and took up her work she wished she had the gift of being amusing it must be dull for a man accustomed to all kinds of active employments to be shut up in the house she was recalled from her absolute selfforgetfulness what could she say to interest mr bellingham while she thought he spoke again i remember when we were reading here three years ago we had a week of just such weather as this but howard and johnson were capital whist players and wilbraham not bad so we got through the days famously can you play ecarte ruth or picquet no sir i have sometimes played at beggarmyneighbour answered ruth humbly regretting her own deficiencies he murmured impatiently and there was silence for another halfhour then he sprang up and rung the bell violently ask mrs morgan for a pack of cards ruthie ill teach you ecarte said he but ruth was stupid not so good as a dummy he said and it was no fun betting against himself so the cards were flung across the tableon the flooranywhere ruth picked them up as she rose she sighed a little with the depression of spirits consequent upon her own want of power to amuse and occupy him she loved youre pale love said he half repenting of his anger at her blunders over the cards go out before dinner you know you dont mind this cursed weather and see that you come home full of adventures to relate come little blockhead give me a kiss and begone she left the room with a feeling of relief for if he were dull without her she should not feel responsible and unhappy at her own stupidity the open air that kind soothing balm which gentle mother nature offers to us all in our seasons of depression relieved her the rain had ceased though every leaf and blade was loaded with trembling glittering drops ruth went down to the circular dale into which the brownfoaming mountain river fell and made a deep pool and after resting there for a while ran on between broken rocks down to the valley below the waterfall was magnificent as she had anticipated she longed to extend her walk to the other side of the stream so she sought the steppingstones the usual crossingplace which were overshadowed by trees a few yards from the pool the waters ran high and rapidly as busy as life between the pieces of grey rock but ruth had no fear and went lightly and steadily on about the middle however there was a great gap either one of the stones was so covered with water as to be invisible or it had been washed lower down at any rate the spring from stone to stone was long and ruth hesitated for a moment before taking it the sound of rushing waters was in her ears to the exclusion of every other noise her eyes were on the current running swiftly below her feet and thus she was startled to see a figure close before her on one of the stones and to hear a voice offering help she looked up and saw a man who was apparently long past middle life and of the stature of a dwarf a second glance accounted for the low height of the speaker for then she saw he was deformed as the consciousness of this infirmity came into her mind it must have told itself in her softened eyes for a faint flush of colour came into the pale face of the deformed gentleman as he repeated his words the water is very rapid will you take my hand perhaps i can help you ruth accepted the offer and with this assistance she was across in a moment he made way for her to precede him in the narrow wood path and then silently followed her up the glen when they had passed out of the wood into the pastureland beyond ruth once more turned to mark him she was struck afresh with the mild beauty of the face though there was something in the countenance which told of the bodys deformity something more and beyond the pallor of habitual illhealth something of a quick spiritual light in the deep seteyes a sensibility about the mouth but altogether though a peculiar it was a most attractive face will you allow me to accompany you if you are going the round by cwm dhu as i imagine you are the handrail is blown away from the little wooden bridge by the storm last night and the rush of waters below may make you dizzy and it is really dangerous to fall there the stream is so deep they walked on without much speech she wondered who her companion might be she should have known him if she had seen him among the strangers at the inn and yet he spoke english too well to be a welshman he knew the country and the paths so perfectly he must be a resident and so she tossed him from england to wales and back again in her imagination i only came here yesterday said he as a widening in the path permitted them to walk abreast last night i went to the higher waterfalls they are most splendid did you go out in all that rain asked ruth timidly oh yes rain never hinders me from walking indeed it gives a new beauty to such a country as this besides my time for my excursion is so short i cannot afford to waste a day then you do not live here asked ruth no my home is in a very different place i live in a busy town where at times it is difficult to feel the truth that there are in this loud stunning tide of human care and crime with whom the melodies abide of th everlasting chime who carry music in their heart through dusky lane and crowded mart plying their task with busier feet because their secret souls a holy strain repeat i have an annual holiday which i generally spend in wales and often in this immediate neighbourhood i do not wonder at your choice replied ruth it is a beautiful country it is indeed and i have been inoculated by an old innkeeper at conway with a love for its people and history and traditions i have picked up enough of the language to understand many of their legends and some are very fine and aweinspiring others very poetic and fanciful ruth was too shy to keep up the conversation by any remark of her own although his gentle pensive manner was very winning for instance said he touching a long budladen stem of foxglove in the hedgeside at the bottom of which one or two crimsonspeckled flowers were bursting from their green sheaths i dare say you dont know what makes this foxglove bend and sway so gracefully you think it is blown by the wind dont you he looked at her with a grave smile which did not enliven his thoughtful eyes but gave an inexpressible sweetness to his face i always thought it was the wind what is it asked ruth innocently oh the welsh tell you that this flower is sacred to the fairies and that it has the power of recognising them and all spiritual beings who pass by and that it bows in deference to them as they waft along its welsh name is maneg ellyllynthe good peoples glove and hence i imagine our folksglove or foxglove its a very pretty fancy said ruth much interested and wishing that he would go on without expecting her to reply but they were already at the wooden bridge he led her across and then bowing his adieu he had taken a different path even before ruth had thanked him for his attention it was an adventure to tell mr bellingham however and it roused and amused him till dinnertime came after which he sauntered forth with a cigar ruth said he when he returned ive seen your little hunchback he looks like riquetwiththetuft hes not a gentleman though if it had not been for his deformity i should not have made him out from your description you called him a gentleman and dont you sir asked ruth surprised oh no hes regularly shabby and seedy in his appearance lodging too the ostler told me over that horrible candle and cheese shop the smell of which is insufferable twenty yards offno gentleman could endure it he must be a traveller or artist or something of that kind did you see his face sir asked ruth no but a mans backhis tout ensemble has character enough in it to decide his rank his face was very singular quite beautiful said she softly but the subject did not interest mr bellingham and he let it drop chapter vi troubles gather about ruth the next day the weather was brave and glorious a perfect bridal of the earth and sky and every one turned out of the inn to enjoy the fresh beauty of nature ruth was quite unconscious of being the object of remark and in her light rapid passings to and fro had never looked at the doors and windows where many watchers stood observing her and commenting upon her situation or her appearance shes a very lovely creature said one gentleman rising from the breakfasttable to catch a glimpse of her as she entered from her mornings ramble not above sixteen i should think very modest and innocentlooking in her white gown his wife busy administering to the wants of a fine little boy could only say without seeing the young girls modest ways and gentle downcast countenance well i do think its a shame such people should be allowed to come here to think of such wickedness under the same roof do come away my dear and dont flatter her by such notice the husband returned to the breakfasttable he smelt the broiled ham and eggs and he heard his wifes commands whether smelling or hearing had most to do in causing his obedience i cannot tell perhaps you can now harry go and see if nurse and baby are ready to go out with you you must lose no time this beautiful morning ruth found mr bellingham was not yet come down so she sallied out for an additional halfhours ramble flitting about through the village trying to catch all the beautiful sunny peeps at the scenery between the cold stone houses which threw the radiant distance into aerial perspective far away she passed by the little shop and just issuing from it came the nurse and baby and little boy the baby sat in placid dignity in her nurses arms with a face of queenly calm her fresh soft peachy complexion was really tempting and ruth who was always fond of children went up to coo and to smile at the little thing and after some peepboing she was about to snatch a kiss when harry whose face had been reddening ever since the play began lifted up his sturdy little right arm and hit ruth a great blow on the face oh for shame sir said the nurse snatching back his hand how dare you do that to the lady who is so kind as to speak to sissy shes not a lady said he indignantly shes a bad naughty girlmamma said so she did and she shant kiss our baby the nurse reddened in her turn she knew what he must have heard but it was awkward to bring it out standing face to face with the elegant young lady children pick up such notions maam said she at last apologetically to ruth who stood white and still with a new idea running through her mind its no notion its true nurse and i heard you say it yourself go away naughty woman said the boy in infantile vehemence of passion to ruth to the nurses infinite relief ruth turned away humbly and meekly with bent head and slow uncertain steps but as she turned she saw the mild sad face of the deformed gentleman who was sitting at the open window above the shop he looked sadder and graver than ever and his eyes met her glance with an expression of deep sorrow and so condemned alike by youth and age she stole with timid step into the house mr bellingham was awaiting her coming in the sittingroom the glorious day restored all his buoyancy of spirits he talked gaily away without pausing for a reply while ruth made tea and tried to calm her heart which was yet beating with the agitation of the new ideas she had received from the occurrence of the morning luckily for her the only answers required for some time were monosyllables but those few words were uttered in so depressed and mournful a tone that at last they struck mr bellingham with surprise and displeasure as the condition of mind they unconsciously implied did not harmonise with his own ruth what is the matter this morning you really are very provoking yesterday when everything was gloomy and you might have been aware that i was out of spirits i heard nothing but expressions of delight today when every creature under heaven is rejoicing you look most deplorable and woebegone you really should learn to have a little sympathy the tears fell quickly down ruths cheeks but she did not speak she could not put into words the sense she was just beginning to entertain of the estimation in which she was henceforward to be held she thought he would be as much grieved as she was at what had taken place that morning she fancied she should sink in his opinion if she told him how others regarded her besides it seemed ungenerous to dilate upon the suffering of which he was the cause i will not thought she embitter his life i will try and be cheerful i must not think of myself so much if i can but make him happy what need i care for chance speeches accordingly she made every effort possible to be as lighthearted as he was but somehow the moment she relaxed thoughts would intrude and wonders would force themselves upon her mind so that altogether she was not the gay and bewitching companion mr bellingham had previously found her they sauntered out for a walk the path they chose led to a wood on the side of a hill and they entered glad of the shade of the trees at first it appeared like any common grove but they soon came to a deep descent on the summit of which they stood looking down on the treetops which were softly waving far beneath their feet there was a path leading sharp down and they followed it the ledge of rock made it almost like going down steps and their walk grew into a bounding and their bounding into a run before they reached the lowest plane a green gloom reigned there it was the still hour of noon the little birds were quiet in some leafy shade they went on a few yards and then they came to a circular pool overshadowed by the trees whose highest boughs had been beneath their feet a few minutes before the pond was hardly below the surface of the ground and there was nothing like a bank on any side a heron was standing there motionless but when he saw them he flapped his wings and slowly rose and soared above the green heights of the wood up into the very sky itself for at that depth the trees appeared to touch the round white clouds which brooded over the earth the speedwell grew in the shallowest water of the pool and all around its margin but the flowers were hardly seen at first so deep was the green shadow cast by the trees in the very middle of the pond the sky was mirrored clear and dark a blue which looked as if a black void lay behind oh there are waterlilies said ruth her eye catching on the farther side i must go and get some no i will get them for you the ground is spongy all round there sit still ruth this heap of grass will make a capital seat he went round and she waited quietly for his return when he came back he took off her bonnet without speaking and began to place his flowers in her hair she was quite still while he arranged her coronet looking up in his face with loving eyes with a peaceful composure she knew that he was pleased from his manner which had the joyousness of a child playing with a new toy and she did not think twice of his occupation it was pleasant to forget everything except his pleasure when he had decked her out he said there ruth now youll do come and look at yourself in the pond here where there are no weeds come she obeyed and could not help seeing her own loveliness it gave her a sense of satisfaction for an instant as the sight of any other beautiful object would have done but she never thought of associating it with herself she knew that she was beautiful but that seemed abstract and removed from herself her existence was in feeling and thinking and loving down in that green hollow they were quite in harmony her beauty was all that mr bellingham cared for and it was supreme it was all he recognised of her and he was proud of it she stood in her white dress against the trees which grew around her face was flushed into a brilliancy of colour which resembled that of a rose in june the great heavy white flowers drooped on either side of her beautiful head and if her brown hair was a little disordered the very disorder only seemed to add a grace she pleased him more by looking so lovely than by all her tender endeavours to fall in with his varying humour but when they left the wood and ruth had taken out her flowers and resumed her bonnet as they came near the inn the simple thought of giving him pleasure was not enough to secure ruths peace she became pensive and sad and could not rally into gaiety really ruth said he that evening you must not encourage yourself in this habit of falling into melancholy reveries without any cause you have been sighing twenty times during the last halfhour do be a little cheerful remember i have no companion but you in this outoftheway place i am very sorry sir said ruth her eyes filling with tears and then she remembered that it was very dull for him to be alone with her heavyhearted as she had been all day she said in a sweet penitent tone would you be so kind as to teach me one of those games at cards you were speaking about yesterday sir i would do my best to learn her soft murmuring voice won its way they rang for the cards and he soon forgot that there was such a thing as depression or gloom in the world in the pleasure of teaching such a beautiful ignoramus the mysteries of cardplaying there said he at last thats enough for one lesson do you know little goose your blunders have made me laugh myself into one of the worst headaches i have had for years he threw himself on the sofa and in an instant she was by his side let me put my cool hands on your forehead she begged that used to do mamma good he lay still his face away from the light and not speaking presently he fell asleep ruth put out the candles and sat patiently by him for a long time fancying he would awaken refreshed the room grew cool in the night air but ruth dared not rouse him from what appeared to be sound restoring slumber she covered him with her shawl which she had thrown over a chair on coming in from their twilight ramble she had ample time to think but she tried to banish thought at last his breathing became quick and oppressed and after listening to it for some minutes with increasing affright ruth ventured to waken him he seemed stupified and shivery ruth became more and more terrified all the household were asleep except one servantgirl who was wearied out of what little english she had knowledge of in more waking hours and she could only answer iss indeed maam to any question put to her by ruth she sat by the bedside all night long he moaned and tossed but never spoke sensibly it was a new form of illness to the miserable ruth her yesterdays suffering went into the black distance of longpast years the present was allinall when she heard people stirring she went in search of mrs morgan whose shrewd sharp manners unsoftened by inward respect for the poor girl had awed ruth even when mr bellingham was by to protect her mrs morgan said she sitting down in the little parlour appropriated to the landlady for she felt her strength suddenly desert hermrs morgan im afraid mr bellingham is very illhere she burst into tears but instantly checking herself oh what must i do continued she i dont think he has known anything all through the night and he looks so strange and wild this morning she gazed up into mrs morgans face as if reading an oracle indeed miss maam and its a very awkward thing but dont cry that can do no good deed it cant ill go and see the poor young man myself and then i can judge if a doctor is wanting ruth followed mrs morgan upstairs when they entered the sickroom mr bellingham was sitting up in bed looking wildly about him and as he saw them he exclaimed ruth ruth come here i wont be left alone and then he fell down exhausted on the pillow mrs morgan went up and spoke to him but he did not answer or take any notice ill send for mr jones my dear deed and i will well have him here in a couple of hours please god oh cant he come sooner asked ruth wild with terror deed no he lives at llanglas when hes at home and thats seven mile away and he may be gone a round eight or nine mile on the other side llanglas but ill send a boy on the pony directly saying this mrs morgan left ruth alone there was nothing to be done for mr bellingham had again fallen into a heavy sleep sounds of daily life began bells rang breakfastservices clattered up and down the passages and ruth sat on shivering by the bedside in that darkened room mrs morgan sent her breakfast upstairs by a chambermaid but ruth motioned it away in her sick agony and the girl had no right to urge her to partake of it that alone broke the monotony of the long morning she heard the sound of merry parties setting out on excursions on horseback or in carriages and once stiff and wearied she stole to the window and looked out on one side of the blind but the day looked bright and discordant to her aching anxious heart the gloom of the darkened room was better and more befitting it was some hours after he was summoned before the doctor made his appearance he questioned his patient and receiving no coherent answers he asked ruth concerning the symptoms but when she questioned him in turn he only shook his head and looked grave he made a sign to mrs morgan to follow him out of the room and they went down to her parlour leaving ruth in a depth of despair lower than she could have thought it possible there remained for her to experience an hour before i am afraid this is a bad case said mr jones to mrs morgan in welsh a brainfever has evidently set in poor young gentleman poor young man he looked the very picture of health that very appearance of robustness will in all probability make his disorder more violent however we must hope for the best mrs morgan who is to attend upon him he will require careful nursing is that young lady his sister she looks too young to be his wife no indeed gentlemen like you must know mr jones that we cant always look too closely into the ways of young men who come to our houses not but what im sorry for her for shes an innocent inoffensive young creature i always think it right for my own morals to put a little scorn into my manners when such as her come to stay here but indeed shes so gentle ive found it hard work to show the proper contempt she would have gone on to her inattentive listener if she had not heard a low tap at the door which recalled her from her morality and mr jones from his consideration of the necessary prescriptions come in said mrs morgan sharply and ruth came in she was white and trembling but she stood in that dignity which strong feeling kept down by selfcommand always imparts i wish you sir to be so kind as to tell me clearly and distinctly what i must do for mr bellingham every direction you give me shall be most carefully attended to you spoke about leechesi can put them on and see about them tell me everything sir that you wish to have done her manner was calm and serious and her countenance and deportment showed that the occasion was calling out strength sufficient to meet it mr jones spoke with a deference which he had not thought of using upstairs even while he supposed her to be the sister of the invalid ruth listened gravely she repeated some of the injunctions in order that she might be sure that she fully comprehended them and then bowing left the room she is no common person said mr jones still she is too young to have the responsibility of such a serious case have you any idea where his friends live mrs morgan indeed and i have his mother as haughty a lady as you would wish to see came travelling through wales last year she stopped here and i warrant you nothing was good enough for her she was real quality she left some clothes and books behind her for the maid was almost as fine as the mistress and little thought of seeing after her ladys clothes having a taste for going to see scenery along with the manservant and we had several letters from her i have them locked in the drawers in the bar where i keep such things well i should recommend your writing to the lady and telling her her sons state it would be a favour mr jones if you would just write it yourself english writing comes so strange to my pen the letter was written and in order to save time mr jones took it to the llanglas postoffice chapter vii the crisiswatching and waiting ruth put away every thought of the past or future everything that could unfit her for the duties of the present exceeding love supplied the place of experience she never left the room after the first day she forced herself to eat because his service needed her strength she did not indulge in any tears because the weeping she longed for would make her less able to attend upon him she watched and waited and prayed prayed with an utter forgetfulness of self only with a consciousness that god was allpowerful and that he whom she loved so much needed the aid of the mighty one day and night the summer night seemed merged into one she lost count of time in the hushed and darkened room one morning mrs morgan beckoned her out and she stole on tiptoe into the dazzling gallery on one side of which the bedrooms opened shes come whispered mrs morgan looking very much excited and forgetting that ruth had never heard that mrs bellingham had been summoned who is come asked ruth the idea of mrs mason flashed through her mindbut with a more terrible because a more vague dread she heard that it was his mother the mother of whom he had always spoken as a person whose opinion was to be regarded more than that of any other individual what must i do will she be angry with me said she relapsing into her childlike dependence on others and feeling that even mrs morgan was some one to stand between her and mrs bellingham mrs morgan herself was a little perplexed her morality was rather shocked at the idea of a proper real lady like mrs bellingham discovering that she had winked at the connexion between her son and ruth she was quite inclined to encourage ruth in her inclination to shrink out of mrs bellinghams observation an inclination which arose from no definite consciousness of having done wrong but principally from the representations she had always heard of the ladys awfulness mrs bellingham swept into her sons room as if she were unconscious what poor young creature had lately haunted it while ruth hurried into some unoccupied bedroom and alone there she felt her selfrestraint suddenly give way and burst into the saddest most utterly wretched weeping she had ever known she was worn out with watching and exhausted by passionate crying and she lay down on the bed and fell asleep the day passed on she slumbered unnoticed and unregarded she awoke late in the evening with a sense of having done wrong in sleeping so long the strain upon her responsibility had not yet left her twilight was closing fast around she waited until it had become night and then she stole down to mrs morgans parlour if you please may i come in asked she jenny morgan was doing up the hieroglyphics which she called her accounts she answered sharply enough but it was a permission to enter and ruth was thankful for it will you tell me how he is do you think i may go back to him no indeed that you may not nest who has made his room tidy these many days is not fit to go in now mrs bellingham has brought her own maid and the family nurse and mr bellinghams man such a tribe of servants and no end to packages waterbeds coming by the carrier and a doctor from london coming down tomorrow as if featherbeds and mr jones was not good enough why she wont let a soul of us into the room theres no chance for you ruth sighed how is he she inquired after a pause how can i tell indeed when im not allowed to go near him mr jones said tonight was a turning point but i doubt it for it is four days since he was taken ill and who ever heard of a sick person taking a turn on an even number of days its always on the third or the fifth or seventh or so on hell not turn till tomorrow night take my word for it and their fine london doctor will get all the credit and honest mr jones will be thrown aside i dont think he will get better myself thoughgelert does not howl for nothing my patience whats the matter with the girllord child youre never going to faint and be ill on my hands her sharp voice recalled ruth from the sick unconsciousness that had been creeping over her as she listened to the latter part of this speech she sat down and could not speakthe room whirled round and roundher white feebleness touched mrs morgans heart youve had no tea i guess indeed and the girls are very careless she rang the bell with energy and seconded her pull by going to the door and shouting out sharp directions in welsh to nest and gwen and three or four other rough kind slatternly servants they brought her tea which was comfortable according to the idea of comfort prevalent in that rude hospitable place there was plenty to eat too much indeed for it revolted the appetite it was intended to provoke but the heartiness with which the kind rosy waiter pressed her to eat and the scolding mrs morgan gave her when she found the buttered toast untouched toast on which she had herself desired that the butter might not be spared did ruth more good than the tea she began to hope and to long for the morning when hope might have become certainty it was all in vain that she was told that the room she had been in all day was at her service she did not say a word but she was not going to bed that night of all nights in the year when life or death hung trembling in the balance she went into the bedroom till the bustling house was still and heard busy feet passing to and fro in the room she might not enter and voices imperious though hushed down to a whisper ask for innumerable things then there was silence and when she thought that all were dead asleep except the watchers she stole out into the gallery on the other side were two windows cut into the thick stone wall and flower pots were placed on the shelves thus formed where great untrimmed straggling geraniums grew and strove to reach the light the window near mr bellinghams door was open the soft warmscented night air came sighing in in faint gusts and then was still it was summer there was no black darkness in the twentyfour hours only the light grew dusky and colour disappeared from objects of which the shape and form remained distinct a soft grey oblong of barred light fell on the flat wall opposite to the windows and deeper grey shadows marked out the tracery of the plants more graceful thus than in reality ruth crouched where no light fell she sat on the ground close by the door her whole existence was absorbed in listening all was still it was only her heart beating with the strong heavy regular sound of a hammer she wished she could stop its rushing incessant clang she heard a rustle of a silken gown and knew it ought not to have been worn in a sickroom for her senses seemed to have passed into the keeping of the invalid and to feel only as he felt the noise was probably occasioned by some change of posture in the watcher inside for it was once more deadstill the soft wind outside sank with a low long distant moan among the windings of the hills and lost itself there and came no more again but ruths heart beat loud she rose with as little noise as if she were a vision and crept to the open window to try and lose the nervous listening for the everrecurring sound out beyond under the calm sky veiled with a mist rather than with a cloud rose the high dark outlines of the mountains shutting in that village as if it lay in a nest they stood like giants solemnly watching for the end of earth and time here and there a black round shadow reminded ruth of some cwm or hollow where she and her lover had rambled in sun and in gladness she then thought the land enchanted into everlasting brightness and happiness she fancied then that into a region so lovely no bale or woe could enter but would be charmed away and disappear before the sight of the glorious guardian mountains now she knew the truth that earth has no barrier which avails against agony it comes lightninglike down from heaven into the mountain house and the town garret into the palace and into the cottage the garden lay close under the house a bright spot enough by day for in that soil whatever was planted grew and blossomed in spite of neglect the white roses glimmered out in the dusk all the night through the red were lost in shadow between the low boundary of the garden and the hills swept one or two green meadows ruth looked into the grey darkness till she traced each separate wave of outline then she heard a little restless bird chirp out its wakefulness from a nest in the ivy round the walls of the house but the motherbird spread her soft feathers and hushed it into silence presently however many little birds began to scent the coming dawn and rustled among the leaves and chirruped loud and clear just above the horizon too the mist became a silvery grey cloud hanging on the edge of the world presently it turned shimmering white and then in an instant it flushed into rose and the mountaintops sprang into heaven and bathed in the presence of the shadow of god with a bound the sun of a molten fiery red came above the horizon and immediately thousands of little birds sang out for joy and a soft chorus of mysterious glad murmurs came forth from the earth the low whispering wind left its hidingplace among the clefts and hollows of the hills and wandered among the rustling herbs and trees waking the flowerbuds to the life of another day ruth gave a sigh of relief that the night was over and gone for she knew that soon suspense would be ended and the verdict known whether for life or for death she grew faint and sick with anxiety it almost seemed as if she must go into the room and learn the truth then she heard movements but they were not sharp or rapid as if prompted by any emergency then again it was still she sat curled up upon the floor with her head thrown back against the wall and her hands clasped round her knees she had yet to wait meanwhile the invalid was slowly rousing himself from a long deep sound healthgiving sleep his mother had sat by him the night through and was now daring to change her position for the first time she was even venturing to give directions in a low voice to the old nurse who had dozed away in an armchair ready to obey any summons of her mistress mrs bellingham went on tiptoe towards the door and chiding herself because her stiff weary limbs made some slight noise she had an irrepressible longing for a few minutes change of scene after her night of watching she felt that the crisis was over and the relief to her mind made her conscious of every bodily feeling and irritation which had passed unheeded as long as she had been in suspense she slowly opened the door ruth sprang upright at the first sound of the creaking handle her very lips were stiff and unpliable with the force of the blood which rushed to her head it seemed as if she could not form words she stood right before mrs bellingham how is he madam mrs bellingham was for a moment surprised at the white apparition which seemed to rise out of the ground but her quick proud mind understood it all in an instant this was the girl then whose profligacy had led her son astray had raised up barriers in the way of her favourite scheme of his marriage with miss duncombe nay this was the real cause of his illness his mortal danger at this present time and of her bitter keen anxiety if under any circumstances mrs bellingham could have been guilty of the illbreeding of not answering a question it was now and for a moment she was tempted to pass on in silence ruth could not wait she spoke again for the love of god madam speak how is he will he live if she did not answer her she thought the creature was desperate enough to force her way into his room so she spoke he has slept well he is better oh my god i thank thee murmured ruth sinking back against the wall it was too much to hear this wretched girl thanking god for her sons life as if in fact she had any lot or part in him and to dare to speak to the almighty on her sons behalf mrs bellingham looked at her with cold contemptuous eyes whose glances were like icebolts and made ruth shiver up away from them young woman if you have any propriety or decency left i trust that you will not dare to force yourself into his room she stood for a moment as if awaiting an answer and half expecting it to be a defiance but she did not understand ruth she did not imagine the faithful trustfulness of her heart ruth believed that if mr bellingham was alive and likely to live all was well when he wanted her he would send for her ask for her yearn for her till every one would yield before his steadfast will at present she imagined that he was probably too weak to care or know who was about him and though it would have been an infinite delight to her to hover and brood around him yet it was of him she thought and not of herself she gently drew herself on one side to make way for mrs bellingham to pass byandby mrs morgan came up ruth was still near the door from which it seemed as if she could not tear herself away indeed miss and you must not hang about the door in this way it is not pretty manners mrs bellingham has been speaking very sharp and cross about it and i shall lose the character of my inn if people take to talking as she does did not i give you a room last night to keep in and never be seen or heard of and did i not tell you what a particular lady mrs bellingham was but you must come out here right in her way indeed it was not pretty nor grateful to me jenny morgan and that i must say ruth turned away like a chidden child mrs morgan followed her to her room scolding as she went and then having cleared her heart after her wont by uttering hasty words her real kindness made her add in a softened tone you stop up here like a good girl ill send you your breakfast byandby and let you know from time to time how he is and you can go out for a walk you know but if you do ill take it as a favour if youll go out by the side door it will maybe save scandal all that day long ruth kept herself close prisoner in the room to which mrs morgan accorded her all that day and many succeeding days but at nights when the house was still and even the little brown mice had gathered up the crumbs and darted again to their holes ruth stole out and crept to his door to catch if she could the sound of his beloved voice she could tell by its tones how he felt and how he was getting on as well as any of the watchers in the room she yearned and pined to see him once more but she had reasoned herself down into something like patience when he was well enough to leave his room when he had not always one of the nurses with him then he would send for her and she would tell him how very patient she had been for his dear sake but it was long to wait even with this thought of the manner in which the waiting would end poor ruth her faith was only building up vain castles in the air they towered up into heaven it is true but after all they were but visions chapter viii mrs bellingham does the thing handsomely if mr bellingham did not get rapidly well it was more owing to the morbid querulous fancy attendant on great weakness than from any unfavourable medical symptom but he turned away with peevish loathing from the very sight of food prepared in the slovenly manner which had almost disgusted him when he was well it was of no use telling him that simpson his mothers maid had superintended the preparation at every point he offended her by detecting something offensive and to be avoided in her daintiest messes and made mrs morgan mutter many a hasty speech which however mrs bellingham thought it better not to hear until her son should be strong enough to travel i think you are better today said she as his man wheeled his sofa to the bedroom window we shall get you downstairs tomorrow if it were to get away from this abominable place i could go down today but i believe im to be kept prisoner here for ever i shall never get well here im sure he sank back on his sofa in impatient despair the surgeon was announced and eagerly questioned by mrs bellingham as to the possibility of her sons removal and he having heard the same anxiety for the same end expressed by mrs morgan in the regions below threw no great obstacles in the way after the doctor had taken his departure mrs bellingham cleared her throat several times mr bellingham knew the prelude of old and winced with nervous annoyance henry there is something i must speak to you about an unpleasant subject certainly but one which has been forced upon me by the very girl herself you must be aware to what i refer without giving me the pain of explaining myself mr bellingham turned himself sharply round to the wall and prepared himself for a lecture by concealing his face from her notice but she herself was in too nervous a state to be capable of observation of course she continued it was my wish to be as blind to the whole affair as possible though you cant imagine how mrs mason has blazoned it abroad all fordham rings with it but of course it could not be pleasant or indeed i may say correct for me to be aware that a person of such improper character was under the samei beg your pardon dear henry what do you say ruth is no improper character mother you do her injustice my dear boy you dont mean to uphold her as a paragon of virtue no mother but i led her wrong i we will let all discussions into the cause or duration of her present character drop if you please said mrs bellingham with the sort of dignified authority which retained a certain power over her sona power which originated in childhood and which he only defied when he was roused into passion he was too weak in body to oppose himself to her and fight the ground inch by inch as i have implied i do not wish to ascertain your share of blame from what i saw of her one morning i am convinced of her forward intrusive manners utterly without shame or even common modesty what are you referring to asked mr bellingham sharply why when you were at the worst and i had been watching you all night and had just gone out in the morning for a breath of fresh air this girl pushed herself before me and insisted upon speaking to me i really had to send mrs morgan to her before i could return to your room a more impudent hardened manner i never saw ruth was neither impudent nor hardened she was ignorant enough and might offend from knowing no better he was getting weary of the discussion and wished it had never been begun from the time he had become conscious of his mothers presence he had felt the dilemma he was in in regard to ruth and various plans had directly crossed his brain but it had been so troublesome to weigh and consider them all properly that they had been put aside to be settled when he grew stronger but this difficulty in which he was placed by his connexion with ruth associated the idea of her in his mind with annoyance and angry regret at the whole affair he wished in the languid way in which he wished and felt everything not immediately relating to his daily comfort that he had never seen her it was a most awkward a most unfortunate affair notwithstanding this annoyance connected with and arising out of ruth he would not submit to hear her abused and something in his manner impressed this on his mother for she immediately changed her mode of attack we may as well drop all dispute as to the young womans manners but i suppose you do not mean to defend your connexion with her i suppose you are not so lost to all sense of propriety as to imagine it fit or desirable that your mother and this degraded girl should remain under the same roof liable to meet at any hour of the day she waited for an answer but no answer came i ask you a simple question is it or is it not desirable i suppose it is not he replied gloomily and i suppose from your manner that you think the difficulty would be best solved by my taking my departure and leaving you with your vicious companion again no answer but inward and increasing annoyance of which mr bellingham considered ruth the cause at length he spoke mother you are not helping me in my difficulty i have no desire to banish you nor to hurt you after all your care for me ruth has not been so much to blame as you imagine that i must say but i do not wish to see her again if you can tell me how to arrange it otherwise without behaving unhandsomely only spare me all this worry while i am so weak i put myself in your hands dismiss her as you wish it but let it be done handsomely and let me hear no more about it i cannot bear it let me have a quiet life without being lectured while i am pent up here and unable to shake off unpleasant thoughts my dear henry rely upon me no more mother its a bad business and i can hardly avoid blaming myself in the matter i dont want to dwell upon it dont be too severe in your selfreproaches while you are so feeble dear henry it is right to repent but i have no doubt in my own mind she led you wrong with her artifices but as you say everything should be done handsomely i confess i was deeply grieved when i first heard of the affair but since i have seen the girl well ill say no more about her since i see it displeases you but i am thankful to god that you see the error of your ways she sat silent thinking for a little while and then sent for her writingcase and began to write her son became restless and nervously irritated mother he said this affair worries me to death i cannot shake off the thoughts of it leave it to me ill arrange it satisfactorily could we not leave tonight i should not be so haunted by this annoyance in another place i dread seeing her again because i fear a scene and yet i believe i ought to see her in order to explain you must not think of such a thing henry said she alarmed at the very idea sooner than that we will leave in half an hour and try to get to pen tre voelas tonight it is not yet three and the evenings are very long simpson should stay and finish the packing she could go straight to london and meet us there macdonald and nurse could go with us could you bear twenty miles do you think anything to get rid of his uneasiness he felt that he was not behaving as he should do to ruth though the really right never entered his head but it would extricate him from his present dilemma and save him many lectures he knew that his mother always liberal where money was concerned would do the thing handsomely and it would always be easy to write and give ruth what explanation he felt inclined in a day or two so he consented and soon lost some of his uneasiness in watching the bustle of the preparation for their departure all this time ruth was quietly spending in her room beguiling the waiting weary hours with pictures of the meeting at the end her room looked to the back and was in a sidewing away from the principal state apartments consequently she was not roused to suspicion by any of the commotion but indeed if she had heard the banging of doors the sharp directions the carriagewheels she would still not have suspected the truth her own love was too faithful it was four oclock and past when some one knocked at her door and on entering gave her a note which mrs bellingham had left that lady had found some difficulty in wording it so as to satisfy herself but it was as follows my son on recovering from his illness is i thank god happily conscious of the sinful way in which he has been living with you by his earnest desire and in order to avoid seeing you again we are on the point of leaving this place but before i go i wish to exhort you to repentance and to remind you that you will not have your own guilt alone upon your head but that of any young man whom you may succeed in entrapping into vice i shall pray that you may turn to an honest life and i strongly recommend you if indeed you are not dead in trespasses and sins to enter some penitentiary in accordance with my sons wishes i forward you in this envelope a banknote of fifty pounds margaret bellingham was this the end of all had he indeed gone she started up and asked this last question of the servant who half guessing at the purport of the note had lingered about the room curious to see the effect produced iss indeed miss the carriage drove from the door as i came upstairs youll see it now on the yspytty road if youll please to come to the window of no ruth started up and followed the chambermaid aye there it was slowly winding up the steep white road on which it seemed to move at a snails pace she might overtake himshe mightshe might speak one farewell word to him print his face on her heart with a last looknay when he saw her he might retract and not utterly for ever leave her thus she thought and she flew back to her room and snatching up her bonnet ran tying the strings with her trembling hands as she went down the stairs out at the nearest door little heeding the angry words of mrs morgan for the hostess more irritated at mrs bellinghams severe upbraiding at parting than mollified by her ample payment was offended by the circumstance of ruth in her wild haste passing through the prohibited front door but ruth was away before mrs morgan had finished her speech out and away scudding along the road thoughtlost in the breathless rapidity of her motion though her heart and head beat almost to bursting what did it signify if she could but overtake the carriage it was a nightmare constantly evading the most passionate wishes and endeavours and constantly gaining ground every time it was visible it was in fact more distant but ruth would not believe it if she could but gain the summit of that weary everlasting hill she believed that she could run again and would soon be nigh upon the carriage as she ran she prayed with wild eagerness she prayed that she might see his face once more even if she died on the spot before him it was one of those prayers which god is too merciful to grant but despairing and wild as it was ruth put her soul into it and prayed it again and yet again wave above wave of the everrising hills were gained were crossed and at last ruth struggled up to the very top and stood on the bare table of moor brown and purple stretching far away till it was lost in the haze of the summer afternoon and the white road was all flat before her but the carriage she sought and the figure she sought had disappeared there was no human being there a few wild blackfaced mountain sheep quietly grazing near the road as if it were long since they had been disturbed by the passing of any vehicle was all the life she saw on the bleak moorland she threw herself down on the ling by the side of the road in despair her only hope was to die and she believed she was dying she could not think she could believe anything surely life was a horrible dream and god would mercifully awaken her from it she had no penitence no consciousness of error or offence no knowledge of any one circumstance but that he was gone yet afterwards long afterwards she remembered the exact motion of a bright green beetle busily meandering among the wild thyme near her and she recalled the musical balanced wavering drop of a skylark into her nest near the heatherbed where she lay the sun was sinking low the hot air had ceased to quiver near the hotter earth when she bethought her once more of the note which she had impatiently thrown down before half mastering its contents oh perhaps she thought i have been too hasty there may be some words of explanation from him on the other side of the page to which in my blind anguish i never turned i will go and find it she lifted herself heavily and stiffly from the crushed heather she stood dizzy and confused with her change of posture and was so unable to move at first that her walk was but slow and tottering but byandby she was tasked and goaded by thoughts which forced her into rapid motion as if by it she could escape from her agony she came down on the level ground just as many gay or peaceful groups were sauntering leisurely home with hearts at ease with low laughs and quiet smiles and many an exclamation at the beauty of the summer evening ever since her adventure with the little boy and his sister ruth had habitually avoided encountering these happyinnocents may i call themthese happy fellowmortals and even now the habit grounded on sorrowful humiliation had power over her she paused and then on looking back she saw more people who had come into the main road from a side path she opened a gate into a pasturefield and crept up to the hedgebank until all should have passed by and she could steal into the inn unseen she sat down on the sloping turf by the roots of an old hawthorntree which grew in the hedge she was still tearless with hot burning eyes she heard the merry walkers pass by she heard the footsteps of the village children as they ran along to their evening play she saw the small black cows come into the fields after being milked and life seemed yet abroad when would the world be still and dark and fit for such a deserted desolate creature as she was even in her hidingplace she was not long at peace the little children with their curious eyes peering here and there had peeped through the hedge and through the gate and now they gathered from all the four corners of the hamlet and crowded round the gate and one more adventurous than the rest had run into the field to cry gi me a halfpenny which set the example to every little one emulous of his boldness and there where she sat low on the ground and longing for the sure hidingplace earth gives to the weary the children kept running in and pushing one another forwards and laughing poor things their time had not come for understanding what sorrow is ruth would have begged them to leave her alone and not madden her utterly but they knew no english save the one eternal gi me a halfpenny she felt in her heart that there was no pity anywhere suddenly while she thus doubted god a shadow fell across her garments on which her miserable eyes were bent she looked up the deformed gentleman she had twice before seen stood there he had been attracted by the noisy little crowd and had questioned them in welsh but not understanding enough of the language to comprehend their answers he had obeyed their signs and entered the gate to which they pointed there he saw the young girl whom he had noticed at first for her innocent beauty and the second time for the idea he had gained respecting her situation there he saw her crouched up like some hunted creature with a wild scared look of despair which almost made her lovely face seem fierce he saw her dress soiled and dim her bonnet crushed and battered with her tossings to and fro on the moorland bed he saw the poor lost wanderer and when he saw her he had compassion on her there was some look of heavenly pity in his eyes as gravely and sadly they met her upturned gaze which touched her stony heart still looking at him as if drawing some good influence from him she said low and mournfully he has left me sirsir he has indeedhe has gone and left me before he could speak a word to comfort her she had burst into the wildest dreariest crying ever mortal cried the settled form of the event when put into words went sharp to her heart her moans and sobs wrung his soul but as no speech of his could be heard if he had been able to decide what best to say he stood by her in apparent calmness while she wretched wailed and uttered her woe but when she lay worn out and stupefied into silence she heard him say to himself in a low voice oh my god for christs sake pity her ruth lifted up her eyes and looked at him with a dim perception of the meaning of his words she regarded him fixedly in a dreamy way as if they struck some chord in her heart and she were listening to its echo and so it was his pitiful look or his words reminded her of the childish days when she knelt at her mothers knee and she was only conscious of a straining longing desire to recall it all he let her take her time partly because he was powerfully affected himself by all the circumstances and by the sad pale face upturned to his and partly by an instinctive consciousness that the softest patience was required but suddenly she startled him as she herself was startled into a keen sense of the suffering agony of the present she sprang up and pushed him aside and went rapidly towards the gate of the field he could not move as quickly as most men but he put forth his utmost speed he followed across the road on to the rocky common but as he went along with his uncertain gait in the dusk gloaming he stumbled and fell over some sharp projecting stone the acute pain which shot up his back forced a short cry from him and when bird and beast are hushed into rest and the stillness of the night is over all a highpitched sound like the voice of pain is carried far in the quiet air ruth speeding on in her despair heard the sharp utterance and stopped suddenly short it did what no remonstrance could have done it called her out of herself the tender nature was in her still in that hour when all good angels seemed to have abandoned her in the old days she could never bear to hear or see bodily suffering in any of gods meanest creatures without trying to succour them and now in her rush to the awful death of the suicide she stayed her wild steps and turned to find from whom that sharp sound of anguish had issued he lay among the white stones too faint with pain to move but with an agony in his mind far keener than any bodily pain as he thought that by his unfortunate fall he had lost all chance of saving her he was almost overpowered by his intense thankfulness when he saw her white figure pause and stand listening and turn again with slow footsteps as if searching for some lost thing he could hardly speak but he made a sound which though his heart was inexpressibly glad was like a groan she came quickly towards him i am hurt said he do not leave me his disabled and tender frame was overcome by the accident and the previous emotions and he fainted away ruth flew to the little mountain stream the dashing sound of whose waters had been tempting her but a moment before to seek forgetfulness in the deep pool into which they fell she made a basin of her joined hands and carried enough of the cold fresh water back to dash into his face and restore him to consciousness while he still kept silence uncertain what to say best fitted to induce her to listen to him she said softly are you better sirare you very much hurt not very much i am better any quick movement is apt to cause me a sudden loss of power in my back and i believe i stumbled over some of these projecting stones it will soon go off and you will help me to go home i am sure oh yes can you go now i am afraid of your lying too long on this heather there is a heavy dew he was so anxious to comply with her wish and not weary out her thought for him and so turn her back upon herself that he tried to rise the pain was acute and this she saw dont hurry yourself sir i can wait then came across her mind the recollection of the business that was thus deferred but the few homely words which had been exchanged between them seemed to have awakened her from her madness she sat down by him and covering her face with her hands cried mournfully and unceasingly she forgot his presence and yet she had a consciousness that some one looked for her kind offices that she was wanted in the world and must not rush hastily out of it the consciousness did not take this definite form it did not become a thought but it kept her still and it was gradually soothing her can you help me to rise now said he after a while she did not speak but she helped him up and then he took her arm and she led him tenderly through all the little velvet paths where the turf grew short and soft between the rugged stones once more on the highway they slowly passed along in the moonlight he guided her by a slight motion of the arm through the more unfrequented lanes to his lodgings at the shop for he thought for her and conceived the pain she would have in seeing the lighted windows of the inn he leant more heavily on her arm as they awaited the opening of the door come in said he not relaxing his hold and yet dreading to tighten it lest she should defy restraint and once more rush away they went slowly into the little parlour behind the shop the bonnylooking hostess mrs hughes by name made haste to light the candle and then they saw each other face to face the deformed gentleman looked very pale but ruth looked as if the shadow of death was upon her chapter ix the stormspirit subdued mrs hughes bustled about with many a sympathetic exclamation now in pretty broken english now in more fluent welsh which sounded as soft as russian or italian in her musical voice mr benson for that was the name of the hunchback lay on the sofa thinking while the tender mrs hughes made every arrangement for his relief from pain he had lodged with her for three successive years and she knew and loved him ruth stood in the little bowwindow looking out across the moon and over the deep blue heavens large torn irregularshaped clouds went hurrying as if summoned by some stormspirit the work they were commanded to do was not here the mighty gatheringplace lay eastward immeasurable leagues and on they went chasing each other over the silent earth now black now silverwhite at one transparent edge now with the moon shining like hope through their darkest centre now again with a silver lining and now utterly black they sailed lower in the lift and disappeared behind the immovable mountains they were rushing in the very direction in which ruth had striven and struggled to go that afternoon they in their wild career would soon pass over the very spot where he her worlds he was lying sleeping or perhaps not sleeping perhaps thinking of her the storm was in her mind and rent and tore her purposes into forms as wild and irregular as the heavenly shapes she was looking at if like them she could pass the barrier horizon in the night she might overtake him mr benson saw her look and read it partially he saw her longing gaze outwards upon the free broad world and thought that the syren waters whose deadly music yet rang in her ears were again tempting her he called her to him praying that his feeble voice might have power my dear young lady i have much to say to you and god has taken my strength from me now when i most need itoh i sin to speak sobut for his sake i implore you to be patient here if only till tomorrow morning he looked at her but her face was immovable and she did not speak she could not give up her hope her chance her liberty till tomorrow god help me said he mournfully my words do not touch her and still holding her hand he sank back on the pillows indeed it was true that his words did not vibrate in her atmosphere the stormspirit raged there and filled her heart with the thought that she was an outcast and the holy words for his sake were answered by the demon who held possession with a blasphemous defiance of the merciful god what have i to do with thee he thought of every softening influence of religion which over his own disciplined heart had power but put them aside as useless then the still small voice whispered and he spake in your mothers name whether she be dead or alive i command you to stay here until i am able to speak to you she knelt down at the foot of the sofa and shook it with her sobs her heart was touched and he hardly dared to speak again at length he said i know you will not goyou could notfor her sake you will not will you no whispered ruth and then there was a great blank in her heart she had given up her chance she was calm in the utter absence of all hope and now you will do what i tell you said he gently but unconsciously to himself in the tone of one who has found the hidden spell by which to rule spirits she slowly said yes but she was subdued he called mrs hughes she came from her adjoining shop you have a bedroom within yours where your daughter used to sleep i think i am sure you will oblige me and i shall consider it as a great favour if you will allow this young lady to sleep there tonight will you take her there now go my dear i have full trust in your promise not to leave until i can speak to you his voice died away to silence but as ruth rose from her knees at his bidding she looked at his face through her tears his lips were moving in earnest unspoken prayer and she knew it was for her that night although his pain was relieved by rest he could not sleep and as in fever the coming events kept unrolling themselves before him in every changing and fantastic form he met ruth in all possible places and ways and addressed her in every manner he could imagine most calculated to move and affect her to penitence and virtue towards morning he fell asleep but the same thoughts haunted his dreams he spoke but his voice refused to utter aloud and she fled relentless to the deep black pool but god works in his own way the visions melted into deep unconscious sleep he was awakened by a knock at the door which seemed a repetition of what he had heard in his last sleeping moments it was mrs hughes she stood at the first word of permission within the room please sir i think the young lady is very ill indeed sir perhaps you would please to come to her how is she ill said he much alarmed quite quietlike sir but i think she is dying thats all indeed sir go away i will be with you directly he replied his heart sinking within him in a very short time he was standing with mrs hughes by ruths bedside she lay as still as if she were dead her eyes shut her wan face numbed into a fixed anguish of expression she did not speak when they spoke though after a while they thought she strove to do so but all power of motion and utterance had left her she was dressed in everything except her bonnet as she had been the day before although sweet thoughtful mrs hughes had provided her with nightgear which lay on the little chest of drawers that served as a dressingtable mr benson lifted up her arm to feel her feeble fluttering pulse and when he let go her hand it fell upon the bed in a dull heavy way as if she were already dead you gave her some food said he anxiously to mrs hughes indeed and i offered her the best in the house but she shook her poor pretty head and only asked if i would please to get her a cup of water i brought her some milk though and deed i think shed rather have had the water but not to seem sour and cross she took some milk by this time mrs hughes was fairly crying when does the doctor come up here indeed sir and hes up nearly every day now the inn is so full ill go for him and can you manage to undress her and lay her in bed open the window too and let in the air if her feet are cold put bottles of hot water to them it was a proof of the true love which was the nature of both that it never crossed their minds to regret that this poor young creature had been thus thrown upon their hands on the contrary mrs hughes called it a blessing it blesseth him that gives and him that takes chapter x a note and the answer at the inn everything was life and bustle mr benson had to wait long in mrs morgans little parlour before she could come to him and he kept growing more and more impatient at last she made her appearance and heard his story people may talk as they will about the little respect that is paid to virtue unaccompanied by the outward accidents of wealth or station but i rather think it will be found that in the long run true and simple virtue always has its proportionate reward in the respect and reverence of every one whose esteem is worth having to be sure it is not rewarded after the way of the world as mere worldly possessions are with low obeisance and lipservice but all the better and more noble qualities in the hearts of others make ready and go forth to meet it on its approach provided only it be pure simple and unconscious of its own existence mr benson had little thought for outward tokens of respect just then nor had mrs morgan much time to spare but she smoothed her ruffled brow and calmed her bustling manner as soon as ever she saw who it was that awaited her for mr benson was well known in the village where he had taken up his summer holiday among the mountains year after year always a resident at the shop and seldom spending a shilling at the inn mrs morgan listened patientlyfor her mr jones will come this afternoon but it is a shame you should be troubled with such as her i had but little time yesterday but i guessed there was something wrong and gwen has just been telling me her bed has not been slept in they were in a pretty hurry to be gone yesterday for all that the gentleman was not fit to travel to my way of thinking indeed william wynn the postboy said he was weary enough before he got to the end of that yspytty road and he thought they would have to rest there a day or two before they could go further than pen tre voelas indeed and anyhow the servant is to follow them with the baggage this very morning and now i remember william wynn said they would wait for her youd better write a note mr benson and tell them her state it was good though unpalatable advice it came from one accustomed to bring excellent if unrefined sense to bear quickly upon any emergency and to decide rapidly she was in truth so little accustomed to have her authority questioned that before mr benson had made up his mind she had produced paper pens and ink from the drawer in her bureau placed them before him and was going to leave the room leave the note on this shelf and trust me that it goes by the maid the boy that drives her there in the car shall bring you an answer back she was gone before he could rally his scattered senses enough to remember that he had not the least idea of the name of the party to whom he was to write the quiet leisure and peace of his little study at home favoured his habit of reverie and long deliberation just as her position as mistress of an inn obliged her to quick decisive ways her advice though good in some points was unpalatable in others it was true that ruths condition ought to be known by those who were her friends but were these people to whom he was now going to write friends he knew there was a rich mother and a handsome elegant son and he had also some idea of the circumstances which might a little extenuate their mode of quitting ruth he had wide enough sympathy to understand that it must have been a most painful position in which the mother had been placed on finding herself under the same roof with a girl who was living with her son as ruth was and yet he did not like to apply to her to write to the son was still more out of the question as it seemed like asking him to return but through one or the other lay the only clue to her friends who certainly ought to be made acquainted with her position at length he wrote madami write to tell you of the condition of the poor young womanhere came a long pause of deliberationwho accompanied your son on his arrival here and who was left behind on your departure yesterday she is lying as it appears to me in a very dangerous state at my lodgings and if i may suggest it would be kind to allow your maid to return and attend upon her until she is sufficiently recovered to be restored to her friends if indeed they could not come to take charge of her themselves i remain madam your obedient servant thurstan benson the note was very unsatisfactory after all his consideration but it was the best he could do he made inquiry of a passing servant as to the ladys name directed the note and placed it on the indicated shelf he then returned to his lodgings to await the doctors coming and the postboys return there was no alteration in ruth she was as one stunned into unconsciousness she did not move her posture she hardly breathed from time to time mrs hughes wetted her mouth with some liquid and there was a little mechanical motion of the lips that was the only sign of life she gave the doctor came and shook his heada thorough prostration of strength occasioned by some great shock on the nervesand prescribed care and quiet and mysterious medicines but acknowledged that the result was doubtful very doubtful after his departure mr benson took his welsh grammar and tried again to master the everpuzzling rules for the mutations of letters but it was of no use for his thoughts were absorbed by the lifeindeath condition of the young creature who was lately bounding and joyous the maid and the luggage the car and the driver had arrived before noon at their journeys end and the note had been delivered it annoyed mrs bellingham exceedingly it was the worst of these kind of connexions there was no calculating the consequences they were neverending all sorts of claims seemed to be established and all sorts of people to step in to their settlement the idea of sending her maid why simpson would not go if she asked her she soliloquised thus while reading the letter and then suddenly turning round to the favourite attendant who had been listening to her mistresss remarks with no inattentive ear she asked simpson would you go and nurse this creature as this she looked at the signaturemr benson whoever he is proposes me no indeed maam said the maid drawing herself up stiff in her virtue im sure maam you would not expect it of me i could never have the face to dress a lady of character again well well dont be alarmed i cannot spare you by the way just attend to the strings on my dress the chambermaid here pulled them into knots and broke them terribly last night it is awkward though very said she relapsing into a musing fit over the condition of ruth if youll allow me maam i think i might say something that would alter the case i believe maam you put a banknote into the letter to the young woman yesterday mrs bellingham bowed acquiescence and the maid went on because maam when the little deformed man wrote that note hes mr benson maam i have reason to believe neither he nor mrs morgan knew of any provision being made for the young woman me and the chambermaid found your letter and the banknote lying quite promiscuous like waste paper on the floor of her room for i believe she rushed out like mad after you left that as you say alters the case this letter then is principally a sort of delicate hint that some provision ought to have been made which is true enough only it has been attended to already what became of the money law maam do you ask of course as soon as i saw it i picked it up and took it to mrs morgan in trust for the young person oh thats right what friends has she did you ever hear from masonperhaps they ought to know where she is mrs mason did tell me maam she was an orphan with a guardian who was noways akin and who washed his hands of her when she ran off but mrs mason was sadly put out and went into hysterics for fear you would think she had not seen after her enough and that she might lose your custom she said it was no fault of hers for the girl was always a forward creature boasting of her beauty and saying how pretty she was and striving to get where her good looks could be seen and admiredone night in particular maam at a county ball and how mrs mason had found out she used to meet mr bellingham at an old womans house who was a regular old witch maam and lives in the lowest part of the town where all the bad characters haunt there thats enough said mrs bellingham sharply for the maids chattering had outrun her tact and in her anxiety to vindicate the character of her friend mrs mason by blackening that of ruth she had forgotten that she a little implicated her mistresss son whom his proud mother did not like to imagine as ever passing through a low and degraded part of the town if she has no friends and is the creature you describe which is confirmed by my own observation the best place for her is as i said before the penitentiary her fifty pounds will keep her for a week or so if she is really unable to travel and pay for her journey and if on her return to fordham she will let me know i will undertake to obtain her admission immediately im sure its well for her she has to do with a lady who will take any interest in her after what has happened mrs bellingham called for her writingdesk and wrote a few hasty lines to be sent back by the postboy who was on the point of starting mrs bellingham presents her compliments to her unknown correspondent mr benson and begs to inform him of a circumstance of which she believes he was ignorant when he wrote the letter with which she has been favoured namely that provision to the amount of l was left for the unfortunate young person who is the subject of mr bensons letter this sum is in the hands of mrs morgan as well as a note from mrs bellingham to the miserable girl in which she proposes to procure her admission into the fordham penitentiary the best place for such a character as by this profligate action she has forfeited the only friend remaining to her in the world this proposition mrs bellingham repeats and they are the young womans best friends who most urge her to comply with the course now pointed out take care mr bellingham hears nothing of this mr bensons note said mrs bellingham as she delivered the answer to her maid he is so sensitive just now that it would annoy him sadly i am sure chapter xi thurstan and faith benson you have now seen the note which was delivered into mr bensons hands as the cool shades of evening stole over the glowing summer sky when he had read it he again prepared to write a few hasty lines before the post went out the postboy was even now sounding his horn through the village as a signal for letters to be ready and it was well that mr benson in his long mornings meditation had decided upon the course to be pursued in case of such an answer as that which he had received from mrs bellingham his present note was as follows dear faithyou must come to this place directly where i earnestly desire you and your advice i am well myself so do not be alarmed i have no time for explanation but i am sure you will not refuse me let me trust that i shall see you on saturday at the latest you know the mode by which i came it is the best for expedition and cheapness dear faith do not fail me your affectionate brother thurstan benson psi am afraid the money i left may be running short do not let this stop you take my facciolati to johnsons he will advance upon it it is the third row bottom shelf only come when this letter was despatched he had done all he could and the next two days passed like a long monotonous dream of watching thought and care undisturbed by any event hardly by the change from day to night which now the harvest moon was at her full was scarcely perceptible on saturday morning the answer came dearest thurstanyour incomprehensible summons has just reached me and i obey thereby proving my right to my name of faith i shall be with you almost as soon as this letter i cannot help feeling anxious as well as curious i have money enough and it is well i have for sally who guards your room like a dragon would rather see me walk the whole way than have any of your things disturbed your affectionate sister faith benson it was a great relief to mr benson to think that his sister would so soon be with him he had been accustomed from childhood to rely on her prompt judgment and excellent sense and to her care he felt that ruth ought to be consigned as it was too much to go on taxing good mrs hughes with night watching and sick nursing with all her other claims on her time he asked her once more to sit by ruth while he went to meet his sister the coach passed by the foot of the steep ascent which led up to llandhu he took a boy to carry his sisters luggage when she arrived they were too soon at the bottom of the hill and the boy began to make ducks and drakes in the shallowest part of the stream which there flowed glassy and smooth while mr benson sat down on a great stone under the shadow of an alder bush which grew where the green flat meadow skirted the water it was delightful to be once more in the open air and away from the scenes and thoughts which had been pressing on him for the last three days there was new beauty in everything from the blue mountains which glimmered in the distant sunlight down to the flat rich peaceful vale with its calm round shadows where he sat the very margin of white pebbles which lay on the banks of the stream had a sort of cleanly beauty about it he felt calmer and more at ease than he had done for some days and yet when he began to think it was rather a strange story which he had to tell his sister in order to account for his urgent summons here was he sole friend and guardian of a poor sick girl whose very name he did not know about whom all that he did know was that she had been the mistress of a man who had deserted her and that he fearedhe believedshe had contemplated suicide the offence too was one for which his sister good and kind as she was had little compassion well he must appeal to her love for him which was a very unsatisfactory mode of proceeding as he would far rather have had her interest in the girl founded on reason or some less personal basis than showing it merely because her brother wished it the coach came slowly rumbling over the stony road his sister was outside but got down in a brisk active way and greeted her brother heartily and affectionately she was considerably taller than he was and must have been very handsome her black hair was parted plainly over her forehead and her dark expressive eyes and straight nose still retained the beauty of her youth i do not know whether she was older than her brother but probably owing to his infirmity requiring her care she had something of a mothers manner towards him thurstan you are looking pale i do not believe you are well whatever you may say have you had the old pain in your back noa littlenever mind that dearest faith sit down here while i send the boy up with your box and then with some little desire to show his sister how well he was acquainted with the language he blundered out his directions in very grammatical welsh so grammatical in fact and so badly pronounced that the boy scratching his head made answer dim saesoneg so he had to repeat it in english well now thurstan here i sit as you bid me but dont try me too long tell me why you sent for me now came the difficulty and oh for a seraphs tongue and a seraphs powers of representation but there was no seraph at hand only the soft running waters singing a quiet tune and predisposing miss benson to listen with a soothed spirit to any tale not immediately involving her brothers welfare which had been the cause of her seeing that lovely vale it is an awkward story to tell faith but there is a young woman lying ill at my lodgings whom i wanted you to nurse he thought he saw a shadow on his sisters face and detected a slight change in her voice as she spoke nothing very romantic i hope thurstan remember i cannot stand much romance i always distrust it i dont know what you mean by romance the story is real enough and not out of the common way im afraid he paused he did not get over the difficulty well tell it me at once thurstan i am afraid you have let some one or perhaps only your own imagination impose upon you but dont try my patience too much you know ive no great stock then ill tell you the young girl was brought to the inn here by a gentleman who has left her she is very ill and has no one to see after her miss benson had some masculine tricks and one was whistling a long low whistle when surprised or displeased she had often found it a useful vent for feelings and she whistled now her brother would rather she had spoken have you sent for her friends she asked at last she has none another pause and another whistle but rather softer and more wavering than the last how is she ill pretty nearly as quiet as if she were dead she does not speak or move or even sigh it would be better for her to die at once i think faith that one word put them right it was spoken in the tone which had authority over her it was so full of grieved surprise and mournful upbraiding she was accustomed to exercise a sway over him owing to her greater decision of character and probably if everything were traced to its cause to her superior vigour of constitution but at times she was humbled before his pure childlike nature and felt where she was inferior she was too good and true to conceal this feeling or to resent its being forced upon her after a time she said thurstan dear let us go to her she helped him with tender care and gave him her arm up the long and tedious hill but when they approached the village without speaking a word on the subject they changed their position and she leant apparently on him he stretched himself up into as vigorous a gait as he could when they drew near to the abodes of men on the way they had spoken but little he had asked after various members of his congregation for he was a dissenting minister in a country town and she had answered but they neither of them spoke of ruth though their minds were full of her mrs hughes had tea ready for the traveller on her arrival mr benson chafed a little internally at the leisurely way in which his sister sipped and sipped and paused to tell him some trifling particular respecting home affairs which she had forgotten before mr bradshaw has refused to let the children associate with the dixons any longer because one evening they played at acting charades indeeda little more bread and butter faith thank you this welsh air does make one hungry mrs bradshaw is paying poor old maggies rent to save her from being sent into the workhouse thats right wont you have another cup of tea i have had two however i think ill take another mr benson could not refrain from a little sigh as he poured it out he thought he had never seen his sister so deliberately hungry and thirsty before he did not guess that she was feeling the meal rather a respite from a distasteful interview which she was aware was awaiting her at its conclusion but all things come to an end and so did miss bensons tea now will you go and see her yes and so they went mrs hughes had pinned up a piece of green calico by way of a venetian blind to shut out the afternoon sun and in the light thus shaded lay ruth still and wan and white even with her brothers account of ruths state such deathlike quietness startled miss bensonstartled her into pity for the poor lovely creature who lay thus stricken and felled when she saw her she could no longer imagine her to be an impostor or a hardened sinner such prostration of woe belonged to neither mr benson looked more at his sisters face than at ruths he read her countenance as a book mrs hughes stood by crying mr benson touched his sister and they left the room together do you think she will live asked he i cannot tell said miss benson in a softened voice but how young she looks quite a child poor creature when will the doctor come thurstan tell me all about her you have never told me the particulars mr benson might have said she had never cared to hear them before and had rather avoided the subject but he was too happy to see this awakening of interest in his sisters warm heart to say anything in the least reproachful he told her the story as well as he could and as he felt it deeply he told it with hearts eloquence and as he ended and looked at her there were tears in the eyes of both and what does the doctor say asked she after a pause he insists upon quiet he orders medicines and strong broth i cannot tell you all mrs hughes can she has been so truly good doing good hoping for nothing again she looks very sweet and gentle i shall sit up tonight and watch her myself and i shall send you and mrs hughes early to bed for you have both a worn look about you i dont like are you sure the effect of that fall has gone off do you feel anything of it in your back still after all i owe her something for turning back to your help are you sure she was going to drown herself i cannot be sure for i have not questioned her she has not been in a state to be questioned but i have no doubt whatever about it but you must not think of sitting up after your journey faith answer me thurstan do you feel any bad effect from that fall no hardly any dont sit up faith tonight thurstan its no use talking for i shall and if you go on opposing me i dare say i shall attack your back and put a blister on it do tell me what that hardly any means besides to set you quite at ease you know i have never seen mountains before and they fill me and oppress me so much that i could not sleep i must keep awake this first night and see that they dont fall on the earth and overwhelm it and now answer my questions about yourself miss benson had the power which some people have of carrying her wishes through to their fulfilment her will was strong her sense was excellent and people yielded to herthey did not know why before ten oclock she reigned sole power and potentate in ruths little chamber nothing could have been better devised for giving her an interest in the invalid the very dependence of one so helpless upon her care inclined her heart towards her she thought she perceived a slight improvement in the symptoms during the night and she was a little pleased that this progress should have been made while she reigned monarch of the sickroom yes certainly there was an improvement there was more consciousness in the look of the eyes although the whole countenance still retained its painful traces of acute suffering manifested in an anxious startled uneasy aspect it was broad morning light though barely five oclock when miss benson caught the sight of ruths lips moving as if in speech miss benson stooped down to listen who are you asked ruth in the faintest of whispers miss bensonmr bensons sister she replied the words conveyed no knowledge to ruth on the contrary weak as a babe in mind and body as she was her lips began to quiver and her eyes to show a terror similar to that of any little child who wakens in the presence of a stranger and sees no dear familiar face of mother or nurse to reassure its trembling heart miss benson took her hand in hers and began to stroke it caressingly dont be afraid dear im a friend come to take care of you would you like some tea now my love the very utterance of these gentle words was unlocking miss bensons heart her brother was surprised to see her so full of interest when he came to inquire later on in the morning it required mrs hughess persuasions as well as his own to induce her to go to bed for an hour or two after breakfast and before she went she made them promise that she should be called when the doctor came he did not come until late in the afternoon the invalid was rallying fast though rallying to a consciousness of sorrow as was evinced by the tears which came slowly rolling down her pale sad cheekstears which she had not the power to wipe away mr benson had remained in the house all day to hear the doctors opinion and now that he was relieved from the charge of ruth by his sisters presence he had the more time to dwell upon the circumstances of her caseso far as they were known to him he remembered his first sight of her her little figure swaying to and fro as she balanced herself on the slippery stones half smiling at her own dilemma with a bright happy light in the eyes that seemed like a reflection from the glancing waters sparkling below then he recalled the changed affrighted look of those eyes as they met his after the childs rebuff of her advanceshow that little incident filled up the tale at which mrs hughes had hinted in a kind of sorrowful way as if loath as a christian should be to believe evil then that fearful evening when he had only just saved her from committing suicide and that nightmare sleep and now lost forsaken and but just delivered from the jaws of death she lay dependent for everything on his sister and himutter strangers a few weeks ago where was her lover could he be easy and happy could he grow into perfect health with these great sins pressing on his conscience with a strong and hard pain or had he a conscience into whole labyrinths of social ethics mr bensons thoughts wandered when his sister entered suddenly and abruptly what does the doctor say is she better oh yes shes better answered miss benson sharp and short her brother looked at her in dismay she bumped down into a chair in a cross disconcerted manner they were both silent for a few minutes only miss benson whistled and clucked alternately what is the matter faith you say she is better why thurstan there is something so shocking the matter that i cannot tell you mr benson changed colour with affright all things possible and impossible crossed his mind but the right one i said all things possible i made a mistake he never believed ruth to be more guilty than she seemed faith i wish you would tell me and not bewilder me with those noises of yours said he nervously i beg your pardon but something so shocking has just been discoveredi dont know how to word itshe will have a child the doctor says so she was allowed to make noises unnoticed for a few minutes her brother did not speak at last she wanted his sympathy isnt it shocking thurstan you might have knocked me down with a straw when he told me does she know yes and i am not sure that that isnt the worst part of all howwhat do you mean oh i was just beginning to have a good opinion of her but im afraid she is very depraved after the doctor was gone she pulled the bedcurtain aside and looked as if she wanted to speak to me i cant think how she heard for we were close to the window and spoke very low well i went to her though i really had taken quite a turn against her and she whispered quite eagerly did he say i should have a baby of course i could not keep it from her but i thought it my duty to look as cold and severe as i could she did not seem to understand how it ought to be viewed but took it just as if she had a right to have a baby she said oh my god i thank thee oh i will be so good i had no patience with her then so i left the room who is with her mrs hughes she is not seeing the thing in a moral light as i should have expected mr benson was silent again after some time he began faith i dont see this affair quite as you do i believe i am right you surprise me brother i dont understand you wait awhile i want to make my feelings very clear to you but i dont know where to begin or how to express myself it is indeed an extraordinary subject for us to have to talk about but if once i get clear of this girl ill wash my hands of all such cases again her brother was not attending to her he was reducing his own ideas to form faith do you know i rejoice in this childs advent may god forgive you thurstanif you know what you are saying but surely it is a temptation dear thurstan i do not think it is a delusion the sin appears to me to be quite distinct from its consequences sophistryand a temptation said miss benson decidedly no it is not said her brother with equal decision in the eye of god she is exactly the same as if the life she has led had left no trace behind we knew her errors before faith yes but not this disgracethis badge of her shame faith faith let me beg of you not to speak so of the little innocent babe who may be gods messenger to lead her back to him think again of her first wordsthe burst of nature from her heart did she not turn to god and enter into a covenant with himi will be so good why it draws her out of herself if her life has hitherto been selfseeking and wickedly thoughtless here is the very instrument to make her forget herself and be thoughtful for another teach her and god will teach her if man does not come between to reverence her child and this reverence will shut out sinwill be purification he was very much excited he was even surprised at his own excitement but his thoughts and meditations through the long afternoon had prepared his mind for this manner of viewing the subject these are quite new ideas to me said miss benson coldly i think you thurstan are the first person i ever heard rejoicing over the birth of an illegitimate child it appears to me i must own rather questionable morality i do not rejoice i have been all this afternoon mourning over the sin which has blighted this young creature i have been dreading lest as she recovered consciousness there should be a return of her despair i have been thinking of every holy word every promise to the penitentof the tenderness which led the magdalen aright i have been feeling severely and reproachfully the timidity which has hitherto made me blink all encounter with evils of this particular kind oh faith once for all do not accuse me of questionable morality when i am trying more than ever i did in my life to act as my blessed lord would have done he was very much agitated his sister hesitated and then she spoke more softly than before but thurstan everything might have been done to lead her right as you call it without this child this miserable offspring of sin the world has indeed made such children miserable innocent as they are but i doubt if this be according to the will of god unless it be his punishment for the parents guilt and even then the worlds way of treatment is too apt to harden the mothers natural love into something like hatred shame and the terror of friends displeasure turn her maddefile her holiest instincts and as for the fathersgod forgive them i cannotat least not just now miss benson thought on what her brother said at length she asked thurstan remember im not convinced how would you have this girl treated according to your theory it will require some time and much christian love to find out the best way i know im not very wise but the way i think it would be right to act in would be this he thought for some time before he spoke and then said she has incurred a responsibilitythat we both acknowledge she is about to become a mother and have the direction and guidance of a little tender life i fancy such a responsibility must be serious and solemn enough without making it into a heavy and oppressive burden so that human nature recoils from bearing it while we do all we can to strengthen her sense of responsibility i would likewise do all we can to make her feel that it is responsibility for what may become a blessing whether the children are legitimate or illegitimate asked miss benson drily yes said her brother firmly the more i think the more i believe i am right no one said he blushing faintly as he spoke can have a greater recoil from profligacy than i have you yourself have not greater sorrow over this young creatures sin than i have the difference is this you confuse the consequences with the sin i dont understand metaphysics i am not aware that i am talking metaphysics i can imagine that if the present occasion be taken rightly and used well all that is good in her may be raised to a height unmeasured but by god while all that is evil and dark may by his blessing fade and disappear in the pure light of her childs presence oh father listen to my prayer that her redemption may date from this time help us to speak to her in the loving spirit of thy holy son the tears were full in his eyes he almost trembled in his earnestness he was faint with the strong power of his own conviction and with his inability to move his sister but she was shaken she sat very still for a quarter of an hour or more while he leaned back exhausted by his own feelings the poor child said she at lengththe poor poor child what it will have to struggle through and endure do you remember thomas wilkins and the way he threw the registry of his birth and baptism back in your face why he would not have the situation he went to sea and was drowned rather than present the record of his shame i do remember it all it has often haunted me she must strengthen her child to look to god rather than to mans opinion it will be the discipline the penance she has incurred she must teach it to be humanly speaking selfdependent but after all said miss benson for she had known and esteemed poor thomas wilkins and had mourned over his untimely death and the recollection thereof softened herafter all it might be concealed the very child need never know its illegitimacy how asked her brother whywe know so little about her yet but in that letter it said she had no friendsnow could she not go into quite a fresh place and be passed off as a widow ah tempter unconscious tempter here was a way of evading the trials for the poor little unborn child of which mr benson had never thought it was the decisionthe pivot on which the fate of years moved and he turned it the wrong way but it was not for his own sake for himself he was brave enough to tell the truth for the little helpless baby about to enter a cruel biting world he was tempted to evade the difficulty he forgot what he had just said of the discipline and penance to the mother consisting in strengthening her child to meet trustfully and bravely the consequences of her own weakness he remembered more clearly the wild fierceness the cainlike look of thomas wilkins as the obnoxious word in the baptismal registry told him that he must go forth branded into the world with his hand against every mans and every mans against him how could it be managed faith nay i must know much more which she alone can tell us before i can see how it is to be managed it is certainly the best plan perhaps it is said her brother thoughtfully but no longer clearly or decidedly and so the conversation dropped ruth moved the bedcurtain aside in her soft manner when miss benson reentered the room she did not speak but she looked at her as if she wished her to come near miss benson went and stood by her ruth took her hand in hers and kissed it then as if fatigued even by this slight movement she fell asleep miss benson took up her work and thought over her brothers speeches she was not convinced but she was softened and bewildered chapter xii losing sight of the welsh mountains miss benson continued in an undecided state of mind for the two next days but on the third as they sat at breakfast she began to speak to her brother that young creatures name is ruth hilton indeed how did you find it out from herself of course she is much stronger i slept with her last night and i was aware she was awake long before i liked to speak but at last i began i dont know what i said or how it went on but i think it was a little relief to her to tell me something about herself she sobbed and cried herself to sleep i think she is asleep now tell me what she said about herself oh it was really very little it was evidently a most painful subject she is an orphan without brother or sister and with a guardian whom i think she said she never saw but once he apprenticed her after her fathers death to a dressmaker this mr bellingham got acquainted with her and they used to meet on sunday afternoons one day they were late lingering on the road when the dressmaker came up by accident she seems to have been very angry and not unnaturally so the girl took fright at her threats and the lover persuaded her to go off with him to london there and then last may i think it was thats all did she express any sorrow for her error no not in words but her voice was broken with sobs though she tried to make it steady after a while she began to talk about her baby but shyly and with much hesitation she asked me how much i thought she could earn as a dressmaker by working very very hard and that brought us round to her child i thought of what you had said thurstan and i tried to speak to her as you wished me i am not sure if it was right i am doubtful in my own mind still dont be doubtful faith dear faith i thank you for your kindness there is really nothing to thank me for it is almost impossible to help being kind to her there is something so meek and gentle about her so patient and so grateful what does she think of doing poor child she thinks of taking lodgingsvery cheap ones she says there she means to work night and day to earn enough for her child for she said to me with such pretty earnestness it must never know want whatever i do i have deserved suffering but it will be such a little innocent darling her utmost earnings would not be more than seven or eight shillings a week im afraid and then she is so young and so pretty there is that fifty pounds mrs morgan brought me and those two letters does she know about them yet no i did not like to tell her till she is a little stronger oh thurstan i wish there was not this prospect of a child i cannot help it i doi could see a way in which we might help her if it were not for that how do you mean oh its no use thinking of it as it is or else we might have taken her home with us and kept her till she had got a little dressmaking in the congregation but for this meddlesome child that spoils everything you must let me grumble to you thurstan i was very good to her and spoke as tenderly and respectfully of the little thing as if it were the queens and born in lawful matrimony thats right my dear faith grumble away to me if you like ill forgive you for the kind thought of taking her home with us but do you think her situation is an insuperable objection why thurstanits so insuperable it puts it quite out of the question howthats only repeating your objection why is it out of the question if there had been no child coming we might have called her by her right namemiss hilton thats one thing then another is the baby in our house why sally would go distraught never mind sally if she were an orphan relation of our own left widowed said he pausing as if in doubt you yourself suggested she should be considered as a widow for the childs sake im only taking up your ideas dear faith i respect you for thinking of taking her home it is just what we ought to do thank you for reminding me of my duty nay it was only a passing thought think of mr bradshaw oh i tremble at the thought of his grim displeasure we must think of a higher than mr bradshaw i own i should be a very coward if he knew he is so severe so inflexible but after all he sees so little of us he never comes to tea you know but is always engaged when mrs bradshaw comes i dont think he knows of what our household consists not know sally oh yes but he does he asked mrs bradshaw one day if she knew what wages we gave her and said we might get a far more efficient and younger servant for the money and speaking about money think what our expenses would be if we took her home for the next six months that consideration was a puzzling one and both sat silent and perplexed for a time miss benson was as sorrowful as her brother for she was becoming as anxious as he was to find it possible that her plan could be carried out theres the fifty pounds said he with a sigh of reluctance at the idea yes theres the fifty pounds echoed his sister with the same sadness in her tone i suppose it is hers i suppose it is and being so we must not think who gave it to her it will defray her expenses i am very sorry but i think we must take it it would never do to apply to him under the present circumstances said miss benson in a hesitating manner no that we wont said her brother decisively if she consents to let us take care of her we will never let her stoop to request anything from him even for his child she can live on bread and water we can all live on bread and water rather than that then i will speak to her and propose the plan oh thurstan from a child you could persuade me to anything i hope i am doing right however much i oppose you at first i am sure to yield soon almost in proportion to my violence at first i think i am very weak no not in this instance we are both right i in the way in which the child ought to be viewed you dear good faith for thinking of taking her home with us god bless you dear for it when ruth began to sit up and the strange new delicious prospect of becoming a mother seemed to give her some mysterious source of strength so that her recovery was rapid and swift from that time miss benson brought her the letters and the banknote do you recollect receiving this letter ruth asked she with grave gentleness ruth changed colour and took it and read it again without making any reply to miss benson then she sighed and thought a while and then took up and read the second notethe note which mrs bellingham had sent to mr benson in answer to his after that she took up the banknote and turned it round and round but not as if she saw it miss benson noticed that her fingers trembled sadly and that her lips were quivering for some time before she spoke if you please miss benson i should like to return this money why my dear i have a strong feeling against taking it while he said she deeply blushing and letting her large white lids drop down and veil her eyes loved me he gave me many thingsmy watchoh many things and i took them from him gladly and thankfully because he loved mefor i would have given him anythingand i thought of them as signs of love but this money pains my heart he has left off loving me and has gone away this money seemsoh miss bensonit seems as if he could comfort me for being forsaken by money and at that word the tears so long kept back and repressed forced their way like rain she checked herself however in the violence of her emotion for she thought of her child so will you take the trouble of sending it back to mrs bellingham that i will my dear i am glad of it that i am they dont deserve to have the power of giving they dont deserve that you should take it miss benson went and enclosed it up there and then simply writing these words in the envelope from ruth hilton and now we wash our hands of these bellinghams said she triumphantly but ruth looked tearful and sad not about returning the note but from the conviction that the reason she had given for the ground of her determination was truehe no longer loved her to cheer her miss benson began to speak of the future miss benson was one of those people who the more she spoke of a plan in its details and the more she realised it in her own mind the more firmly she became a partisan of the project thus she grew warm and happy in the idea of taking ruth home but ruth remained depressed and languid under the conviction that he no longer loved her no home no future but the thought of her child could wean her from this sorrow miss benson was a little piqued and this pique showed itself afterwards in talking to her brother of the mornings proceedings in the sickchamber i admired her at the time for sending away her fifty pounds so proudly but i think she has a cold heart she hardly thanked me at all for my proposal of taking her home with us her thoughts are full of other things just now and people have such different ways of showing feeling some by silence some by words at any rate it is unwise to expect gratitude what do you expectnot indifference or ingratitude it is better not to expect or calculate consequences the longer i live the more fully i see that let us try simply to do right actions without thinking of the feelings they are to call out in others we know that no holy or selfdenying effort can fall to the ground vain and useless but the sweep of eternity is large and god alone knows when the effect is to be produced we are trying to do right now and to feel right dont let us perplex ourselves with endeavouring to map out how she should feel or how she should show her feelings thats all very fine and i dare say very true said miss benson a little chagrined but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush and i would rather have had one good hearty thank you now for all i have been planning to do for her than the grand effects you promise me in the sweep of eternity dont be grave and sorrowful thurstan or ill go out of the room i can stand sallys scoldings but i cant bear your look of quiet depression whenever i am a little hasty or impatient i had rather you would give me a good box on the ear and i would often rather you would speak if ever so hastily instead of whistling so if i box your ears when i am vexed with you will you promise to scold me when you are put out of the way instead of whistling very well thats a bargain you box and i scold but seriously i began to calculate our money when she so cavalierly sent off the fiftypound note i cant help admiring her for it and i am very much afraid we shall not have enough to pay the doctors bill and take her home with us she must go inside the coach whatever we do said mr benson decidedly whos there come in oh mrs hughes sit down indeed sir and i cannot stay but the young lady has just made me find up her watch for her and asked me to get it sold to pay the doctor and the little things she has had since she came and please sir indeed i dont know where to sell it nearer than carnarvon that is good of her said miss benson her sense of justice satisfied and remembering the way in which ruth had spoken of the watch she felt what a sacrifice it must have been to resolve to part with it and her goodness just helps us out of our dilemma said her brother who was unaware of the feelings with which ruth regarded her watch or perhaps he might have parted with his facciolati mrs hughes patiently awaited their leisure for answering her practical question where could the watch be sold suddenly her face brightened mr jones the doctor is going to be married perhaps he would like nothing better than to give this pretty watch to his bride indeed and i think its very likely and hell pay money for it as well as letting alone his bill ill ask him sir at any rate mr jones was only too glad to obtain possession of so elegant a present at so cheap a rate he even as mrs hughes had foretold paid money for it more than was required to defray the expenses of ruths accommodation as the most of the articles of food she had were paid for at the time by mr or miss benson but they strictly forbade mrs hughes to tell ruth of this would you object to my buying you a black gown said miss benson to her the day after the sale of the watch she hesitated a little and then went on my brother and i think it would be better to call youas if in fact you werea widow it will save much awkwardness and it will spare your child much mortification she was going to have added but that word did not exactly do but at the mention of her child ruth started and turned rubyred as she always did when allusion was made to it oh yes certainly thank you much for thinking of it indeed said she very low as if to herself i dont know how to thank you for all you are doing but i do love you and will pray for you if i may if you may ruth repeated miss benson in a tone of surprise yes if i may if you will let me pray for you certainly my dear my dear ruth you dont know how often i sin i do so wrong with my few temptations we are both of us great sinners in the eyes of the most holy let us pray for each other dont speak so again my dear at least not to me miss benson was actually crying she had always looked upon herself as so inferior to her brother in real goodness had seen such heights above her that she was distressed by ruths humility after a short time she resumed the subject then i may get you a black gownand we may call you mrs hilton no not mrs hilton said ruth hastily miss benson who had hitherto kept her eyes averted from ruths face from a motive of kindly delicacy now looked at her with surprise why not asked she it was my mothers name said ruth in a low voice i had better not be called by it then let us call you by my mothers name said miss benson tenderly she would have but ill talk to you about my mother some other time let me call you mrs denbigh it will do very well too people will think you are a distant relation when she told mr benson this choice of name he was rather sorry it was like his sisters impulsive kindnessimpulsive in everythingand he could imagine how ruths humility had touched her he was sorry but he said nothing and now the letter was written home announcing the probable arrival of the brother and sister on a certain day with a distant relation early left a widow as miss benson expressed it she desired the spare room might be prepared and made every provision she could think of for ruths comfort for ruth still remained feeble and weak when the black gown at which she had stitched away incessantly was finishedwhen nothing remained but to rest for the next days journeyruth could not sit still she wandered from window to window learning off each rock and tree by heart each had its tale which it was agony to remember but which it would have been worse agony to forget the sound of running waters she heard that quiet evening was in her ears as she lay on her deathbed so well had she learnt their tune and now all was over she had driven in to llandhu sitting by her lovers side living in the bright present and strangely forgetful of the past or the future she had dreamed out her dream and she had awakened from the vision of love she walked slowly and sadly down the long hill her tears fast falling but as quickly wiped away while she strove to make steady the low quivering voice which was often called upon to answer some remark of miss bensons they had to wait for the coach ruth buried her face in some flowers which mrs hughes had given her on parting and was startled when the mail drew up with a sudden pull which almost threw the horses on their haunches she was placed inside and the coach had set off again before she was fully aware that mr and miss benson were travelling on the outside but it was a relief to feel she might now cry without exciting their notice the shadow of a heavy thundercloud was on the valley but the little upland village church that showed the spot in which so much of her life had passed stood out clear in the sunshine she grudged the tears that blinded her as she gazed there was one passenger who tried after a while to comfort her dont cry miss said the kindhearted woman youre parting from friends maybe well thats bad enough but when you come to my age youll think none of it why ive three sons and theyre soldiers and sailors all of themhere there and everywhere one is in america beyond seas another is in china making tea and another is at gibraltar three miles from spain and yet you see i can laugh and eat and enjoy myself i sometimes think ill try and fret a bit just to make myself a better figure but lord its no use its against my nature so i laugh and grow fat again id be quite thankful for a fit of anxiety as would make me feel easy in my clothes which them mantymakers will make so tight im fairly throttled ruth durst cry no more it was no relief now she was watched and noticed and plied with a sandwich or a gingerbread each time she looked sad she lay back with her eyes shut as if asleep and went on and on the sun never seeming to move from his high place in the sky nor the bright hot day to show the least sign of waning every now and then miss benson scrambled down and made kind inquiries of the pale weary ruth and once they changed coaches and the fat old lady left her with a hearty shake of the hand it is not much further now said miss benson apologetically to ruth see we are losing sight of the welsh mountains we have about eighteen miles of plain and then we come to the moors and the rising ground amidst which eccleston lies i wish we were there for my brother is sadly tired the first wonder in ruths mind was why then if mr benson were so tired did they not stop where they were for the night for she knew little of the expenses of a night at an inn the next thought was to beg that mr benson would take her place inside the coach and allow her to mount up by miss benson she proposed this and miss benson was evidently pleased well if youre not tired it would make a rest and a change for him to be sure and if you were by me i could show you the first sight of eccleston if we reach there before it is quite dark so mr benson got down and changed places with ruth she hardly yet understood the numerous small economies which he and his sister had to practisethe little daily selfdenialsall endured so cheerfully and simply that they had almost ceased to require an effort and it had become natural to them to think of others before themselves ruth had not understood that it was for economy that their places had been taken on the outside of the coach while hers as an invalid requiring rest was to be the inside and that the biscuits which supplied the place of a dinner were in fact chosen because the difference in price between the two would go a little way towards fulfilling their plan for receiving her as an inmate her thought about money had been hitherto a childs thought the subject had never touched her but afterwards when she had lived a little with the bensons her eyes were opened and she remembered their simple kindness on the journey and treasured the remembrance of it in her heart a low grey cloud was the first sign of eccleston it was the smoke of the town hanging over the plain beyond the place where she was expected to believe it existed arose round waving uplands nothing to the fine outlines of the welsh mountains but still going up nearer to heaven than the rest of the flat world into which she had now entered rumbling stones lampposts a sudden stop and they were in the town of eccleston and a strange uncouth voice on the dark side of the coach was heard to say be ye there measter yes yes said miss benson quickly did sally send you ben get the ostlers lantern and look out the luggage chapter xiii the dissenting ministers household miss benson had resumed every morsel of the briskness which she had rather lost in the middle of the day her foot was on her native stones and a very rough set they were and she was near her home and among known people even mr benson spoke very cheerfully to ben and made many inquiries of him respecting people whose names were strange to ruth she was cold and utterly weary she took miss bensons offered arm and could hardly drag herself as far as the little quiet street in which mr bensons house was situated the street was so quiet that their footsteps sounded like a loud disturbance and announced their approach as effectually as the trumpets lordly blare did the coming of abdallah a door flew open and a lighted passage stood before them as soon as they had entered a stout elderly servant emerged from behind the door her face radiant with welcome eh bless ye are ye back again i thought i should ha been lost without ye she gave mr benson a hearty shake of the hand and kissed miss benson warmly then turning to ruth she said in a loud whisper whos yon mr benson was silent and walked a step onwards miss benson said boldly out the lady i named in my note sallymrs denbigh a distant relation aye but you said hoo was a widow is this chit a widow yes this is mrs denbigh answered miss benson if id been her mother id ha given her a lollypop instead of a husband hoo looks fitter for it hush sally sally look theres your master trying to move that heavy box miss benson calculated well when she called sallys attention to her master for it was well believed by every one and by sally herself that his deformity was owing to a fall he had had when he was scarcely more than a baby and entrusted to her carea little nursegirl as she then was not many years older than himself for years the poor girl had cried herself to sleep on her palletbed moaning over the blight her carelessness had brought upon her darling nor was this selfreproach diminished by the forgiveness of the gentle mother from whom thurstan benson derived so much of his character the way in which comfort stole into sallys heart was in the graduallyformed resolution that she would never leave him nor forsake him but serve him faithfully all her life long and she had kept to her word she loved miss benson but she almost worshipped the brother the reverence for him was in her heart however and did not always show itself in her manners but if she scolded him herself she allowed no one else that privilege if miss benson differed from her brother and ventured to think his sayings or doings might have been improved sally came down upon her like a thunderclap my goodness gracious master thurstan when will you learn to leave off meddling with other folks business here ben help me up with these trunks the little narrow passage was cleared and miss benson took ruth into the sittingroom there were only two sittingrooms on the groundfloor one behind the other out of the back room the kitchen opened and for this reason the back parlour was used as the family sittingroom or else being with its garden aspect so much the pleasanter of the two both sally and miss benson would have appropriated it for mr bensons study as it was the front room which looked to the street was his room and many a person coming for helphelp of which giving money was the lowest kindwas admitted and let forth by mr benson unknown to any one else in the house to make amends for his having the least cheerful room on the groundfloor he had the garden bedroom while his sister slept over his study there were two more rooms again over these with sloping ceilings though otherwise large and airy the attic looking into the garden was the spare bedroom while the front belonged to sally there was no room over the kitchen which was in fact a supplement to the house the sittingroom was called by the pretty oldfashioned name of the parlour while mr bensons room was styled the study the curtains were drawn in the parlour there was a bright fire and a clean hearth indeed exquisite cleanliness seemed the very spirit of the household for the door which was open to the kitchen showed a delicatelywhite and spotless floor and bright glittering tins on which the ruddy firelight danced from the place in which ruth sat she could see all sallys movements and though she was not conscious of close or minute observation at the time her body being weary and her mind full of other thoughts yet it was curious how faithfully that scene remained depicted on her memory in after years the warm light filled every corner of the kitchen in strong distinction to the faint illumination of the one candle in the parlour whose radiance was confined and was lost in the dead folds of windowcurtains carpet and furniture the square stout bustling figure neat and clean in every respect but dressed in the peculiar oldfashioned costume of the county namely a darkstriped linseywoolsey petticoat made very short displaying sturdy legs in woollen stockings beneath a loose kind of jacket called there a bedgown made of pink print a snowwhite apron and cap both of linen and the latter made in the shape of a mutchthese articles completed sallys costume and were painted on ruths memory whilst sally was busied in preparing tea miss benson took off ruths things and the latter instinctively felt that sally in the midst of her movements was watching their proceedings occasionally she also put in a word in the conversation and these little sentences were uttered quite in the tone of an equal if not of a superior she had dropped the more formal you with which at first she had addressed miss benson and thoud her quietly and habitually all these particulars sank unconsciously into ruths mind but they did not rise to the surface and become perceptible for a length of time she was weary and much depressed even the very kindness that ministered to her was overpowering but over the dark misty moor a little light shonea beacon and on that she fixed her eyes and struggled out of her present deep dejectionthe little child that was coming to her mr benson was as languid and weary as ruth and was silent during all this bustle and preparation his silence was more grateful to ruth than miss bensons many words although she felt their kindness after tea miss benson took her upstairs to her room the white dimity bed and the walls stained green had something of the colouring and purity of effect of a snowdrop while the floor rubbed with a mixture that turned it into a rich dark brown suggested the idea of the gardenmould out of which the snowdrop grows as miss benson helped the pale ruth to undress her voice became less fulltoned and hurried the hush of approaching night subdued her into a softened solemn kind of tenderness and the murmured blessing sounded like granted prayer when miss benson came downstairs she found her brother reading some letters which had been received during his absence she went and softly shut the door of communication between the parlour and the kitchen and then fetching a grey worsted stocking which she was knitting sat down near him her eyes not looking at her work but fixed on the fire while the eternal rapid click of the knittingneedles broke the silence of the room with a sound as monotonous and incessant as the noise of a handloom she expected him to speak but he did not she enjoyed an examination into and discussion of her feelings it was an interest and amusement to her while he dreaded and avoided all such conversation there were times when his feelings which were always earnest and sometimes morbid burst forth and defied control and overwhelmed him when a force was upon him compelling him to speak but he in general strove to preserve his composure from a fear of the compelling pain of such times and the consequent exhaustion his heart had been very full of ruth all day long and he was afraid of his sister beginning the subject so he read on or seemed to do so though he hardly saw the letter he held before him it was a great relief to him when sally threw open the middle door with a bang which did not indicate either calmness of mind or sweetness of temper is yon young woman going to stay any length o time with us asked she of miss benson mr benson put his hand gently on his sisters arm to check her from making any reply while he said we cannot exactly tell sally she will remain until after her confinement lord bless us and save usa baby in the house nay then my times come and ill pack up and begone i never could abide them things id sooner have rats in the house sally really did look alarmed why sally said mr benson smiling i was not much more than a baby when you came to take care of me yes you were master thurstan you were a fine bouncing lad of three year old and better then she remembered the change she had wrought in the fine bouncing lad and her eyes filled with tears which she was too proud to wipe away with her apron for as she sometimes said to herself she could not abide crying before folk well its no use talking sally said miss benson too anxious to speak to be any longer repressed weve promised to keep her and we must do it youll have none of the trouble sally so dont be afraid well i never as if i minded trouble you might ha known me better nor that ive scoured masters room twice over just to make the boards look white though the carpet is to cover them and now you go and cast up about me minding my trouble if thems the fashions youve learnt in wales im thankful ive never been there sally looked red indignant and really hurt mr benson came in with his musical voice and soft words of healing faith knows you dont care for trouble sally she is only anxious about this poor young woman who has no friends but ourselves we know there will be more trouble in consequence of her coming to stay with us and i think though we never spoke about it that in making our plans we reckoned on your kind help sally which has never failed us yet when we needed it youve twice the sense of your sister master thurstan that you have boys always has its truth there will be more trouble and i shall have my share ont i reckon i can face it if im told out and out but i cannot abide the way some folk has of denying theres trouble or pain to be met just as if their saying there was none would do away with it some folk treats one like a babby and i dont like it im not meaning you master thurstan no sally you need not say that i know well enough who you mean when you say some folk however i admit i was wrong in speaking as if you minded trouble for there never was a creature minded it less but i want you to like mrs denbigh said miss benson i dare say i should if youd let me alone i did na like her sitting down in masters chair set her up indeed in an armchair wi cushions wenches in my day were glad enough of stools she was tired tonight said mr benson we are all tired so if you have done your work sally come in to reading the three quiet people knelt down side by side and two of them prayed earnestly for them that had gone astray before ten oclock the household were in bed ruth sleepless weary restless with the oppression of a sorrow which she dared not face and contemplate bravely kept awake all the early part of the night many a time did she rise and go to the long casement window and look abroad over the still and quiet townover the grey stone walls and chimneys and old highpointed roofson to the faraway hilly line of the horizon lying calm under the bright moonshine it was late in the morning when she woke from her longdeferred slumbers and when she went downstairs she found mr and miss benson awaiting her in the parlour that homely pretty oldfashioned little room how bright and still and clean it looked the window all the windows at the back of the house were casements was open to let in the sweet morning air and streaming eastern sunshine the long jessamine sprays with their whitescented stars forced themselves almost into the room the little square garden beyond with grey stone walls all round was rich and mellow in its autumnal colouring running from deep crimson hollyhocks up to amber and gold nasturtiums and all toned down by the clear and delicate air it was so still that the gossamerwebs laden with dew did not tremble or quiver in the least but the sun was drawing to himself the sweet incense of many flowers and the parlour was scented with the odours of mignonette and stocks miss benson was arranging a bunch of china and damask roses in an oldfashioned jar they lay all dewy and fresh on the white breakfastcloth when ruth entered mr benson was reading in some large folio with gentle morning speech they greeted her but the quiet repose of the scene was instantly broken by sally popping in from the kitchen and glancing at ruth with sharp reproach she said i reckon i may bring in breakfast now with a strong emphasis on the last word i am afraid i am very late said ruth oh never mind said mr benson gently it was our fault for not telling you our breakfast hour we always have prayers at halfpast seven and for sallys sake we never vary from that time for she can so arrange her work if she knows the hour of prayers as to have her mind calm and untroubled ahem said miss benson rather inclined to testify against the invariable calmness of sallys mind at any hour of the day but her brother went on as if he did not hear her but the breakfast does not signify being delayed a little and i am sure you were sadly tired with your long day yesterday sally came slapping in and put down some withered tough dry toast with its not my doing if it is like leather but as no one appeared to hear her she withdrew to her kitchen leaving ruths cheeks like crimson at the annoyance she had caused all day long she had that feeling common to those who go to stay at a fresh house among comparative strangers a feeling of the necessity that she should become accustomed to the new atmosphere in which she was placed before she could move and act freely it was indeed a purer ether a diviner air which she was breathing in now than what she had been accustomed to for long months the gentle blessed mother who had made her childhoods home holy ground was in her very nature so far removed from any of earths stains and temptations that she seemed truly one of those who ask not if thine eye be on them who in love and truth where no misgiving is rely upon the genial sense of youth in the bensons house there was the same unconsciousness of individual merit the same absence of introspection and analysis of motive as there had been in her mother but it seemed that their lives were pure and good not merely from a lovely and beautiful nature but from some law the obedience to which was of itself harmonious peace and which governed them almost implicitly and with as little questioning on their part as the glorious stars which haste not rest not in their eternal obedience this household had many failings they were but human and with all their loving desire to bring their lives into harmony with the will of god they often erred and fell short but somehow the very errors and faults of one individual served to call out higher excellences in another and so they reacted upon each other and the result of short discords was exceeding harmony and peace but they had themselves no idea of the real state of things they did not trouble themselves with marking their progress by selfexamination if mr benson did sometimes in hours of sick incapacity for exertion turn inwards it was to cry aloud with almost morbid despair god be merciful to me a sinner but he strove to leave his life in the hands of god and to forget himself ruth sat still and quiet through the long first day she was languid and weary from her journey she was uncertain what help she might offer to give in the household duties and what she might not and in her languor and in her uncertainty it was pleasant to watch the new ways of the people among whom she was placed after breakfast mr benson withdrew to his study miss benson took away the cups and saucers and leaving the kitchen door open talked sometimes to ruth sometimes to sally while she washed them up sally had upstairs duties to perform for which ruth was thankful as she kept receiving rather angry glances for her unpunctuality as long as sally remained downstairs miss benson assisted in the preparation for the early dinner and brought some kidneybeans to shred into a basin of bright pure springwater which caught and danced in the sunbeams as she sat near the open casement of the parlour talking to ruth of things and people which as yet the latter did not understand and could not arrange and comprehend she was like a child who gets a few pieces of a dissected map and is confused until a glimpse of the whole unity is shown him mr and mrs bradshaw were the centre pieces in ruths map their children their servants were the accessories and one or two other names were occasionally mentioned ruth wondered and almost wearied at miss bensons perseverance in talking to her about people whom she did not know but in truth miss benson heard the longdrawn quivering sighs which came from the poor heavy heart when it was left to silence and had leisure to review the past and her quick accustomed ear caught also the low mutterings of the thunder in the distance in the shape of sallys soliloquies which like the asides at a theatre were intended to be heard suddenly miss benson called ruth out of the room upstairs into her own bedchamber and then began rummaging in little oldfashioned boxes drawn out of an equally oldfashioned bureau half desk half table and wholly drawers my dear ive been very stupid and thoughtless oh im so glad i thought of it before mrs bradshaw came to call here it is and she pulled out an old weddingring and hurried it on ruths finger ruth hung down her head and reddened deep with shame her eyes smarted with the hot tears that filled them miss benson talked on in a nervous hurried way it was my grandmothers its very broad they made them so then to hold a posy inside theres one in that thine own sweetheart till death doth part i think it is there there run away and look as if youd always worn it ruth went up to her room and threw herself down on her knees by the bedside and cried as if her heart would break and then as if a light had come down into her soul she calmed herself and prayedno words can tell how humbly and with what earnest feeling when she came down she was tearstained and wretchedly pale but even sally looked at her with new eyes because of the dignity with which she was invested by an earnestness of purpose which had her child for its object she sat and thought but she no longer heaved those bitter sighs which had wrung miss bensons heart in the morning in this way the day wore on early dinner early tea seemed to make it preternaturally long to ruth the only event was some unexplained absence of sallys who had disappeared out of the house in the evening much to miss bensons surprise and somewhat to her indignation at night after ruth had gone up to her room this absence was explained to her at least she had let down her long waving glossy hair and was standing absorbed in thought in the middle of the room when she heard a round clumping knock at her door different from that given by the small knuckles of delicate fingers and in walked sally with a judgelike severity of demeanour holding in her hand two widows caps of commonest make and coarsest texture queen eleanor herself when she presented the bowl to fair rosamond had not a more relentless purpose stamped on her demeanour than had sally at this moment she walked up to the beautiful astonished ruth where she stood in her long soft white dressinggown with all her luxuriant brown hair hanging dishevelled down her figure and thus sally spoke missusor miss as the case may beive my doubts as to you im not going to have my master and miss faith put upon or shame come near them widows wears these sort o caps and has their hair cut off and whether widows wears weddingrings or not they shall have their hair cut offthey shall ill have no half work in this house ive lived with the family fortynine year come michaelmas and ill not see it disgraced by any ones fine long curls sit down and let me snip off your hair and let me see you sham decently in a widows cap tomorrow or ill leave the house whattens come over miss faith as used to be as mim a lady as ever was to be taken by such as you i dunnot know here sit down with ye and let me crop you she laid no light hand on ruths shoulder and the latter partly intimidated by the old servant who had hitherto only turned her vixen lining to observation and partly because she was brokenspirited enough to be indifferent to the measure proposed quietly sat down sally produced the formidable pair of scissors that always hung at her side and began to cut in a merciless manner she expected some remonstrance or some opposition and had a torrent of words ready to flow forth at the least sign of rebellion but ruth was still and silent with meeklybowed head under the strange hands that were shearing her beautiful hair into the clipped shortness of a boys long before she had finished sally had some slight misgivings as to the fancied necessity of her task but it was too late for half the curls were gone and the rest must now come off when she had done she lifted up ruths face by placing her hand under the round white chin she gazed into the countenance expecting to read some anger there though it had not come out in words but she only met the large quiet eyes that looked at her with sad gentleness out of their finelyhollowed orbits ruths soft yet dignified submission touched sally with compunction though she did not choose to show the change in her feelings she tried to hide it indeed by stooping to pick up the long bright tresses and holding them up admiringly and letting them drop down and float on the air like the pendant branches of the weeping birch she said i thought we should ha had some cryingi did theyre pretty curls enough youve not been so bad to let them be cut off neither you see master thurstan is no wiser than a babby in some things and miss faith just lets him have his own way so its all left to me to keep him out of scrapes ill wish you a very good night ive heard many a one say as long hair was not wholesome good night but in a minute she popped her head into ruths room once more youll put on them caps tomorrow morning ill make you a present on them sally had carried away the beautiful curls and she could not find it in her heart to throw such lovely chestnut tresses away so she folded them up carefully in paper and placed them in a safe corner of her drawer chapter xiv ruths first sunday at eccleston ruth felt very shy when she came down at halfpast seven the next morning in her widows cap her smooth pale face with its oval untouched by time looked more young and childlike than ever when contrasted with the headgear usually associated with ideas of age she blushed very deeply as mr and miss benson showed the astonishment which they could not conceal in their looks she said in a low voice to miss benson sally thought i had better wear it miss benson made no reply but was startled at the intelligence which she thought was conveyed in this speech of sallys acquaintance with ruths real situation she noticed sallys looks particularly this morning the manner in which the old servant treated ruth had in it far more of respect than there had been the day before but there was a kind of satisfied way of braving out miss bensons glances which made the latter uncertain and uncomfortable she followed her brother into his study do you know thurstan i am almost certain sally suspects mr benson sighed the deception grieved him and yet he thought he saw its necessity what makes you think so asked he oh many little things it was her odd way of ducking her head about as if to catch a good view of ruths left hand that made me think of the weddingring and once yesterday when i thought i had made up quite a natural speech and was saying how sad it was for so young a creature to be left a widow she broke in with widow be farred in a very strange contemptuous kind of manner if she suspects we had far better tell her the truth at once she will never rest till she finds it out so we must make a virtue of necessity well brother you shall tell her then for i am sure i darent i dont mind doing the thing since you talked to me that day and since ive got to know ruth but i do mind all the clatter people will make about it but sally is not people oh i see it must be done shell talk as much as all the other persons put together so thats the reason i call her people shall i call her for the house was too homely and primitive to have bells sally came fully aware of what was now going to be told her and determined not to help them out in telling their awkward secret by understanding the nature of it before it was put into the plainest language in every pause when they hoped she had caught the meaning they were hinting at she persisted in looking stupid and perplexed and in saying well as if quite unenlightened as to the end of the story when it was all complete and plain before her she said honestly enough its just as i thought it was and i think you may thank me for having had the sense to put her into widows caps and clip off that bonny brown hair that was fitter for a bride in lawful matrimony than for such as her she took it very well though she was as quiet as a lamb and i clipped her pretty roughly at first i must say though if id ha known who your visitor was id ha packed up my things and cleared myself out of the house before such as her came into it as its done i suppose i must stand by you and help you through with it i only hope i shant lose my characterand me a parish clerks daughter oh sally people know you too well to think any ill of you said miss benson who was pleased to find the difficulty so easily got over for in truth sally had been much softened by the unresisting gentleness with which ruth had submitted to the clipping of the night before if id been with you master thurstan id ha seen sharp after you for youre always picking up some one or another as nobody else would touch with a pair of tongs why there was that nelly brandons child as was left at our door if i hadnt gone to th overseer we should have had that irish tramps babby saddled on us for life but i went off and told th overseer and th mother was caught yes said mr benson sadly and i often lie awake and wonder what is the fate of that poor little thing forced back on the mother who tried to get quit of it i often doubt whether i did right but its no use thinking about it now im thankful it isnt said sally and now if weve talked doctrine long enough ill go make th beds yon girls secret is safe enough for me saying this she left the room and miss benson followed she found ruth busy washing the breakfast things and they were done in so quiet and orderly a manner that neither miss benson nor sally both particular enough had any of their little fancies or prejudices annoyed she seemed to have an instinctive knowledge of the exact period when her help was likely to become a hindrance and withdrew from the busy kitchen just at the right time that afternoon as miss benson and ruth sat at their work mrs and miss bradshaw called miss benson was so nervous as to surprise ruth who did not understand the probable and possible questions which might be asked respecting any visitor at the ministers house ruth went on sewing absorbed in her own thoughts and glad that the conversation between the two elder ladies and the silence of the younger one who sat at some distance from her gave her an opportunity of retreating into the haunts of memory and soon the work fell from her hands and her eyes were fixed on the little garden beyond but she did not see its flowers or its walls she saw the mountains which girdled llandhu and saw the sun rise from behind their iron outline just as it had donehow long ago was it months or was it yearssince she had watched the night through crouched up at his door which was the dream and which the reality that distant life or this his moans rang more clearly in her ears than the buzzing of the conversation between mrs bradshaw and miss benson at length the subdued scaredlooking little lady and her brighteyed silent daughter rose to take leave ruth started into the present and stood up and curtseyed and turned sick at heart with sudden recollection miss benson accompanied mrs bradshaw to the door and in the passage gave her a long explanation of ruths fictitious history mrs bradshaw looked so much interested and pleased that miss benson enlarged a little more than was necessary and rounded off her invention with one or two imaginary details which she was quite unconscious were overheard by her brother through the halfopen study door she was rather dismayed when he called her into his room after mrs bradshaws departure and asked her what she had been saying about ruth oh i thought it was better to explain it thoroughlyi mean to tell the story we wished to have believed once for allyou know we agreed about that thurstan deprecatingly yes but i heard you saying you believed her husband had been a young surgeon did i not well thurstan you know he must have been something and young surgeons are so in the way of dying it seemed very natural besides said she with sudden boldness i do think ive a talent for fiction it is so pleasant to invent and make the incidents dovetail together and after all if we are to tell a lie we may as well do it thoroughly or else its of no use a bungling lie would be worse than useless and thurstanit may be very wrongbut i believei am afraid i enjoy not being fettered by truth dont look so grave you know it is necessary if ever it was to tell falsehoods now and dont be angry with me because i do it well he was shading his eyes with his hand and did not speak for some time at last he said if it were not for the child i would tell all but the world is so cruel you dont know how this apparent necessity for falsehood pains me faith or you would not invent all these details which are so many additional lies well well i will restrain myself if i have to talk about ruth again but mrs bradshaw will tell every one who need to know you dont wish me to contradict it thurstan surelyit was such a pretty probable story faith i hope god will forgive us if we are doing wrong and pray dear dont add one unnecessary word that is not true another day elapsed and then it was sunday and the house seemed filled with a deep peace even sallys movements were less hasty and abrupt mr benson seemed invested with a new dignity which made his bodily deformity be forgotten in his calm grave composure of spirit every trace of weekday occupation was put away the night before a bright new handsome tablecloth had been smoothed down over the table and the jars had been freshly filled with flowers sunday was a festival and a holy day in the house after the very early breakfast little feet pattered into mr bensons study for he had a class for boysa sort of domestic sundayschool only that there was more talking between teacher and pupils than dry absolute lessons going on miss benson too had her little neattippeted maidens sitting with her in the parlour and she was far more particular in keeping them to their reading and spelling than her brother was with his boys sally too put in her word of instruction from the kitchen helping as she fancied though her assistance was often rather malapropos for instance she called out to a little fat stupid rolypoly girl to whom miss benson was busy explaining the meaning of the word quadruped quadruped a thing wi four legs jenny a chair is a quadruped child but miss benson had a deaf manner sometimes when her patience was not too severely tried and she put it on now ruth sat on a low hassock and coaxed the least of the little creatures to her and showed it pictures till it fell asleep in her arms and sent a thrill through her at the thought of the tiny darling who would lie on her breast before long and whom she would have to cherish and to shelter from the storms of the world and then she remembered that she was once white and sinless as the wee lassie who lay in her arms and she knew that she had gone astray byandby the children trooped away and miss benson summoned her to put on her things for chapel the chapel was up a narrow street or rather culdesac close by it stood on the outskirts of the town almost in fields it was built about the time of matthew and philip henry when the dissenters were afraid of attracting attention or observation and hid their places of worship in obscure and outoftheway parts of the towns in which they were built accordingly it often happened as in the present case that the buildings immediately surrounding as well as the chapels themselves looked as if they carried you back to a period a hundred and fifty years ago the chapel had a picturesque and oldworld look for luckily the congregation had been too poor to rebuild it or newface it in george the thirds time the staircases which led to the galleries were outside at each end of the building and the irregular roof and worn stone steps looked grey and stained by time and weather the grassy hillocks each with a little upright headstone were shaded by a grand old wychelm a lilacbush or two a white rosetree and a few laburnums all old and gnarled enough were planted round the chapel yard and the casement windows of the chapel were made of heavyleaded diamondshaped panes almost covered with ivy producing a green gloom not without its solemnity within this ivy was the home of an infinite number of little birds which twittered and warbled till it might have been thought that they were emulous of the power of praise possessed by the human creatures within with such earnest longdrawn strains did this crowd of winged songsters rejoice and be glad in their beautiful gift of life the interior of the building was plain and simple as plain and simple could be when it was fitted up oaktimber was much cheaper than it is now so the woodwork was all of that description but roughly hewed for the early builders had not much wealth to spare the walls were whitewashed and were recipients of the shadows of the beauty without on their white plains the tracery of the ivy might be seen now still now stirred by the sudden flight of some little bird the congregation consisted of here and there a farmer with his labourers who came down from the uplands beyond the town to worship where their fathers worshipped and who loved the place because they knew how much those fathers had suffered for it although they never troubled themselves with the reason why they left the parish church of a few shopkeepers far more thoughtful and reasoning who were dissenters from conviction unmixed with old ancestral association and of one or two families of still higher worldly station with many poor who were drawn there by love for mr bensons character and by a feeling that the faith which made him what he was could not be far wrong for the base of the pyramid and with mr bradshaw for its apex the congregation stood complete the country people came in sleeking down their hair and treading with earnest attempts at noiseless lightness of step over the floor of the aisle and byandby when all were assembled mr benson followed unmarshalled and unattended when he had closed the pulpitdoor and knelt in prayer for an instant or two he gave out a psalm from the dear old scottish paraphrase with its primitive inversion of the simple perfect bible words and a kind of precentor stood up and having sounded the note on a pitchpipe sang a couple of lines by way of indicating the tune then all the congregation stood up and sang aloud mr bradshaws great bass voice being half a note in advance of the others in accordance with his place of precedence as principal member of the congregation his powerful voice was like an organ very badly played and very much out of tune but as he had no ear and no diffidence it pleased him very much to hear the fine loud sound he was a tall largeboned iron man stern powerful and authoritative in appearance dressed in clothes of the finest broadcloth and scrupulously illmade as if to show that he was indifferent to all outward things his wife was sweet and gentlelooking but as if she was thoroughly broken into submission ruth did not see this or hear aught but the words which were reverentlyoh how reverentlyspoken by mr benson he had had ruth present in his thoughts all the time he had been preparing for his sunday duty and he had tried carefully to eschew everything which she might feel as an allusion to her own case he remembered how the good shepherd in poussins beautiful picture tenderly carried the lambs which had wearied themselves by going astray and felt how like tenderness was required towards poor ruth but where is the chapter which does not contain something which a broken and contrite spirit may not apply to itself and so it fell out that as he read ruths heart was smitten and she sank down and down till she was kneeling on the floor of the pew and speaking to god in the spirit if not in the words of the prodigal son father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy child miss benson was thankful although she loved ruth the better for this selfabandonment that the ministers seat was far in the shade of the gallery she tried to look most attentive to her brother in order that mr bradshaw might not suspect anything unusual while she stealthily took hold of ruths passive hand as it lay helpless on the cushion and pressed it softly and tenderly but ruth sat on the ground bowed down and crushed in her sorrow till all was ended miss benson loitered in her seat divided between the consciousness that she as locum tenens for the ministers wife was expected to be at the door to receive the kind greetings of many after her absence from home and her unwillingness to disturb ruth who was evidently praying and by her quiet breathing receiving grave and solemn influences into her soul at length she rose up calm and composed even to dignity the chapel was still and empty but miss benson heard the buzz of voices in the chapelyard without they were probably those of people waiting for her and she summoned courage and taking ruths arm in hers and holding her hand affectionately they went out into the broad daylight as they issued forth miss benson heard mr bradshaws strong bass voice speaking to her brother and winced as she knew he would be wincing under the broad praise which is impertinence however little it may be intended or esteemed as such oh yesmy wife told me yesterday about herher husband was a surgeon my father was a surgeon too as i think you have heard very much to your credit i must say mr benson with your limited means to burden yourself with a poor relation very creditable indeed miss benson glanced at ruth she either did not hear or did not understand but passed on into the awful sphere of mr bradshaws observation unmoved he was in a bland and condescending humour of universal approval and when he saw ruth he nodded his head in token of satisfaction that ordeal was over miss benson thought and in the thought rejoiced after dinner you must go and lie down my dear said she untying ruths bonnetstrings and kissing her sally goes to church again but you wont mind staying alone in the house i am sorry we have so many people to dinner but my brother will always have enough on sundays for any old or weak people who may have come from a distance to stay and dine with us and today they all seem to have come because it is his first sabbath at home in this way ruths first sabbath passed over chapter xv mother and child here is a parcel for you ruth said miss benson on the tuesday morning for me said ruth all sorts of rushing thoughts and hopes filling her mind and turning her dizzy with expectation if it had been from him the newborn resolutions would have had a hard struggle for existence it is directed mrs denbigh said miss benson before giving it up it is in mrs bradshaws handwriting and far more curious than ruth she awaited the untying of the closeknotted string when the paper was opened it displayed a whole piece of delicate cambricmuslin and there was a short note from mrs bradshaw to ruth saying her husband had wished her to send this muslin in aid of any preparations mrs denbigh might have to make ruth said nothing but coloured up and sat down again to her employment very fine muslin indeed said miss benson feeling it and holding it up against the light with the air of a connoisseur yet all the time she was glancing at ruths grave face the latter kept silence and showed no wish to inspect her present further at last she said in a low voice i suppose i may send it back again my dear child send it back to mr bradshaw youd offend him for life you may depend upon it he means it as a mark of high favour what right had he to send it me asked ruth still in her quiet voice what right mr bradshaw thinks i dont know exactly what you mean by right ruth was silent for a moment and then said there are people to whom i love to feel that i owe gratitudegratitude which i cannot express and had better not talk aboutbut i cannot see why a person whom i do not know should lay me under an obligation oh dont say i must take this muslin please miss benson what miss benson might have said if her brother had not just then entered the room neither he nor any other person could tell but she felt his presence was most opportune and called him in as umpire he had come hastily for he had much to do but he no sooner heard the case than he sat down and tried to draw some more explicit declaration of her feeling from ruth who had remained silent during miss bensons explanation you would rather send this present back said he yes she answered softly is it wrong why do you want to return it because i feel as if mr bradshaw had no right to offer it me mr benson was silent its beautifully fine said miss benson still examining the piece you think that it is a right which must be earned yes said she after a minutes pause dont you i understand what you mean it is a delight to have gifts made to you by those whom you esteem and love because then such gifts are merely to be considered as fringes to the garmentas inconsiderable additions to the mighty treasure of their affection adding a grace but no additional value to what before was precious and proceeding as naturally out of that as leaves burgeon out upon the trees but you feel it to be different when there is no regard for the giver to idealise the giftwhen it simply takes its stand among your property as so much moneys value is this it ruth i think it is i never reasoned why i felt as i did i only knew that mr bradshaws giving me a present hurt me instead of making me glad well but there is another side of the case we have not looked at yetwe must think of that too you know who said do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you mr bradshaw may not have had that in his mind when he desired his wife to send you this he may have been selfseeking and only anxious to gratify his love of patronisingthat is the worst motive we can give him and that would be no excuse for your thinking only of yourself and returning his present but you would not have me pretend to be obliged asked ruth no i would not i have often been similarly situated to you ruth mr bradshaw has frequently opposed me on the points on which i feel the warmestam the most earnestly convinced he no doubt thinks me quixotic and often speaks of me and to me with great contempt when he is angry i suppose he has a little fit of penitence afterwards or perhaps he thinks he can pay for ungracious speeches by a present so formerly he invariably sent me something after these occasions it was a time of all others to feel as you are doing now but i became convinced it would be right to accept them giving only the very cool thanks which i felt this omission of all show of much gratitude had the best effectthe presents have much diminished but if the gifts have lessened the unjustifiable speeches have decreased in still greater proportion and i am sure we respect each other more take this muslin ruth for the reason i named and thank him as your feelings prompt you overstrained expressions of gratitude always seem like an endeavour to place the receiver of these expressions in the position of debtor for future favours but you wont fall into this error ruth listened to mr benson but she had not yet fallen sufficiently into the tone of his mind to understand him fully she only felt that he comprehended her better than miss benson who once more tried to reconcile her to her present by calling her attention to the length and breadth thereof i will do what you wish me she said after a little pause of thoughtfulness may we talk of something else mr benson saw that his sisters frame of mind was not particularly congenial with ruths any more than ruths was with miss bensons and putting aside all thought of returning to the business which had appeared to him so important when he came into the room but which principally related to himself he remained above an hour in the parlour interesting them on subjects far removed from the present and left them at the end of that time soothed and calm but the present gave a new current to ruths ideas her heart was as yet too sore to speak but her mind was crowded with plans she asked sally to buy her with the money produced by the sale of a ring or two the coarsest linen the homeliest dark blue print and similar materials on which she set busily to work to make clothes for herself and as they were made she put them on and as she put them on she gave a grace to each which such homely material and simple shaping had never had before then the fine linen and delicate soft white muslin which she had chosen in preference to more expensive articles of dress when mr bellingham had given her carte blanche in london were cut into small garments most daintily stitched and made ready for the little creature for whom in its white purity of soul nothing could be too precious the love which dictated this extreme simplicity and coarseness of attire was taken for stiff hard economy by mr bradshaw when he deigned to observe it and economy by itself without any soul or spirit in it to make it living and holy was a great merit in his eyes indeed ruth altogether found favour with him her quiet manner subdued by an internal consciousness of a deeper cause for sorrow than he was aware of he interpreted into a very proper and becoming awe of him he looked off from his own prayers to observe how well she attended to hers at chapel when he came to any verse in the hymn relating to immortality or a future life he sang it unusually loud thinking he should thus comfort her in her sorrow for her deceased husband he desired mrs bradshaw to pay her every attention she could and even once remarked that he thought her so respectable a young person that he should not object to her being asked to tea the next time mr and miss benson came he added that he thought indeed benson had looked last sunday as if he rather hoped to get an invitation and it was right to encourage the ministers and to show them respect even though their salaries were small the only thing against this mrs denbigh was the circumstance of her having married too early and without any provision for a family though ruth pleaded delicacy of health and declined accompanying mr and miss benson on their visit to mr bradshaw she still preserved her place in his esteem and miss benson had to call a little upon her talent for fiction to spare ruth from the infliction of further presents in making which his love of patronising delighted the yellow and crimson leaves came floating down on the still october air november followed bleak and dreary it was more cheerful when the earth put on her beautiful robe of white which covered up all the grey naked stems and loaded the leaves of the hollies and evergreens each with its burden of feathery snow when ruth sank down to languor and sadness miss benson trotted upstairs and rummaged up every article of spare or wornout clothing and bringing down a variety of strange materials she tried to interest ruth in making them up into garments for the poor but though ruths fingers flew through the work she still sighed with thought and remembrance miss benson was at first disappointed and then she was angry when she heard the low long sigh and saw the dreamy eyes filling with glittering tears she would say what is the matter ruth in a halfreproachful tone for the sight of suffering was painful to her she had done all in her power to remedy it and though she acknowledged a cause beyond her reach for ruths deep sorrow and in fact loved and respected her all the more for these manifestations of grief yet at the time they irritated her then ruth would snatch up the dropped work and stitch away with drooping eyes from which the hot tears fell fast and miss benson was then angry with herself yet not at all inclined to agree with sally when she asked her mistress why she kept mithering the poor lass with asking her for ever what was the matter as if she did not know well enough some element of harmony was wantingsome little angel of peace in loving whom all hearts and natures should be drawn together and their discords hushed the earth was still hiding her guilty front with innocent snow when a little baby was laid by the side of the pale white mother it was a boy beforehand she had wished for a girl as being less likely to feel the want of a fatheras being what a mother worse than widowed could most effectually shelter but now she did not think or remember this what it was she would not have exchanged for a wilderness of girls it was her own her darling her individual baby already though not an hour old separate and sole in her heart strangely filling up its measure with love and peace and even hope for here was a new pure beautiful innocent life which she fondly imagined in that early passion of maternal love she could guard from every touch of corrupting sin by ever watchful and most tender care and her mother had thought the same most probably and thousands of others think the same and pray to god to purify and cleanse their souls that they may be fit guardians for their little children oh how ruth prayed even while she was yet too weak to speak and how she felt the beauty and significance of the words our father she was roused from this holy abstraction by the sound of miss bensons voice it was very much as if she had been crying look ruth it said softly my brother sends you these they are the first snowdrops in the garden and she put them on the pillow by ruth the baby lay on the opposite side wont you look at him said ruth he is so pretty miss benson had a strange reluctance to see him to ruth in spite of all that had come and gone she was reconcilednay more she was deeply attached but over the baby there hung a cloud of shame and disgrace poor little creature her heart was closed against itfirmly as she thought but she could not resist ruths low faint voice nor her pleading eyes and she went round to peep at him as he lay in his mothers arm as yet his shield and guard sally says he will have black hair she thinks said ruth his little hand is quite a mans already just feel how firmly he closes it and with her own weak fingers she opened his little red fist and taking miss bensons reluctant hand placed one of her fingers in his grasp that babytouch called out her love the doors of her heart were thrown open wide for the little infant to go in and take possession ah my darling said ruth falling back weak and weary if god will but spare you to me never mother did more than i will i have done you a grievous wrongbut if i may but live i will spend my life in serving you and in serving god said miss benson with tears in her eyes you must not make him into an idol or god will perhaps punish you through him a pang of affright shot through ruths heart at these words had she already sinned and made her child into an idol and was there punishment already in store for her through him but then the internal voice whispered that god was our father and that he knew our frame and knew how natural was the first outburst of a mothers love so although she treasured up the warning she ceased to affright herself for what had already gushed forth now go to sleep ruth said miss benson kissing her and darkening the room but ruth could not sleep if her heavy eyes closed she opened them again with a start for sleep seemed to be an enemy stealing from her the consciousness of being a mother that one thought excluded all remembrance and all anticipation in those first hours of delight but soon remembrance and anticipation came there was the natural want of the person who alone could take an interest similar in kind though not in amount to the mothers and sadness grew like a giant in the still watches of the night when she remembered that there would be no father to guide and strengthen the child and place him in a favourable position for fighting the hard battle of life she hoped and believed that no one would know the sin of his parents and that that struggle might be spared to him but a fathers powerful care and mighty guidance would never be his and then in those hours of spiritual purification came the wonder and the doubt of how far the real father would be the one to whom with her desire of heaven for her child whatever might become of herself she would wish to entrust him slight speeches telling of a selfish worldly nature unnoticed at the time came back upon her ear having a new significance they told of a low standard of impatient selfindulgence of no acknowledgment of things spiritual and heavenly even while this examination was forced upon her by the new spirit of maternity that had entered into her and made her childs welfare supreme she hated and reproached herself for the necessity there seemed upon her of examining and judging the absent father of her child and so the compelling presence that had taken possession of her wearied her into a kind of feverish slumber in which she dreamt that the innocent babe that lay by her side in soft ruddy slumber had started up into mans growth and instead of the pure and noble being whom she had prayed to present as her child to our father in heaven he was a repetition of his father and like him lured some maiden who in her dream seemed strangely like herself only more utterly sad and desolate even than she into sin and left her there to even a worse fate than that of suicide for ruth believed there was a worse she dreamt she saw the girl wandering lost and that she saw her son in high places prosperousbut with more than blood on his soul she saw her son dragged down by the clinging girl into some pit of horrors into which she dared not look but from whence his fathers voice was heard crying aloud that in his day and generation he had not remembered the words of god and that now he was tormented in this flame then she started in sick terror and saw by the dim rushlight sally nodding in an armchair by the fire and felt her little soft warm babe nestled up against her breast rocked by her heart which yet beat hard from the effects of the evil dream she dared not go to sleep again but prayed and every time she prayed she asked with a more complete wisdom and a more utter and selfforgetting faith little child thy angel was with god and drew her nearer and nearer to him whose face is continually beheld by the angels of little children chapter xvi sally tells of her sweethearts and discourses on the duties of life sally and miss benson took it in turns to sit up or rather they took it in turns to nod by the fire for if ruth was awake she lay very still in the moonlight calm of her sick bed that time resembled a beautiful august evening such as i have seen the white snowy rolling mist covers up under its great sheet all trees and meadows and tokens of earth but it cannot rise high enough to shut out the heavens which on such nights seem bending very near and to be the only real and present objects and so near so real and present did heaven and eternity and god seem to ruth as she lay encircling her mysterious holy child one night sally found out she was not asleep im a rare hand at talking folks to sleep said she ill try on thee for thou must get strength by sleeping and eating what must i talk to thee about i wonder shall i tell thee a love story or a fairy story such as ive telled master thurstan many a time and many a time for all his father set his face again fairies and called it vain talking or shall i tell you the dinner i once cooked when mr harding as was miss faiths sweetheart came unlooked for and wed nought in the house but a neck of mutton out of which i made seven dishes all with a different name who was mr harding asked ruth oh he was a grand gentleman from lunnon as had seen miss faith and been struck by her pretty looks when she was out on a visit and came here to ask her to marry him she said no she would never leave master thurstan as could never marry but she pined a deal at after he went away she kept up afore master thurstan but i seed her fretting though i never let on that i did for i thought shed soonest get over it and be thankful at after shed the strength to do right however ive no business to be talking of miss bensons concerns ill tell you of my own sweethearts and welcome or ill tell you of the dinner which was the grandest thing i ever did in my life but i thought a lunnoner should never think country folks knew nothing and my word i puzzled him with his dinner im doubting whether to this day he knows whether what he was eating was fish flesh or fowl shall i tell you how i managed but ruth said she would rather hear about sallys sweethearts much to the disappointment of the latter who considered the dinner by far the greatest achievement well you see i dont know as i should call them sweethearts for excepting john rawson who was shut up in the madhouse the next week i never had what you may call a downright offer of marriage but once but i had once and so i may say i had a sweetheart i was beginning to be afeard though for one likes to be axed thats but civility and i remember after i had turned forty and afore jeremiah dixon had spoken i began to think john rawson had perhaps not been so very mad and that id done ill to lightly his offer as a madmans if it was to be the only one i was ever to have i dont mean as id have had him but i thought if it was to come oer again id speak respectful of him to folk and say it were only his way to go about on all fours but that he was a sensible man in most things however id had my laugh and so had others at my crazy lover and it was late now to set him up as a solomon however i thought it would be no bad thing to be tried again but i little thought the trial would come when it did you see saturday night is a leisure night in countinghouses and suchlike places while its the busiest of all for servants well it was a saturday night and id my baize apron on and the tails of my bedgown pinned together behind down on my knees pipeclaying the kitchen when a knock comes to the back door come in says i but it knocked again as if it were too stately to open the door for itself so i got up rather cross and opened the door and there stood jerry dixon mr holts head clerk only he was not head clerk then so i stood stopping up the door fancying he wanted to speak to master but he kind of pushed past me and telling me summut about the weather as if i could not see it for myself he took a chair and sat down by the oven cool and easy thought i meaning hisself not his place which i knew must be pretty hot well it seemed no use standing waiting for my gentleman to go not that he had much to say either but he kept twirling his hat round and round and smoothing the nap ont with the back of his hand so at last i squatted down to my work and thinks i i shall be on my knees all ready if he puts up a prayer for i knew he was a methodee by bringingup and had only lately turned to masters way of thinking and them methodees are terrible hands at unexpected prayers when one least looks for em i cant say i like their way of taking one by surprise as it were but then im a parish clerks daughter and could never demean myself to dissenting fashions always save and except master thurstans bless him however id been caught once or twice unawares so this time i thought id be up to it and i moved a dry duster wherever i went to kneel upon in case he began when i were in a wet place byandby i thought if the man would pray it would be a blessing for it would prevent his sending his eyes after me wherever i went for when they takes to praying they shuts their eyes and quivers th lids in a queer kind o waythem dissenters does i can speak pretty plain to you for youre bred in the church like mysel and must find it as out o the way as i do to be among dissenting folk god forbid i should speak disrespectful of master thurstan and miss faith though i never think on them as church or dissenters but just as christians but to come back to jerry first i tried always to be cleaning at his back but when he wheeled round so as always to face me i thought id try a different game so says i master dixon i ax your pardon but i must pipeclay under your chair will you please to move well he moved and byandby i was at him again with the same words and at after that again and again till he were always moving about wi his chair behind him like a snail as carries its house on its back and the great gaupus never seed that i were pipeclaying the same places twice over at last i got desperate cross he were so in my way so i made two big crosses on the tails of his brown coat for you see whenever he went up or down he drew out the tails of his coat from under him and stuck them through the bars of the chair and flesh and blood could not resist pipeclaying them for him and a pretty brushing hed have i reckon to get it off again well at length he clears his throat uncommon loud so i spreads my duster and shuts my eyes all ready but when nought comed of it i opened my eyes a little bit to see what he were about my word if there he wasnt down on his knees right facing me staring as hard as he could well i thought it would be hard work to stand that if he made a long ado so i shut my eyes again and tried to think serious as became what i fancied were coming but forgive me but i thought why couldnt the fellow go in and pray wi master thurstan as had always a calm spirit ready for prayer instead o me who had my dresser to scour let alone an apron to iron at last he says says he sally will you oblige me with your hand so i thought it were maybe methodee fashion to pray hand in hand and ill not deny but i wished id washed it better after blackleading the kitchen fire i thought id better tell him it were not so clean as i could wish so says i master dixon you shall have it and welcome if i may just go and wash em first but says he my dear sally dirty or clean its all the same to me seeing im only speaking in a figuring way what im asking on my bended knees is that youd please to be so kind as to be my wedded wife week after next will suit me if its agreeable to you my word i were up on my feet in an instant it were odd now werent it i never thought of taking the fellow and getting married for all ill not deny i had been thinking it would be agreeable to be axed but all at once i couldnt abide the chap sir says i trying to look shamefaced as became the occasion but for all that feeling a twittering round my mouth that i were afeard might end in a laughmaster dixon im obleeged to you for the compliment and thank ye all the same but i think id prefer a single life he looked mighty taken aback but in a minute he cleared up and was as sweet as ever he still kept on his knees and i wished hed take himself up but i reckon he thought it would give force to his words says he think again my dear sally ive a fourroomed house and furniture conformable and eighty pound a year you may never have such a chance again there were truth enough in that but it was not pretty in the man to say it and it put me up a bit as for that neither you nor i can tell master dixon youre not the first chap as ive had down on his knees afore me axing me to marry him you see i were thinking of john rawson only i thought there were no need to say he were on all foursit were truth he were on his knees you know and maybe youll not be the last anyhow ive no wish to change my condition just now ill wait till christmas says he ive a pig as will be ready for killing then so i must get married before that well now would you believe it the pig were a temptation id a receipt for curing hams as miss faith would never let me try saying the old way were good enough however i resisted says i very stern because i felt id been wavering master dixon once for all pig or no pig ill not marry you and if youll take my advice youll get up off your knees the flags is but damp yet and it would be an awkward thing to have rheumatiz just before winter with that he got up stiff enough he looked as sulky a chap as ever i clapped eyes on and as he were so black and cross i thought id done well whatever came of the pig to say no to him you may live to repent this says he very red but ill not be too hard upon ye ill give you another chance ill let you have the night to think about it and ill just call in to hear your second thoughts after chapel tomorrow well now did ever you hear the like but that is the way with all of them men thinking so much of theirselves and that its but ask and have theyve never had me though and i shall be sixtyone next martinmas so theres not much time left for them to try me i reckon well when jeremiah said that he put me up more than ever and i says my first thoughts second thoughts and third thoughts is all one and the same youve but tempted me once and that was when you spoke of your pig but of yoursel youre nothing to boast on and so ill bid you good night and ill keep my manners or else if i told the truth i should say it had been a great loss of time listening to you but ill be civilso good night he never said a word but went off as black as thunder slamming the door after him the master called me in to prayers but i cant say i could put my mind to them for my heart was beating so however it was a comfort to have had an offer of holy matrimony and though it flustered me it made me think more of myself in the night i began to wonder if id not been cruel and hard to him you see i were feverishlike and the old song of barbary allen would keep running in my head and i thought i were barbary and he were young jemmy gray and that maybe hed die for love of me and i pictured him to mysel lying on his deathbed with his face turned to the wall wi deadly sorrow sighing and i could ha pinched mysel for having been so like cruel barbary allen and when i got up next day i found it hard to think on the real jerry dixon i had seen the night before apart from the sad and sorrowful jerry i thought on adying when i were between sleeping and waking and for many a day i turned sick when i heard the passing bell for i thought it were the bell loudknelling which were to break my heart wi a sense of what id missed in saying no to jerry and so killing him with cruelty but in less than a three week i heard parish bells aringing merrily for a wedding and in the course of a morning some one says to me hark how the bells is ringing for jerry dixons wedding and all on a sudden he changed back again from a heartbroken young fellow like jemmy gray into a stout middleaged man ruddycomplexioned with a wart on his left cheek like life sally waited for some exclamation at the conclusion of her tale but receiving none she stepped softly to the bedside and there lay ruth peaceful as death with her baby on her breast i thought id lost some of my gifts if i could not talk a body to sleep said sally in a satisfied and selfcomplacent tone youth is strong and powerful and makes a hard battle against sorrow so ruth strove and strengthened and her baby flourished accordingly and before the little celandines were out on the hedgebanks or the white violets had sent forth their fragrance from the border under the south wall of miss bensons small garden ruth was able to carry her baby into that sheltered place on sunny days she often wished to thank mr benson and his sister but she did not know how to tell the deep gratitude she felt and therefore she was silent but they understood her silence well one day as she watched her sleeping child she spoke to miss benson with whom she happened to be alone do you know of any cottage where the people are clean and where they would not mind taking me in asked she taking you in what do you mean said miss benson dropping her knitting in order to observe ruth more closely i mean said ruth where i might lodge with my babyany very poor place would do only it must be clean or he might be ill and what in the world do you want to go and lodge in a cottage for said miss benson indignantly ruth did not lift up her eyes but she spoke with a firmness which showed that she had considered the subject i think i could make dresses i know i did not learn as much as i might but perhaps i might do for servants and people who are not particular servants are as particular as any one said miss benson glad to lay hold of the first objection that she could well somebody who would be patient with me said ruth nobody is patient over an illfitting gown put in miss benson theres the stuff spoilt and what not perhaps i could find plain work to do said ruth very meekly that i can do very well mamma taught me and i liked to learn from her if you would be so good miss benson you might tell people i could do plain work very neatly and punctually and cheaply youd get sixpence a day perhaps said miss benson and who would take care of baby i should like to know prettily hed be neglected would not he why hed have the croup and the typhus fever in no time and be burnt to ashes after i have thought of all look how he sleeps hush darling for just at this point he began to cry and to show his determination to be awake as if in contradiction to his mothers words ruth took him up and carried him about the room while she went on speaking yes just now i know he will not sleep but very often he will and in the night he always does and so youd work in the night and kill yourself and leave your poor baby an orphan ruth im ashamed of you now brother mr benson had just come in is not this too bad of ruth here she is planning to go away and leave us just as weas i at least have grown so fond of baby and hes beginning to know me where were you thinking of going to ruth interrupted mr benson with mild surprise anywhere to be near you and miss benson in any poor cottage where i might lodge very cheaply and earn my livelihood by taking in plain sewing and perhaps a little dressmaking and where i could come and see you and dear miss benson sometimes and bring baby if he was not dead before then of some fever or burn or scald poor neglected child or you had not worked yourself to death with never sleeping said miss benson mr benson thought a minute or two and then he spoke to ruth whatever you may do when this little fellow is a year old and able to dispense with some of a mothers care let me beg you ruth as a favour to meas a still greater favour to my sister is it not faith yes you may put it so if you like to stay with us continued he till then when baby is twelve months old well talk about it again and very likely before then some opening may be shown us never fear leading an idle life ruth well treat you as a daughter and set you all the household tasks and it is not for your sake that we ask you to stay but for this little dumb helpless childs and it is not for our sake that you must stay but for his ruth was sobbing i do not deserve your kindness said she in a broken voice i do not deserve it her tears fell fast and soft like summer rain but no further word was spoken mr benson quietly passed on to make the inquiry for which he had entered the room but when there was nothing to decide upon and no necessity for entering upon any new course of action ruths mind relaxed from its strungup state she fell into trains of reverie and mournful regretful recollections which rendered her languid and tearful this was noticed both by miss benson and sally and as each had keen sympathies and felt depressed when they saw any one near them depressed and as each without much reasoning on the cause or reason for such depression felt irritated at the uncomfortable state into which they themselves were thrown they both resolved to speak to ruth on the next fitting occasion accordingly one afternoonthe morning of that day had been spent by ruth in housework for she had insisted on mr bensons words and had taken miss bensons share of the more active and fatiguing household duties but she went through them heavily and as if her heart was far awayin the afternoon when she was nursing her child sally on coming into the back parlour found her there alone and easily detected the fact that she had been crying wheres miss benson said sally gruffly gone out with mr benson answered ruth with an absent sadness in her voice and manner her tears scarce checked while she spoke began to fall afresh and as sally stood and gazed she saw the babe look back in his mothers face and his little lip begin to quiver and his open blue eye to grow overclouded as with some mysterious sympathy with the sorrowful face bent over him sally took him briskly from his mothers arms ruth looked up in grave surprise for in truth she had forgotten sallys presence and the suddenness of the motion startled her my bonny boy are they letting the salt tears drop on thy sweet face before thourt weaned little somebody knows how to be a motheri could make a better myself dance thumbkin dancedance ye merry men every one aye thats it smile my pretty any one but a child like thee continued she turning to ruth would have known better than to bring illluck on thy babby by letting tears fall on its face before it was weaned but thourt not fit to have a babby and so ive said many a time ive a great mind to buy thee a doll and take thy babby mysel sally did not look at ruth for she was too much engaged in amusing the baby with the tassel of the string to the windowblind or else she would have seen the dignity which the mothers soul put into ruth at that moment sally was quelled into silence by the gentle composure the selfcommand over her passionate sorrow which gave to ruth an unconscious grandeur of demeanour as she came up to the old servant give him back to me please i did not know it brought illluck or if my heart broke i would not have let a tear drop on his facei never will again thank you sally as the servant relinquished him to her who came in the name of a mother sally watched ruths grave sweet smile as she followed up sallys play with the tassel and imitated with all the docility inspired by love every movement and sound which had amused her babe thoult be a mother after all said sally with a kind of admiration of the control which ruth was exercising over herself but why talk of thy heart breaking i dont question thee about whats past and gone but now thourt wanting for nothing nor thy child either the time to come is the lords and in his hands and yet thou goest about asighing and amoaning in a way that i cant stand or thole what do i do wrong said ruth i try to do all i can yes in a way said sally puzzled to know how to describe her meaning thou dost itbut theres a right and a wrong way of setting about everythingand to my thinking the right way is to take a thing up heartily if it is only making a bed why dear ah me making a bed may be done after a christian fashion i take it or else whats to come of such as me in heaven whove had little enough time on earth for clapping ourselves down on our knees for set prayers when i was a girl and wretched enough about master thurstan and the crook on his back which came of the fall i gave him i took to praying and sighing and giving up the world and i thought it were wicked to care for the flesh so i made heavy puddings and was careless about dinner and the rooms and thought i was doing my duty though i did call myself a miserable sinner but one night the old missus master thurstans mother came in and sat down by me as i was ascolding myself without thinking of what i was saying and says she sally what are you blaming yourself about and groaning over we hear you in the parlour every night and it makes my heart ache oh maam says i im a miserable sinner and im travailing in the new birth was that the reason says she why the pudding was so heavy today oh maam maam said i if you would not think of the things of the flesh but trouble yourself about your immortal soul and i sat ashaking my head to think about her soul but says she in her sweetdropping voice i do try to think of my soul every hour of the day if by that you mean trying to do the will of god but well talk now about the pudding master thurstan could not eat it and i know youll be sorry for that well i was sorry but i didnt choose to say so as she seemed to expect me so says i its a pity to see children brought up to care for things of the flesh and then i could have bitten my tongue out for the missus looked so grave and i thought of my darling little lad pining for want of his food at last says she sally do you think god has put us into the world just to be selfish and do nothing but see after our own souls or to help one another with heart and hand as christ did to all who wanted help i was silent for you see she puzzled me so she went on what is that beautiful answer in your church catechism sally i were pleased to hear a dissenter as i did not think would have done it speak so knowledgeably about the catechism and she went on to do my duty in that station of life unto which it shall please god to call me well your station is a servant and it is as honourable as a kings if you look at it right you are to help and serve others in one way just as a king is to help others in another now what way are you to help and serve or to do your duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased god to call you did it answer gods purpose and serve him when the food was unfit for a child to eat and unwholesome for any one well i would not give it up i was so pigheaded about my soul so says i i wish folks would be content with locusts and wild honey and leave other folks in peace to work out their salvation and i groaned out pretty loud to think of missuss soul i often think since she smiled a bit at me but she said well sally tomorrow you shall have time to work out your salvation but as we have no locusts in england and i dont think theyd agree with master thurstan if we had i will come and make the pudding but i shall try and do it well not only for him to like it but because everything may be done in a right way or a wrong the right way is to do it as well as we can as in gods sight the wrong is to do it in a selfseeking spirit which either leads us to neglect it to follow out some device of our own for our own ends or to give up too much time and thought to it both before and after the doing well i thought of all old missuss words this morning when i saw you making the beds you sighed so you could not half shake the pillows your heart was not in your work and yet it was the duty god had set you i reckon i know its not the work parsons preach about though i dont think they go so far off the mark when they read whatsoever thy hand findeth to do that do with all thy might just try for a day to think of all the odd jobs as has to be done well and truly as in gods sight not just slurred over anyhow and youll go through them twice as cheerfully and have no thought to spare for sighing or crying sally bustled off to set on the kettle for tea and felt half ashamed in the quiet of the kitchen to think of the oration she had made in the parlour but she saw with much satisfaction that henceforward ruth nursed her boy with a vigour and cheerfulness that were reflected back from him and the household work was no longer performed with a languid indifference as if life and duty were distasteful miss benson had her share in this improvement though sally placidly took all the credit to herself one day as she and ruth sat together miss benson spoke of the child and thence went on to talk about her own childhood by degrees they spoke of education and the booklearning that forms one part of it and the result was that ruth determined to get up early all through the bright summer mornings to acquire the knowledge hereafter to be given to her child her mind was uncultivated her reading scant beyond the mere mechanical arts of education she knew nothing but she had a refined taste and excellent sense and judgment to separate the true from the false with these qualities she set to work under mr bensons directions she read in the early morning the books that he marked out she trained herself with strict perseverance to do all thoroughly she did not attempt to acquire any foreign language although her ambition was to learn latin in order to teach it to her boy those summer mornings were happy for she was learning neither to look backwards nor forwards but to live faithfully and earnestly in the present she rose while the hedgesparrow was yet singing his reveille to his mate she dressed and opened her window shading the softblowing air and the sunny eastern light from her baby if she grew tired she went and looked at him and all her thoughts were holy prayers for him then she would gaze awhile out of the high upper window on to the moorlands that swelled in waves one behind the other in the grey cool morning light these were her occasional relaxations and after them she returned with strength to her work chapter xvii leonards christening in that body of dissenters to which mr benson belonged it is not considered necessary to baptize infants as early as the ceremony can be performed and many circumstances concurred to cause the solemn thanksgiving and dedication of the child for so these dissenters look upon christenings to be deferred until it was probably somewhere about six months old there had been many conversations in the little sittingroom between the brother and sister and their protegee which had consisted more of questions betraying a thoughtful wondering kind of ignorance on the part of ruth and answers more suggestive than explanatory from mr benson while miss benson kept up a kind of running commentary always simple and often quaint but with that intuition into the very heart of all things truly religious which is often the gift of those who seem at first sight to be only affectionate and sensible when mr benson had explained his own views of what a christening ought to be considered and by calling out ruths latent feelings into pious earnestness brought her into a right frame of mind he felt that he had done what he could to make the ceremony more than a mere form and to invest it quiet humble and obscure as it must necessarily be in outward shapemournful and anxious as much of its antecedents had rendered itwith the severe grandeur of an act done in faith and truth it was not far to carry the little one for as i said the chapel almost adjoined the ministers house the whole procession was to have consisted of mr and miss benson ruth carrying her baby and sally who felt herself as a churchofengland woman to be condescending and kind in requesting leave to attend a baptism among them dissenters but unless she had asked permission she would not have been desired to attend so careful was the habit of her master and mistress that she should be allowed that freedom which they claimed for themselves but they were glad she wished to go they liked the feeling that all were of one household and that the interests of one were the interests of all it produced a consequence however which they did not anticipate sally was full of the event which her presence was to sanction and as it were to redeem from the character of being utterly schismatic she spoke about it with an air of patronage to three or four and among them to some of the servants at mr bradshaws miss benson was rather surprised to receive a call from jemima bradshaw on the very morning of the day on which little leonard was to be baptized miss bradshaw was rosy and breathless with eagerness although the second in the family she had been at school when her younger sisters had been christened and she was now come in the full warmth of a girls fancy to ask if she might be present at the afternoons service she had been struck with mrs denbighs grace and beauty at the very first sight when she had accompanied her mother to call upon the bensons on their return from wales and had kept up an enthusiastic interest in the widow only a little older than herself whose very reserve and retirement but added to her unconscious power of enchantment oh miss benson i never saw a christening papa says i may go if you think mr benson and mrs denbigh would not dislike it and i will be quite quiet and sit up behind the door or anywhere and that sweet little baby i should so like to see him christened is he to be called leonard did you say after mr denbigh is it nonot exactly said miss benson rather discomfited was not mr denbighs name leonard then mamma thought it would be sure to be called after him and so did i but i may come to the christening may i not dear miss benson miss benson gave her consent with a little inward reluctance both her brother and ruth shared in this feeling although no one expressed it and it was presently forgotten jemima stood grave and quiet in the oldfashioned vestry adjoining the chapel as they entered with steps subdued to slowness she thought ruth looked so pale and awed because she was left a solitary parent but ruth came to the presence of god as one who had gone astray and doubted her own worthiness to be called his child she came as a mother who had incurred a heavy responsibility and who entreated his almighty aid to enable her to discharge it full of passionate yearning love which craved for more faith in god to still her distrust and fear of the future that might hang over her darling when she thought of her boy she sickened and trembled but when she heard of gods lovingkindness far beyond all tender mothers love she was hushed into peace and prayer there she stood her fair pale cheek resting on her babys head as he slumbered on her bosom her eyes went slanting down under their halfclosed white lids but their gaze was not on the primitive cottagelike room it was earnestly fixed on a dim mist through which she fain would have seen the life that lay before her child but the mist was still and dense too thick a veil for anxious human love to penetrate the future was hid with god mr benson stood right under the casement window that was placed high up in the room he was almost in shade except for one or two marked lights which fell on hair already silvery white his voice was always low and musical when he spoke to few it was too weak to speak so as to be heard by many without becoming harsh and strange but now it filled the little room with a loving sound like the stockdoves brooding murmur over her young he and ruth forgot all in their earnestness of thought and when he said let us pray and the little congregation knelt down you might have heard the babys faint breathing scarcely sighing out upon the stillness so absorbed were all in the solemnity but the prayer was long thought followed thought and fear crowded upon fear and all were to be laid bare before god and his aid and counsel asked before the end sally had shuffled quietly out of the vestry into the green chapelyard upon which the door opened miss benson was alive to this movement and so full of curiosity as to what it might mean that she could no longer attend to her brother and felt inclined to rush off and question sally the moment all was ended miss bradshaw hung about the babe and ruth and begged to be allowed to carry the child home but ruth pressed him to her as if there was no safe harbour for him but in his mothers breast mr benson saw her feeling and caught miss bradshaws look of disappointment come home with us said he and stay to tea you have never drank tea with us since you went to school i wish i might said miss bradshaw colouring with pleasure but i must ask papa may i run home and ask to be sure my dear jemima flew off and fortunately her father was at home for her mothers permission would have been deemed insufficient she received many directions about her behaviour take no sugar in your tea jemima i am sure the bensons ought not to be able to afford sugar with their means and do not eat much you can have plenty at home on your return remember mrs denbighs keep must cost them a great deal so jemima returned considerably sobered and very much afraid of her hunger leading her to forget mr bensons poverty meanwhile miss benson and sally acquainted with mr bensons invitation to jemima set about making some capital teacakes on which they piqued themselves they both enjoyed the offices of hospitality and were glad to place some homemade tempting dainty before their guests what made ye leave the chapelvestry before my brother had ended inquired miss benson indeed maam i thought master had prayed so long hed be drouthy so i just slipped out to put on the kettle for tea miss benson was on the point of reprimanding her for thinking of anything besides the object of the prayer when she remembered how she herself had been unable to attend after sallys departure for wondering what had become of her so she was silent it was a disappointment to miss bensons kind and hospitable expectation when jemima as hungry as a hound confined herself to one piece of the cake which her hostess had had such pleasure in making and jemima wished she had not a prophetic feeling all teatime of the manner in which her father would inquire into the particulars of the meal elevating his eyebrows at every viand named beyond plain breadandbutter and winding up with some such sentence as this well i marvel how with bensons salary he can afford to keep such a table sally could have told of selfdenial when no one was by when the left hand did not know what the right hand did on the part of both her master and mistress practised without thinking even to themselves that it was either a sacrifice or a virtue in order to enable them to help those who were in need or even to gratify miss bensons kind oldfashioned feelings on such occasions as the present when a stranger came to the house her homely affectionate pleasure in making others comfortable might have shown that such little occasional extravagances were not waste but a good work and were not to be gauged by the standard of moneyspending this evening her spirits were damped by jemimas refusal to eat poor jemima the cakes were so good and she was so hungry but still she refused while sally was clearing away the teathings miss benson and jemima accompanied ruth upstairs when she went to put little leonard to bed a christening is a very solemn service said miss bradshaw i had no idea it was so solemn mr benson seemed to speak as if he had a weight of care on his heart that god alone could relieve or lighten my brother feels these things very much said miss benson rather wishing to cut short the conversation for she had been aware of several parts in the prayer which she knew were suggested by the peculiarity and sadness of the case before him i could not quite follow him all through continued jemima what did he mean by saying this child rebuked by the world and bidden to stand apart thou wilt not rebuke but wilt suffer it to come to thee and be blessed with thine almighty blessing why is this little darling to be rebuked i do not think i remember the exact words but he said something like that my dear your gown is dripping wet it must have dipped into the tub let me wring it out oh thank you never mind my gown said jemima hastily and wanting to return to her question but just then she caught the sight of tears falling fast down the cheeks of the silent ruth as she bent over her child crowing and splashing away in his tub with a sudden consciousness that unwittingly she had touched on some painful chord jemima rushed into another subject and was eagerly seconded by miss benson the circumstance seemed to die away and leave no trace but in afteryears it rose vivid and significant before jemimas memory at present it was enough for her if mrs denbigh would let her serve her in every possible way her admiration for beauty was keen and little indulged at home and ruth was very beautiful in her quiet mournfulness her mean and homely dress left herself only the more open to admiration for she gave it a charm by her unconscious wearing of it that made it seem like the drapery of an old greek statuesubordinate to the figure it covered yet imbued by it with an unspeakable grace then the pretended circumstances of her life were such as to catch the imagination of a young romantic girl altogether jemima could have kissed her hand and professed herself ruths slave she moved away all the articles used at this little coucher she folded up leonards dayclothes she felt only too much honoured when ruth trusted him to her for a few minutesonly too amply rewarded when ruth thanked her with a grave sweet smile and a grateful look of her loving eyes when jemima had gone away with the servant who was sent to fetch her there was a little chorus of praise shes a warmhearted girl said miss benson she remembers all the old days before she went to school she is worth two of mr richard theyre each of them just the same as they were when they were children when they broke that window in the chapel and he ran away home and she came knocking at our door with a single knock just like a beggars and i went to see who it was and was quite startled to see her round brown honest face looking up at me halffrightened and telling me what she had done and offering me the money in her savings bank to pay for it we never should have heard of master richards share in the business if it had not been for sally but remember said mr benson how strict mr bradshaw has always been with his children it is no wonder if poor richard was a coward in those days he is now or im much mistaken answered miss benson and mr bradshaw was just as strict with jemima and shes no coward but ive no faith in richard he has a look about him that i dont like and when mr bradshaw was away on business in holland last year for those months my young gentleman did not come half as regularly to chapel and i always believe that story of his being seen out with the hounds at smithiles those are neither of them great offences in a young man of twenty said mr benson smiling no i dont mind them in themselves but when he could change back so easily to being regular and mim when his father came home i dont like that leonard shall never be afraid of me said ruth following her own train of thought i will be his friend from the very first and i will try and learn how to be a wise friend and you will teach me wont you sir what made you wish to call him leonard ruth asked miss benson it was my mothers fathers name and she used to tell me about him and his goodness and i thought if leonard could be like him do you remember the discussion there was about miss bradshaws name thurstan her father wanting her to be called hepzibah but insisting that she was to have a scripture name at any rate and mrs bradshaw wanting her to be juliana after some novel she had read not long before and at last jemima was fixed upon because it would do either for a scripture name or a name for a heroine out of a book i did not know jemima was a scripture name said ruth oh yes it is one of jobs daughters jemima kezia and kerenhappuch there are a good many jemimas in the world and some kezias but i never heard of a kerenhappuch and yet we know just as much of one as of another people really like a pretty name whether in scripture or out of it when there is no particular association with the name said mr benson now i was called faith after the cardinal virtue and i like my name though many people would think it too puritan that was according to our gentle mothers pious desire and thurstan was called by his name because my father wished it for although he was what people called a radical and a democrat in his ways of talking and thinking he was very proud in his heart of being descended from some old sir thurstan who figured away in the french wars the difference between theory and practice thinking and being put in mr benson who was in a mood for allowing himself a little social enjoyment he leant back in his chair with his eyes looking at but not seeing the ceiling miss benson was clicking away with her eternal knittingneedles looking at her brother and seeing him too ruth was arranging her childs clothes against the morrow it was but their usual way of spending an evening the variety was given by the different tone which the conversation assumed on the different nights yet somehow the peacefulness of the time the window open into the little garden the scents that came stealing in and the clear summer heaven above made the time be remembered as a happy festival by ruth even sally seemed more placid than usual when she came in to prayers and she and miss benson followed ruth to her bedroom to look at the beautiful sleeping leonard god bless him said miss benson stooping down to kiss his little dimpled hand which lay outside the coverlet tossed abroad in the heat of the evening now dont get up too early ruth injuring your health will be shortsighted wisdom and poor economy good night good night dear miss benson good night sally when ruth had shut her door she went again to the bed and looked at her boy till her eyes filled with tears god bless thee darling i only ask to be one of his instruments and not thrown aside as uselessor worse than useless so ended the day of leonards christening mr benson had sometimes taught the children of different people as an especial favour when requested by them but then his pupils were only children and by their progress he was little prepared for ruths she had had early teaching of that kind which need never be unlearnt from her mother enough to unfold many of her powers they had remained inactive now for several years but had grown strong in the dark and quiet time her tutor was surprised at the bounds by which she surmounted obstacles the quick perception and ready adaptation of truths and first principles and her immediate sense of the fitness of things her delight in what was strong and beautiful called out her masters sympathy but most of all he admired the complete unconsciousness of uncommon power or unusual progress it was less of a wonder than he considered it to be it is true for she never thought of comparing what she was now with her former self much less with another indeed she did not think of herself at all but of her boy and what she must learn in order to teach him to be and to do as suited her hope and her prayer if any ones devotion could have flattered her into selfconsciousness it was jemimas mr bradshaw never dreamed that his daughter could feel herself inferior to the ministers protegee but so it was and no knighterrant of old could consider himself more honoured by his ladyes commands than did jemima if ruth allowed her to do anything for her or for her boy ruth loved her heartily even while she was rather annoyed at the open expressions jemima used of admiration please i really would rather not be told if people do think me pretty but it was not merely beautiful it was sweetlooking and good mrs postlethwaite called you replied jemima all the more i would rather not hear it i may be pretty but i know i am not good besides i dont think we ought to hear what is said of us behind our backs ruth spoke so gravely that jemima feared lest she was displeased dear mrs denbigh i never will admire or praise you again only let me love you and let me love you said ruth with a tender kiss jemima would not have been allowed to come so frequently if mr bradshaw had not been possessed with the idea of patronising ruth if the latter had chosen she might have gone dressed from head to foot in the presents which he wished to make her but she refused them constantly occasionally to miss bensons great annoyance but if he could not load her with gifts he could show his approbation by asking her to his house and after some deliberation she consented to accompany mr and miss benson there the house was square and massylooking with a great deal of drabcolour about the furniture mrs bradshaw in her lackadaisical sweettempered way seconded her husband in his desire of being kind to ruth and as she cherished privately a great taste for what was beautiful or interesting as opposed to her husbands love of the purely useful this taste of hers had rarely had so healthy and true a mode of gratification as when she watched ruths movements about the room which seemed in its unobtrusiveness and poverty of colour to receive the requisite ornament of light and splendour from ruths presence mrs bradshaw sighed and wished she had a daughter as lovely about whom to weave a romance for castlebuilding after the manner of the minerva press was the outlet by which she escaped from the pressure of her prosaic life as mr bradshaws wife her perception was only of external beauty and she was not always alive to that or she might have seen how a warm affectionate ardent nature free from all envy or carking care of self gave an unspeakable charm to her plain brightfaced daughter jemima whose dark eyes kept challenging admiration for her friend the first evening spent at mr bradshaws passed like many succeeding visits there there was tea the equipage for which was as handsome and as ugly as money could purchase then the ladies produced their sewing while mr bradshaw stood before the fire and gave the assembled party the benefit of his opinions on many subjects the opinions were as good and excellent as the opinions of any man can be who sees one side of a case very strongly and almost ignores the other they coincided in many points with those held by mr benson but he once or twice interposed with a plea for those who might differ and then he was heard by mr bradshaw with a kind of evident and indulgent pity such as one feels for a child who unwittingly talks nonsense byandby mrs bradshaw and miss benson fell into one tete a tete and ruth and jemima into another two wellbehaved but unnaturally quiet children were sent to bed early in the evening in an authoritative voice by their father because one of them had spoken too loud while he was enlarging on an alteration in the tariff just before the suppertray was brought in a gentleman was announced whom ruth had never previously seen but who appeared well known to the rest of the party it was mr farquhar mr bradshaws partner he had been on the continent for the last year and had only recently returned he seemed perfectly at home but spoke little he leaned back in his chair screwed up his eyes and watched everybody yet there was nothing unpleasant or impertinent in his keenness of observation ruth wondered to hear him contradict mr bradshaw and almost expected some rebuff but mr bradshaw if he did not yield the point admitted for the first time that evening that it was possible something might be said on the other side mr farquhar differed also from mr benson but it was in a more respectful manner than mr bradshaw had done for these reasons although mr farquhar had never spoken to ruth she came away with the impression that he was a man to be respected and perhaps liked sally would have thought herself mightily aggrieved if on their return she had not heard some account of the evening as soon as miss benson came in the old servant began well and who was there and what did they give you for supper only mr farquhar besides ourselves and sandwiches spongecake and wine there was no occasion for anything more replied miss benson who was tired and preparing to go upstairs mr farquhar why they do say hes thinking of miss jemima nonsense sally why hes old enough to be her father said miss benson half way up the first flight theres no need for it to be called nonsense though he may be ten year older muttered sally retreating towards the kitchen bradshaws betsy knows what shes about and wouldnt have said it for nothing ruth wondered a little about it she loved jemima well enough to be interested in what related to her but after thinking for a few minutes she decided that such a marriage was and would ever be very unlikely chapter xviii ruth becomes a governess in mr bradshaws family one afternoon not long after this mr and miss benson set off to call upon a farmer who attended the chapel but lived at some distance from the town they intended to stay to tea if they were invited and ruth and sally were left to spend a long afternoon together at first sally was busy in her kitchen and ruth employed herself in carrying her baby out into the garden it was now nearly a year since she came to the bensons it seemed like yesterday and yet as if a lifetime had gone between the flowers were budding now that were all in bloom when she came down on the first autumnal morning into the sunny parlour the yellow jessamine that was then a tender plant had now taken firm root in the soil and was sending out strong shoots the wallflowers which miss benson had sown on the wall a day or two after her arrival were scenting the air with their fragrant flowers ruth knew every plant now it seemed as though she had always lived here and always known the inhabitants of the house she heard sally singing her accustomed song in the kitchen a song she never varied over her afternoons work it began as i was going to derby sir upon a marketday and if music is a necessary element in a song perhaps i had better call it by some other name but the strange change was in ruth herself she was conscious of it though she could not define it and did not dwell upon it life had become significant and full of duty to her she delighted in the exercise of her intellectual powers and liked the idea of the infinite amount of which she was ignorant for it was a grand pleasure to learnto crave and be satisfied she strove to forget what had gone before this last twelve months she shuddered up from contemplating it it was like a bad unholy dream and yet there was a strange yearning kind of love for the father of the child whom she pressed to her heart which came and she could not bid it begone as sinful it was so pure and natural even when thinking of it as in the sight of god little leonard cooed to the flowers and stretched after their bright colours and ruth laid him on the dry turf and pelted him with the gay petals he chinked and crowed with laughing delight and clutched at her cap and pulled it off her short rich curls were goldenbrown in the slanting sunlight and by their very shortness made her look more childlike she hardly seemed as if she could be the mother of the noble babe over whom she knelt now snatching kisses now matching his cheek with roseleaves all at once the bells of the old church struck the hour and far away high up in the air began slowly to play the old tune of life let us cherish they had played it for yearsfor the life of manand it always sounded fresh and strange and aerial ruth was still in a moment she knew not why and the tears came into her eyes as she listened when it was ended she kissed her baby and bade god bless him just then sally came out dressed for the evening with a leisurely look about her she had done her work and she and ruth were to drink tea together in the exquisitely clean kitchen but while the kettle was boiling she came out to enjoy the flowers she gathered a piece of southernwood and stuffed it up her nose by way of smelling it whatten you call this in your country asked she oldman replied ruth we call it here ladslove it and peppermintdrops always remind me of going to church in the country here ill get you a blackcurrant leaf to put in the teapot it gives it a flavour we had bees once against this wall but when missus died we forgot to tell em and put em in mourning and in course they swarmed away without our knowing and the next winter came a hard frost and they died now i dare say the water will be boiling and its time for little master there to come in for the dew is falling see all the daisies is shutting themselves up sally was most gracious as a hostess she quite put on her company manners to receive ruth in the kitchen they laid leonard to sleep on the sofa in the parlour that they might hear him the more easily and then they sat quietly down to their sewing by the bright kitchen fire sally was as usual the talker and as usual the subject was the family of whom for so many years she had formed a part aye things was different when i was a girl quoth she eggs was thirty for a shilling and butter only sixpence a pound my wage when i came here was but three pound and i did on it and was always clean and tidy which is more than many a lass can say now who gets her seven and eight pound a year and tea was kept for an afternoon drink and pudding was eaten afore meat in them days and the upshot was people paid their debts better aye aye wen gone backwards and we thinken wen gone forrards after shaking her head a little over the degeneracy of the times sally returned to a part of the subject on which she thought she had given ruth a wrong idea youll not go for to think now that ive not more than three pound a year ive a deal above that now first of all old missus gave me four pound for she said i were worth it and i thought in my heart that i were so i took it without more ado but after her death master thurstan and miss faith took a fit of spending and says they to me one day as i carried tea in sally we think your wages ought to be raised what matter what you think said i pretty sharp for i thought theyd ha shown more respect to missus if theyd let things stand as they were in her time and theyd gone and moved the sofa away from the wall to where it stands now already that very day so i speaks up sharp and says i as long as im content i think its no business of yours to be meddling wi me and my money matters but says miss faith shes always the one to speak first if youll notice though its master that comes in and clinches the matter with some reason shed never ha thought ofhe were always a sensible lad sally all the servants in the town have six pound and better and you have as hard a place as any of em did you ever hear me grumble about my work that you talk about it in that way wait till i grumble says i but dont meddle wi me till then so i flung off in a huff but in the course of the evening master thurstan came in and sat down in the kitchen and hes such winning ways he wiles one over to anything and besides a notion had come into my headnow youll not tell said she glancing round the room and hitching her chair nearer to ruth in a confidential manner ruth promised and sally went on i thought i should like to be an heiress wi money and leave it all to master and miss faith and i thought if id six pound a year i could maybe get to be an heiress all i was feared on was that some chap or other might marry me for my money but ive managed to keep the fellows off so i looks mim and grateful and i thanks master thurstan for his offer and i takes the wages and what do you think ive done asked sally with an exultant air what have you done asked ruth why replied sally slowly and emphatically ive saved thirty pound but thats not it ive getten a lawyer to make me a will thats it wench said she slapping ruth on the back how did you manage it asked ruth aye that was it said sally i thowt about it many a night before i hit on the right way i was afeard the money might be thrown into chancery if i didnt make it all safe and yet i could na ask master thurstan at last and at length john jackson the grocer had a nephew come to stay a week with him as was prentice to a lawyer in liverpool so now was my time and here was my lawyer wait a minute i could tell you my story better if i had my will in my hand and ill scomfish you if ever you go for to tell she held up her hand and threatened ruth as she left the kitchen to fetch the will when she came back she brought a parcel tied up in a blue pockethandkerchief she sat down squared her knees untied the handkerchief and displayed a small piece of parchment now do you know what this is said she holding it up its parchment and its the right stuff to make wills on people gets into chancery if they dont make them o this stuff and i reckon tom jackson thowt hed have a fresh job on it if he could get it into chancery for the rascal went and wrote it on a piece of paper at first and came and read it me out loud off a piece of paper no better than what one writes letters upon i were up to him and thinks i come come my lad im not a fool though you may think so i know a paper will wont stand but ill let you run your rig so i sits and i listens and would you belie me he read it out as if it were as clear a business as your giving me that thimbleno more ado though it were thirty pound i could understand it myselthat were no law for me i wanted summat to consider about and for th meaning to be wrapped up as i wrap up my best gown so says i tom its not on parchment i mun have it on parchment this ill do as well says he well get it witnessed and it will stand good well i liked the notion of having it witnessed and for a while that soothed me but after a bit i felt i should like it done according to law and not plain out as anybody might ha done it i mysel if i could have written so says i tom i mun have it on parchment parchment costs money says he very grave oh oh my lad are ye there thinks i thats the reason im clipped of law so says i tom i mun have it on parchment ill pay the money and welcome its thirty pound and what i can lay to it ill make it safe it shall be on parchment and ill tell thee what lad ill gie ye sixpence for every good lawword you put in it sounding like and not to be caught up as a person runs your master had need to be ashamed of you as a prentice if you cant do a thing more tradesmanlike than this well he laughed above a bit but i were firm and stood to it so he made it out on parchment now woman try and read it said she giving it to ruth ruth smiled and began to read sally listening with rapt attention when ruth came to the word testatrix sally stopped her that was the first sixpence said she i thowt he was going to fob me off again wi plain language but when that word came i out wi my sixpence and gave it to him on the spot now go on presently ruth read accruing that was the second sixpence four sixpences it were in all besides sixandeightpence as we bargained at first and threeandfourpence parchment there thats what i call a will witnessed according to law and all master thurstan will be prettily taken in when i die and he finds all his extra wage left back to him but it will teach him its not so easy as he thinks for to make a woman give up her way the time was now drawing near when little leonard might be weanedthe time appointed by all three for ruth to endeavour to support herself in some way more or less independent of mr and miss benson this prospect dwelt much in all of their minds and was in each shaded with some degree of perplexity but they none of them spoke of it for fear of accelerating the event if they had felt clear and determined as to the best course to be pursued they were none of them deficient in courage to commence upon that course at once miss benson would perhaps have objected the most to any alteration in their present daily mode of life but that was because she had the habit of speaking out her thoughts as they arose and she particularly disliked and dreaded change besides this she had felt her heart open out and warm towards the little helpless child in a strong and powerful manner nature had intended her warm instincts to find vent in a mothers duties her heart had yearned after children and made her restless in her childless state without her well knowing why but now the delight she experienced in tending nursing and contriving for the little boyeven contriving to the point of sacrificing many of her cherished whimsmade her happy and satisfied and peaceful it was more difficult to sacrifice her whims than her comforts but all had been given up when and where required by the sweet lordly baby who reigned paramount in his very helplessness from some cause or other an exchange of ministers for one sunday was to be effected with a neighbouring congregation and mr benson went on a short absence from home when he returned on monday he was met at the housedoor by his sister who had evidently been looking out for him for some time she stepped out to greet him dont hurry yourself thurstan alls well only i wanted to tell you something dont fidget yourselfbaby is quite well bless him its only good news come into your room and let me talk a little quietly with you she drew him into his study which was near the outer door and then she took off his coat and put his carpetbag in a corner and wheeled a chair to the fire before she would begin well now to think how often things fall out just as we want them thurstan have not you often wondered what was to be done with ruth when the time came at which we promised her she should earn her living i am sure you have because i have so often thought about it myself and yet i never dared to speak out my fear because that seemed giving it a shape and now mr bradshaw has put all to rights he invited mr jackson to dinner yesterday just as we were going into chapel and then he turned to me and asked me if i would come to teastraight from afternoon chapel because mrs bradshaw wanted to speak to me he made it very clear i was not to bring ruth and indeed she was only too happy to stay at home with baby and so i went and mrs bradshaw took me into her bedroom and shut the doors and said mr bradshaw had told her that he did not like jemima being so much confined with the younger ones while they were at their lessons and that he wanted some one above a nursemaid to sit with them while their masters were theresome one who would see about their learning their lessons and who would walk out with them a sort of nursery governess i think she meant though she did not say so and mr bradshaw for of course i saw his thoughts and words constantly peeping out though he had told her to speak to me believed that our ruth would be the very person now thurstan dont look so surprised as if she had never come into your head i am sure i saw what mrs bradshaw was driving at long before she came to the point and i could scarcely keep from smiling and saying wed jump at the proposallong before i ought to have known anything about it oh i wonder what we ought to do said mr benson or rather i believe i see what we ought to do if i durst but do it why what ought we to do asked his sister in surprise i ought to go and tell mr bradshaw the whole story and get ruth turned out of our house said miss benson indignantly they cant make us do that said her brother i do not think they would try yes mr bradshaw would try and he would blazon out poor ruths sin and there would not be a chance for her left i know him well thurstan and why should he be told now more than a year ago a year ago he did not want to put her in a situation of trust about his children and you think shell abuse that trust do you youve lived a twelvemonth in the house with ruth and the end of it is you think she will do his children harm besides who encouraged jemima to come to the house so much to see ruth did you not say it would do them both good to see something of each other mr benson sat thinking if you had not known ruth as well as you doif during her stay with us you had marked anything wrong or forward or deceitful or immodest i would say at once dont allow mr bradshaw to take her into his house but still i would say dont tell of her sin and her sorrow to so severe a manso unpitiful a judge but here i ask you thurstan can you or i or sally quickeyed as she is say that in any one thing we have had true just occasion to find fault with ruth i dont mean that she is perfectshe acts without thinking her temper is sometimes warm and hasty but have we any right to go and injure her prospects for life by telling mr bradshaw all we know of her errorsonly sixteen when she did so wrong and never to escape from it all her many years to cometo have the despair which would arise from its being known clutching her back into worse sin what harm do you think she can do what is the risk to which you think you are exposing mr bradshaws children she paused out of breath her eyes glittering with tears of indignation and impatient for an answer that she might knock it to pieces i do not see any danger that can arise said he at length and with slow difficulty as if not fully convinced i have watched ruth and i believe she is pure and truthful and the very sorrow and penitence she has feltthe very suffering she has gone throughhas given her a thoughtful conscientiousness beyond her age that and the care of her baby said miss benson secretly delighted at the tone of her brothers thoughts ah faith that baby you so much dreaded once is turning out a blessing you see said thurstan with a faint quiet smile yes any one might be thankful and better too for leonard but how could i tell that it would be like him but to return to ruth and mr bradshaw what did you say oh with my feelings of course i was only too glad to accept the proposal and so i told mrs bradshaw then and i afterwards repeated it to mr bradshaw when he asked me if his wife had mentioned their plans they would understand that i must consult you and ruth before it could be considered as finally settled and have you named it to her yes answered miss benson half afraid lest he should think she had been too precipitate and what did she say asked he after a little pause of grave silence at first she seemed very glad and fell into my mood of planning how it should all be managed how sally and i should take care of the baby the hours that she was away at mr bradshaws but byandby she became silent and thoughtful and knelt down by me and hid her face in my lap and shook a little as if she was crying and then i heard her speak in a very low smothered voice for her head was still bent downquite hanging down indeed so that i could not see her face so i stooped to listen and i heard her say do you think i should be good enough to teach little girls miss benson she said it so humbly and fearfully that all i thought of was how to cheer her and i answered and asked her if she did not hope to be good enough to bring up her own darling to be a brave christian man and she lifted up her head and i saw her eyes looking wild and wet and earnest and she said with gods help that will i try to make my child and i said then ruth as you strive and as you pray for your own child so you must strive and pray to make mary and elizabeth good if you are trusted with them and she said out quite clear though her face was hidden from me once more i will strive and i will pray you would not have had any fears thurstan if you could have heard and seen her last night i have no fear said he decidedly let the plan go on after a minute he added but i am glad it was so far arranged before i heard of it my indecision about right and wrongmy perplexity as to how far we are to calculate consequencesgrows upon me i fear you look tired and weary dear you should blame your body rather than your conscience at these times a very dangerous doctrine the scroll of fate was closed and they could not foresee the future and yet if they could have seen it though they might have shrunk fearfully at first they would have smiled and thanked god when all was done and said chapter xix after five years the quiet days grew into weeks and months and even years without any event to startle the little circle into the consciousness of the lapse of time one who had known them at the date of ruths becoming a governess in mr bradshaws family and had been absent until the time of which i am now going to tell you would have noted some changes which had imperceptibly come over all but he too would have thought that the life which had brought so little of turmoil and vicissitude must have been calm and tranquil and in accordance with the bygone activity of the town in which their existence passed away the alterations that he would have perceived were those caused by the natural progress of time the benson home was brightened into vividness by the presence of the little leonard now a noble boy of six large and grand in limb and stature and with a face of marked beauty and intelligence indeed he might have been considered by many as too intelligent for his years and often the living with old and thoughtful people gave him beyond most children the appearance of pondering over the mysteries which meet the young on the threshold of life but which fade away as advancing years bring us more into contact with the practical and tangiblefade away and vanish until it seems to require the agitation of some great storm of the soul before we can again realise spiritual things but at times leonard seemed oppressed and bewildered after listening intent with grave and wondering eyes to the conversation around him at others the bright animal life shone forth radiant and no threemonths kittenno foal suddenly tossing up its heels by the side of its sedate dam and careering around the pasture in pure mad enjoymentno young creature of any kind could show more merriment and gladness of heart for ever in mischief was sallys account of him at such times but it was not intentional mischief and sally herself would have been the first to scold any one else who had used the same words in reference to her darling indeed she was once nearly giving warning because she thought the boy was being illused the occasion was this leonard had for some time shown a strange odd disregard of truth he invented stories and told them with so grave a face that unless there was some internal evidence of their incorrectness such as describing a cow with a bonnet on he was generally believed and his statements which were given with the full appearance of relating a real occurrence had once or twice led to awkward results all the three whose hearts were pained by this apparent unconsciousness of the difference between truth and falsehood were unaccustomed to children or they would have recognised this as a stage through which most infants who have lively imaginations pass and accordingly there was a consultation in mr bensons study one morning ruth was there quiet very pale and with compressed lips sick at heart as she heard miss bensons arguments for the necessity of whipping in order to cure leonard of his storytelling mr benson looked unhappy and uncomfortable education was but a series of experiments to them all and they all had a secret dread of spoiling the noble boy who was the darling of their hearts and perhaps this very intensity of love begot an impatient unnecessary anxiety and made them resolve on sterner measures than the parent of a large family where love was more spread abroad would have dared to use at any rate the vote for whipping carried the day and even ruth trembling and cold agreed that it must be done only she asked in a meek sad voice if she need be present mr benson was to be the executionerthe scene the study and being instantly told that she had better not she went slowly and languidly up to her room and kneeling down she closed her ears and prayed miss benson having carried her point was very sorry for the child and would have begged him off but mr benson had listened more to her arguments than now to her pleadings and only answered if it is right it shall be done he went into the garden and deliberately almost as if he wished to gain time chose and cut off a little switch from the laburnumtree then he returned through the kitchen and gravely taking the awed and wondering little fellow by the hand he led him silently into the study and placing him before him began an admonition on the importance of truthfulness meaning to conclude with what he believed to be the moral of all punishment as you cannot remember this of yourself i must give you a little pain to make you remember it i am very sorry it is necessary and that you cannot recollect without my doing so but before he had reached this very proper and desirable conclusion and while he was yet working his way his heart aching with the terrified look of the child at the solemnly sad face and words of upbraiding sally burst in and what may ye be going to do with that fine switch i saw ye gathering master thurstan asked she her eyes gleaming with anger at the answer she knew must come if answer she had at all go away sally said mr benson annoyed at the fresh difficulty in his path ill not stir never a step till you give me that switch as youve got for some mischief ill be bound sally remember where it is said he that spareth the rod spoileth the child said mr benson austerely aye i remember and i remember a bit more than you want me to remember i reckon it were king solomon as spoke them words and it were king solomons son that were king rehoboam and no great shakes either i can remember what is said on him chronicles xii chapter th verse and he thats king rehoboam the lad that tasted the rod did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord ive not been reading my chapters every night for fifty year to be caught napping by a dissenter neither said she triumphantly come along leonard she stretched out her hand to the child thinking that she had conquered but leonard did not stir he looked wistfully at mr benson come said she impatiently the boys mouth quivered if you want to whip me uncle you may do it i dont much mind put in this form it was impossible to carry out his intentions and so mr benson told the lad he might gothat he would speak to him another time leonard went away more subdued in spirit than if he had been whipped sally lingered a moment she stopped to add i think its for them without sin to throw stones at a poor child and cut up good laburnumbranches to whip him i only do as my betters do when i call leonards mother mrs denbigh the moment she had said this she was sorry it was an ungenerous advantage after the enemy had acknowledged himself defeated mr benson dropped his head upon his hands and hid his face and sighed deeply leonard flew in search of his mother as in search of a refuge if he had found her calm he would have burst into a passion of crying after his agitation as it was he came upon her kneeling and sobbing and he stood quite still then he threw his arms round her neck and said mamma mamma i will be goodi make a promise i will speak truei make a promise and he kept his word miss benson piqued herself upon being less carried away by her love for this child than any one else in the house she talked severely and had capital theories but her severity ended in talk and her theories would not work however she read several books on education knitting socks for leonard all the while and upon the whole i think the hands were more usefully employed than the head and the good honest heart better than either she looked older than when we first knew her but it was a ripe kindly age that was coming over her her excellent practical sense perhaps made her a more masculine character than her brother he was often so much perplexed by the problems of life that he let the time for action go by but she kept him in check by her clear pithy talk which brought back his wandering thoughts to the duty that lay straight before him waiting for action and then he remembered that it was the faithful part to wait patiently upon god and leave the ends in his hands who alone knows why evil exists in this world and why it ever hovers on either side of good in this respect miss benson had more faith than her brotheror so it seemed for quick resolute action in the next step of life was all she required while he deliberated and trembled and often did wrong from his very deliberation when his first instinct would have led him right but although decided and prompt as ever miss benson was grown older since the summer afternoon when she dismounted from the coach at the foot of the long welsh hill that led to llandhu where her brother awaited her to consult her about ruth though her eye was as bright and straightlooking as ever quick and brave in its glances her hair had become almost snowy white and it was on this point she consulted sally soon after the date of leonards last untruth the two were arranging miss bensons room one morning when after dusting the lookingglass she suddenly stopped in her operation and after a close inspection of herself startled sally by this speech sally im looking a great deal older than i used to do sally who was busy dilating on the increased price of flour considered this remark of miss bensons as strangely irrelevant to the matter in hand and only noticed it by a to be sure i suppose we all on us do but twoandfourpence a dozen is too much to make us pay for it miss benson went on with her inspection of herself and sally with her economical projects sally said miss benson my hair is nearly white the last time i looked it was only pepperandsalt what must i do dowhy what would the wench do asked sally contemptuously yere never going to be taken in at your time of life by hairdyes and such gimcracks as can only take in young girls whose wisdomteeth are not cut and who are not very likely to want them said miss benson quietly no but you see sally its very awkward having such grey hair and feeling so young do you know sally ive as great a mind for dancing when i hear a lively tune on the streetorgans as ever and as great a mind to sing when im happyto sing in my old way sally you know aye you had it from a girl said sally and many a time when the doors been shut i did not know if it was you in the parlour or a big bumblebee in the kitchen as was making that drumbling noise i heard you at it yesterday but an old woman with grey hair ought not to have a fancy for dancing or singing continued miss benson whatten nonsense are ye talking said sally roused to indignation calling yoursel an old woman when youre better than ten years younger than me and many a girl has grey hair at fiveandtwenty but im more than fiveandtwenty sally im fiftyseven next may more shame for ye then not to know better than to talk of dyeing your hair i cannot abide such vanities oh dear sally when will you understand what i mean i want to know how i am to keep remembering how old i am so as to prevent myself from feeling so young i was quite startled just now to see my hair in the glass for i can generally tell if my cap is straight by feeling ill tell you what ill doill cut off a piece of my grey hair and plait it together for a marker in my bible miss benson expected applause for this bright idea but sally only made answer youll be taking to painting your cheeks next now youve once thought of dyeing your hair so miss benson plaited her grey hair in silence and quietness leonard holding one end of it while she wove it and admiring the colour and texture all the time with a sort of implied dissatisfaction at the auburn colour of his own curls which was only halfcomforted away by miss bensons information that if he lived long enough his hair would be like hers mr benson who had looked old and frail while he was yet but young was now stationary as to the date of his appearance but there was something more of nervous restlessness in his voice and ways than formerly that was the only change six years had brought to him and as for sally she chose to forget age and the passage of years altogether and had as much work in her to use her own expression as she had at sixteen nor was her appearance very explicit as to the flight of time fifty sixty or seventy she might benot more than the last not less than the firstthough her usual answer to any circuitous inquiry as to her age was now what it had been for many years past im feared i shall never see thirty again then as to the house it was not one where the sittingrooms are refurnished every two or three years not now even since ruth came to share their living a place where as an article grew shabby or worn a new one was purchased the furniture looked poor and the carpets almost threadbare but there was such a dainty spirit of cleanliness abroad such exquisite neatness of repair and altogether so bright and cheerful a look about the roomseverything so aboveboardno shifts to conceal poverty under flimsy ornamentthat many a splendid drawingroom would give less pleasure to those who could see evidences of character in inanimate things but whatever poverty there might be in the house there was full luxuriance in the little square wallencircled garden on two sides of which the parlour and kitchen looked the laburnumtree which when ruth came was like a twig stuck into the ground was now a golden glory in spring and a pleasant shade in summer the wild hop that mr benson had brought home from one of his country rambles and planted by the parlourwindow while leonard was yet a baby in his mothers arms was now a garland over the casement hanging down long tendrils that waved in the breezes and threw pleasant shadows and traceries like some bacchanalian carving on the parlourwalls at morn or dusky eve the yellow rose had clambered up to the window of mr bensons bedroom and its blossomladen branches were supported by a jargonelle peartree rich in autumnal fruit but perhaps in ruth herself there was the greatest external change for of the change which had gone on in her heart and mind and soul or if there had been any neither she nor any one around her was conscious but sometimes miss benson did say to sally how very handsome ruth is grown to which sally made ungracious answer yes shes well enough beauty is deceitful and favour a snare and im thankful the lord has spared me from such mantraps and springguns but even sally could not help secretly admiring ruth if her early brilliancy of colour was gone a clear ivory skin as smooth as satin told of complete and perfect health and was as lovely if not so striking in effect as the banished lilies and roses her hair had grown darker and deeper in the shadow that lingered in its masses her eyes even if you could have guessed that they had shed bitter tears in their day had a thoughtful spiritual look about them that made you wonder at their depth and lookand look again the increase of dignity in her face had been imparted to her form i do not know if she had grown taller since the birth of her child but she looked as if she had and although she had lived in a very humble home yet there was something about either it or her or the people amongst whom she had been thrown during the last few years which had so changed her that whereas six or seven years ago you would have perceived that she was not altogether a lady by birth and education yet now she might have been placed among the highest in the land and would have been taken by the most critical judge for their equal although ignorant of their conventional etiquettean ignorance which she would have acknowledged in a simple childlike way being unconscious of any false shame her whole heart was in her boy she often feared that she loved him too muchmore than god himselfyet she could not bear to pray to have her love for her child lessened but she would kneel down by his little bed at nightat the deep still midnightwith the stars that kept watch over rizpah shining down upon her and tell god what i have now told you that she feared she loved her child too much yet could not would not love him less and speak to him of her one treasure as she could speak to no earthly friend and so unconsciously her love for her child led her up to love to god to the allknowing who read her heart it might be superstitioni dare say it wasbut somehow she never lay down to rest without saying as she looked her last on her boy thy will not mine be done and even while she trembled and shrank with infinite dread from sounding the depths of what that will might be she felt as if her treasure were more secure to waken up rosy and bright in the morning as one over whose slumbers gods holy angels had watched for the very words which she had turned away in sick terror from realising the night before her daily absence at her duties to the bradshaw children only ministered to her love for leonard everything does minister to love when its foundation lies deep in a true heart and it was with an exquisite pang of delight that after a moment of vague fear oh mercy to myself i said if lucy should be dead she saw her childs bright face of welcome as he threw open the door every afternoon on her return home for it was his silentlyappointed work to listen for her knock and rush breathless to let her in if he were in the garden or upstairs among the treasures of the lumberroom either miss benson or her brother or sally would fetch him to his happy little task no one so sacred as he to the allotted duty and the joyous meeting was not deadened by custom to either mother or child ruth gave the bradshaws the highest satisfaction as mr bradshaw often said both to her and to the bensons indeed she rather winced under his pompous approbation but his favourite recreation was patronising and when ruth saw how quietly and meekly mr benson submitted to gifts and praise when an honest word of affection or a tacit implied acknowledgment of equality would have been worth everything said and done she tried to be more meek in spirit and to recognise the good that undoubtedly existed in mr bradshaw he was richer and more prosperous than evera keen farseeing man of business with an undisguised contempt for all who failed in the success which he had achieved but it was not alone those who were less fortunate in obtaining wealth than himself that he visited with severity of judgment every moral error or delinquency came under his unsparing comment stained by no vice himself either in his own eyes or in that of any human being who cared to judge him having nicely and wisely proportioned and adapted his means to his ends he could afford to speak and act with a severity which was almost sanctimonious in its ostentation of thankfulness as to himself not a misfortune or a sin was brought to light but mr bradshaw could trace it to its cause in some former mode of action which he had long ago foretold would lead to shame if anothers son turned out wild or bad mr bradshaw had little sympathy it might have been prevented by a stricter rule or more religious life at home young richard bradshaw was quiet and steady and other fathers might have had sons like him if they had taken the same pains to enforce obedience richard was an only son and yet mr bradshaw might venture to say he had never had his own way in his life mrs bradshaw was he confessed mr bradshaw did not dislike confessing his wifes errors rather less firm than he should have liked with the girls and with some people he believed jemima was rather headstrong but to his wishes she had always shown herself obedient all children were obedient if their parents were decided and authoritative and every one would turn out well if properly managed if they did not prove good they must take the consequences of their errors mrs bradshaw murmured faintly at her husband when his back was turned but if his voice was heard or his footsteps sounded in the distance she was mute and hurried her children into the attitude or action most pleasing to their father jemima it is true rebelled against this manner of proceeding which savoured to her a little of deceit but even she had not as yet overcome her awe of her father sufficiently to act independently of him and according to her own sense of rightor rather i should say according to her own warm passionate impulses before him the wilfulness which made her dark eyes blaze out at times was hushed and still he had no idea of her selftormenting no notion of the almost southern jealousy which seemed to belong to her brunette complexion jemima was not pretty the flatness and shortness of her face made her almost plain yet most people looked twice at her expressive countenance at the eyes which flamed or melted at every trifle at the rich colour which came at every expressed emotion into her usually sallow face at the faultless teeth which made her smile like a sunbeam but then again when she thought she was not kindly treated when a suspicion crossed her mind or when she was angry with herself her lips were tightpressed together her colour was wan and almost livid and a stormy gloom clouded her eyes as with a film but before her father her words were few and he did not notice looks or tones her brother richard had been equally silent before his father in boyhood and early youth but since he had gone to be clerk in a london house preparatory to assuming his place as junior partner in mr bradshaws business he spoke more on his occasional visits at home and very proper and highly moral was his conversation set sentences of goodness which were like the flowers that children stick in the ground and that have not sprung upwards from rootsdeep down in the hidden life and experience of the heart he was as severe a judge as his father of other peoples conduct but you felt that mr bradshaw was sincere in his condemnation of all outward error and vice and that he would try himself by the same laws as he tried others somehow richards words were frequently heard with a lurking distrust and many shook their heads over the pattern son but then it was those whose sons had gone astray and been condemned in no private or tender manner by mr bradshaw so it might be revenge in them still jemima felt that all was not right her heart sympathised in the rebellion against his fathers commands which her brother had confessed to her in an unusual moment of confidence but her uneasy conscience condemned the deceit which he had practised the brother and sister were sitting alone over a blazing christmas fire and jemima held an old newspaper in her hand to shield her face from the hot light they were talking of family events when during a pause jemimas eye caught the name of a great actor who had lately given prominence and life to a character in one of shakspeares plays the criticism in the paper was fine and warmed jemimas heart how i should like to see a play exclaimed she should you said her brother listlessly yes to be sure just hear this and she began to read a fine passage of criticism those newspaper people can make an article out of anything said he yawning ive seen the man myself and it was all very well but nothing to make such a fuss about you you seen have you seen a play richard oh why did you never tell me before tell me all about it why did you never name seeing in your letters he half smiled contemptuously enough oh at first it strikes one rather but after a while one cares no more for the theatre than one does for mincepies oh i wish i might go to london said jemima impatiently ive a great mind to ask papa to let me go to the george smiths and then i could see i would not think him like mincepies you must not do any such thing said richard now neither yawning nor contemptuous my father would never allow you to go to the theatre and the george smiths are such old fogeysthey would be sure to tell how do you go then does my father give you leave oh many things are right for men which are not for girls jemima sat and pondered richard wished he had not been so confidential you need not name it said he rather anxiously name what said she startled for her thoughts had gone far afield oh name my going once or twice to the theatre no i shant name it said she no one here would care to hear it but it was with some little surprise and almost with a feeling of disgust that she heard richard join with her father in condemning some one and add to mr bradshaws list of offences by alleging that the young man was a playgoer he did not think his sister heard his words mary and elizabeth were the two girls whom ruth had in charge they resembled jemima more than their brother in character the household rules were occasionally a little relaxed in their favour for mary the elder was nearly eight years younger than jemima and three intermediate children had died they loved ruth dearly made a great pet of leonard and had many profound secrets together most of which related to their wonders if jemima and mr farquhar would ever be married they watched their sister closely and every day had some fresh confidence to make to each other confirming or discouraging to their hopes ruth rose early and shared the household work with sally and miss benson till seven and then she helped leonard to dress and had a quiet time alone with him till prayers and breakfast at nine she was to be at mr bradshaws house she sat in the room with mary and elizabeth during the latin the writing and arithmetic lessons which they received from masters then she read and walked with them they clinging to her as to an elder sister she dined with her pupils at the family lunch and reached home by four that happy homethose quiet days and so the peaceful days passed on into weeks and months and years and ruth and leonard grew and strengthened into the riper beauty of their respective ages while as yet no touch of decay had come on the quaint primitive elders of the household chapter xx jemima refuses to be managed it was no wonder that the lookerson were perplexed as to the state of affairs between jemima and mr farquhar for they too were sorely puzzled themselves at the sort of relationship between them was it love or was it not that was the question in mr farquhars mind he hoped it was not he believed it was not and yet he felt as if it were there was something preposterous he thought in a man nearly forty years of age being in love with a girl of twenty he had gone on reasoning through all the days of his manhood on the idea of a staid nobleminded wife grave and sedate the fit companion in experience of her husband he had spoken with admiration of reticent characters full of selfcontrol and dignity and he hopedhe trusted that all this time he had not been allowing himself unconsciously to fall in love with a wildhearted impetuous girl who knew nothing of life beyond her fathers house and who chafed under the strict discipline enforced there for it was rather a suspicious symptom of the state of mr farquhars affections that he had discovered the silent rebellion which continued in jemimas heart unperceived by any of her own family against the severe laws and opinions of her father mr farquhar shared in these opinions but in him they were modified and took a milder form still he approved of much that mr bradshaw did and said and this made it all the more strange that he should wince so for jemima whenever anything took place which he instinctively knew that she would dislike after an evening at mr bradshaws when jemima had gone to the very verge of questioning or disputing some of her fathers severe judgments mr farquhar went home in a dissatisfied restless state of mind which he was almost afraid to analyse he admired the inflexible integrityand almost the pomp of principleevinced by mr bradshaw on every occasion he wondered how it was that jemima could not see how grand a life might be whose every action was shaped in obedience to some eternal law instead of which he was afraid she rebelled against every law and was only guided by impulse mr farquhar had been taught to dread impulses as promptings of the devil sometimes if he tried to present her fathers opinions before her in another form so as to bring himself and her rather more into that state of agreement he longed for she flashed out upon him with the indignation of difference that she dared not show to or before her father as if she had some diviner instinct which taught her more truly than they knew with all their experience at least in her first expressions there seemed something good and fine but opposition made her angry and irritable and the arguments which he was constantly provoking whenever he was with her in her fathers absence frequently ended in some vehemence of expression on her part that offended mr farquhar who did not see how she expiated her anger in tears and selfreproaches when alone in her chamber then he would lecture himself severely on the interest he could not help feeling in a wilful girl he would determine not to interfere with her opinions in future and yet the very next time they differed he strove to argue her into harmony with himself in spite of all resolutions to the contrary mr bradshaw saw just enough of this interest which jemima had excited in his partners mind to determine him in considering their future marriage as a settled affair the fitness of the thing had long ago struck him her fathers partnerso the fortune he meant to give her might continue in the business a man of such steadiness of character and such a capital eye for a desirable speculation as mr farquharjust the right age to unite the paternal with the conjugal affection and consequently the very man for jemima who had something unruly in her which might break out under a regime less wisely adjusted to the circumstances than was mr bradshaws in his own opiniona house readyfurnished at a convenient distance from her homeno near relations on mr farquhars side who might be inclined to consider his residence as their own for an indefinite time and so add to the household expensesin short what could be more suitable in every way mr bradshaw respected the very selfrestraint he thought he saw in mr farquhars demeanour attributing it to a wise desire to wait until trade should be rather more slack and the man of business more at leisure to become the lover as for jemima at times she thought she almost hated mr farquhar what business has he she would think to lecture me often i can hardly bear it from papa and i will not bear it from him he treats me just like a child and as if i should lose all my present opinions when i know more of the world i am sure i should like never to know the world if it was to make me think as he does hard man that he is i wonder what made him take jem brown on as gardener again if he does not believe that above one criminal in a thousand is restored to goodness ill ask him some day if that was not acting on impulse rather than principle poor impulse how you do get abused but i will tell mr farquhar i will not let him interfere with me if i do what papa bids me no one has a right to notice whether i do it willingly or not so then she tried to defy mr farquhar by doing and saying things that she knew he would disapprove she went so far that he was seriously grieved and did not even remonstrate and lecture and then she was disappointed and irritated for somehow with all her indignation at interference she liked to be lectured by him not that she was aware of this liking of hers but still it would have been more pleasant to be scolded than so quietly passed over her two little sisters with their wideawake eyes had long ago put things together and conjectured every day they had some fresh mystery together to be imparted in garden walks and whispered talks lizzie did you see how the tears came into mimies eyes when mr farquhar looked so displeased when she said good people were always dull i think shes in love mary said the last words with grave emphasis and felt like an oracle of twelve years of age i dont said lizzie i know i cry often enough when papa is cross and im not in love with him yes but you dont look as mimie did dont call her mimieyou know papa does not like it yes but there are so many things papa does not like i can never remember them all never mind about that but listen to something ive got to tell you if youll never never tell no indeed i wont mary what is it not to mrs denbigh no not even to mrs denbigh well then the other daylast friday mimie jemima interrupted the more conscientious elizabeth jemima if it must be so jerked out mary sent me to her desk for an envelope and what do you think i saw what asked elizabeth expecting nothing less than a redhot valentine signed walter farquhar pro bradshaw farquhar and co in full why a piece of paper with dulllooking lines upon it just like the scientific dialogues and i remembered all about it it was once when mr farquhar had been telling us that a bullet does not go in a straight line but in a something curve and he drew some lines on a piece of paper and mimie jemima put in elizabeth well well she had treasured it up and written in a corner w f april rd now thats rather like love is not it for jemima hates useful information just as much as i do and thats saying a great deal and yet she had kept this paper and dated it if thats all i know dick keeps a paper with miss bensons name written on it and yet hes not in love with her and perhaps jemima may like mr farquhar and he may not like her it seems such a little while since her hair was turned up and he has always been a grave middleaged man ever since i can recollect and then have you never noticed how often he finds fault with heralmost lectures her to be sure said mary but he may be in love for all that just think how often papa lectures mamma and yet of course theyre in love with each other well we shall see said elizabeth poor jemima little thought of the four sharp eyes that watched her daily course while she sat alone as she fancied with her secret in her own room for in a passionate fit of grieving at the impatient hasty temper which had made her so seriously displease mr farquhar that he had gone away without remonstrance without more leavetaking than a distant bow she had begun to suspect that rather than not be noticed at all by him rather than be an object of indifference to himoh far rather would she be an object of anger and upbraiding and the thoughts that followed this confession to herself stunned and bewildered her and for once that they made her dizzy with hope ten times they made her sick with fear for an instant she planned to become and to be all he could wish her to change her very nature for him and then a great gush of pride came over her and she set her teeth tight together and determined that he should either love her as she was or not at all unless he could take her with all her faults she would not care for his regard love was too noble a word to call such cold calculating feeling as his must be who went about with a pattern idea in his mind trying to find a wife to match besides there was something degrading jemima thought in trying to alter herself to gain the love of any human creature and yet if he did not care for her if this late indifference were to last what a great shroud was drawn over life could she bear it from the agony she dared not look at but which she was going to risk encountering she was aroused by the presence of her mother jemima your father wants to speak to you in the diningroom what for asked the girl oh he is fidgeted by something mr farquhar said to me and which i repeated i am sure i thought there was no harm in it and your father always likes me to tell him what everybody says in his absence jemima went with a heavy heart into her fathers presence he was walking up and down the room and did not see her at first oh jemima is that you has your mother told you what i want to speak to you about no said jemima not exactly she has been telling me what proves to me how very seriously you must have displeased and offended mr farquhar before he could have expressed himself to her as he did when he left the house you know what he said no said jemima her heart swelling within her he has no right to say anything about me she was desperate or she durst not have said this before her father no rightwhat do you mean jemima said mr bradshaw turning sharp round surely you must know that i hope he may one day be your husband that is to say if you prove yourself worthy of the excellent training i have given you i cannot suppose mr farquhar would take any undisciplined girl as a wife jemima held tight by a chair near which she was standing she did not speak her father was pleased by her silenceit was the way in which he liked his projects to be received but you cannot suppose he continued that mr farquhar will consent to marry you consent to marry me repeated jemima in a low tone of brooding indignation were those the terms upon which her rich womans heart was to be given with a calm consent of acquiescent acceptance but a little above resignation on the part of the receiver if you give way to a temper which although you have never dared to show it to me i am well aware exists although i hoped the habits of selfexamination i had instilled had done much to cure you of manifesting it at one time richard promised to be the more headstrong of the two now i must desire you to take pattern by him yes he continued falling into his old train of thought it would be a most fortunate connexion for you in every way i should have you under my own eye and could still assist you in the formation of your character and i should be at hand to strengthen and confirm your principles mr farquhars connexion with the firm would be convenient and agreeable to me in a pecuniary point of view he mr bradshaw was going on in his enumeration of the advantages which he in particular and jemima in the second place would derive from this marriage when his daughter spoke at first so low that he could not hear her as he walked up and down the room with his creaking boots and he had to stop to listen has mr farquhar ever spoken to you about it jemimas cheek was flushed as she asked the question she wished that she might have been the person to whom he had first addressed himself mr bradshaw answered no not spoken it has been implied between us for some time at least i have been so aware of his intentions that i have made several allusions in the course of business to it as a thing that might take place he can hardly have misunderstood he must have seen that i perceived his design and approved of it said mr bradshaw rather doubtfully as he remembered how very little in fact passed between him and his partner which could have reference to the subject to any but a mind prepared to receive it perhaps mr farquhar had not really thought of it but then again that would imply that his own penetration had been mistaken a thing not impossible certainly but quite beyond the range of probability so he reassured himself and as he thought his daughter by saying the whole thing is so suitablethe advantages arising from the connexion are so obvious besides which i am quite aware from many little speeches of mr farquhars that he contemplates marriage at no very distant time and he seldom leaves eccleston and visits few families besides our owncertainly none that can compare with ours in the advantages you have all received in moral and religious training but then mr bradshaw was checked in his implied praises of himself and only himself could be his martingale when he once set out on such a career by a recollection that jemima must not feel too secure as she might become if he dwelt too much on the advantages of her being her fathers daughter accordingly he said but you must be aware jemima that you do very little credit to the education i have given you when you make such an impression as you must have done today before mr farquhar could have said what he did of you what did he say asked jemima still in the low husky tone of suppressed anger your mother says he remarked to her what a pity it is that jemima cannot maintain her opinions without going into a passion and what a pity it is that her opinions are such as to sanction rather than curb these fits of rudeness and anger did he say that said jemima in a still lower tone not questioning her father but speaking rather to herself i have no doubt he did replied her father gravely your mother is in the habit of repeating accurately to me what takes place in my absence besides which the whole speech is not one of hers she has not altered a word in the repetition i am convinced i have trained her to habits of accuracy very unusual in a woman at another time jemima might have been inclined to rebel against this system of carrying constant intelligence to headquarters which she had long ago felt as an insurmountable obstacle to any free communication with her mother but now her fathers means of acquiring knowledge faded into insignificance before the nature of the information he imparted she stood quite still grasping the chairback longing to be dismissed i have said enough now i hope to make you behave in a becoming manner to mr farquhar if your temper is too unruly to be always under your own control at least have respect to my injunctions and take some pains to curb it before him may i go asked jemima chafing more and more you may said her father when she left the room he gently rubbed his hands together satisfied with the effect he had produced and wondering how it was that one so well brought up as his daughter could ever say or do anything to provoke such a remark from mr farquhar as that which he had heard repeated nothing can be more gentle and docile than she is when spoken to in the proper manner i must give farquhar a hint said mr bradshaw to himself jemima rushed upstairs and locked herself into her room she began pacing up and down at first without shedding a tear but then she suddenly stopped and burst out crying with passionate indignation so i am to behave well not because it is rightnot because it is rightbut to show off before mr farquhar oh mr farquhar said she suddenly changing to a sort of upbraiding tone of voice i did not think so of you an hour ago i did not think you could choose a wife in that coldhearted way though you did profess to act by rule and line but you think to have me do you because it is fitting and suitable and you want to be married and cant spare time for wooing she was lashing herself up by an exaggeration of all her father had said and how often i have thought you were too grand for me but now i know better now i can believe that all you do is done from calculation you are good because it adds to your business credityou talk in that high strain about principle because it sounds well and is respectableand even these things are better than your cold way of looking out for a wife just as you would do for a carpet to add to your comforts and settle you respectably but i wont be that wife you shall see something of me which shall make you not acquiesce so quietly in the arrangements of the firm she cried too vehemently to go on thinking or speaking then she stopped and said only an hour ago i was hopingi dont know what i was hopingbut i thoughtoh how i was deceivedi thought he had a true deep loving manly heart which god might let me win but now i know he has only a calm calculating head if jemima had been vehement and passionate before this conversation with her father it was better than the sullen reserve she assumed now whenever mr farquhar came to the house he felt it deeply no reasoning with himself took off the pain he experienced he tried to speak on the subjects she liked in the manner she liked until he despised himself for the unsuccessful efforts he stood between her and her father once or twice in obvious inconsistency with his own previously expressed opinions and mr bradshaw piqued himself upon his admirable management in making jemima feel that she owed his indulgence or forbearance to mr farquhars interference but jemimaperverse miserable jemimathought that she hated mr farquhar all the more she respected her father inflexible much more than her father pompously giving up to mr farquhars subdued remonstrances on her behalf even mr bradshaw was perplexed and shut himself up to consider how jemima was to be made more fully to understand his wishes and her own interests but there was nothing to take hold of as a ground for any further conversation with her her actions were so submissive that they were spiritless she did all her father desired she did it with a nervous quickness and haste if she thought that otherwise mr farquhar would interfere in any way she wished evidently to owe nothing to him she had begun by leaving the room when he came in after the conversation she had had with her father but at mr bradshaws first expression of his wish that she should remain she remainedsilent indifferent inattentive to all that was going on at least there was this appearance of inattention she would work away at her sewing as if she were to earn her livelihood by it the light was gone out of her eyes as she lifted them up heavily before replying to any question and the eyelids were often swollen with crying but in all this there was no positive fault mr bradshaw could not have told her not to do this or to do that without her doing it for she had become much more docile of late it was a wonderful proof of the influence ruth had gained in the family that mr bradshaw after much deliberation congratulated himself on the wise determination he had made of requesting her to speak to jemima and find out what feeling was at the bottom of all this change in her ways of going on he rang the bell is mrs denbigh here he inquired of the servant who answered it yes sir she is just come beg her to come to me in this room as soon as she can leave the young ladies ruth came sit down mrs denbigh sit down i want to have a little conversation with you not about your pupils they are going on well under your care i am sure and i often congratulate myself on the choice i madei assure you i do but now i want to speak to you about jemima she is very fond of you and perhaps you could take some opportunity of observing to herin short of saying to her that she is behaving very foolishlyin fact disgusting mr farquhar who was i know inclined to like her by the sullen sulky way she behaves in when he is by he paused for the ready acquiescence he expected but ruth did not quite comprehend what was required of her and disliked the glimpse she had gained of the task very much i hardly understand sir you are displeased with miss bradshaws manners to mr farquhar well well not quite that i am displeased with her mannersthey are sulky and abrupt particularly when he is byand i want you of whom she is so fond to speak to her about it but i have never had the opportunity of noticing them whenever i have seen her she has been most gentle and affectionate but i think you do not hesitate to believe me when i say that i have noticed the reverse said mr bradshaw drawing himself up no sir i beg your pardon if i have expressed myself so badly as to seem to doubt but am i to tell miss bradshaw that you have spoken of her faults to me asked ruth a little astonished and shrinking more than ever from the proposed task if you would allow me to finish what i have got to say without interruption i could then tell you what i do wish i beg your pardon sir said ruth gently i wish you to join our circle occasionally in an evening mrs bradshaw shall send you an invitation when mr farquhar is likely to be here warned by me and consequently with your observation quickened you can hardly fail to notice instances of what i have pointed out and then i will trust to your own good sense mr bradshaw bowed to her at this part of his sentence to find an opportunity to remonstrate with her ruth was beginning to speak but he waved his hand for another minute of silence only a minute mrs denbigh i am quite aware that in requesting your presence occasionally in the evening i shall be trespassing upon the time which is in fact your money you may be assured that i shall not forget this little circumstance and you can explain what i have said on this head to benson and his sister i am afraid i cannot do it ruth began but while she was choosing words delicate enough to express her reluctance to act as he wished he had almost bowed her out of the room and thinking that she was modest in her estimate of her qualifications for remonstrating with his daughter he added blandly no one so able mrs denbigh i have observed many qualities in youobserved when perhaps you have little thought it if he had observed ruth that morning he would have seen an absence of mind and depression of spirits not much to her credit as a teacher for she could not bring herself to feel that she had any right to go into the family purposely to watch over and find fault with any one member of it if she had seen anything wrong in jemima ruth loved her so much that she would have told her of it in private and with many doubts how far she was the one to pull out the mote from any ones eye even in the most tender mannershe would have had to conquer reluctance before she could have done even this but there was something undefinably repugnant to her in the manner of acting which mr bradshaw had proposed and she determined not to accept the invitations which were to place her in so false a position but as she was leaving the house after the end of the lessons while she stood in the hall tying on her bonnet and listening to the last small confidences of her two pupils she saw jemima coming in through the gardendoor and was struck by the change in her looks the large eyes so brilliant once were dim and clouded the complexion sallow and colourless a lowering expression was on the dark brow and the corners of her mouth drooped as with sorrowful thoughts she looked up and her eyes met ruths oh you beautiful creature thought jemima with your still calm heavenly face what are you to know of earths trials you have lost your beloved by deathbut that is a blessed sorrow the sorrow i have pulls me down and down and makes me despise and hate every onenot you though and her face changing to a soft tender look she went up to ruth and kissed her fondly as if it were a relief to be near some one on whose true pure heart she relied ruth returned the caress and even while she did so she suddenly rescinded her resolution to keep clear of what mr bradshaw had desired her to do on her way home she resolved if she could to find out what were jemimas secret feelings and if as from some previous knowledge she suspected they were morbid and exaggerated in any way to try and help her right with all the wisdom which true love gives it was time that some one should come to still the storm in jemimas turbulent heart which was daily and hourly knowing less and less of peace the irritating difficulty was to separate the two characters which at two different times she had attributed to mr farquharthe old one which she had formerly believed to be true that he was a man acting up to a high standard of lofty principle and acting up without a struggle and this last had been the circumstance which had made her rebellious and irritable once the new one which her father had excited in her suspicious mind that mr farquhar was cold and calculating in all he did and that she was to be transferred by the former and accepted by the latter as a sort of stockintradethese were the two mr farquhars who clashed together in her mind and in this state of irritation and prejudice she could not bear the way in which he gave up his opinions to please her that was not the way to win her she liked him far better when he inflexibly and rigidly adhered to his idea of right and wrong not even allowing any force to temptation and hardly any grace to repentance compared with that beauty of holiness which had never yielded to sin he had been her idol in those days as she found out now however much at the time she had opposed him with violence as for mr farquhar he was almost weary of himself no reasoning even no principle seemed to have influence over him for he saw that jemima was not at all what he approved of in woman he saw her uncurbed and passionate affecting to despise the rules of life he held most sacred and indifferent to if not positively disliking him and yet he loved her dearly but he resolved to make a great effort of will and break loose from these trammels of sense and while he resolved some old recollection would bring her up hanging on his arm in all the confidence of early girlhood looking up in his face with her soft dark eyes and questioning him upon the mysterious subjects which had so much interest for both of them at that time although they had become only matter for dissension in these later days it was also true as mr bradshaw had said mr farquhar wished to marry and had not much choice in the small town of eccleston he never put this so plainly before himself as a reason for choosing jemima as her father had done to her but it was an unconscious motive all the same however now he had lectured himself into the resolution to make a pretty long absence from eccleston and see if amongst his distant friends there was no woman more in accordance with his ideal who could put the naughty wilful plaguing jemima bradshaw out of his head if he did not soon perceive some change in her for the better a few days after ruths conversation with mr bradshaw the invitation she had been expecting yet dreading came it was to her alone mr and miss benson were pleased at the compliment to her and urged her acceptance of it she wished that they had been included she had not thought it right or kind to jemima to tell them why she was going and she feared now lest they should feel a little hurt that they were not asked too but she need not have been afraid they were glad and proud of the attention to her and never thought of themselves ruthie what gown shall you wear tonight your dark grey one i suppose asked miss benson yes i suppose so i never thought of it but that is my best well then i shall quill up a ruff for you you know i am a famous quiller of net ruth came downstairs with a little flush on her cheeks when she was ready to go she held her bonnet and shawl in her hand for she knew miss benson and sally would want to see her dressed is not mamma pretty asked leonard with a childs pride she looks very nice and tidy said miss benson who had an idea that children should not talk or think about beauty i think my ruff looks so nice said ruth with gentle pleasure and indeed it did look nice and set off the pretty round throat most becomingly her hair now grown long and thick was smoothed as close to her head as its waving nature would allow and plaited up in a great rich knot low down behind the grey gown was as plain as plain could be you should have light gloves ruth said miss benson she went upstairs and brought down a delicate pair of limerick ones which had been long treasured up in a walnutshell they say them gloves is made of chickensskins said sally examining them curiously i wonder how they set about skinning em here ruth said mr benson coming in from the garden heres a rose or two for you i am sorry there are no more i hoped i should have had my yellow rose out by this time but the damask and the white are in a warmer corner and have got the start miss benson and leonard stood at the door and watched her down the little passagestreet till she was out of sight she had hardly touched the bell at mr bradshaws door when mary and elizabeth opened it with boisterous glee we saw you comingweve been watching for youwe want you to come round the garden before tea papa is not come in yet do come she went round the garden with a little girl clinging to each arm it was full of sunshine and flowers and this made the contrast between it and the usual large family room which fronted the northeast and therefore had no evening sun to light up its cold drab furniture more striking than usual it looked very gloomy there was the great diningtable heavy and square the range of chairs straight and square the workboxes useful and square the colouring of walls and carpet and curtains all of the coldest description everything was handsome and everything was ugly mrs bradshaw was asleep in her easychair when they came in jemima had just put down her work and lost in thought she leant her cheek on her hand when she saw ruth she brightened a little and went to her and kissed her mrs bradshaw jumped up at the sound of their entrance and was wide awake in a moment oh i thought your father was here said she evidently relieved to find that he had not come in and caught her sleeping thank you mrs denbigh for coming to us tonight said she in the quiet tone in which she generally spoke in her husbands absence when he was there a sort of constant terror of displeasing him made her voice sharp and nervous the children knew that many a thing passed over by their mother when their father was away was sure to be noticed by her when he was present and noticed too in a cross and querulous manner for she was so much afraid of the blame which on any occasion of their misbehaviour fell upon her and yet she looked up to her husband with a reverence and regard and a faithfulness of love which his decision of character was likely to produce on a weak and anxious mind he was a rest and a support to her on whom she cast all her responsibilities she was an obedient unremonstrating wife to him no stronger affection had ever brought her duty to him into conflict with any desire of her heart she loved her children dearly though they all perplexed her very frequently her son was her especial darling because he very seldom brought her into any scrapes with his father he was so cautious and prudent and had the art of keeping a calm sough about any difficulty he might be in with all her dutiful sense of the obligation which her husband enforced upon her to notice and tell him everything that was going wrong in the household and especially among his children mrs bradshaw somehow contrived to be honestly blind to a good deal that was not praiseworthy in master richard mr bradshaw came in before long bringing with him mr farquhar jemima had been talking to ruth with some interest before then but on seeing mr farquhar she bent her head down over her work went a little paler and turned obstinately silent mr bradshaw longed to command her to speak but even he had a suspicion that what she might say when so commanded might be rather worse in its effect than her gloomy silence so he held his peace and a discontented angry kind of peace it was mrs bradshaw saw that something was wrong but could not tell what only she became every moment more trembling and nervous and irritable and sent mary and elizabeth off on all sorts of contradictory errands to the servants and made the tea twice as strong and sweetened it twice as much as usual in hopes of pacifying her husband with good things mr farquhar had gone for the last time or so he thought he had resolved for the fifth time that he would go and watch jemima once more and if her temper got the better of her and she showed the old sullenness again and gave the old proofs of indifference to his good opinion he would give her up altogether and seek a wife elsewhere he sat watching her with folded arms and in silence altogether they were a pleasant family party jemima wanted to wind a skein of wool mr farquhar saw it and came to her anxious to do her this little service she turned away pettishly and asked ruth to hold it for her ruth was hurt for mr farquhar and looked sorrowfully at jemima but jemima would not see her glance of upbraiding as ruth hoping that she would relent delayed a little to comply with her request mr farquhar did and went back to his seat to watch them both he saw jemima turbulent and stormy in look he saw ruth to all appearance heavenly calm as the angels or with only that little tinge of sorrow which her friends behaviour had called forth he saw the unusual beauty of her face and form which he had never noticed before and he saw jemima with all the brilliancy she once possessed in eyes and complexion dimmed and faded he watched ruth speaking low and soft to the little girls who seemed to come to her in every difficulty and he remarked her gentle firmness when their bedtime came and they pleaded to stay up longer their father was absent in his countinghouse or they would not have dared to do so he liked ruths soft distinct unwavering no you must go you must keep to what is right far better than the goodnatured yielding to entreaty he had formerly admired in jemima he was wandering off into this comparison while ruth with delicate and unconscious tact was trying to lead jemima into some subject which should take her away from the thoughts whatever they were that made her so ungracious and rude jemima was ashamed of herself before ruth in a way which she had never been before any one else she valued ruths good opinion so highly that she dreaded lest her friend should perceive her faults she put a check upon herselfa check at first but after a little time she had forgotten something of her trouble and listened to ruth and questioned her about leonard and smiled at his little witticisms and only the sighs that would come up from the very force of habit brought back the consciousness of her unhappiness before the end of the evening jemima had allowed herself to speak to mr farquhar in the old wayquestioning differing disputing she was recalled to the remembrance of that miserable conversation by the entrance of her father after that she was silent but he had seen her face more animated and bright with a smile as she spoke to mr farquhar and although he regretted the loss of her complexion for she was still very pale he was highly pleased with the success of his project he never doubted but that ruth had given her some sort of private exhortation to behave better he could not have understood the pretty art with which by simply banishing unpleasant subjects and throwing a wholesome natural sunlit tone over others ruth had insensibly drawn jemima out of her gloom he resolved to buy mrs denbigh a handsome silk gown the very next day he did not believe she had a silk gown poor creature he had noticed that dark grey stuff this long long time as her sunday dress he liked the colour the silk one should be just the same tinge then he thought that it would perhaps be better to choose a lighter shade one which might be noticed as different to the old gown for he had no doubt she would like to have it remarked and perhaps would not object to tell people that it was a present from mr bradshawa token of his approbation he smiled a little to himself as he thought of this additional source of pleasure to ruth she in the meantime was getting up to go home while jemima was lighting the bedcandle at the lamp ruth came round to bid good night mr bradshaw could not allow her to remain till the morrow uncertain whether he was satisfied or not good night mrs denbigh said he good night thank you i am obliged to youi am exceedingly obliged to you he laid emphasis on these words for he was pleased to see mr farquhar step forward to help jemima in her little office mr farquhar offered to accompany ruth home but the streets that intervened between mr bradshaws and the chapelhouse were so quiet that he desisted when he learnt from ruths manner how much she disliked his proposal mr bradshaw too instantly observed oh mrs denbigh need not trouble you farquhar i have servants at liberty at any moment to attend on her if she wishes it in fact he wanted to make hay while the sun shone and to detain mr farquhar a little longer now that jemima was so gracious she went upstairs with ruth to help her to put on her things dear jemima said ruth i am so glad to see you looking better tonight you quite frightened me this morning you looked so ill did i replied jemima oh ruth i have been so unhappy lately i want you to come and put me to rights she continued half smiling you know im a sort of outpupil of yours though we are so nearly of an age you ought to lecture me and make me good should i dear said ruth i dont think im the one to do it oh yes you areyouve done me good tonight well if i can do anything for you tell me what it is asked ruth tenderly oh not nownot now replied jemima i could not tell you here its a long story and i dont know that i can tell you at all mamma might come up at any moment and papa would be sure to ask what we had been talking about so long take your own time love said ruth only remember as far as i can how glad i am to help you youre too good my darling said jemima fondly dont say so replied ruth earnestly almost as if she were afraid god knows i am not well were none of us too good answered jemima i know that but you are very good nay i wont call you so if it makes you look so miserable but come away downstairs with the fragrance of ruths sweetness lingering about her jemima was her best self during the next halfhour mr bradshaw was more and more pleased and raised the price of the silk which he was going to give ruth sixpence a yard during the time mr farquhar went home through the gardenway happier than he had been this long time he even caught himself humming the old refrain on revient on revient toujours a ses premiers amours but as soon as he was aware of what he was doing he cleared away the remnants of the song into a cough which was sonorous if not perfectly real chapter xxi mr farquhars attentions transferred the next morning as jemima and her mother sat at their work it came into the head of the former to remember her fathers very marked way of thanking ruth the evening before what a favourite mrs denbigh is with papa said she i am sure i dont wonder at it did you notice mamma how he thanked her for coming here last night yes dear but i dont think it was all mrs bradshaw stopped short she was never certain if it was right or wrong to say anything not all what asked jemima when she saw her mother was not going to finish the sentence not all because mrs denbigh came to tea here replied mrs bradshaw why what else could he be thanking her for what has she done asked jemima stimulated to curiosity by her mothers hesitating manner i dont know if i ought to tell you said mrs bradshaw oh very well said jemima rather annoyed nay dear your papa never said i was not to tell perhaps i may never mind i dont want to hear in a piqued tone there was silence for a little while jemima was trying to think of something else but her thoughts would revert to the wonder what mrs denbigh could have done for her father i think i may tell you though said mrs bradshaw half questioning jemima had the honour not to urge any confidence but she was too curious to take any active step towards repressing it mrs bradshaw went on i think you deserve to know it is partly your doing that papa is so pleased with mrs denbigh he is going to buy her a silk gown this morning and i think you ought to know why why asked jemima because papa is so pleased to find that you mind what she says i mind what she says to be sure i do and always did but why should papa give her a gown for that i think he ought to give it me rather said jemima half laughing i am sure he would dear he will give you one i am certain if you want one he was so pleased to see you like your old self to mr farquhar last night we neither of us could think what had come over you this last month but now all seems right a dark cloud came over jemimas face she did not like this close observation and constant comment upon her manners and what had ruth to do with it i am glad you were pleased said she very coldly then after a pause she added but you have not told me what mrs denbigh had to do with my good behaviour did not she speak to you about it asked mrs bradshaw looking up no why should she she has no right to criticise what i do she would not be so impertinent said jemima feeling very uncomfortable and suspicious yes love she would have had a right for papa had desired her to do it papa desired her what do you mean mamma oh dear i dare say i should not have told you said mrs bradshaw perceiving from jemimas tone of voice that something had gone wrong only you spoke as if it would be impertinent in mrs denbigh and i am sure she would not do anything that was impertinent you know it would be but right for her to do what papa told her and he said a great deal to her the other day about finding out why you were so cross and bringing you right and you are right now dear said mrs bradshaw soothingly thinking that jemima was annoyed like a good child at the recollection of how naughty she had been then papa is going to give mrs denbigh a gown because i was civil to mr farquhar last night yes dear said mrs bradshaw more and more frightened at jemimas angry manner of speakinglowtoned but very indignant jemima remembered with smouldered anger ruths pleading way of wiling her from her sullenness the night before management everywhere but in this case it was peculiarly revolting so much so that she could hardly bear to believe that the seeminglytransparent ruth had lent herself to it are you sure mamma that papa asked mrs denbigh to make me behave differently it seems so strange i am quite sure he spoke to her last friday morning in the study i remember it was friday because mrs dean was working here jemima remembered now that she had gone into the schoolroom on the friday and found her sisters lounging about and wondering what papa could possibly want with mrs denbigh after this conversation jemima repulsed all ruths timid efforts to ascertain the cause of her disturbance and to help her if she could ruths tender sympathising manner as she saw jemima daily looking more wretched was distasteful to the latter in the highest degree she could not say that mrs denbighs conduct was positively wrongit might even be quite right but it was inexpressibly repugnant to her to think of her father consulting with a stranger a week ago she almost considered ruth as a sister how to manage his daughter so as to obtain the end he wished for yes even if that end was for her own good she was thankful and glad to see a brown paper parcel lying on the halltable with a note in ruths handwriting addressed to her father she knew what it was the grey silk dress that she was sure ruth would never accept no one henceforward could induce jemima to enter into conversation with mr farquhar she suspected manoeuvring in the simplest actions and was miserable in this constant state of suspicion she would not allow herself to like mr farquhar even when he said things the most after her own heart she heard him one evening talking with her father about the principles of trade her father stood out for the keenest sharpest work consistent with honesty if he had not been her father she would perhaps have thought some of his sayings inconsistent with true christian honesty he was for driving hard bargains exacting interest and payment of just bills to a day that was he said the only way in which trade could be conducted once allow a margin of uncertainty or where feelings instead of maxims were to be the guide and all hope of there ever being any good men of business was ended suppose a delay of a month in requiring payment might save a mans creditprevent his becoming a bankrupt put in mr farquhar i would not give it him i would let him have money to set up again as soon as he had passed the bankruptcy court if he never passed i might in some cases make him an allowance but i would always keep my justice and my charity separate and yet charity in your sense of the word degrades justice tempered with mercy and consideration elevates that is not justicejustice is certain and inflexible no mr farquhar you must not allow any quixotic notions to mingle with your conduct as a tradesman and so they went on jemimas face glowing with sympathy in all mr farquhar said till once on looking up suddenly with sparkling eyes she saw a glance of her fathers which told her as plain as words could say that he was watching the effect of mr farquhars speeches upon his daughter she was chilled thenceforward she thought her father prolonged the argument in order to call out those sentiments which he knew would most recommend his partner to his daughter she would so fain have let herself love mr farquhar but this constant manoeuvring in which she did not feel clear that he did not take a passive part made her sick at heart she even wished that they might not go through the form of pretending to try to gain her consent to the marriage if it involved all this premeditated action and speechmakingsuch moving about of every one into their right places like pieces at chess she felt as if she would rather be bought openly like an oriental daughter where no one is degraded in their own eyes by being parties to such a contract the consequences of all this admirable management of mr bradshaws would have been very unfortunate to mr farquhar who was innocent of all connivance in any of the plotsindeed would have been as much annoyed at them as jemima had he been aware of them but that the impression made upon him by ruth on the evening i have so lately described was deepened by the contrast which her behaviour made to miss bradshaws on one or two more recent occasions there was no use he thought in continuing attentions so evidently distasteful to jemima to her a young girl hardly out of the schoolroom he probably appeared like an old man and he might even lose the friendship with which she used to regard him and which was and ever would be very dear to him if he persevered in trying to be considered as a lover he should always feel affectionately towards her her very faults gave her an interest in his eyes for which he had blamed himself most conscientiously and most uselessly when he was looking upon her as his future wife but which the said conscience would learn to approve of when she sank down to the place of a young friend over whom he might exercise a good and salutary interest mrs denbigh if not many months older in years had known sorrow and cares so early that she was much older in character besides her shy reserve and her quiet daily walk within the lines of duty were much in accordance with mr farquhars notion of what a wife should be still it was a wrench to take his affections away from jemima if she had not helped him to do so by every means in her power he could never have accomplished it yes by every means in her power had jemima alienated her lover her belovedfor so he was in fact and now her quicksighted eyes saw he was gone for everpast recall for did not her jealous sore heart feel even before he himself was conscious of the fact that he was drawn towards sweet lovely composed and dignified ruthone who always thought before she spoke as mr farquhar used to bid jemima dowho never was tempted by sudden impulse but walked the world calm and selfgoverned what now availed jemimas reproaches as she remembered the days when he had watched her with earnest attentive eyes as he now watched ruth and the times since when led astray by her morbid fancy she had turned away from all his advances it was only in marchlast march he called me dear jemima ah dont i remember it well the pretty nosegay of greenhouse flowers that he gave me in exchange for the wild daffodilsand how he seemed to care for the flowers i gave himand how he looked at me and thanked methat is all gone and over now her sisters came in bright and glowing oh jemima how nice and cool you are sitting in this shady room she had felt it even chilly we have been such a long walk we are so tired it is so hot why did you go then said she oh we wanted to go we would not have stayed at home on any account it has been so pleasant said mary weve been to scaurside wood to gather wild strawberries said elizabeth such a quantity weve left a whole basketful in the dairy mr farquhar says hell teach us how to dress them in the way he learnt in germany if we can get him some hock do you think papa will let us have some was mr farquhar with you asked jemima a dull light coming into her eyes yes we told him this morning that mamma wanted us to take some old linen to the lame man at scaurside farm and that we meant to coax mrs denbigh to let us go into the wood and gather strawberries said elizabeth i thought he would make some excuse and come said the quickwitted mary as eager and thoughtless an observer of one loveaffair as of another and quite forgetting that not many weeks ago she had fancied an attachment between him and jemima did you i did not replied elizabeth at least i never thought about it i was quite startled when i heard his horses feet behind us on the road he said he was going to the farm and could take our basket was not it kind of him jemima did not answer so mary continued you know its a great pull up to the farm and we were so hot already the road was quite white and baked it hurt my eyes terribly i was so glad when mrs denbigh said we might turn into the wood the light was quite green there the branches are so thick overhead and there are whole beds of wild strawberries said elizabeth taking up the tale now mary was out of breath mary fanned herself with her bonnet while elizabeth went on you know where the grey rock crops out dont you jemima well there was a complete carpet of strawberry runners so pretty and we could hardly step without treading the little bright scarlet berries under foot we did so wish for leonard put in mary yes but mrs denbigh gathered a great many for him and mr farquhar gave her all his i thought you said he had gone on to dawsons farm said jemima oh yes he just went up there and then he left his horse there like a wise man and came to us in the pretty cool green wood oh jemima it was so prettylittle flecks of light coming down here and there through the leaves and quivering on the ground you must go with us tomorrow yes said mary were going again tomorrow we could not gather nearly all the strawberries and leonard is to go too tomorrow yes we thought of such a capital plan thats to say mr farquhar thought of itwe wanted to carry leonard up the hill in a kings cushion but mrs denbigh would not hear of it she said it would tire us so and yet she wanted him to gather strawberries and so interrupted mary for by this time the two girls were almost speaking together mr farquhar is to bring him up before him on his horse youll go with us wont you dear jemima asked elizabeth it will be at no i cant go said jemima abruptly dont ask mei cant the little girls were hushed into silence by her manner for whatever she might be to those above her in age and position to those below her jemima was almost invariably gentle she felt that they were wondering at her go upstairs and take off your things you know papa does not like you to come into this room in the shoes in which you have been out she was glad to cut her sisters short in the details which they were so mercilessly inflictingdetails which she must harden herself to before she could hear them quietly and unmoved she saw that she had lost her place as the first object in mr farquhars eyesa position she had hardly cared for while she was secure in the enjoyment of it but the charm of it now was redoubled in her acute sense of how she had forfeited it by her own doing and her own fault for if he were the cold calculating man her father had believed him to be and had represented him as being to her would he care for a portionless widow in humble circumstances like mrs denbigh no money no connexion encumbered with her boy the very action which proved mr farquhar to be lost to jemima reinstated him on his throne in her fancy and she must go on in hushed quietness quivering with every fresh token of his preference for another that other too one so infinitely more worthy of him than herself so that she could not have even the poor comfort of thinking that he had no discrimination and was throwing himself away on a common or worthless person ruth was beautiful gentle good and conscientious the hot colour flushed up into jemimas sallow face as she became aware that even while she acknowledged these excellences on mrs denbighs part she hated her the recollection of her marble face wearied her even to sickness the tones of her low voice were irritating from their very softness her goodness undoubted as it was was more distasteful than many faults which had more savour of human struggle in them what was this terrible demon in her heart asked jemimas better angel was she indeed given up to possession was not this the old stinging hatred which had prompted so many crimes the hatred of all sweet virtues which might win the love denied to us the old anger that wrought in the elder brothers heart till it ended in the murder of the gentle abel while yet the world was young oh god help me i did not know i was so wicked cried jemima aloud in her agony it had been a terrible glimpse into the dark lurid gulfthe capability for evil in her heart she wrestled with the demon but he would not depart it was to be a struggle whether or not she was to be given up to him in this her time of sore temptation all the next day long she sat and pictured the happy strawberry gathering going on even then in pleasant scaurside wood every touch of fancy which could heighten her idea of their enjoyment and of mr farquhars attention to the blushing conscious ruthevery such touch which would add a pang to her selfreproach and keen jealousy was added by her imagination she got up and walked about to try and stop her overbusy fancy by bodily exercise but she had eaten little all day and was weak and faint in the intense heat of the sunny garden even the long grasswalk under the filberthedge was parched and dry in the glowing august sun yet her sisters found her there when they returned walking quickly up and down as if to warm herself on some winters day they were very weary and not half so communicative as on the day before now that jemima was craving for every detail to add to her agony yes leonard came up before mr farquhar oh how hot it is jemima do sit down and ill tell you about it but i cant if you keep walking so i cant sit still today said jemima springing up from the turf as soon as she had sat down tell me i can hear you while i walk about oh but i cant shout i can hardly speak i am so tired mr farquhar brought leonard youve told me that before said jemima sharply well i dont know what else to tell somebody had been since yesterday and gathered nearly all the strawberries off the grey rock jemima jemima said elizabeth faintly i am so dizzyi think i am ill the next minute the tired girl lay swooning on the grass it was an outlet for jemimas fierce energy with a strength she had never again and never had known before she lifted up her fainting sister and bidding mary run and clear the way she carried her in through the open gardendoor up the wide oldfashioned stairs and laid her on the bed in her own room where the breeze from the window came softly and pleasantly through the green shade of the vineleaves and jessamine give me the water run for mamma mary said jemima as she saw that the faintingfit did not yield to the usual remedy of a horizontal position and the water sprinkling dear dear lizzie said jemima kissing the pale unconscious face i think you loved me darling the long walk on the hot day had been too much for the delicate elizabeth who was fast outgrowing her strength it was many days before she regained any portion of her spirit and vigour after that faintingfit she lay listless and weary without appetite or interest through the long sunny autumn weather on the bed or on the couch in jemimas room whither she had been carried at first it was a comfort to mrs bradshaw to be able at once to discover what it was that had knocked up elizabeth she did not rest easily until she had settled upon a cause for every ailment or illness in the family it was a stern consolation to mr bradshaw during his time of anxiety respecting his daughter to be able to blame somebody he could not like his wife have taken comfort from an inanimate fact he wanted the satisfaction of feeling that some one had been in fault or else this never could have happened poor ruth did not need his implied reproaches when she saw her gentle elizabeth lying feeble and languid her heart blamed her for thoughtlessness so severely as to make her take all mr bradshaws words and hints as too light censure for the careless way in which to please her own child she had allowed her two pupils to fatigue themselves with such long walks she begged hard to take her share of nursing every spare moment she went to mr bradshaws and asked with earnest humility to be allowed to pass them with elizabeth and as it was often a relief to have her assistance mrs bradshaw received these entreaties very kindly and desired her to go upstairs where elizabeths pale countenance brightened when she saw her but where jemima sat in silent annoyance that her own room was now become open ground for one whom her heart rose up against to enter in and be welcomed whether it was that ruth who was not an inmate of the house brought with her a fresher air more change of thought to the invalid i do not know but elizabeth always gave her a peculiarly tender greeting and if she had sunk down into languid fatigue in spite of all jemimas endeavours to interest her she roused up into animation when ruth came in with a flower a book or a brown and ruddy pear sending out the warm fragrance it retained from the sunny gardenwall at chapelhouse the jealous dislike which jemima was allowing to grow up in her heart against ruth was as she thought never shown in word or deed she was cold in manner because she could not be hypocritical but her words were polite and kind in purport and she took pains to make her actions the same as formerly but rule and line may measure out the figure of a man it is the soul that gives it life and there was no soul no inner meaning breathing out in jemimas actions ruth felt the change acutely she suffered from it some time before she ventured to ask what had occasioned it but one day she took miss bradshaw by surprise when they were alone together for a few minutes by asking her if she had vexed her in any way she was so changed it is sad when friendship has cooled so far as to render such a question necessary jemima went rather paler than usual and then made answer changed how do you mean how am i changed what do i say or do different from what i used to do but the tone was so constrained and cold that ruths heart sank within her she knew now as well as words could have told her that not only had the old feeling of love passed away from jemima but that it had gone unregretted and no attempt had been made to recall it love was very precious to ruth now as of old time it was one of the faults of her nature to be ready to make any sacrifices for those who loved her and to value affection almost above its price she had yet to learn the lesson that it is more blessed to love than to be beloved and lonely as the impressible years of her youth had beenwithout parents without brother or sisterit was perhaps no wonder that she clung tenaciously to every symptom of regard and could not relinquish the love of any one without a pang the doctor who was called in to elizabeth prescribed seaair as the best means of recruiting her strength mr bradshaw who liked to spend money ostentatiously went down straight to abermouth and engaged a house for the remainder of the autumn for as he told the medical man money was no object to him in comparison with his childrens health and the doctor cared too little about the mode in which his remedy was administered to tell mr bradshaw that lodgings would have done as well or better than the complete house he had seen fit to take for it was now necessary to engage servants and take much trouble which might have been obviated and elizabeths removal effected more quietly and speedily if she had gone into lodgings as it was she was weary of hearing all the planning and talking and deciding and undeciding and redeciding before it was possible for her to go her only comfort was in the thought that dear mrs denbigh was to go with her it had not been entirely by way of pompously spending his money that mr bradshaw had engaged this seaside house he was glad to get his little girls and their governess out of the way for a busy time was impending when he should want his head clear for electioneering purposes and his house clear for electioneering hospitality he was the mover of a project for bringing forward a man on the liberal and dissenting interest to contest the election with the old tory member who had on several successive occasions walked over the course as he and his family owned half the town and votes and rent were paid alike to the landlord kings of eccleston had mr cranworth and his ancestors been this many a long year their right was so little disputed that they never thought of acknowledging the allegiance so readily paid to them the old feudal feeling between landowner and tenant did not quake prophetically at the introduction of manufactures the cranworth family ignored the growing power of the manufacturers more especially as the principal person engaged in the trade was a dissenter but notwithstanding this lack of patronage from the one great family in the neighbourhood the business flourished increased and spread wide and the dissenting head thereof looked around about the time of which i speak and felt himself powerful enough to defy the great cranworth interest even in their hereditary stronghold and by so doing avenge the slights of many yearsslights which rankled in mr bradshaws mind as much as if he did not go to chapel twice every sunday and pay the largest pewrent of any member of mr bensons congregation accordingly mr bradshaw had applied to one of the liberal parliamentary agents in londona man whose only principle was to do wrong on the liberal side he would not act right or wrong for a tory but for a whig the latitude of his conscience had never yet been discovered it was possible mr bradshaw was not aware of the character of this agent at any rate he knew he was the man for his purpose which was to hear of some one who would come forward as a candidate for the representation of eccleston on the dissenting interest there are in round numbers about six hundred voters said he two hundred are decidedly in the cranworth interestdare not offend mr cranworth poor souls two hundred more we may calculate upon as pretty certainfactory hands or people connected with our trade in some way or anotherwho are indignant at the stubborn way in which cranworth has contested the right of water two hundred are doubtful dont much care either way said the parliamentary agent of course we must make them care mr bradshaw rather shrunk from the knowing look with which this was said he hoped that mr pilson did not mean to allude to bribery but he did not express this hope because he thought it would deter the agent from using this means and it was possible it might prove to be the only way and if he mr bradshaw once embarked on such an enterprise there must be no failure by some expedient or another success must be certain or he could have nothing to do with it the parliamentary agent was well accustomed to deal with all kinds and shades of scruples he was most at home with men who had none but still he could allow for human weakness and he perfectly understood mr bradshaw i have a notion i know of a man who will just suit your purpose plenty of moneydoes not know what to do with it in facttired of yachting travelling wants something new i heard through some of the means of intelligence i employ that not very long ago he was wishing for a seat in parliament a liberal said mr bradshaw decidedly belongs to a family who were in the long parliament in their day mr bradshaw rubbed his hands dissenter asked he no no not so far as that but very lax church what is his name asked mr bradshaw eagerly excuse me until i am certain that he would like to come forward for eccleston i think i had better not mention his name the anonymous gentleman did like to come forward and his name proved to be donne he and mr bradshaw had been in correspondence during all the time of mr ralph cranworths illness and when he died everything was arranged ready for a start even before the cranworths had determined who should keep the seat warm till the eldest son came of age for the father was already member for the county mr donne was to come down to canvass in person and was to take up his abode at mr bradshaws and therefore it was that the seaside house within twenty miles distance of eccleston was found to be so convenient as an infirmary and nursery for those members of his family who were likely to be useless if not positive encumbrances during the forthcoming election chapter xxii the liberal candidate and his precursor jemima did not know whether she wished to go to abermouth or not she longed for change she wearied of the sights and sounds of home but yet she could not bear to leave the neighbourhood of mr farquhar especially as if she went to abermouth ruth would in all probability be left to take her holiday at home when mr bradshaw decided that she was to go ruth tried to feel glad that he gave her the means of repairing her fault towards elizabeth and she resolved to watch over the two girls most faithfully and carefully and to do all in her power to restore the invalid to health but a tremor came over her whenever she thought of leaving leonard she had never quitted him for a day and it seemed to her as if her brooding constant care was his natural and necessary shelter from all evilsfrom very death itself she would not go to sleep at nights in order to enjoy the blessed consciousness of having him near her when she was away from him teaching her pupils she kept trying to remember his face and print it deep on her heart against the time when days and days would elapse without her seeing that little darling countenance miss benson would wonder to her brother that mr bradshaw did not propose that leonard should accompany his mother he only begged her not to put such an idea into ruths head as he was sure mr bradshaw had no thoughts of doing any such thing yet to ruth it might be a hope and then a disappointment his sister scolded him for being so coldhearted but he was full of sympathy although he did not express it and made some quiet little sacrifices in order to set himself at liberty to take leonard a long walking expedition on the day when his mother left eccleston ruth cried until she could cry no longer and felt very much ashamed of herself as she saw the grave and wondering looks of her pupils whose only feeling on leaving home was delight at the idea of abermouth and into whose minds the possibility of death to any of their beloved ones never entered ruth dried her eyes and spoke cheerfully as soon as she caught the perplexed expression of their faces and by the time they arrived at abermouth she was as much delighted with all the new scenery as they were and found it hard work to resist their entreaties to go rambling out on the seashore at once but elizabeth had undergone more fatigue that day than she had had before for many weeks and ruth was determined to be prudent meanwhile the bradshaws house at eccleston was being rapidly adapted for electioneering hospitality the partitionwall between the unused drawingroom and the schoolroom was broken down in order to admit of folding doors the ingenious upholsterer of the town and what town does not boast of the upholsterer full of contrivances and resources in opposition to the upholsterer of steady capital and no imagination who looks down with uneasy contempt on ingenuity had come in to give his opinion that nothing could be easier than to convert a bathroom into a bedroom by the assistance of a little drapery to conceal the showerbath the string of which was to be carefully concealed for fear that the unconscious occupier of the bathbed might innocently take it for a bellrope the professional cook of the town had been already engaged to take up her abode for a month at mr bradshaws much to the indignation of betsy who became a vehement partisan of mr cranworth as soon as ever she heard of the plan of her deposition from sovereign authority in the kitchen in which she had reigned supreme for fourteen years mrs bradshaw sighed and bemoaned herself in all her leisure moments which were not many and wondered why their house was to be turned into an inn for this mr donne when everybody knew that the george was good enough for the cranworths who never thought of asking the electors to the halland they had lived at cranworth ever since julius caesars time and if that was not being an old family she did not know what was the excitement soothed jemima there was something to do it was she who planned with the upholsterer it was she who soothed betsy into angry silence it was she who persuaded her mother to lie down and rest while she herself went out to buy the heterogeneous things required to make the family and house presentable to mr donne and his precursorthe friend of the parliamentary agent this latter gentleman never appeared himself on the scene of action but pulled all the strings notwithstanding the friend was a mr hickson a lawyera briefless barrister some people called him but he himself professed a great disgust to the law as a great sham which involved an immensity of underhand action and truckling and timeserving and was perfectly encumbered by useless forms and ceremonies and dead obsolete words so instead of putting his shoulder to the wheel to reform the law he talked eloquently against it in such a highpriest style that it was occasionally a matter of surprise how he could ever have made a friend of the parliamentary agent before mentioned but as mr hickson himself said it was the very corruptness of the law which he was fighting against in doing all he could to effect the return of certain members to parliament these certain members being pledged to effect a reform in the law according to mr hickson and as he once observed confidentially if you had to destroy a hydraheaded monster would you measure swords with the demon as if he were a gentleman would you not rather seize the first weapon that came to hand and so do i my great object in life sir is to reform the law of england sir once get a majority of liberal members into the house and the thing is done and i consider myself justified for so highfor i may say so holyan end in using mens weaknesses to work out my purpose of course if men were angels or even immaculatemen invulnerable to bribes we would not bribe could you asked jemima for the conversation took place at mr bradshaws dinnertable where a few friends were gathered together to meet mr hickson and among them was mr benson we neither would nor could said the ardent barrister disregarding in his vehemence the point of the question and floating on over the bar of argument into the wide ocean of his own eloquence as it isas the world stands they who would succeed even in good deeds must come down to the level of expediency and therefore i say once more if mr donne is the man for your purpose and your purpose is a good one a lofty one a holy one for mr hickson remembered the dissenting character of his little audience and privately considered the introduction of the word holy a most happy hit then i say we must put all the squeamish scruples which might befit utopia or some such place on one side and treat men as they are if they are avaricious it is not we who have made them so but as we have to do with them we must consider their failings in dealing with them if they have been careless or extravagant or have had their little peccadillos we must administer the screw the glorious reform of the law will justify in my idea all means to obtain the endthat law from the profession of which i have withdrawn myself from perhaps a too scrupulous conscience he concluded softly to himself we are not to do evil that good may come said mr benson he was startled at the deep sound of his own voice as he uttered these words but he had not been speaking for some time and his voice came forth strong and unmodulated true sir most true said mr hickson bowing i honour you for the observation and he profited by it insomuch that he confined his further remarks on elections to the end of the table where he sat near mr bradshaw and one or two equally eager though not equally influential partisans of mr donnes meanwhile mr farquhar took up mr bensons quotation at the end where he and jemima sat near to mrs bradshaw and him but in the present state of the world as mr hickson says it is rather difficult to act upon that precept oh mr farquhar said jemima indignantly the tears springing to her eyes with a feeling of disappointment for she had been chafing under all that mr hickson had been saying perhaps the more for one or two attempts on his part at a flirtation with the daughter of his wealthy host which she resented with all the loathing of a preoccupied heart and she had longed to be a man to speak out her wrath at this paltering with right and wrong she had felt grateful to mr benson for his one clear short precept coming down with a divine force against which there was no appeal and now to have mr farquhar taking the side of expediency it was too bad nay jemima said mr farquhar touched and secretly flattered by the visible pain his speech had given dont be indignant with me till i have explained myself a little more i dont understand myself yet and it is a very intricate question or so it appears to me which i was going to put really earnestly and humbly for mr bensons opinion now mr benson may i ask if you always find it practicable to act strictly in accordance with that principle for if you do not i am sure no man living can are there not occasions when it is absolutely necessary to wade through evil to good i am not speaking in the careless presumptuous way of that man yonder said he lowering his voice and addressing himself to jemima more exclusively i am really anxious to hear what mr benson will say on the subject for i know no one to whose candid opinion i should attach more weight but mr benson was silent he did not see mrs bradshaw and jemima leave the room he was really as mr farquhar supposed him completely absent questioning himself as to how far his practice tallied with his principle by degrees he came to himself he found the conversation still turned on the election and mr hickson who felt that he had jarred against the little ministers principles and yet knew from the carte du pays which the scouts of the parliamentary agent had given him that mr benson was a person to be conciliated on account of his influence over many of the working people began to ask him questions with an air of deferring to superior knowledge that almost surprised mr bradshaw who had been accustomed to treat benson in a very different fashion of civil condescending indulgence just as one listens to a child who can have had no opportunities of knowing better at the end of a conversation that mr hickson held with mr benson on a subject in which the latter was really interested and on which he had expressed himself at some length the young barrister turned to mr bradshaw and said very audibly i wish donne had been here this conversation during the last halfhour would have interested him almost as much as it has done me mr bradshaw little guessed the truth that mr donne was at that very moment coaching up the various subjects of public interest in eccleston and privately cursing the particular subject on which mr benson had been holding forth as being an unintelligible piece of quixotism or the leading dissenter of the town need not have experienced a pang of jealousy at the possible future admiration his minister might excite in the possible future member for eccleston and if mr benson had been clairvoyant he need not have made an especial subject of gratitude out of the likelihood that he might have an opportunity of so far interesting mr donne in the condition of the people of eccleston as to induce him to set his face against any attempts at bribery mr benson thought of this half the night through and ended by determining to write a sermon on the christian view of political duties which might be good for all both electors and member to hear on the eve of an election for mr donne was expected at mr bradshaws before the next sunday and of course as mr and miss benson had settled it he would appear at the chapel with them on that day but the stinging conscience refused to be quieted no present plan of usefulness allayed the aching remembrance of the evil he had done that good might come not even the look of leonard as the early dawn fell on him and mr bensons sleepless eyes saw the rosy glow on his firm round cheeks his open mouth through which the soft longdrawn breath came gently quivering and his eyes not fully shut but closed to outward sightnot even the aspect of the quiet innocent child could soothe the troubled spirit leonard and his mother dreamt of each other that night her dream of him was one of undefined terrorterror so great that it wakened her up and she strove not to sleep again for fear that ominous ghastly dream should return he on the contrary dreamt of her sitting watching and smiling by his bedside as her gentle self had been many a morning and when she saw him awake so it fell out in the dream she smiled still more sweetly and bending down she kissed him and then spread out large soft whitefeathered wings which in no way surprised her childhe seemed to have known they were there all along and sailed away through the open window far into the blue sky of a summers day leonard wakened up then and remembered how far away she really wasfar more distant and inaccessible than the beautiful blue sky to which she had betaken herself in his dreamand cried himself to sleep again in spite of her absence from her child which made one great and abiding sorrow ruth enjoyed her seaside visit exceedingly in the first place there was the delight of seeing elizabeths daily and almost hourly improvement then at the doctors express orders there were so few lessons to be done that there was time for the long exploring rambles which all three delighted in and when the rain came and the storms blew the house with its wild seaviews was equally delightful it was a large house built on the summit of a rock which nearly overhung the shore below there were to be sure a series of zigzag tacking paths down the face of this rock but from the house they could not be seen old or delicate people would have considered the situation bleak and exposed indeed the present proprietor wanted to dispose of it on this very account but by its present inhabitants this exposure and bleakness were called by other names and considered as charms from every part of the rooms they saw the grey storms gather on the seahorizon and put themselves in marching array and soon the march became a sweep and the great dome of the heavens was covered with the lurid clouds between which and the vivid green earth below there seemed to come a purple atmosphere making the very threatening beautiful and byandby the house was wrapped in sheets of rain shutting out sky and sea and inland view till of a sudden the storm was gone by and the heavy raindrops glistened in the sun as they hung on leaf and grass and the little birds sang east and the little birds sang west and there was a pleasant sound of running waters all abroad oh if papa would but buy this house exclaimed elizabeth after one such storm which she had watched silently from the very beginning of the little cloud no bigger than a mans hand mamma would never like it i am afraid said mary she would call our delicious gushes of air draughts and think we should catch cold jemima would be on our side but how long mrs denbigh is i hope she was near enough the postoffice when the rain came on ruth had gone to the shop in the little village about halfamile distant where all letters were left till fetched she only expected one but that one was to tell her of leonard she however received two the unexpected one was from mr bradshaw and the news it contained was if possible a greater surprise than the letter itself mr bradshaw informed her that he planned arriving by dinnertime the following saturday at eagles crag and more that he intended bringing mr donne and one or two other gentlemen with him to spend the sunday there the letter went on to give every possible direction regarding the household preparations the dinnerhour was fixed to be at six but of course ruth and the girls would have dined long before the professional cook would arrive the day before laden with all the provisions that could not be obtained on the spot ruth was to engage a waiter from the inn and this it was that detained her so long while she sat in the little parlour awaiting the coming of the landlady she could not help wondering why mr bradshaw was bringing this strange gentleman to spend two days at abermouth and thus giving himself so much trouble and fuss of preparation there were so many small reasons that went to make up the large one which had convinced mr bradshaw of the desirableness of this step that it was not likely that ruth should guess at one half of them in the first place miss benson in the pride and fulness of her heart had told mrs bradshaw what her brother had told her how he meant to preach upon the christian view of the duties involved in political rights and as of course mrs bradshaw had told mr bradshaw he began to dislike the idea of attending chapel on that sunday at all for he had an uncomfortable idea that by the christian standardthat divine test of the true and purebribery would not be altogether approved of and yet he was tacitly coming round to the understanding that packets would be required for what purpose both he and mr donne were to be supposed to remain ignorant but it would be very awkward so near to the time if he were to be clearly convinced that bribery however disguised by names and words was in plain terms a sin and yet he knew mr benson had once or twice convinced him against his will of certain things which he had thenceforward found it impossible to do without such great uneasiness of mind that he had left off doing them which was sadly against his interest and if mr donne whom he had intended to take with him to chapel as fair dissenting prey should also become convinced why the cranworths would win the day and he should be the laughingstock of eccleston no in this one case bribery must be allowedwas allowable but it was a great pity human nature was so corrupt and if his member succeeded he would double his subscription to the schools in order that the next generation might be taught better there were various other reasons which strengthened mr bradshaw in the bright idea of going down to abermouth for the sunday some connected with the outofdoor politics and some with the domestic for instance it had been the plan of the house to have a cold dinner on the sundaysmr bradshaw had piqued himself on this strictnessand yet he had an instinctive feeling that mr donne was not quite the man to partake of cold meat for conscience sake with cheerful indifference to his fare mr donne had in fact taken the bradshaw household a little by surprise before he came mr bradshaw had pleased himself with thinking that more unlikely things had happened than the espousal of his daughter with the member of a small borough but this pretty airy bubble burst as soon as he saw mr donne and its very existence was forgotten in less than half an hour when he felt the quiet but incontestible difference of rank and standard that there was in every respect between his guest and his own family it was not through any circumstance so palpable and possibly accidental as the bringing down a servant whom mr donne seemed to consider as much a matter of course as a carpetbag though the smart gentlemans arrival fluttered the volscians in corioli considerably more than his gentlespoken masters it was nothing like this it was something indescribablea quiet being at ease and expecting every one else to be soan attention to women which was so habitual as to be unconsciously exercised to those subordinate persons in mr bradshaws familya happy choice of simple and expressive words some of which it must be confessed were slang but fashionable slang and that makes all the differencea measured graceful way of utterance with a style of pronunciation quite different to that of eccleston all these put together make but a part of the indescribable whole which unconsciously affected mr bradshaw and established mr donne in his estimation as a creature quite different to any he had seen before and as most unfit to mate with jemima mr hickson who had appeared as a model of gentlemanly ease before mr donnes arrival now became vulgar and coarse in mr bradshaws eyes and yet such was the charm of that languid highbred manner that mr bradshaw cottoned as he expressed it to mr farquhar to his new candidate at once he was only afraid lest mr donne was too indifferent to all things under the sun to care whether he gained or lost the election but he was reassured after the first conversation they had together on the subject mr donnes eye lightened with an eagerness that was almost fierce though his tones were as musical and nearly as slow as ever and when mr bradshaw alluded distantly to probable expenses and packets mr donne replied oh of course disagreeable necessity better speak as little about such things as possible other people can be found to arrange all the dirty work neither you nor i would like to soil our fingers by it i am sure four thousand pounds are in mr pilsons hands and i shall never inquire what becomes of them they may very probably be absorbed in the law expenses you know i shall let it be clearly understood from the hustings that i most decidedly disapprove of bribery and leave the rest to hicksons management he is accustomed to these sort of things i am not mr bradshaw was rather perplexed by this want of bustling energy on the part of the new candidate and if it had not been for the four thousand pounds aforesaid would have doubted whether mr donne cared sufficiently for the result of the election jemima thought differently she watched her fathers visitor attentively with something like the curious observation which a naturalist bestows on a new species of animal do you know what mr donne reminds me of mamma said she one day as the two sat at work while the gentlemen were absent canvassing no he is not like anybody i ever saw he quite frightens me by being so ready to open the door for me if i am going out of the room and by giving me a chair when i come in i never saw any one like him who is it jemima not any personnot any human being mamma said jemima half smiling do you remember our stopping at wakefield once on our way to scarborough and there were horseraces going on somewhere and some of the racers were in the stables at the inn where we dined yes i remember it but what about that why richard somehow knew one of the jockeys and as we were coming in from our ramble through the town this man or boy asked us to look at one of the racers he had the charge of well my dear well mamma mr donne is like that horse nonsense jemima you must not say so i dont know what your father would say if he heard you likening mr donne to a brute brutes are sometimes very beautiful mamma i am sure i should think it a compliment to be likened to a racehorse such as the one we saw but the thing in which they are alike is the sort of repressed eagerness in both eager why i should say there never was any one cooler than mr donne think of the trouble your papa has had this month past and then remember the slow way in which mr donne moves when he is going out to canvass and the low drawling voice in which he questions the people who bring him intelligence i can see your papa standing by ready to shake them to get out their news but mr donnes questions are always to the point and force out the grain without the chaff and look at him if any one tells him ill news about the election have you never seen a dull red light come into his eyes that is like my racehorse her flesh quivered all over at certain sounds and noises which had some meaning to her but she stood quite still pretty creature now mr donne is just as eager as she was though he may be too proud to show it though he seems so gentle i almost think he is very headstrong in following out his own will well dont call him like a horse again for i am sure papa would not like it do you know i thought you were going to say he was like little leonard when you asked me who he was like leonard oh mamma he is not in the least like leonard he is twenty times more like my racehorse now my dear jemima do be quiet your father thinks racing so wrong that i am sure he would be very seriously displeased if he were to hear you to return to mr bradshaw and to give one more of his various reasons for wishing to take mr donne to abermouth the wealthy eccleston manufacturer was uncomfortably impressed with an indefinable sense of inferiority to his visitor it was not in education for mr bradshaw was a welleducated man it was not in power for if he chose the present object of mr donnes life might be utterly defeated it did not arise from anything overbearing in manner for mr donne was habitually polite and courteous and was just now anxious to propitiate his host whom he looked upon as a very useful man whatever this sense of inferiority arose from mr bradshaw was anxious to relieve himself of it and imagined that if he could make more display of his wealth his object would be obtained now his house in eccleston was oldfashioned and illcalculated to exhibit moneys worth his mode of living though strained to a high pitch just at this time he became aware was no more than mr donne was accustomed to every day of his life the first day at dessert some remark some opportune remark as mr bradshaw in his innocence had thought was made regarding the price of pineapples which was rather exorbitant that year and mr donne asked mrs bradshaw with quiet surprise if they had no pinery as if to be without a pinery were indeed a depth of pitiable destitution in fact mr donne had been born and cradled in all that wealth could purchase and so had his ancestors before him for so many generations that refinement and luxury seemed the natural condition of man and they that dwelt without were in the position of monsters the absence was noticed but not the presence now mr bradshaw knew that the house and grounds of eagles crag were exorbitantly dear and yet he really thought of purchasing them and as one means of exhibiting his wealth and so raising himself up to the level of mr donne he thought that if he could take the latter down to abermouth and show him the place for which because his little girls had taken a fancy to it he was willing to give the fancyprice of fourteen thousand pounds he should at last make those halfshut dreamy eyes open wide and their owner confess that in wealth at least the eccleston manufacturer stood on a par with him all these mingled motives caused the determination which made ruth sit in the little innparlour at abermouth during the wild storms passage she wondered if she had fulfilled all mr bradshaws directions she looked at the letter yes everything was done and now home with her news through the wet lane where the little pools by the roadside reflected the deep blue sky and the round white clouds with even deeper blue and clearer white and the raindrops hung so thick on the trees that even a little birds flight was enough to shake them down in a bright shower as of rain when she told the news mary exclaimed oh how charming then we shall see this new member after all while elizabeth added yes i shall like to do that but where must we be papa will want the diningroom and this room and where must we sit oh said ruth in the dressingroom next to my room all that your papa wants always is that you are quiet and out of the way chapter xxiii recognition saturday came torn ragged clouds were driven across the sky it was not a becoming day for the scenery and the little girls regretted it much first they hoped for a change at twelve oclock and then at the afternoon tideturning but at neither time did the sun show his face papa will never buy this dear place said elizabeth sadly as she watched the weather the sun is everything to it the sea looks quite leaden today and there is no sparkle on it and the sands that were so yellow and sunspeckled on thursday are all one dull brown now never mind tomorrow may be better said ruth cheerily i wonder what time they will come at inquired mary your papa said they would be at the station at five oclock and the landlady at the swan said it would take them half an hour to get here and they are to dine at six asked elizabeth yes answered ruth and i think if we had our tea half an hour earlier at halfpast four and then went out for a walk we should be nicely out of the way just during the bustle of the arrival and dinner and we could be in the drawingroom ready against your papa came in after dinner oh that would be nice said they and tea was ordered accordingly the southwesterly wind had dropped and the clouds were stationary when they went out on the sands they dug little holes near the incoming tide and made canals to them from the water and blew the light seafoam against each other and then stole on tiptoe near to the groups of grey and white seagulls which despised their caution flying softly and slowly away to a little distance as soon as they drew near and in all this ruth was as great a child as any only she longed for leonard with a mothers longing as indeed she did every day and all hours of the day byandby the clouds thickened yet more and one or two drops of rain were felt it was very little but ruth feared a shower for her delicate elizabeth and besides the september evening was fast closing in the dark and sunless day as they turned homewards in the rapidly increasing dusk they saw three figures on the sand near the rocks coming in their direction papa and mr donne exclaimed mary now we shall see him which do you make out is him asked elizabeth oh the tall one to be sure dont you see how papa always turns to him as if he was speaking to him and not to the other who is the other asked elizabeth mr bradshaw said that mr farquhar and mr hickson would come with him but that is not mr farquhar i am sure said ruth the girls looked at each other as they always did when ruth mentioned mr farquhars name but she was perfectly unconscious both of the look and of the conjectures which gave rise to it as soon as the two parties drew near mr bradshaw called out in his strong voice well my dears we found there was an hour before dinner so we came down upon the sands and here you are the tone of his voice assured them that he was in a bland and indulgent mood and the two little girls ran towards him he kissed them and shook hands with ruth told his companions that these were the little girls who were tempting him to this extravagance of purchasing eagles crag and then rather doubtfully and because he saw that mr donne expected it he introduced my daughters governess mrs denbigh it was growing darker every moment and it was time they should hasten back to the rocks which were even now indistinct in the grey haze mr bradshaw held a hand of each of his daughters and ruth walked alongside the two strange gentlemen being on the outskirts of the party mr bradshaw began to give his little girls some home news he told them that mr farquhar was ill and could not accompany them but jemima and their mamma were quite well the gentleman nearest to ruth spoke to her are you fond of the sea asked he there was no answer so he repeated his question in a different form do you enjoy staying by the seaside i should rather ask the reply was yes rather breathed out in a deep inspiration than spoken in a sound the sands heaved and trembled beneath ruth the figures near her vanished into strange nothingness the sounds of their voices were as distant sounds in a dream while the echo of one voice thrilled through and through she could have caught at his arm for support in the awful dizziness which wrapped her up body and soul that voice no if name and face and figure were all changed that voice was the same which had touched her girlish heart which had spoken most tender words of love which had won and wrecked her and which she had last heard in the low mutterings of fever she dared not look round to see the figure of him who spoke dark as it was she knew he was thereshe heard him speak in the manner in which he used to address strangers years ago perhaps she answered him perhaps she did notgod knew it seemed as if weights were tied to her feetas if the steadfast rocks recededas if time stood stillit was so long so terrible that path across the reeling sand at the foot of the rocks they separated mr bradshaw afraid lest dinner should cool preferred the shorter way for himself and his friends on elizabeths account the girls were to take the longer and easier path which wound upwards through a rocky field where larks nests abounded and where wild thyme and heather were now throwing out their sweets to the soft night air the little girls spoke in eager discussion of the strangers they appealed to ruth but ruth did not answer and they were too impatient to convince each other to repeat the question the first little ascent from the sands to the field surmounted ruth sat down suddenly and covered her face with her hands this was so unusualtheir wishes their good was so invariably the rule of motion or of rest in their walksthat the girls suddenly checked stood silent and affrighted in surprise they were still more startled when ruth wailed aloud some inarticulate words are you not well dear mrs denbigh asked elizabeth gently kneeling down on the grass by ruth she sat facing the west the low watery twilight was on her face as she took her hands away so pale so haggard so wild and wandering a look the girls had never seen on human countenance before well what are you doing here with me you should not be with me said she shaking her head slowly they looked at each other you are sadly tired said elizabeth soothingly come home and let me help you to bed i will tell papa you are ill and ask him to send for a doctor ruth looked at her as if she did not understand the meaning of her words no more she did at first but byandby the dulled brain began to think most vividly and rapidly and she spoke in a sharp way which deceived the girls into a belief that nothing had been the matter yes i was tired i am tired those sandsoh those sands those weary dreadful sands but that is all over now only my heart aches still feel how it flutters and beats said she taking elizabeths hand and holding it to her side i am quite well though she continued reading pity in the childs looks as she felt the trembling quivering beat we will go straight to the dressingroom and read a chapter that will still my heart and then ill go to bed and mr bradshaw will excuse me i know this one night i only ask for one night put on your right frocks dears and do all you ought to do but i know you will said she bending down to kiss elizabeth and then before she had done so raising her head abruptly you are good and dear girlsgod keep you so by a strong effort at selfcommand she went onwards at an even pace neither rushing nor pausing to sob and think the very regularity of motion calmed her the front and back doors of the house were on two sides at right angles with each other they all shrunk a little from the idea of going in at the front door now that the strange gentlemen were about and accordingly they went through the quiet farmyard right into the bright ruddy kitchen where the servants were dashing about with the dinner things it was a contrast in more than colour to the lonely dusky field which even the little girls perceived and the noise the warmth the very bustle of the servants were a positive relief to ruth and for the time lifted off the heavy press of pentup passion a silent house with moonlit rooms or with a faint gloom brooding over the apartments would have been more to be dreaded then she must have given way and cried out as it was she went up the old awkward back stairs and into the room they were to sit in there was no candle mary volunteered to go down for one and when she returned she was full of the wonders of preparation in the drawingroom and ready and eager to dress so as to take her place there before the gentlemen had finished dinner but she was struck by the strange paleness of ruths face now that the light fell upon it stay up here dear mrs denbigh well tell papa you are tired and are gone to bed another time ruth would have dreaded mr bradshaws displeasure for it was an understood thing that no one was to be ill or tired in his household without leave asked and cause given and assigned but she never thought of that now her great desire was to hold quiet till she was alone quietness it was notit was rigidity but she succeeded in being rigid in look and movement and went through her duties to elizabeth who preferred remaining with her upstairs with wooden precision but her heart felt at times like ice at times like burning fire always a heavy heavy weight within her at last elizabeth went to bed still ruth dared not think mary would come upstairs soon and with a strange sick shrinking yearning ruth awaited herand the crumbs of intelligence she might drop out about him ruths sense of hearing was quickened to miserable intensity as she stood before the chimneypiece grasping it tight with both handsgazing into the dying fire but seeingnot the dead grey embers or the little sparks of vivid light that ran hither and thither among the woodashesbut an old farmhouse and climbing winding road and a little golden breezy common with a rural inn on the hilltop far far away and through the thoughts of the past came the sharp sounds of the presentof three voices one of which was almost silence it was so hushed indifferent people would only have guessed that mr donne was speaking by the quietness in which the others listened but ruth heard the voice and many of the words though they conveyed no idea to her mind she was too much stunned even to feel curious to know to what they related he spoke that was her one fact presently up came mary bounding exultant papa had let her stay up one quarter of an hour longer because mr hickson had asked mr hickson was so clever she did not know what to make of mr donne he seemed such a dawdle but he was very handsome had ruth seen him oh no she could not it was so dark on those stupid sands well never mind she would see him tomorrow she must be well tomorrow papa seemed a good deal put out that neither she nor elizabeth were in the drawingroom tonight and his last words were tell mrs denbigh i hope and papas hopes always meant expect she will be able to make breakfast at nine oclock and then she would see mr donne that was all ruth heard about him she went with mary into her bedroom helped her to undress and put the candle out at length she was alone in her own room at length but the tension did not give way immediately she fastened her door and threw open the window cold and threatening as was the night she tore off her gown she put her hair back from her heated face it seemed now as if she could not thinkas if thought and emotion had been repressed so sternly that they would not come to relieve her stupified brain till all at once like a flash of lightning her life past and present was revealed to her in its minutest detail and when she saw her very present now the strange confusion of agony was too great to be borne and she cried aloud then she was quite dead and listened as to the sound of galloping armies if i might see him if i might see him if i might just ask him why he left me if i had vexed him in any way it was so strangeso cruel it was not him it was his mother said she almost fiercely as if answering herself oh god but he might have found me out before this she continued sadly he did not care for me as i did for him he did not care for me at all she went on wildly and sharply he did me cruel harm i can never again lift up my face in innocence they think i have forgotten all because i do not speak oh darling love am i talking against you asked she tenderly i am so torn and perplexed you who are the father of my child but that very circumstance full of such tender meaning in many cases threw a new light into her mind it changed her from the woman into the motherthe stern guardian of her child she was still for a time thinking then she began again but in a low deep voice he left me he might have been hurried off but he might have inquiredhe might have learnt and explained he left me to bear the burden and the shame and never cared to learn as he might have done of leonards birth he has no love for his child and i will have no love for him she raised her voice while uttering this determination and then feeling her own weakness she moaned out alas alas and then she started up for all this time she had been rocking herself backwards and forwards as she sat on the ground and began to pace the room with hurried steps what am i thinking of where am i i who have been praying these years and years to be worthy to be leonards mother my god what a depth of sin is in my heart why the old time would be as white as snow to what it would be now if i sought him out and prayed for the explanation which should reestablish him in my heart i who have striven or made a mock of trying to learn gods holy will in order to bring up leonard into the full strength of a christiani who have taught his sweet innocent lips to pray lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil and yet somehow ive been longing to give him to his father who iswho is she almost choked till at last she cried sharp out oh my god i do believe leonards father is a bad man and yet oh pitiful god i love him i cannot forgeti cannot she threw her body half out of the window into the cold night air the wind was rising and came in great gusts the rain beat down on her it did her good a still calm night would not have soothed her as this did the wild tattered clouds hurrying past the moon gave her a foolish kind of pleasure that almost made her smile a vacant smile the blastdriven rain came on her again and drenched her hair through and through the words stormy wind fulfilling his word came into her mind she sat down on the floor this time her hands were clasped round her knees the uneasy rocking motion was stilled i wonder if my darling is frightened with this blustering noisy wind i wonder if he is awake and then her thoughts went back to the various times of old when affrighted by the weathersounds so mysterious in the nighthe had crept into her bed and clung to her and she had soothed him and sweetly awed him into stillness and childlike faith by telling him of the goodness and power of god of a sudden she crept to a chair and there knelt as in the very presence of god hiding her face at first not speaking a word for did he not know her heart but byandby moaning out amid her sobs and tears and now for the first time she wept oh my god help me for i am very weak my god i pray thee be my rock and my strong fortress for i of myself am nothing if i ask in his name thou wilt give it me in the name of jesus christ i pray for strength to do thy will she could not think or indeed remember anything but that she was weak and god was strong and a very present help in time of trouble and the wind rose yet higher and the house shook and vibrated as in measured time the great and terrible gusts came from the four quarters of the heavens and blew around it dying away in the distance with loud and unearthly wails which were not utterly still before the sound of the coming blast was heard like the trumpets of the vanguard of the prince of air there was a knock at the bedroom doora little gentle knock and a soft childs voice mrs denbigh may i come in please i am so frightened it was elizabeth ruth calmed her passionate breathing by one hasty draught of water and opened the door to the timid girl oh mrs denbigh did you ever hear such a night i am so frightened and mary sleeps so sound ruth was too much shaken to be able to speak all at once but she took elizabeth in her arms to reassure her elizabeth stood back why how wet you are mrs denbigh and theres the window open i do believe oh how cold it is said she shivering get into my bed dear said ruth but do come too the candle gives such a strange light with that long wick and somehow your face does not look like you please put the candle out and come to bed i am so frightened and it seems as if i should be safer if you were by me ruth shut the window and went to bed elizabeth was all shivering and quaking to soothe her ruth made a great effort and spoke of leonard and his fears and in a low hesitating voice she spoke of gods tender mercy but very humbly for she feared lest elizabeth should think her better and holier than she was the little girl was soon asleep her fears forgotten and ruth worn out by passionate emotion and obliged to be still for fear of awaking her bedfellow went off into a short slumber through the depths of which the echoes of her waking sobs quivered up when she awoke the grey light of autumnal dawn was in the room elizabeth slept on but ruth heard the servants about and the early farmyard sounds after she had recovered from the shock of consciousness and recollection she collected her thoughts with a stern calmness he was here in a few hours she must meet him there was no escape except through subterfuges and contrivances that were both false and cowardly how it would all turn out she could not say or even guess but of one thing she was clear and to one thing she would hold fast that was that come what might she would obey gods law and be the end of all what it might she would say thy will be done she only asked for strength enough to do this when the time came how the time would comewhat speech or action would be requisite on her part she did not knowshe did not even try to conjecture she left that in his hands she was icy cold but very calm when the breakfastbell rang she went down immediately because she felt that there was less chance of a recognition if she were already at her place beside the teaurn and busied with the cups than if she came in after all were settled her heart seemed to stand still but she felt almost a strange exultant sense of power over herself she felt rather than saw that he was not there mr bradshaw and mr hickson were and so busy talking electionpolitics that they did not interrupt their conversation even when they bowed to her her pupils sat one on each side of her before they were quite settled and while the other two gentlemen yet hung over the fire mr donne came in ruth felt as if that moment was like death she had a kind of desire to make some sharp sound to relieve a choking sensation but it was over in an instant and she sat on very composed and silentto all outward appearance the very model of a governess who knew her place and byandby she felt strangely at ease in her sense of power she could even listen to what was being said she had never dared as yet to look at mr donne though her heart burnt to see him once again he sounded changed the voice had lost its fresh and youthful eagerness of tone though in peculiarity of modulation it was the same it could never be mistaken for the voice of another person there was a good deal said at that breakfast for none seemed inclined to hurry although it was sunday morning ruth was compelled to sit there and it was good for her that she did that halfhour seemed to separate the present mr donne very effectively from her imagination of what mr bellingham had been she was no analyser she hardly even had learnt to notice character but she felt there was some strange difference between the people she had lived with lately and the man who now leant back in his chair listening in a careless manner to the conversation but never joining in or expressing any interest in it unless it somewhere or somehow touched himself now mr bradshaw always threw himself into a subject it might be in a pompous dogmatic sort of way but he did do it whether it related to himself or not and it was part of mr hicksons trade to assume an interest if he felt it not but mr donne did neither the one nor the other when the other two were talking of many of the topics of the day he put his glass in his eye the better to examine into the exact nature of a cold gamepie at the other side of the table suddenly ruth felt that his attention was caught by her until now seeing his shortsightedness she had believed herself safe now her face flushed with a painful miserable blush but in an instant she was strong and quiet she looked up straight at his face and as if this action took him aback he dropped his glass and began eating away with great diligence she had seen him he was changed she knew not how in fact the expression which had been only occasional formerly when his worse self predominated had become permanent he looked restless and dissatisfied but he was very handsome still and her quick eye had recognised with a sort of strange pride that the eyes and mouth were like leonards although perplexed by the straightforward brave look she had sent right at him he was not entirely baffled he thought this mrs denbigh was certainly like poor ruth but this woman was far handsomer her face was positively greek and then such a proud superb turn of her head quite queenly a governess in mr bradshaws family why she might be a percy or a howard for the grandeur of her grace poor ruth this womans hair was darker though and she had less colour altogether a more refinedlooking person poor ruth and for the first time for several years he wondered what had become of her though of course there was but one thing that could have happened and perhaps it was as well he did not know her end for most likely it would have made him very uncomfortable he leant back in his chair and unobserved for he would not have thought it gentlemanly to look so fixedly at her if she or any one noticed him he put up his glass again she was speaking to one of her pupils and did not see him by jove it must be she though there were little dimples came out about the mouth as she spoke just like those he used to admire so much in ruth and which he had never seen in any one elsethe sunshine without the positive movement of a smile the longer he looked the more he was convinced and it was with a jerk that he recovered himself enough to answer mr bradshaws question whether he wished to go to church or not church how fara mile no i think i shall perform my devotions at home today he absolutely felt jealous when mr hickson sprang up to open the door as ruth and her pupils left the room he was pleased to feel jealous again he had been really afraid he was too much usedup for such sensations but hickson must keep his place what he was paid for was doing the talking to the electors not paying attention to the ladies in their families mr donne had noticed that mr hickson had tried to be gallant to miss bradshaw let him if he liked but let him beware how he behaved to this fair creature ruth or no ruth it certainly was ruth only how the devil had she played her cards so well as to be the governessthe respected governess in such a family as mr bradshaws mr donnes movements were evidently to be the guide of mr hicksons mr bradshaw always disliked going to church partly from principle partly because he never could find the places in the prayerbook mr donne was in the drawingroom as mary came down ready equipped he was turning over the leaves of the large and handsome bible seeing mary he was struck with a new idea how singular it is said he that the name of ruth is so seldom chosen by those good people who go to the bible before they christen their children it is a pretty name i think mr bradshaw looked up why mary said he is not that mrs denbighs name yes papa replied mary eagerly and i know two other ruths theres ruth brown here and ruth macartney at eccleston and i have an aunt called ruth mr donne i dont think your observation holds good besides my daughters governess i know three other ruths oh i have no doubt i was wrong it was just a speech of which one perceives the folly the moment it is made but secretly he rejoiced with a fierce joy over the success of his device elizabeth came to summon mary ruth was glad when she got into the open air and away from the house two hours were gone and over two out of a day a day and a halffor it might be late on monday morning before the eccleston party returned she felt weak and trembling in body but strong in power over herself they had left the house in good time for church so they needed not to hurry and they went leisurely along the road now and then passing some country person whom they knew and with whom they exchanged a kindly placid greeting but presently to ruths dismay she heard a step behind coming at a rapid pace a peculiar clank of rather highheeled boots which gave a springy sound to the walk that she had known well long ago it was like a nightmare where the evil dreaded is never avoided never completely shunned but is by ones side at the very moment of triumph in escape there he was by her side and there was a quarter of a mile intervening between her and the church but even yet she trusted that he had not recognised her i have changed my mind you see said he quietly i have some curiosity to see the architecture of the church some of these old country churches have singular bits about them mr bradshaw kindly directed me part of the way but i was so much puzzled by turns to the right and turns to the left that i was quite glad to espy your party that speech required no positive answer of any kind and no answer did it receive he had not expected a reply he knew if she were ruth she could not answer any indifferent words of his and her silence made him more certain of her identity with the lady by his side the scenery here is of a kind new to me neither grand wild nor yet marked by high cultivation and yet it has great charms it reminds me of some parts of wales he breathed deeply and then added you have been in wales i believe he spoke low almost in a whisper the little churchbell began to call the lagging people with its quick sharp summons ruth writhed in body and spirit but struggled on the churchdoor would be gained at last and in that holy place she would find peace he repeated in a louder tone so as to compel an answer in order to conceal her agitation from the girls have you never been in wales he used never instead of ever and laid the emphasis on that word in order to mark his meaning to ruth and ruth only but he drove her to bay i have been in wales sir she replied in a calm grave tone i was there many years ago events took place there which contribute to make the recollection of that time most miserable to me i shall be obliged to you sir if you will make no further reference to it the little girls wondered how mrs denbigh could speak in such a tone of quiet authority to mr donne who was almost a member of parliament but they settled that her husband must have died in wales and of course that would make the recollection of the country most miserable as she said mr donne did not dislike the answer and he positively admired the dignity with which she spoke his leaving her as he did must have made her very miserable and he liked the pride that made her retain her indignation until he could speak to her in private and explain away a good deal of what she might complain of with some justice the church was reached they all went up the middle aisle into the eagles crag pew he followed them in entered himself and shut the door ruths heart sank as she saw him there just opposite to her coming between her and the clergyman who was to read out the word of god it was mercilessit was cruel to haunt her there she durst not lift her eyes to the bright eastern lightshe could not see how peacefully the marble images of the dead lay on their tombs for he was between her and all light and peace she knew that his look was on her that he never turned his glance away she could not join in the prayer for the remission of sins while he was there for his very presence seemed as a sign that their stain would never be washed out of her life but although goaded and chafed by her thoughts and recollections she kept very still no sign of emotion no flush of colour was on her face as he looked at her elizabeth could not find her place and then ruth breathed once long and deeply as she moved up the pew and out of the straight burning glance of those eyes of evil meaning when they sat down for the reading of the first lesson ruth turned the corner of the seat so as no longer to be opposite to him she could not listen the words seemed to be uttered in some world far away from which she was exiled and cast out their sound and yet more their meaning was dim and distant but in this extreme tension of mind to hold in her bewildered agony it so happened that one of her senses was preternaturally acute while all the church and the people swam in misty haze one point in a dark corner grew clearer and clearer till she saw what at another time she could not have discerned at all a facea gargoyle i think they call itat the end of the arch next to the narrowing of the nave into the chancel and in the shadow of that contraction the face was beautiful in feature the next to it was a grinning monkey but it was not the features that were the most striking part there was a halfopen mouth not in any way distorted out of its exquisite beauty by the intense expression of suffering it conveyed any distortion of the face by mental agony implies that a struggle with circumstance is going on but in this face if such struggle had been it was over now circumstance had conquered and there was no hope from mortal endeavour or help from mortal creature to be had but the eyes looked onward and upward to the hills from whence cometh our help and though the parted lips seemed ready to quiver with agony yet the expression of the whole face owing to these strange stony and yet spiritual eyes was high and consoling if mortal gaze had never sought its meaning before in the deep shadow where it had been placed long centuries ago yet ruths did now who could have imagined such a look who could have witnessedperhaps feltsuch infinite sorrow and yet dared to lift it up by faith into a peace so pure or was it a mere conception if so what a soul the unknown carver must have had for creator and handicraftsman must have been one no two minds could have been in such perfect harmony whatever it washowever it came thereimaginer carver sufferer all were long passed away human art was endedhuman life donehuman suffering over but this remained it stilled ruths beating heart to look on it she grew still enough to hear words which have come to many in their time of need and awed them in the presence of the extremest suffering that the hushed world has ever heard of the second lesson for the morning of the th of september is the th chapter of st matthews gospel and when they prayed again ruths tongue was unloosed and she also could pray in his name who underwent the agony in the garden as they came out of church there was a little pause and gathering at the door it had begun to rain those who had umbrellas were putting them up those who had not were regretting and wondering how long it would last standing for a moment impeded by the people who were thus collected under the porch ruth heard a voice close to her say very low but very distinctly i have much to say to youmuch to explain i entreat you to give me the opportunity ruth did not reply she would not acknowledge that she heard but she trembled nevertheless for the wellremembered voice was low and soft and had yet its power to thrill she earnestly desired to know why and how he had left her it appeared to her as if that knowledge could alone give her a relief from the restless wondering that distracted her mind and that one explanation could do no harm no the higher spirit made answer it must not be ruth and the girls had each an umbrella she turned to mary and said mary give your umbrella to mr donne and come under mine her way of speaking was short and decided she was compressing her meaning into as few words as possible the little girl obeyed in silence as they went first through the churchyard stile mr donne spoke again you are unforgiving said he i only ask you to hear me i have a right to be heard ruth i wont believe you are so much changed as not to listen to me when i entreat he spoke in a tone of soft complaint but he himself had done much to destroy the illusion which had hung about his memory for years whenever ruth had allowed herself to think of it besides which during the time of her residence in the benson family her feeling of what people ought to be had been unconsciously raised and refined and mr donne even while she had to struggle against the force of past recollections repelled her so much by what he was at present that every speech of his every minute they were together served to make her path more and more easy to follow his voice retained something of its former influence when he spoke without her seeing him she could not help remembering former days she did not answer this last speech any more than the first she saw clearly that putting aside all thought as to the character of their former relationship it had been dissolved by his willhis act and deed and that therefore the power to refuse any further intercourse whatsoever remained with her it sometimes seems a little strange how after having earnestly prayed to be delivered from temptation and having given ourselves with shut eyes into gods hand from that time every thought every outward influence every acknowledged law of life seems to lead us on from strength to strength it seems strange sometimes because we notice the coincidence but it is the natural unavoidable consequence of all truth and goodness being one and the same and therefore carried out in every circumstance external and internal of gods creation when mr donne saw that ruth would not answer him he became only the more determined that she should hear what he had to say what that was he did not exactly know the whole affair was most mysterious and piquant the umbrella protected ruth from more than the rain on that walk homewards for under its shelter she could not be spoken to unheard she had not rightly understood at what time she and the girls were to dine from the gathering at mealtimes she must not shrink she must show no sign of weakness but oh the relief after that walk to sit in her own room locked up so that neither mary nor elizabeth could come by surprise and to let her weary frame weary with being so long braced up to rigidity and stiff quiet fall into a chair anyhowall helpless nerveless motionless as if the very bones had melted out of her the peaceful rest which her mind took was in thinking of leonard she dared not look before or behind but she could see him well at present she brooded over the thought of him till she dreaded his father more and more by the light of her childs purity and innocence she saw evil clearly and yet more clearly she thought that if leonard ever came to know the nature of his birth she had nothing for it but to die out of his sight he could never knowhuman heart could never know her ignorant innocence and all the small circumstances which had impelled her onwards but god knew and if leonard heard of his mothers error why nothing remained but death for she felt then as if she had it in her power to die innocently out of such future agony but that escape is not so easy suddenly a fresh thought came and she prayed that through whatever suffering she might be purified whatever trials woes measureless pangs god might see fit to chastise her with she would not shrink if only at last she might come into his presence in heaven alas the shrinking from suffering we cannot help that part of her prayer was vain and as for the rest was not the sure justice of his law finding her out even now his laws once broken his justice and the very nature of those laws bring the immutable retribution but if we turn penitently to him he enables us to bear our punishment with a meek and docile heart for his mercy endureth for ever mr bradshaw had felt himself rather wanting in proper attention to his guest inasmuch as he had been unable all in a minute to comprehend mr donnes rapid change of purpose and before it had entered into his mind that notwithstanding the distance of the church mr donne was going thither that gentleman was out of the sight and far out of the reach of his burly host but though the latter had so far neglected the duties of hospitality as to allow his visitor to sit in the eagles crag pew with no other guard of honour than the children and the governess mr bradshaw determined to make up for it by extra attention during the remainder of the day accordingly he never left mr donne whatever wish that gentleman expressed it was the study of his host to gratify did he hint at the pleasure which a walk in such beautiful scenery would give him mr bradshaw was willing to accompany him although at eccleston it was a principle with him not to take any walks for pleasure on a sunday when mr donne turned round and recollected letters which must be written and which would compel him to stay at home mr bradshaw instantly gave up the walk and remained at hand ready to furnish him with any writingmaterials which could be wanted and which were not laid out in the halffurnished house nobody knew where mr hickson was all this time he had sauntered out after mr donne when the latter set off for church and he had never returned mr donne kept wondering if he could have met ruthif in fact she had gone out with her pupils now that the afternoon had cleared up this uneasy wonder and a few mental imprecations on his hosts polite attention together with the letterwriting pretence passed away the afternoonthe longest afternoon he had ever spent and of weariness he had had his share lunch was lingering in the diningroom left there for the truant mr hickson but of the children or ruth there was no sign he ventured on a distant inquiry as to their whereabouts they dine early they are gone to church again mrs denbigh was a member of the establishment once and though she attends chapel at home she seems glad to have an opportunity of going to church mr donne was on the point of asking some further questions about mrs denbigh when mr hickson came in loudspoken cheerful hungry and as ready to talk about his ramble and the way in which he had lost and found himself as he was about everything else he knew how to dress up the commonest occurrence with a little exaggeration a few puns and a happy quotation or two so as to make it sound very agreeable he could read faces and saw that he had been missed both host and visitor looked moped to death he determined to devote himself to their amusement during the remainder of the day for he had really lost himself and felt that he had been away too long on a dull sunday when people were apt to get hypped if not well amused it is really a shame to be indoors in such a place rain yes it rained some hours ago but now it is splendid weather i feel myself quite qualified for guide i assure you i can show you all the beauties of the neighbourhood and throw in a bog and a nest of vipers to boot mr donne languidly assented to this proposal of going out and then he became restless until mr hickson had eaten a hasty lunch for he hoped to meet ruth on the way from church to be near her and watch her though he might not be able to speak to her to have the slow hours roll awayto know he must leave the next dayand yet so close to her not to be seeing herwas more than he could bear in an impetuous kind of way he disregarded all mr hicksons offers of guidance to lovely views and turned a deaf ear to mr bradshaws expressed wish of showing him the land belonging to the house very little for fourteen thousand pounds and set off wilfully on the road leading to the church from which he averred he had seen a view which nothing else about the place could equal they met the country people dropping homewards no ruth was there she and her pupils had returned by the fieldway as mr bradshaw informed his guests at dinnertime mr donne was very captious all through dinner he thought it would never be over and cursed hicksons interminable stories which were told on purpose to amuse him his heart gave a fierce bound when he saw her in the drawingroom with the little girls she was reading to themwith how sick and trembling a heart no words can tell but she could master and keep down outward signs of her emotion an hour more tonight part of which was to be spent in family prayer and all in the safety of company another hour in the morning when all would be engaged in the bustle of departureif during this short space of time she could not avoid speaking to him she could at least keep him at such a distance as to make him feel that henceforward her world and his belonged to separate systems wide as the heavens apart by degrees she felt that he was drawing near to where she stood he was by the table examining the books that lay upon it mary and elizabeth drew off a little space awestricken by the future member for eccleston as he bent his head over a book he said i implore you five minutes alone the little girls could not hear but ruth hemmed in so that no escape was possible did hear she took sudden courage and said in a clear voice will you read the whole passage aloud i do not remember it mr hickson hovering at no great distance heard these words and drew near to second mrs denbighs request mr bradshaw who was very sleepy after his unusually late dinner and longing for bedtime joined in the request for it would save the necessity for making talk and he might perhaps get in a nap undisturbed and unnoticed before the servants came in to prayers mr donne was caught he was obliged to read aloud although he did not know what he was reading in the middle of some sentence the door opened a rush of servants came in and mr bradshaw became particularly wide awake in an instant and read them a long sermon with great emphasis and unction winding up with a prayer almost as long ruth sat with her head drooping more from exhaustion after a season of effort than because she shunned mr donnes looks he had so lost his power over herhis power which had stirred her so deeply the night beforethat except as one knowing her error and her shame and making a cruel use of such knowledge she had quite separated him from the idol of her youth and yet for the sake of that first and only love she would gladly have known what explanation he could offer to account for leaving her it would have been something gained to her own selfrespect if she had learnt that he was not then as she felt him to be now cold and egotistical caring for no one and nothing but what related to himself home and leonardhow strangely peaceful the two seemed oh for the rest that a dream about leonard would bring mary and elizabeth went to bed immediately after prayers and ruth accompanied them it was planned that the gentlemen should leave early the next morning they were to breakfast half an hour sooner to catch the railway train and this by mr donnes own arrangement who had been as eager about his canvassing the week before as it was possible for him to be but who now wished eccleston and the dissenting interest therein very fervently at the devil just as the carriage came round mr bradshaw turned to ruth any message for leonard beyond love which is a matter of course ruth gaspedfor she saw mr donne catch at the name she did not guess the sudden sharp jealousy called out by the idea that leonard was a grownup man who is leonard said he to the little girl standing by him he did not know which she was mrs denbighs little boy answered mary under some pretence or other he drew near to ruth and in that low voice which she had learnt to loathe he said our child by the white misery that turned her face to stoneby the wild terror in her imploring eyesby the gasping breath which came out as the carriage drove awayhe knew that he had seized the spell to make her listen at last chapter xxiv the meeting on the sands he will take him away from me he will take the child from me these words rang like a tolling bell through ruths head it seemed to her that her doom was certain leonard would be taken from her she had a firm convictionnot the less firm because she knew not on what it was basedthat a child whether legitimate or not belonged of legal right to the father and leonard of all children was the prince and monarch every mans heart would long to call leonard child she had been too strongly taxed to have much power left her to reason coolly and dispassionately just then even if she had been with any one who could furnish her with information from which to draw correct conclusions the one thought haunted her night and dayhe will take my child away from me in her dreams she saw leonard borne away into some dim land to which she could not follow sometimes he sat in a swiftlymoving carriage at his fathers side and smiled on her as he passed by as if going to promised pleasure at another time he was struggling to return to her stretching out his little arms and crying to her for the help she could not give how she got through the days she did not know her body moved about and habitually acted but her spirit was with her child she thought often of writing and warning mr benson of leonards danger but then she shrank from recurring to circumstances all mention of which had ceased years ago the very recollection of which seemed buried deep for ever besides she feared occasioning discord or commotion in the quiet circle in which she lived mr bensons deep anger against her betrayer had been shown too clearly in the old time to allow her to think that he would keep it down without expression now he would cease to do anything to forward his election he would oppose him as much as he could and mr bradshaw would be angry and a storm would arise from the bare thought of which ruth shrank with the cowardliness of a person thoroughly worn out with late contest she was bodily wearied with her spiritual buffeting one morning three or four days after their departure she received a letter from miss benson she could not open it at first and put it on one side clenching her hand over it all the time at last she tore it open leonard was safe as yet there were a few lines in his great round hand speaking of events no larger than the loss of a beautiful alley there was a sheet from miss benson she always wrote letters in the manner of a diary monday we did soandso tuesday soandso c ruth glanced rapidly down the page yes here it was sick fluttering heart be still in the middle of the damsons when they were just on the fire there was a knock at the door my brother was out and sally was washing up and i was stirring the preserve with my great apron and bib on so i bade leonard come in from the garden and open the door but i would have washed his face first if i had known who it was it was mr bradshaw and the mr donne that they hope to send up to the house of commons as member of parliament for eccleston and another gentleman whose name i never heard they had come canvassing and when they found my brother was out they asked leonard if they could see me the child said yes if i could leave the damsons and straightway came to call me leaving them standing in the passage i whipped off my apron and took leonard by the hand for i fancied i should feel less awkward if he was with me and then i went and asked them all into the study for i thought i should like them to see how many books thurstan had got then they began talking politics at me in a very polite manner only i could not make head or tail of what they meant and mr donne took a deal of notice of leonard and called him to him and i am sure he noticed what a noble handsome boy he was though his face was very brown and red and hot with digging and his curls all tangled leonard talked back as if he had known him all his life till i think mr bradshaw thought he was making too much noise and bid him remember he ought to be seen not heard so he stood as still and stiff as a soldier close to mr donne and as i could not help looking at the two and thinking how handsome they both were in their different ways i could not tell thurstan half the messages the gentlemen left for him but there was one thing more i must tell you though i said i would not when mr donne was talking to leonard he took off his watch and chain and put it round the boys neck who was pleased enough you may be sure i bade him give it back to the gentleman when they were all going away and i was quite surprised and very uncomfortable when mr donne said he had given it to leonard and that he was to keep it for his own i could see mr bradshaw was annoyed and he and the other gentleman spoke to mr donne and i heard them say too barefaced and i shall never forget mr donnes proud stubborn look back at them nor his way of saying i allow no one to interfere with what i choose to do with my own and he looked so haughty and displeased i durst say nothing at the time but when i told thurstan he was very grieved and angry and said he had heard that our party were bribing but that he never could have thought they would have tried to do it at his house thurstan is very much out of spirits about this election altogether and indeed it does make sad work up and down the town however he sent back the watch with a letter to mr bradshaw and leonard was very good about it so i gave him a taste of the new damsonpreserve on his bread for supper although a stranger might have considered this letter wearisome from the multiplicity of the details ruth craved greedily after more what had mr donne said to leonard had leonard liked his new acquaintance were they likely to meet again after wondering and wondering over these points ruth composed herself by the hope that in a day or two she should hear again and to secure this end she answered the letters by return of post that was on thursday on friday she had another letter in a strange hand it was from mr donne no name no initials were given if it had fallen into another persons hands they could not have recognised the writer nor guessed to whom it was sent it contained simply these words for our childs sake and in his name i summon you to appoint a place where i can speak and you can listen undisturbed the time must be on sunday the limit of distance may be the circumference of your power of walking my words may be commands but my fond heart entreats more i shall not say now but remember your boys welfare depends on your acceding to this request address b d postoffice eccleston ruth did not attempt to answer this letter till the last five minutes before the post went out she could not decide until forced to it either way she dreaded she was very nearly leaving the letter altogether unanswered but suddenly she resolved she would know all the best the worst no cowardly dread of herself or of others should make her neglect aught that came to her in her childs name she took up a pen and wrote the sands below the rocks where we met you the other night time afternoon church sunday came i shall not go to church this afternoon you know the way of course and i can trust you to go steadily by yourselves when they came to kiss her before leaving her according to their fond wont they were struck by the coldness of her face and lips are you not well dear mrs denbigh how cold you are yes darling i am well and tears sprang into her eyes as she looked at their anxious little faces go now dears five oclock will soon be here and then we will have tea and that will warm you said they leaving the room and then it will be over she murmuredover it never came into her head to watch the girls as they disappeared down the lane on their way to church she knew them too well to distrust their doing what they were told she sat still her head bowed on her arms for a few minutes and then rose up and went to put on her walking things some thoughts impelled her to sudden haste she crossed the field by the side of the house ran down the steep and rocky path and was carried by the impetus of her descent far out on the level sandsbut not far enough for her intent without looking to the right hand or to the left where comers might be seen she went forwards to the black posts which rising above the heaving waters marked where the fishermens nets were laid she went straight towards this place and hardly stinted her pace even where the wet sands were glittering with the receding waves once there she turned round and in a darting glance saw that as yet no one was near she was perhaps halfamile or more from the grey silvery rocks which sloped away into brown moorland interspersed with a field here and there of golden waving corn behind were purple hills with sharp clear outlines touching the sky a little on one side from where she stood she saw the white cottages and houses which formed the village of abermouth scattered up and down and on a windy hill about a mile inland she saw the little grey church where even now many were worshipping in peace pray for me she sighed out as this object caught her eye and now close under the heathery fields where they fell softly down and touched the sands she saw a figure moving in the direction of the great shadow made by the rocksgoing towards the very point where the path from eagles crag came down to the shore it is he said she to herself and she turned round and looked seaward the tide had turned the waves were slowly receding as if loath to lose the hold they had so lately and with such swift bounds gained on the yellow sands the eternal moan they have made since the world began filled the ear broken only by the skirl of the grey seabirds as they alighted in groups on the edge of the waters or as they rose up with their measured balancing motion and the sunlight caught their white breasts there was no sign of human life to be seen no boat or distant sail or near shrimper the black posts there were all that spoke of mens work or labour beyond a stretch of the waters a few pale grey hills showed like films their summits clear though faint their bases lost in a vapoury mist on the hard echoing sands and distinct from the ceaseless murmur of the salt sea waves came footstepsnearernearer very near they were when ruth unwilling to show the fear that rioted in her heart turned round and faced mr donne he came forward with both hands extended this is kind my own ruth said he ruths arms hung down motionless at her sides what ruth have you no word for me i have nothing to say said ruth why you little revengeful creature and so i am to explain all before you will even treat me with decent civility i do not want explanations said ruth in a trembling tone we must not speak of the past you asked me to come in leonardsin my childs name and to hear what you had to say about him but what i have to say about him relates to you even more and how can we talk about him without recurring to the past that past which you try to ignorei know you cannot do it in your heartis full of happy recollections to me were you not happy in wales he said in his tenderest tone but there was no answer not even one faint sigh though he listened intently you dare not speak you dare not answer me your heart will not allow you to prevaricate and you know you were happy suddenly ruths beautiful eyes were raised to him full of lucid splendour but grave and serious in their expression and her cheeks heretofore so faintly tinged with the tenderest blush flashed into a ruddy glow i was happy i do not deny it whatever comes i will not blench from the truth i have answered you and yet replied he secretly exulting in her admission and not perceiving the inner strength of which she must have been conscious before she would have dared to make itand yet ruth we are not to recur to the past why not if it was happy at the time is the recollection of it so miserable to you he tried once more to take her hand but she quietly stepped back i came to hear what you had to say about my child said she beginning to feel very weary our child ruth she drew herself up and her face went very pale what have you to say about him asked she coldly much exclaimed hemuch that may affect his whole life but it all depends upon whether you will hear me or not i listen good heavens ruth you will drive me mad oh what a changed person you are from the sweet loving creature you were i wish you were not so beautiful she did not reply but he caught a deep involuntary sigh will you hear me if i speak though i may not begin all at once to talk of this boya boy of whom any motherany parent might be proud i could see that ruth i have seen him he looked like a prince in that cramped miserable house and with no earthly advantages it is a shame he should not have every kind of opportunity laid open before him there was no sign of maternal ambition on the motionless face though there might be some little spring in her heart as it beat quick and strong at the idea of the proposal she imagined he was going to make of taking her boy away to give him the careful education she had often craved for him she should refuse it as she would everything else which seemed to imply that she acknowledged a claim over leonard but yet sometimes for her boys sake she had longed for a larger openinga more extended sphere ruth you acknowledge we were happy oncethere were circumstances which if i could tell you them all in detail would show you how in my weak convalescent state i was almost passive in the hands of others ah ruth i have not forgotten the tender nurse who soothed me in my delirium when i am feverish i dream that i am again at llandhu in the little old bedchamber and you in whitewhich you always wore then you knowflitting about me the tears dropped large and round from ruths eyesshe could not help ithow could she we were happy then continued he gaining confidence from the sight of her melted mood and recurring once more to the admission which he considered so much in his favour can such happiness never return thus he went on quickly anxious to lay before her all he had to offer before she should fully understand his meaning if you would consent leonard should be always with youeducated where and how you likedmoney to any amount you might choose to name should be secured to you and himif only ruthif only those happy days might return ruth spoke i said that i was happy because i had asked god to protect and help meand i dared not tell a lie i was happy oh what is happiness or misery that we should talk about them now mr donne looked at her as she uttered these words to see if she was wandering in her mind they seemed to him so utterly strange and incoherent i dare not think of happinessi must not look forward to sorrow god did not put me here to consider either of these things my dear ruth compose yourself there is no hurry in answering the question i asked what was it said ruth i love you so i cannot live without you i offer you my heart my lifei offer to place leonard wherever you would have him placed i have the power and the means to advance him in any path of life you choose all who have shown kindness to you shall be rewarded by me with a gratitude even surpassing your own if there is anything else i can do that you can suggest i will do it listen to me said ruth now that the idea of what he proposed had entered her mind when i said that i was happy with you long ago i was choked with shame as i said it and yet it may be a vain false excuse that i make for myself i was very young i did not know how such a life was against gods pure and holy willat least not as i know it now and i tell you truthall the days of my years since i have gone about with a stain on my hidden soula stain which made me loathe myself and envy those who stood spotless and undefiled which made me shrink from my childfrom mr benson from his sister from the innocent girls whom i teachnay even i have cowered away from god himself and what i did wrong then i did blindly to what i should do now if i listened to you she was so strongly agitated that she put her hands over her face and sobbed without restraint then taking them away she looked at him with a glowing face and beautiful honest wet eyes and tried to speak calmly as she asked if she needed to stay longer she would have gone away at once but that she thought of leonard and wished to hear all that his father might have to say he was so struck anew by her beauty and understood her so little that he believed that she only required a little more urging to consent to what he wished for in all she had said there was no trace of the anger and resentment for his desertion of her which he had expected would be a prominent featurethe greatest obstacle he had to encounter the deep sense of penitence she expressed he mistook for earthly shame which he imagined he could soon soothe away yes i have much more to say i have not said half i cannot tell you how fondly i willhow fondly i do love youhow my life shall be spent in ministering to your wishes money i seei know you despise mr bellingham i will not stay to hear you speak to me so again i have been sinful but it is not you who should she could not speak she was so choking with passionate sorrow he wanted to calm her as he saw her shaken with repressed sobs he put his hand on her arm she shook it off impatiently and moved away in an instant ruth said he nettled by her action of repugnance i begin to think you never loved me ii never loved you do you dare to say so her eyes flamed on him as she spoke her red round lip curled into beautiful contempt why do you shrink so from me said he in his turn getting impatient i did not come here to be spoken to in this way said she i came if by any chance i could do leonard good i would submit to many humiliations for his sakebut to no more from you are not you afraid to brave me so said he dont you know how much you are in my power she was silent she longed to go away but dreaded lest he should follow her where she might be less subject to interruption than she was herenear the fishermans nets which the receding tide was leaving every moment barer and more bare and the posts they were fastened to more blackly uprising above the waters mr donne put his hands on her arms as they hung down before herher hands tightly clasped together ask me to let you go said he i will if you will ask me he looked very fierce and passionate and determined the vehemence of his action took ruth by surprise and the painful tightness of the grasp almost made her exclaim but she was quite still and mute ask me said he giving her a little shake she did not speak her eyes fixed on the distant shore were slowly filling with tears suddenly a light came through the mist that obscured them and the shut lips parted she saw some distant object that gave her hope it is stephen bromley said she he is coming to his nets they say he is a very desperate violent man but he will protect me you obstinate wilful creature said mr donne releasing his grasp you forget that one word of mine could undeceive all these good people at eccleston and that if i spoke out ever so little they would throw you off in an instant now he continued do you understand how much you are in my power mr and miss benson know allthey have not thrown me off ruth gasped out oh for leonards sake you would not be so cruel then do not you be cruel to himto me think once more i think once more she spoke solemnly to save leonard from the shame and agony of knowing my disgrace i would lie down and die oh perhaps it would be best for himfor me if i might my death would be a stingless griefbut to go back into sin would be the real cruelty to him the errors of my youth may be washed away by my tearsit was so once when the gentle blessed christ was upon earth but now if i went into wilful guilt as you would have me how could i teach leonard gods holy will i should not mind his knowing my past sin compared to the awful corruption it would be if he knew me living now as you would have me lost to all fear of god her speech was broken by sobs whatever may be my doomgod is justi leave myself in his hands i will save leonard from evil evil would it be for him if i lived with you i will let him die first she lifted her eyes to heaven and clasped and wreathed her hands together tight then she said you have humbled me enough sir i shall leave you now she turned away resolutely the dark grey fisherman was at hand mr donne folded his arms and set his teeth and looked after her what a stately step she has how majestic and graceful all her attitudes were she thinks she has baffled me now we will try something more and bid a higher price he unfolded his arms and began to follow her he gained upon her for her beautiful walk was now wavering and unsteady the works which had kept her in motion were running down fast ruth said he overtaking her you shall hear me once more aye look round your fisherman is near he may hear me if he chooseshear your triumph i am come to offer to marry you ruth come what may i will have you nayi will make you hear me i will hold this hand till you have heard me tomorrow i will speak to any one in eccleston you liketo mr bradshaw mr the little minister i mean we can make it worth while for him to keep our secret and no one else need know but what you are really mrs denbigh leonard shall still bear this name but in all things else he shall be treated as my son he and you would grace any situation i will take care the highest paths are open to him he looked to see the lovely face brighten into sudden joy on the contrary the head was still hung down with a heavy droop i cannot said she her voice was very faint and low it is sudden for you my dearest but be calm it will all be easily managed leave it to me i cannot repeated she more distinct and clear though still very low why what on earth makes you say that asked he in a mood to be irritated by any repetition of such words i do not love you i did once dont say i did not love you then but i do not now i could never love you again all you have said and done since you came with mr bradshaw to abermouth first has only made me wonder how i ever could have loved you we are very far apart the time that has pressed down my life like brands of hot iron and scarred me for ever has been nothing to you you have talked of it with no sound of moaning in your voiceno shadow over the brightness of your face it has left no sense of sin on your conscience while me it haunts and haunts and yet i might plead that i was an ignorant childonly i will not plead anything for god knows all but this is only one piece of our great difference you mean that i am no saint he said impatient at her speech granted but people who are no saints have made very good husbands before now come dont let any morbid overstrained conscientiousness interfere with substantial happinesshappiness both to you and to mefor i am sure i can make you happyaye and make you love me too in spite of your pretty defiance i love you so dearly i must win love back and here are advantages for leonard to be gained by you quite in a holy and legitimate way she stood very erect if there was one thing needed to confirm me you have named it you shall have nothing to do with my boy by my consent much less by my agency i would rather see him working on the roadside than leading such a lifebeing such a one as you are you have heard my mind now mr bellingham you have humbled meyou have baited me and if at last i have spoken out too harshly and too much in a spirit of judgment the fault is yours if there were no other reason to prevent our marriage but the one fact that it would bring leonard into contact with you that would be enough it is enough said he making her a low bow neither you nor your child shall ever more be annoyed by me i wish you a good evening they walked aparthe back to the inn to set off instantly while the blood was hot within him from the place where he had been so mortifiedshe to steady herself along till she reached the little path more like a rude staircase than anything else by which she had to climb to the house she did not turn round for some time after she was fairly lost to the sight of any one on the shore she clambered on almost stunned by the rapid beating of her heart her eyes were hot and dry and at last became as if she were suddenly blind unable to go on she tottered into the tangled underwood which grew among the stones filling every niche and crevice and little shelving space with green and delicate tracery she sank down behind a great overhanging rock which hid her from any one coming up the path an ashtree was rooted in this rock slanting away from the seabreezes that were prevalent in most weathers but this was a still autumnal sabbath evening as ruths limbs fell so they lay she had no strength no power of volition to move a finger she could not think or remember she was literally stunned the first sharp sensation which roused her from her torpor was a quick desire to see him once more up she sprang and climbed to an outjutting dizzy point of rock but a little above her sheltered nook yet commanding a wide view over the bare naked sandsfar away below touching the rippling waterline was stephen bromley busily gathering in his nets besides him there was no living creature visible ruth shaded her eyes as if she thought they might have deceived her but no there was no one there she went slowly down to her old place crying sadly as she went oh if i had not spoken so angrily to himthe last things i said were so bitterso reproachfuland i shall never never see him again she could not take in the general view and scope of their conversationthe event was too near her for that but her heart felt sore at the echo of her last words just and true as their severity was her struggle her constant flowing tears which fell from very weakness made her experience a sensation of intense bodily fatigue and her soul had lost the power of throwing itself forward or contemplating anything beyond the dreary present when the expanse of grey wild bleak moors stretching wide away below a sunless sky seemed only an outward sign of the waste world within her heart for which she could claim no sympathyfor she could not even define what its woes were and if she could no one would understand how the present time was haunted by the terrible ghost of the former love i am so weary i am so weary she moaned aloud at last i wonder if i might stop here and just die away she shut her eyes until through the closed lids came a ruddy blaze of light the clouds had parted away and the sun was going down in a crimson glory behind the distant purple hills the whole western sky was one flame of fire ruth forgot herself in looking at the gorgeous sight she sat up gazing and as she gazed the tears dried on her cheeks and somehow all human care and sorrow were swallowed up in the unconscious sense of gods infinity the sunset calmed her more than any words however wise and tender could have done it even seemed to give her strength and courage she did not know how or why but so it was she rose and went slowly towards home her limbs were very stiff and every now and then she had to choke down an unbidden sob her pupils had been long returned from church and had busied themselves in preparing teaan occupation which had probably made them feel the time less long if they had ever seen a sleepwalker they might have likened ruth to one for the next few days so slow and measured did her movements seemso far away was her intelligence from all that was passing around herso hushed and strange were the tones of her voice they had letters from home announcing the triumphant return of mr donne as mp for eccleston mrs denbigh heard the news without a word and was too languid to join in the search after purple and yellow flowers with which to deck the sittingroom at eagles crag a letter from jemima came the next day summoning them home mr donne and his friends had left the place and quiet was restored in the bradshaw household so it was time that marys and elizabeths holiday should cease mrs denbigh had also a lettera letter from miss benson saying that leonard was not quite well there was so much pains taken to disguise anxiety that it was very evident much anxiety was felt and the girls were almost alarmed by ruths sudden change from taciturn langour to eager vehement energy body and mind seemed strained to exertion every plan that could facilitate packing and windingup affairs at abermouth every errand and arrangement that could expedite their departure by one minute was done by ruth with stern promptitude she spared herself in nothing she made them rest made them lie down while she herself lifted weights and transacted business with feverish power never resting and trying never to have time to think for in remembrance of the past there was remorsehow had she forgotten leonard these last few dayshow had she repined and been dull of heart to her blessing and in anticipation of the future there was one sharp point of red light in the darkness which pierced her brain with agony and which she would not see or recogniseand saw and recognised all the more for such mad determinationwhich is not the true shield against the bitterness of the arrows of death when the seaside party arrived in eccleston they were met by mrs and miss bradshaw and mr benson by a firm resolution ruth kept from shaping the question is he alive as if by giving shape to her fears she made their realisation more imminent she said merely how is he but she said it with drawn tight bloodless lips and in her eyes mr benson read her anguish of anxiety he is very ill but we hope he will soon be better it is what every child has to go through chapter xxv jemima makes a discovery mr bradshaw had been successful in carrying his point his member had been returned his proud opponents mortified so the public thought he ought to be well pleased but the public were disappointed to see that he did not show any of the gratification they supposed him to feel the truth was that he had met with so many small mortifications during the progress of the election that the pleasure which he would otherwise have felt in the final success of his scheme was much diminished he had more than tacitly sanctioned bribery and now that the excitement was over he regretted it not entirely from conscientious motives though he was uneasy from a slight sense of wrongdoing but he was more pained after all to think that in the eyes of some of his townsmen his hitherto spotless character had received a blemish he who had been so stern and severe a censor on the undue influence exercised by the opposite party in all preceding elections could not expect to be spared by their adherents now when there were rumours that the hands of the scrupulous dissenters were not clean before it had been his boast that neither friend nor enemy could say one word against him now he was constantly afraid of an indictment for bribery and of being compelled to appear before a committee to swear to his own share in the business his uneasy fearful consciousness made him stricter and sterner than ever as if he would quench all wondering slanderous talk about him in the town by a renewed austerity of uprightness that the slackprincipled mr bradshaw of one month of ferment and excitement might not be confounded with the highlyconscientious and deeplyreligious mr bradshaw who went to chapel twice a day and gave a hundred pounds apiece to every charity in the town as a sort of thankoffering that his end was gained but he was secretly dissatisfied with mr donne in general that gentleman had been rather too willing to act in accordance with any ones advice no matter whose as if he had thought it too much trouble to weigh the wisdom of his friends in which case mr bradshaws would have doubtless proved the most valuable but now and then he unexpectedly and utterly without reason took the conduct of affairs into his own hands as when he had been absent without leave only just before the day of nomination no one guessed whither he had gone but the fact of his being gone was enough to chagrin mr bradshaw who was quite ready to pick a quarrel on this very head if the election had not terminated favourably as it was he had a feeling of proprietorship in mr donne which was not disagreeable he had given the new mp his seat his resolution his promptitude his energy had made mr donne our member and mr bradshaw began to feel proud of him accordingly but there had been no one circumstance during this period to bind jemima and mr farquhar together they were still misunderstanding each other with all their power the difference in the result was this jemima loved him all the more in spite of quarrels and coolness he was growing utterly weary of the petulant temper of which he was never certain of the reception which varied day after day according to the mood she was in and the thoughts that were uppermost and he was almost startled to find how very glad he was that the little girls and mrs denbigh were coming home his was a character to bask in peace and lovely quiet ruth with her low tones and quiet replies her delicate waving movements appeared to him the very type of what a woman should bea calm serene soul fashioning the body to angelic grace it was therefore with no slight interest that mr farquhar inquired daily after the health of little leonard he asked at the bensons house and sally answered him with swollen and tearful eyes that the child was very badvery bad indeed he asked at the doctors and the doctor told him in a few short words that it was only a bad kind of measles and that the lad might have a struggle for it but he thought he would get through vigorous children carried their force into everything never did things by halves if they were ill they were sure to be in a high fever directly if they were well there was no peace in the house for their rioting for his part continued the doctor he thought he was glad he had had no children as far as he could judge they were pretty much all plague and no profit but as he ended his speech he sighed and mr farquhar was none the less convinced that common report was true which represented the clever prosperous surgeon of eccleston as bitterly disappointed at his failure of offspring while these various interests and feelings had their course outside the chapelhouse within there was but one thought which possessed all the inmates when sally was not cooking for the little invalid she was crying for she had had a dream about green rushes not three months ago which by some queer process of oneiromancy she interpreted to mean the death of a child and all miss bensons endeavours were directed to making her keep silence to ruth about this dream sally thought that the mother ought to be told what were dreams sent for but for warnings but it was just like a pack of dissenters who would not believe anything like other folks miss benson was too much accustomed to sallys contempt for dissenters as viewed from the pinnacle of the establishment to pay much attention to all this grumbling especially as sally was willing to take as much trouble about leonard as if she believed he was going to live and that his recovery depended upon her care miss bensons great object was to keep her from having any confidential talks with ruth as if any repetition of the dream could have deepened the conviction in ruths mind that the child would die it seemed to her that his death would only be the fitting punishment for the state of indifference towards himtowards life and deathtowards all things earthly or divine into which she had suffered herself to fall since her last interview with mr donne she did not understand that such exhaustion is but the natural consequence of violent agitation and severe tension of feeling the only relief she experienced was in constantly serving leonard she had almost an animals jealousy lest any one should come between her and her young mr benson saw this jealous suspicion although he could hardly understand it but he calmed his sisters wonder and officious kindness so that the two patiently and quietly provided all that ruth might want but did not interfere with her right to nurse leonard but when he was recovering mr benson with the slight tone of authority he knew how to assume when need was bade ruth lie down and take some rest while his sister watched ruth did not answer but obeyed in a dull weary kind of surprise at being so commanded she lay down by her child gazing her fill at his calm slumber and as she gazed her large white eyelids were softly pressed down as with a gentle irresistible weight and she fell asleep she dreamed that she was once more on the lonely shore striving to carry leonard away from some pursuersome human pursuershe knew he was human and she knew who he was although she dared not say his name even to herself he seemed so close and present gaining on her flying footsteps rushing after her as with the sound of the roaring tide her feet seemed heavy weights fixed to the ground they would not move all at once just near the shore a great black whirlwind of waves clutched her back to her pursuer she threw leonard on to land which was safety but whether he reached it or no or was swept back like her into a mysterious something too dreadful to be borne she did not know for the terror awakened her at first the dream seemed yet a reality and she thought that the pursuer was couched even there in that very room and the great boom of the sea was still in her ears but as full consciousness returned she saw herself safe in the dear old roomthe haven of restthe shelter from storms a bright fire was glowing in the little oldfashioned cupshaped grate niched into a corner of the wall and guarded on either side by whitewashed bricks which rested on hobs on one of these the kettle hummed and buzzed within two points of boiling whenever she or leonard required tea in her dream that homelike sound had been the roaring of the relentless sea creeping swiftly on to seize its prey miss benson sat by the fire motionless and still it was too dark to read any longer without a candle but yet on the ceiling and upper part of the walls the golden light of the setting sun was slowly movingso slow and yet a motion gives the feeling of rest to the weary yet more than perfect stillness the old clock on the staircase told its monotonous clickclack in that soothing way which more marked the quiet of the house than disturbed with any sense of sound leonard still slept that renovating slumber almost in her arms far from that fatal pursuing sea with its human form of cruelty the dream was a vision the reality which prompted the dream was over and pastleonard was safeshe was safe all this loosened the frozen springs and they gushed forth in her heart and her lips moved in accordance with her thoughts what were you saying my darling said miss benson who caught sight of the motion and fancied she was asking for something miss benson bent over the side of the bed on which ruth lay to catch the low tones of her voice i only said replied ruth timidly thank god i have so much to thank him for you dont know my dear i am sure we have all of us cause to be thankful that our boy is spared see he is wakening up and we will have a cup of tea together leonard strode on to perfect health but he was made older in character and looks by his severe illness he grew tall and thin and the lovely child was lost in the handsome boy he began to wonder and to question ruth mourned a little over the vanished babyhood when she was all in all and over the childhood whose petals had fallen away it seemed as though two of her children were gonethe one an infant the other a bright thoughtless darling and she wished that they could have remained quick in her memory for ever instead of being absorbed in loving pride for the present boy but these were only fanciful regrets flitting like shadows across a mirror peace and thankfulness were once more the atmosphere of her mind nor was her unconsciousness disturbed by any suspicion of mr farquhars increasing approbation and admiration which he was diligently nursing up into love for her she knew that he had sentshe did not know how often he had broughtfruit for the convalescent leonard she heard on her return from her daily employment that mr farquhar had brought a little gentle pony on which leonard weak as he was might ride to confess the truth her maternal pride was such that she thought that all kindness shown to such a boy as leonard was but natural she believed him to be a child whom all that looked on loved as in truth he was and the proof of this was daily shown in many kind inquiries and many thoughtful little offerings besides mr farquhars the poor warm and kind of heart to all sorrow common to humanity were touched with pity for the young widow whose only child lay ill and nigh unto death they brought what they coulda fresh egg when eggs were scarcea few ripe pears that grew on the sunniest side of the humblest cottage where the fruit was regarded as a source of incomea call of inquiry and a prayer that god would spare the child from an old crippled woman who could scarcely drag herself so far as the chapelhouse yet felt her worn and weary heart stirred with a sharp pang of sympathy and a very present remembrance of the time when she too was young and saw the lifebreath quiver out of her child now an angel in that heaven which felt more like home to the desolate old creature than this empty earth to all such when leonard was better ruth went and thanked them from her heart she and the old cripple sat hand in hand over the scanty fire on the hearth of the latter while she told in solemn broken homely words how her child sickened and died tears fell like rain down ruths cheeks but those of the old woman were dry all tears had been wept out of her long ago and now she sat patient and quiet waiting for death but after this ruth clave unto her and the two were henceforward a pair of friends mr farquhar was only included in the general gratitude which she felt towards all who had been kind to her boy the winter passed away in deep peace after the storms of the autumn yet every now and then a feeling of insecurity made ruth shake for an instant those wild autumnal storms had torn aside the quiet flowers and herbage that had gathered over the wreck of her early life and shown her that all deeds however hidden and long passed by have their eternal consequences she turned sick and faint whenever mr donnes name was casually mentioned no one saw it but she felt the miserable stop in her hearts beating and wished that she could prevent it by any exercise of selfcommand she had never named his identity with mr bellingham nor had she spoken about the seaside interview deep shame made her silent and reserved on all her life before leonards birth from that time she rose again in her selfrespect and spoke as openly as a child when need was of all occurrences which had taken place since then except that she could not and would not tell of this mocking echo this haunting phantom this past that would not rest in its grave the very circumstance that it was stalking abroad in the world and might reappear at any moment made her a coward she trembled away from contemplating what the reality had been only she clung more faithfully than before to the thought of the great god who was a rock in the dreary land where no shadow was autumn and winter with their lowering skies were less dreary than the woeful desolate feelings that shed a gloom on jemima she found too late that she had considered mr farquhar so securely her own for so long a time that her heart refused to recognise him as lost to her unless her reason went through the same weary convincing miserable evidence day after day and hour after hour he never spoke to her now except from common civility he never cared for her contradictions he never tried with patient perseverance to bring her over to his opinions he never used the wonted wiles so tenderly remembered now they had no existence but in memory to bring her round out of some wilful moodand such moods were common enough now frequently she was sullenly indifferent to the feelings of othersnot from any unkindness but because her heart seemed numb and stony and incapable of sympathy then afterwards her selfreproach was terriblein the dead of night when no one saw it with a strange perversity the only intelligence she cared to hear the only sights she cared to see were the circumstances which gave confirmation to the idea that mr farquhar was thinking of ruth for a wife she craved with stinging curiosity to hear something of their affairs every day partly because the torture which such intelligence gave was almost a relief from the deadness of her heart to all other interests and so spring gioventu dellanno came back to her bringing all the contrasts which spring alone can bring to add to the heaviness of the soul the little winged creatures filled the air with bursts of joy the vegetation came bright and hopefully onwards without any check of nipping frost the ashtrees in the bradshaws garden were out in leaf by the middle of may which that year wore more the aspect of summer than most junes do the sunny weather mocked jemima and the unusual warmth oppressed her physical powers she felt very weak and languid she was acutely sensible that no one else noticed her want of strength father mother all seemed too full of other things to care if as she believed her life was waning she herself felt glad that it was so but her delicacy was not unnoticed by all her mother often anxiously asked her husband if he did not think jemima was looking ill nor did his affirmation to the contrary satisfy her as most of his affirmations did she thought every morning before she got up how she could tempt jemima to eat by ordering some favourite dainty for dinner in many other little ways she tried to minister to her child but the poor girls own abrupt irritability of temper had made her mother afraid of openly speaking to her about her health ruth too saw that jemima was not looking well how she had become an object of dislike to her former friend she did not know but she was sensible that miss bradshaw disliked her now she was not aware that this feeling was growing and strengthening almost into repugnance for she seldom saw jemima out of schoolhours and then only for a minute or two but the evil element of a fellowcreatures dislike oppressed the atmosphere of her life that fellowcreature was one who had once loved her so fondly and whom she still loved although she had learnt to fear her as we fear those whose faces cloud over when we come in sightwho cast unloving glances at us of which we though not seeing are conscious as of some occult influence and the cause of whose dislike is unknown to us though every word and action seems to increase it i believe that this sort of dislike is only shown by the jealous and that it renders the disliker even more miserable because more continually conscious than the object but the growing evidence of jemimas feeling made ruth very unhappy at times this very may too an idea had come into her mind which she had tried to repressnamely that mr farquhar was in love with her it annoyed her extremely it made her reproach herself that she ever should think such a thing possible she tried to strangle the notion to drown it to starve it out by neglectits existence caused her such pain and distress the worst was he had won leonards heart who was constantly seeking him out or when absent talking about him the best was some journey connected with business which would take him to the continent for several weeks and during that time surely this disagreeable fancy of his would die away if untrue and if true some way would be opened by which she might put a stop to all increase of predilection on his part and yet retain him as a friend for leonardthat darling for whom she was farseeing and covetous and miserly of every scrap of love and kindly regard mr farquhar would not have been flattered if he had known how much his departure contributed to ruths rest of mind on the saturday afternoon on which he set out on his journey it was a beautiful day the sky of that intense quivering blue which seemed as though you could look through it for ever yet not reach the black infinite space which is suggested as lying beyond now and then a thin torn vaporous cloud floated slowly within the vaulted depth but the soft air that gently wafted it was not perceptible among the leaves on the trees which did not even tremble ruth sat at her work in the shadow formed by the old grey garden wall miss benson and sallythe one in the parlour windowseat mending stockings the other hard at work in her kitchenwere both within talking distance for it was weather for open doors and windows but none of the three kept up any continued conversation and in the intervals ruth sang low a brooding song such as she remembered her mother singing long ago now and then she stopped to look at leonard who was labouring away with vehement energy at digging over a small plot of ground where he meant to prick out some celery plants that had been given to him ruths heart warmed at the earnest spirited way in which he thrust his large spade deep down into the brown soil his ruddy face glowing his curly hair wet with the exertion and yet she sighed to think that the days were over when her deeds of skill could give him pleasure now his delight was in acting himself last year not fourteen months ago he had watched her making a daisychain for him as if he could not admire her cleverness enough this yearthis week when she had been devoting every spare hour to the simple tailoring which she performed for her boy she had always made every article he wore and felt almost jealous of the employment he had come to her with a wistful look and asked when he might begin to have clothes made by a man ever since the wednesday when she had accompanied mary and elizabeth at mrs bradshaws desire to be measured for spring clothes by the new eccleston dressmaker she had been looking forward to this saturday afternoons pleasure of making summer trousers for leonard but the satisfaction of the employment was a little taken away by leonards speech it was a sign however that her life was very quiet and peaceful that she had leisure to think upon the thing at all and often she forgot it entirely in her low chanting song or in listening to the thrush warbling out his afternoon ditty to his patient mate in the hollybush below the distant rumble of carts through the busy streets it was marketday not only formed a low rolling bass to the nearer and pleasanter sounds but enhanced the sense of peace by the suggestion of the contrast afforded to the repose of the garden by the bustle not far off but besides physical din and bustle there is mental strife and turmoil that afternoon as jemima was restlessly wandering about the house her mother desired her to go on an errand to mrs pearsons the new dressmaker in order to give some directions about her sisters new frocks jemima went rather than have the trouble of resisting or else she would have preferred staying at home moving or being outwardly quiet according to her own fitful will mrs bradshaw who as i have said had been aware for some time that something was wrong with her daughter and was very anxious to set it to rights if she only knew how had rather planned this errand with a view to dispel jemimas melancholy and mimie dear said her mother when you are there look out for a new bonnet for yourself she has got some very pretty ones and your old one is so shabby it does for me mother said jemima heavily i dont want a new bonnet but i want you to have one my lassie i want my girl to look well and nice there was something of homely tenderness in mrs bradshaws tone that touched jemimas heart she went to her mother and kissed her with more of affection than she had shown to any one for weeks before and the kiss was returned with warm fondness i think you love me mother said jemima we all love you dear if you would but think so and if you want anything or wish for anything only tell me and with a little patience i can get your father to give it you i know only be happy theres a good girl be happy as if one could by an effort of will thought jemima as she went along the street too absorbed in herself to notice the bows of acquaintances and friends but instinctively guiding herself right among the throng and press of carts and gigs and market people in high street but her mothers tones and looks with their comforting power remained longer in her recollection than the inconsistency of any words spoken when she had completed her errand about the frocks she asked to look at some bonnets in order to show her recognition of her mothers kind thought mrs pearson was a smart cleverlooking woman of five or six and thirty she had all the variety of smalltalk at her fingerends that was formerly needed by barbers to amuse the people who came to be shaved she had admired the town till jemima was weary of its praises sick and oppressed by its sameness as she had been these many weeks here are some bonnets maam that will be just the thing for youelegant and tasty yet quite of the simple style suitable to young ladies oblige me by trying on this white silk jemima looked at herself in the glass she was obliged to own it was very becoming and perhaps not the less so for the flush of modest shame which came into her cheeks as she heard mrs pearsons open praises of the rich beautiful hair and the oriental eyes of the wearer i induced the young lady who accompanied your sisters the other daythe governess is she maam yesmrs denbigh is her name said jemima clouding over thank you maam well i persuaded mrs denbigh to try on that bonnet and you cant think how charming she looked in it and yet i dont think it became her as much as it does you mrs denbigh is very beautiful said jemima taking off the bonnet and not much inclined to try on any other very maam quite a peculiar style of beauty if i might be allowed i should say that hers was a grecian style of loveliness while yours was oriental she reminded me of a young person i once knew in fordham mrs pearson sighed an audible sigh in fordham said jemima remembering that ruth had once spoken of the place as one in which she had spent some time while the county in which it was situated was the same in which ruth was born in fordham why i think mrs denbigh comes from that neighbourhood oh maam she cannot be the young person i meani am sure maamholding the position she does in your establishment i should hardly say i knew her myself for i only saw her two or three times at my sisters house but she was so remarked for her beauty that i remember her face quite wellthe more so on account of her vicious conduct afterwards her vicious conduct repeated jemima convinced by these words that there could be no identity between ruth and the young person alluded to then it could not have been our mrs denbigh oh no maam i am sure i should be sorry to be understood to have suggested anything of the kind i beg your pardon if i did so all i meant to sayand perhaps that was a liberty i ought not to have taken considering what ruth hilton was ruth hilton said jemima turning suddenly round and facing mrs pearson yes maam that was the name of the young person i allude to tell me about herwhat did she do asked jemima subduing her eagerness of tone and look as best she might but trembling as on the verge of some strange discovery i dont know whether i ought to tell you maamit is hardly a fit story for a young lady but this ruth hilton was an apprentice to my sisterinlaw who had a firstrate business in fordham which brought her a good deal of patronage from the county families and this young creature was very artful and bold and thought sadly too much of her beauty and somehow she beguiled a young gentleman who took her into keeping i am sure maam i ought to apologise for polluting your ears go on said jemima breathlessly i dont know much more his mother followed him into wales she was a lady of a great deal of religion and of a very old family and was much shocked at her sons misfortune in being captivated by such a person but she led him to repentance and took him to paris where i think she died but i am not sure for owing to family differences i have not been on terms for some years with my sisterinlaw who was my informant who died interrupted jemimathe young mans mother oror ruth hilton oh dear maam pray dont confuse the two it was the mother mrs i forget the namesomething like billington it was the lady who died and what became of the other asked jemima unable as her dark suspicion seemed thickening to speak the name the girl why maam what could become of her not that i know exactlyonly one knows they can but go from bad to worse poor creatures god forgive me if i am speaking too transiently of such degraded women who after all are a disgrace to our sex then you know nothing more about her asked jemima i did hear that she had gone off with another gentleman that she met with in wales but im sure i cant tell who told me there was a little pause jemima was pondering on all she had heard suddenly she felt that mrs pearsons eyes were upon her watching her not with curiosity but with a newlyawakened intelligenceand yet she must ask one more question but she tried to ask it in an indifferent careless tone handling the bonnet while she spoke how long is it since all thisall you have been telling me abouthappened leonard was eight years old whylet me see it was before i was married and i was married three years and poor dear pearson has been deceased fivei should say going on for nine years this summer blush roses would become your complexion perhaps better than these lilacs said she as with superficial observation she watched jemima turning the bonnet round and round on her handthe bonnet that her dizzy eyes did not see thank you it is very pretty but i dont want a bonnet i beg your pardon for taking up your time and with an abrupt bow to the discomfited mrs pearson she was out and away in the open air threading her way with instinctive energy along the crowded street suddenly she turned round and went back to mrs pearsons with even more rapidity than she had been walking away from the house i have changed my mind said she as she came breathless up into the showroom i will take the bonnet how much is it allow me to change the flowers it can be done in an instant and then you can see if you would not prefer the roses but with either foliage it is a lovely little bonnet said mrs pearson holding it up admiringly on her hand oh never mind the flowersyes change them to roses and she stood by agitated mrs pearson thought with impatience all the time the milliner was making the alteration with skilful busy haste by the way said jemima when she saw the last touches were being given and that she must not delay executing the purpose which was the real cause of her returnpapa i am sure would not like your connecting mrs denbighs name with such astory as you have been telling me oh dear maam i have too much respect for you all to think of doing such a thing of course i know maam that it is not to be cast up to any lady that she is like anybody disreputable but i would rather you did not name the likeness to any one said jemima not to any one dont tell any one the story you have told me this morning indeed maam i should never think of such a thing my poor husband could have borne witness that i am as close as the grave where there is anything to conceal oh dear said jemima mrs pearson there is nothing to conceal only you must not speak about it i certainly shall not do it maam you may rest assured of me this time jemima did not go towards home but in the direction of the outskirts of the town on the hilly side she had some dim recollection of hearing her sisters ask if they might not go and invite leonard and his mother to tea and how could she face ruth after the conviction had taken possession of her heart that she and the sinful creature she had just heard of were one and the same it was yet only the middle of the afternoon the hours were early in the oldfashioned town of eccleston soft white clouds had come slowly sailing up out of the west the plain was flecked with thin floating shadows gently borne along by the westerly wind that was waving the long grass in the hayfields into alternate light and shade jemima went into one of these fields lying by the side of the upland road she was stunned by the shock she had received the diver leaving the green sward smooth and known where his friends stand with their familiar smiling faces admiring his glad braverythe diver down in an instant in the horrid depths of the sea close to some strange ghastly lidlesseyed monster can hardly more feel his blood curdle at the near terror than did jemima now two hours agobut a point of time on her minds dialshe had never imagined that she should ever come in contact with any one who had committed open sin she had never shaped her conviction into words and sentences but still it was there that all the respectable all the family and religious circumstances of her life would hedge her in and guard her from ever encountering the great shock of coming face to face with vice without being pharisaical in her estimation of herself she had all a pharisees dread of publicans and sinners and all a childs cowardlinessthat cowardliness which prompts it to shut its eyes against the object of terror rather than acknowledge its existence with brave faith her fathers often reiterated speeches had not been without their effect he drew a clear line of partition which separated mankind into two great groups to one of which by the grace of god he and his belonged while the other was composed of those whom it was his duty to try and reform and bring the whole force of his morality to bear upon with lectures admonitions and exhortationsa duty to be performed because it was a dutybut with very little of that hope and faith which is the spirit that maketh alive jemima had rebelled against these hard doctrines of her fathers but their frequent repetition had had its effect and led her to look upon those who had gone astray with shrinking shuddering recoil instead of with a pity so christlike as to have both wisdom and tenderness in it and now she saw among her own familiar associates one almost her housefellow who had been stained with that evil most repugnant to her womanly modesty that would fain have ignored its existence altogether she loathed the thought of meeting ruth again she wished that she could take her up and put her down at a distance somewhereanywherewhere she might never see or hear of her more never be reminded as she must be whenever she saw her that such things were in this sunny bright larksinging earth over which the blue dome of heaven bent softly down as jemima sat in the hayfield that june afternoon her cheeks flushed and red but her lips pale and compressed and her eyes full of a heavy angry sorrow it was saturday and the people in that part of the country left their work an hour earlier on that day by this jemima knew it must be growing time for her to be at home she had had so much of conflict in her own mind of late that she had grown to dislike struggle or speech or explanation and so strove to conform to times and hours much more than she had done in happier days but oh how full of hate her heart was growing against the world and oh how she sickened at the thought of seeing ruth who was to be trusted more if ruthcalm modest delicate dignified ruthhad a memory blackened by sin as she went heavily along the thought of mr farquhar came into her mind it showed how terrible had been the stun that he had been forgotten until now with the thought of him came in her first merciful feeling towards ruth this would never have been had there been the least latent suspicion in jemimas jealous mind that ruth had purposely done aughtlooked a lookuttered a wordmodulated a tonefor the sake of attracting as jemima recalled all the passages of their intercourse she slowly confessed to herself how pure and simple had been all ruths ways in relation to mr farquhar it was not merely that there had been no coquetting but there had been simple unconsciousness on ruths part for so long a time after jemima had discovered mr farquhars inclination for her and when at length she had slowly awakened to some perception of the state of his feelings there had been a modest shrinking dignity of manner not startled or emotional or even timid but pure grave and quiet and this conduct of ruths jemima instinctively acknowledged to be of necessity transparent and sincere now and here there was no hypocrisy but some time somewhere on the part of somebody what hypocrisy what lies must have been acted if not absolutely spoken before ruth could have been received by them all as the sweet gentle girlish widow which she remembered they had all believed mrs denbigh to be when first she came among them could mr and miss benson know could they be a party to the deceit not sufficiently acquainted with the world to understand how strong had been the temptation to play the part they did if they wished to give ruth a chance jemima could not believe them guilty of such deceit as the knowledge of mrs denbighs previous conduct would imply and yet how it darkened the latter into a treacherous hypocrite with a black secret shut up in her soul for yearsliving in apparent confidence and daily household familiarity with the bensons for years yet never telling the remorse that ought to be corroding her heart who was true who was not who was good and pure who was not the very foundations of jemimas belief in her mind were shaken could it be false could there be two ruth hiltons she went over every morsel of evidence it could not be she knew that mrs denbighs former name had been hilton she had heard her speak casually but charily of having lived in fordham she knew she had been in wales but a short time before she made her appearance in eccleston there was no doubt of the identity into the middle of jemimas pain and horror at the afternoons discovery there came a sense of the power which the knowledge of this secret gave her over ruth but this was no relief only an aggravation of the regret with which jemima looked back on her state of ignorance it was no wonder that when she arrived at home she was so oppressed with headache that she had to go to bed directly quiet mother quiet dear dear mother for she clung to the known and tried goodness of her mother more than ever now that is all i want and she was left to the stillness of her darkened room the blinds idly flapping to and fro in the soft evening breeze and letting in the rustling sound of the branches which waved close to her window and the thrushs gurgling warble and the distant hum of the busy town her jealousy was goneshe knew not how or where she might shun and recoil from ruth but she now thought that she could never more be jealous of her in her pride of innocence she felt almost ashamed that such a feeling could have had existence could mr farquhar hesitate between her own self and one who no she could not name what ruth had been even in thought and yet he might never know so fair a seeming did her rival wear oh for one ray of gods holy light to know what was seeming and what was truth in this traitorous hollow earth it might beshe used to think such things possible before sorrow had embittered herthat ruth had worked her way through the deep purgatory of repentance up to something like purity again god only knew if her present goodness was realif after having striven back thus far on the heights a fellowwoman was to throw her down into some terrible depth with her unkind incontinent tongue that would be too cruel and yet ifthere was such woeful uncertainty and deceit somewhereif ruth no that jemima with noble candour admitted was impossible whatever ruth had been she was good and to be respected as such now it did not follow that jemima was to preserve the secret always she doubted her own power to do so if mr farquhar came home again and were still constant in his admiration of mrs denbigh and if mrs denbigh gave him anythe least encouragement but this last she thought from what she knew of ruths character was impossible only what was impossible after this afternoons discovery at any rate she would watch and wait come what might ruth was in her power and strange to say this last certainty gave jemima a kind of protecting almost pitying feeling for ruth her horror at the wrong was not diminished but the more she thought of the struggles that the wrongdoer must have made to extricate herself the more she felt how cruel it would be to baffle all by revealing what had been but for her sisters sake she had a duty to perform she must watch ruth for her loves sake she could not have helped watching but she was too much stunned to recognise the force of her love while duty seemed the only stable thing to cling to for the present she would neither meddle nor mar in ruths course of life chapter xxvi mr bradshaws virtuous indignation so it was that jemima no longer avoided ruth nor manifested by word or look the dislike which for a long time she had been scarce concealing ruth could not help noticing that jemima always sought to be in her presence while she was at mr bradshaws house either when daily teaching mary and elizabeth or when she came as an occasional visitor with mr and miss benson or by herself up to this time jemima had used no gentle skill to conceal the abruptness with which she would leave the room rather than that ruth and she should be brought into contactrather than that it should fall to her lot to entertain ruth during any part of the evening it was months since jemima had left off sitting in the schoolroom as had been her wont during the first few years of ruths governessship now each morning miss bradshaw seated herself at a little round table in the window at her work or at her writing but whether she sewed or wrote or read ruth felt that she was always watchingwatching at first ruth had welcomed all these changes in habit and behaviour as giving her a chance she thought by some patient waiting or some opportune show of enduring constant love to regain her lost friends regard but byandby the icy chillness immovable and grey struck more to her heart than many sudden words of unkindness could have done they might be attributed to the hot impulses of a hasty temperto the vehement anger of an accuser but this measured manner was the conscious result of some deepseated feeling this cold sternness befitted the calm implacability of some severe judge the watching which ruth felt was ever upon her made her unconsciously shiver as you would if you saw that the passionless eyes of the dead were visibly gazing upon you her very being shrivelled and parched up in jemimas presence as if blown upon by a bitter keen east wind jemima bent every power she possessed upon the one object of ascertaining what ruth really was sometimes the strain was very painful the constant tension made her soul weary and she moaned aloud and upbraided circumstance she dared not go higherto the maker of circumstance for having deprived her of her unsuspicious happy ignorance things were in this state when mr richard bradshaw came on his annual home visit he was to remain another year in london and then to return and be admitted into the firm after he had been a week at home he grew tired of the monotonous regularity of his fathers household and began to complain of it to jemima i wish farquhar were at home though he is such a stiff quiet old fellow his coming in in the evenings makes a change what has become of the millses they used to drink tea with us sometimes formerly oh papa and mr mills took opposite sides at the election and we have never visited since i dont think they are any great loss anybody is a lossthe stupidest bore that ever was would be a blessing if he only would come in sometimes mr and miss benson have drank tea here twice since you came come thats capital apropos of stupid bores you talk of the bensons i did not think you had so much discrimination my little sister jemima looked up in surprise and then reddened angrily i never meant to say a word against mr or miss benson and that you know quite well dick never mind i wont tell tales they are stupid old fogeys but they are better than nobody especially as that handsome governess of the girls always comes with them to be looked at there was a little pause richard broke it by saying do you know mimie ive a notion if she plays her cards well she may hook farquhar who asked jemima shortly though she knew quite well mrs denbigh to be sure we were talking of her you know farquhar asked me to dine with him at his hotel as he passed through town andid my own reasons for going and trying to creep up his sleevei wanted him to tip me as he used to do for shame dick burst in jemima well well not tip me exactly but lend me some money the governor keeps me so deucedly short why it was only yesterday when my father was speaking about your expenses and your allowance i heard you say that youd more than you knew how to spend dont you see that was the perfection of art if my father had thought me extravagant he would have kept me in with a tight rein as it is im in great hopes of a handsome addition and i can tell you its needed if my father had given me what i ought to have had at first i should not have been driven to the speculations and messes ive got into what speculations what messes asked jemima with anxious eagerness oh messes was not the right word speculations hardly was for they are sure to turn out well and then i shall surprise my father with my riches he saw that he had gone a little too far in his confidence and was trying to draw in but what do you mean do explain it to me never you trouble your head about my business my dear women cant understand the sharemarket and such things dont think ive forgotten the awful blunders you made when you tried to read the state of the moneymarket aloud to my father that night when he had lost his spectacles what were we talking of oh of farquhar and pretty mrs denbigh yes i soon found out that was the subject my gentleman liked me to dwell on he did not talk about her much himself but his eyes sparkled when i told him what enthusiastic letters polly and elizabeth wrote about her how old dye think she is i know said jemima at least i heard her age spoken about amongst other things when first she came she will be fiveandtwenty this autumn and farquhar is forty if he is a day shes young too to have such a boy as leonard youngerlooking or full as younglooking as she is i tell you what mimie she looks younger than you how old are you threeandtwenty aint it last march replied jemima youll have to make haste and pick up somebody if youre losing your good looks at this rate why jemima i thought you had a good chance of farquhar a year or two ago how come you to have lost him id far rather youd had him than that proud haughty mrs denbigh who flashes her great grey eyes upon me if ever i dare to pay her a compliment she ought to think it an honour that i take that much notice of her besides farquhar is rich and its keeping the business of the firm in ones own family and if he marries mrs denbigh she will be sure to be wanting leonard in when hes of age and i wont have that have a try for farquhar mimie ten to one its not too late i wish id brought you a pink bonnet down you go about so dowdyso careless of how you look if mr farquhar has not liked me as i am said jemima choking i dont want to owe him to a pink bonnet nonsense i dont like to have my sisters governess stealing a march on my sister i tell you farquhar is worth trying for if youll wear the pink bonnet ill give it you and ill back you against mrs denbigh i think you might have done something with our member as my father calls him when you had him so long in the house but altogether i should like farquhar best for a brotherinlaw by the way have you heard down here that donne is going to be married i heard of it in town just before i left from a man that was good authority some sir thomas campbells seventh daughter a girl without a penny father ruined himself by gambling and obliged to live abroad but donne is not a man to care for any obstacle from all accounts when once he has taken a fancy it was love at first sight they say i believe he did not know of her existence a month ago no we have not heard of it replied jemima my father will like to know tell it him continued she as she was leaving the room to be alone in order to still her habitual agitation whenever she heard mr farquhar and ruth coupled together mr farquhar came home the day before richard bradshaw left for town he dropped in after tea at the bradshaws he was evidently disappointed to see none but the family there and looked round whenever the door opened look look said dick to his sister i wanted to make sure of his coming in tonight to save me my fathers parting exhortations against the temptations of the world as if i did not know much more of the world than he does so i used a spell i thought would prove efficacious i told him that we should be by ourselves with the exception of mrs denbigh and look how he is expecting her to come in jemima did see did understand she understood too why certain packets were put carefully on one side apart from the rest of the purchases of swiss toys and jewellery by which mr farquhar proved that none of mr bradshaws family had been forgotten by him during his absence before the end of the evening she was very conscious that her sore heart had not forgotten how to be jealous her brother did not allow a word a look or an incident which might be supposed on mr farquhars side to refer to ruth to pass unnoticed he pointed out all to his sister never dreaming of the torture he was inflicting only anxious to prove his own extreme penetration at length jemima could stand it no longer and left the room she went into the schoolroom where the shutters were not closed as it only looked into the garden she opened the window to let the cool night air blow in on her hot cheeks the clouds were hurrying over the moons face in a tempestuous and unstable manner making all things seem unreal now clear out in its bright light now trembling and quivering in shadow the pain at her heart seemed to make jemimas brain grow dull she laid her head on her arms which rested on the windowsill and grew dizzy with the sick weary notion that the earth was wandering lawless and aimless through the heavens where all seemed one tossed and whirling wrack of clouds it was a waking nightmare from the uneasy heaviness of which she was thankful to be roused by dicks entrance what you are here are you i have been looking everywhere for you i wanted to ask you if you have any spare money you could lend me for a few weeks how much do you want asked jemima in a dull hopeless voice oh the more the better but i should be glad of any trifle i am kept so confoundedly short when jemima returned with her little store even her careless selfish brother was struck by the wanness of her face lighted by the bedcandle she carried come mimie dont give it up if i were you i would have a good try against mrs denbigh ill send you the bonnet as soon as ever i get back to town and you pluck up a spirit and ill back you against her even yet it seemed to jemima strangeand yet only a fitting part of this strange chaotic worldto find that her brother who was the last person to whom she could have given her confidence in her own family and almost the last person of her acquaintance to whom she could look for real help and sympathy should have been the only one to hit upon the secret of her love and the idea passed away from his mind as quickly as all ideas not bearing upon his own selfinterests did the night the sleepless night was so crowded and haunted by miserable images that she longed for day and when day came with its stinging realities she wearied and grew sick for the solitude of night for the next week she seemed to see and hear nothing but what confirmed the idea of mr farquhars decided attachment to ruth even her mother spoke of it as a thing which was impending and which she wondered how mr bradshaw would like for his approval or disapproval was the standard by which she measured all things oh merciful god prayed jemima in the dead silence of the night the strain is too greati cannot bear it longermy lifemy lovethe very essence of me which is myself through time and eternity and on the other side there is allpitying charity if she had not been what she isif she had shown any sign of triumphany knowledge of her prizeif she had made any effort to gain his dear heart i must have given way long ago and taunted her even if i did not tell otherstaunted her even though i sank down to the pit the next moment the temptation is too strong for me oh lord where is thy peace that i believed in in my childhoodthat i hear people speaking of now as if it hushed up the troubles of life and had not to be sought forsought for as with tears of blood there was no sound nor sight in answer to this wild imploring cry which jemima half thought must force out a sign from heaven but there was a dawn stealing on through the darkness of her night it was glorious weather for the end of august the nights were as full of light as the dayseverywhere save in the low dusky meadows by the riverside where the mists rose and blended the pale sky with the lands below unknowing of the care and trouble around them mary and elizabeth exulted in the weather and saw some new glory in every touch of the years decay they were clamorous for an expedition to the hills before the calm stillness of the autumn should be disturbed by storms they gained permission to go on the next wednesdaythe next halfholiday they had won their mother over to consent to a full holiday but their father would not hear of it mrs bradshaw had proposed an early dinner but the idea was scouted at by the girls what would the expedition be worth if they did not carry their dinners with them in baskets anything out of a basket and eaten in the open air was worth twenty times as much as the most sumptuous meal in the house so the baskets were packed up while mrs bradshaw wailed over probable colds to be caught from sitting on the damp ground ruth and leonard were to go they four jemima had refused all invitations to make one of the party and yet she had a halfsympathy with her sisters joya sort of longing lingering look back to the time when she too would have revelled in the prospect that lay before them they too would grow up and suffer though now they played regardless of their doom the morning was bright and glorious just cloud enough as some one said to make the distant plain look beautiful from the hills with its floating shadows passing over the golden cornfields leonard was to join them at twelve when his lessons with mr benson and the girls with their masters should be over ruth took off her bonnet and folded her shawl with her usual dainty careful neatness and laid them aside in a corner of the room to be in readiness she tried to forget the pleasure she always anticipated from a long walk towards the hills while the mornings work went on but she showed enough of sympathy to make the girls cling round her with many a caress of joyous love everything was beautiful in their eyes from the shadows of the quivering leaves on the wall to the glittering beads of dew not yet absorbed by the sun which decked the gossamer web in the vine outside the window eleven oclock struck the latin master went away wondering much at the radiant faces of his pupils and thinking that it was only very young people who could take such pleasure in the delectus ruth said now do let us try to be very steady this next hour and mary pulled back ruths head and gave the pretty budding mouth a kiss they sat down to work while mrs denbigh read aloud a fresh sungleam burst into the room and they looked at each other with glad anticipating eyes jemima came in ostensibly to seek for a book but really from that sort of restless weariness of any one place or employment which had taken possession of her since mr farquhars return she stood before the bookcase in the recess languidly passing over the titles in search of the one she wanted ruths voice lost a tone or two of its peacefulness and her eyes looked more dim and anxious at jemimas presence she wondered in her heart if she dared to ask miss bradshaw to accompany them in their expedition eighteen months ago she would have urged it on her friend with soft loving entreaty now she was afraid even to propose it as a hard possibility everything she did or said was taken so wronglyseemed to add to the old dislike or the later stony contempt with which miss bradshaw had regarded her while they were in this way mr bradshaw came into the room his entrancehis being at home at all at this timewas so unusual a thing that the reading was instantly stopped and all four involuntarily looked at him as if expecting some explanation of his unusual proceeding his face was almost purple with suppressed agitation mary and elizabeth leave the room dont stay to pack up your books leave the room i say he spoke with trembling anger and the frightened girls obeyed without a word a cloud passing over the sun cast a cold gloom into the room which was late so bright and beaming but by equalising the light it took away the dark shadow from the place where jemima had been standing and her figure caught her fathers eye leave the room jemima said he why father replied she in an opposition that was strange even to herself but which was prompted by the sullen passion which seethed below the stagnant surface of her life and which sought a vent in defiance she maintained her ground facing round upon her father and ruthruth who had risen and stood trembling shaking a lightningfear having shown her the precipice on which she stood it was of no use no quiet innocent lifeno profound silence even to her own heart as to the past the old offence could never be drowned in the deep but thus when all was calm on the great broad sunny sea it rose to the surface and faced her with its unclosed eyes and its ghastly countenance the blood bubbled up to her brain and made such a sound there as of boiling waters that she did not hear the words which mr bradshaw first spoke indeed his speech was broken and disjointed by intense passion but she needed not to hear she knew as she rose up at first so she stood nownumb and helpless when her ears heard again as if the sounds were drawing nearer and becoming more distinct from some faint vague distance of space mr bradshaw was saying if there be one sin i hatei utterly loathemore than all others it is wantonness it includes all other sins it is but of a piece that you should have come with your sickly hypocritical face imposing upon us all i trust benson did not know of itfor his own sake i trust not before god if he got you into my house on false pretences he shall find his charity at other mens expense shall cost him dearyouthe common talk of eccleston for your profligacy he was absolutely choked by his boiling indignation ruth stood speechless motionless her head drooped a little forward her eyes were more than half veiled by the large quivering lids her arms hung down straight and heavy at last she heaved the weight off her heart enough to say in a faint moaning voice speaking with infinite difficulty i was so young the more depraved the more disgusting you mr bradshaw exclaimed almost glad that the woman unresisting so long should now begin to resist but to his surprise for in his anger he had forgotten her presence jemima moved forwards and said father you hold your tongue jemima you have grown more and more insolentmore and more disobedient every day i now know who to thank for it when such a woman came into my family there is no wonder at any corruptionany evilany defilement father not a word if in your disobedience you choose to stay and hear what no modest young woman would put herself in the way of hearing you shall be silent when i bid you the only good you can gain is in the way of warning look at that woman indicating ruth who moved her drooping head a little on one side as if by such motion she could avert the pitiless pointingher face growing whiter and whiter still every instantlook at that woman i saycorrupt long before she was your agehypocrite for years if ever you or any child of mine cared for her shake her off from you as st paul shook off the vipereven into the fire he stopped for very want of breath jemima all flushed and panting went up and stood side by side with wan ruth she took the cold dead hand which hung next to her in her warm convulsive grasp and holding it so tight that it was blue and discoloured for days she spoke out beyond all power of restraint from her father father i will speak i will not keep silence i will bear witness to ruth i have hated herso keenly may god forgive me but you may know from that that my witness is true i have hated her and my hatred was only quenched into contemptnot contempt now dear ruthdear ruththis was spoken with infinite softness and tenderness and in spite of her fathers fierce eyes and passionate gesturei heard what you have learnt now father weeks and weeks agoa year it may be all time of late has been so long and i shuddered up from her and from her sin and i might have spoken of it and told it there and then if i had not been afraid that it was from no good motive i should act in so doing but to gain a way to the desire of my own jealous heart yes father to show you what a witness i am for ruth i will own that i was stabbed to the heart with jealousy some onesome one cared for ruth thatoh father spare me saying all her face was doubledyed with crimson blushes and she paused for one momentno more i watched her and i watched her with my wildbeast eyes if i had seen one paltering with dutyif i had witnessed one flickering shadow of untruth in word or actionif more than all things my womans instinct had ever been conscious of the faintest speck of impurity in thought or word or look my old hate would have flamed out with the flame of hell my contempt would have turned to loathing disgust instead of my being full of pity and the stirrings of newawakened love and most true respect father i have borne my witness and i will tell you how much your witness is worth said her father beginning low that his pentup wrath might have room to swell out it only convinces me more and more how deep is the corruption this wanton has spread in my family she has come amongst us with her innocent seeming and spread her nets well and skilfully she has turned right into wrong and wrong into right and taught you all to be uncertain whether there be any such thing as vice in the world or whether it ought not to be looked upon as virtue she has led you to the brink of the deep pit ready for the first chance circumstance to push you in and i trusted heri trusted heri welcomed her i have done very wrong murmured ruth but so low that perhaps he did not hear her for he went on lashing himself up i welcomed her i was duped into allowing her bastardi sicken at the thought of it at the mention of leonard ruth lifted up her eyes for the first time since the conversation began the pupils dilating as if she were just becoming aware of some new agony in store for her i have seen such a look of terror on a poor dumb animals countenance and once or twice on human faces i pray i may never see it again on either jemima felt the hand she held in her strong grasp writhe itself free ruth spread her arms before her clasping and lacing her fingers together her head thrown a little back as if in intensest suffering mr bradshaw went on that very child and heir of shame to associate with my own innocent children i trust they are not contaminated i cannot bear iti cannot bear it were the words wrung out of ruth cannot bear it cannot bear it he repeated you must bear it madam do you suppose your child is to be exempt from the penalties of his birth do you suppose that he alone is to be saved from the upbraiding scoff do you suppose that he is ever to rank with other boys who are not stained and marked with sin from their birth every creature in eccleston may know what he is do you think they will spare him their scorn cannot bear it indeed before you went into your sin you should have thought whether you could bear the consequences or nothave had some idea how far your offspring would be degraded and scouted till the best thing that could happen to him would be for him to be lost to all sense of shame dead to all knowledge of guilt for his mothers sake ruth spoke out she stood like a wild creature at bay past fear now i appeal to god against such a doom for my child i appeal to god to help me i am a mother and as such i cry to god for helpfor help to keep my boy in his pitying sight and to bring him up in his holy fear let the shame fall on me i have deserved it but hehe is so innocent and good ruth had caught up her shawl and was tying on her bonnet with her trembling hands what if leonard was hearing of her shame from common report what would be the mysterious shock of the intelligence she must face him and see the look in his eyes before she knew whether he recoiled from her he might have his heart turned to hate her by their cruel jeers jemima stood by dumb and pitying her sorrow was past her power she helped in arranging the dress with one or two gentle touches which were hardly felt by ruth but which called out all mr bradshaws ire afresh he absolutely took her by the shoulders and turned her by force out of the room in the hall and along the stairs her passionate woeful crying was heard the sound only concentrated mr bradshaws anger on ruth he held the streetdoor open wide and said between his teeth if ever you or your bastard darken this door again i will have you both turned out by the police he need not have added this if he had seen ruths face chapter xxvii preparing to stand on the truth as ruth went along the accustomed streets every sight and every sound seemed to bear a new meaning and each and all to have some reference to her boys disgrace she held her head down and scudded along dizzy with fear lest some word should have told him what she had been and what he was before she could reach him it was a wild unreasoning fear but it took hold of her as strongly as if it had been well founded and indeed the secret whispered by mrs pearson whose curiosity and suspicion had been excited by jemimas manner and confirmed since by many a little corroborating circumstance had spread abroad and was known to most of the gossips in eccleston before it reached mr bradshaws ears as ruth came up to the door of the chapelhouse it was opened and leonard came out bright and hopeful as the morning his face radiant at the prospect of the happy day before him he was dressed in the clothes it had been such a pleasant pride to her to make for him he had the dark blue ribbon tied round his neck that she had left out for him that very morning with a smiling thought of how it would set off his brown handsome face she caught him by the hand as they met and turned him with his face homewards without a word her looks her rushing movement her silence awed him and although he wondered he did not stay to ask why she did so the door was on the latch she opened it and only said upstairs in a hoarse whisper up they went into her own room she drew him in and bolted the door and then sitting down she placed him she had never let go of him before her holding him with her hands on each of his shoulders and gazing into his face with a woeful look of the agony that could not find vent in words at last she tried to speak she tried with strong bodily effort almost amounting to convulsion but the words would not come it was not till she saw the absolute terror depicted on his face that she found utterance and then the sight of that terror changed the words from what she meant them to have been she drew him to her and laid her head upon his shoulder hiding her face even there my poor poor boy my poor poor darling oh would that i had diedi had died in my innocent girlhood mother mother sobbed leonard what is the matter why do you look so wild and ill why do you call me your poor boy are we not going to scaursidehill i dont much mind it mother only please dont gasp and quiver so dearest mother are you ill let me call aunt faith ruth lifted herself up and put away the hair that had fallen over and was blinding her eyes she looked at him with intense wistfulness kiss me leonard said shekiss me my darling once more in the old way leonard threw himself into her arms and hugged her with all his force and their lips clung together as in the kiss given to the dying leonard said she at length holding him away from her and nerving herself up to tell him all by one spasmodic effortlisten to me the boy stood breathless and still gazing at her on her impetuous transit from mr bradshaws to the chapelhouse her wild desperate thought had been that she would call herself by every violent coarse name which the world might give herthat leonard should hear those words applied to his mother first from her own lips but the influence of his presencefor he was a holy and sacred creature in her eyes and this point remained steadfast though all the rest were upheavedsubdued her and now it seemed as if she could not find words fine enough and pure enough to convey the truth that he must learn and should learn from no tongue but hers leonardwhen i was very young i did very wrong i think god who knows all will judge me more tenderly than menbut i did wrong in a way which you cannot understand yet she saw the red flush come into his cheek and it stung her as the first token of that shame which was to be his portion through lifein a way people never forget never forgive you will hear me called the hardest names that ever can be thrown at womeni have been today and my child you must bear it patiently because they will be partly true never get confused by your love for me into thinking that what i did was rightwhere was i said she suddenly faltering and forgetting all she had said and all she had got to say and then seeing leonards face of wonder and burning shame and indignation she went on more rapidly as fearing lest her strength should fail before she had ended and leonard continued she in a trembling sad voice this is not all the punishment of punishments lies awaiting me still it is to see you suffer for my wrongdoing yes darling they will speak shameful things of you poor innocent child as well as of me who am guilty they will throw it in your teeth through life that your mother was never marriedwas not married when you were born were not you married are not you a widow asked he abruptly for the first time getting anything like a clear idea of the real state of the case no may god forgive me and help me exclaimed she as she saw a strange look of repugnance cloud over the boys face and felt a slight motion on his part to extricate himself from her hold it was as slight as transient as it could beover in an instant but she had taken her hands away and covered up her face with them as quicklycovered up her face in shame before her child and in the bitterness of her heart she was wailing out oh would to god i had diedthat i had died as a babythat i had died as a little baby hanging at my mothers breast mother said leonard timidly putting his hand on her arm but she shrunk from him and continued her low passionate wailing mother said he after a pause coming nearer though she saw it notmammy darling said he using the caressing name which he had been trying to drop as not sufficiently manly mammy my own own dear dear darling mother i dont believe themi dont i dont i dont i dont he broke out into a wild burst of crying as he said this in a moment her arms were round the poor boy and she was hushing him up like a baby on her bosom hush leonard leonard be still my child i have been too sudden with youi have done you harmoh i have done you nothing but harm cried she in a tone of bitter selfreproach no mother said he stopping his tears and his eyes blazing out with earnestness there never was such a mother as you have been to me and i wont believe any one who says it i wont and ill knock them down if they say it again i will he clenched his fist with a fierce defiant look on his face you forget my child said ruth in the sweetest saddest tone that ever was heard i said it of myself i said it because it was true leonard threw his arms tight round her and hid his face against her bosom she felt him pant there like some hunted creature she had no soothing comfort to give him oh that she and he lay dead at last exhausted he lay so still and motionless that she feared to look she wanted him to speak yet dreaded his first words she kissed his hair his head his very clothes murmuring low inarticulate moaning sounds leonard said she leonard look up at me leonard look up but he only clung the closer and hid his face the more my boy said she what can i do or say if i tell you never to mind itthat it is nothingi tell you false it is a bitter shame and a sorrow that i have drawn down upon you a shame leonard because of me your mother but leonard it is no disgrace or lowering of you in the eyes of god she spoke now as if she had found the clue which might lead him to rest and strength at last remember that always remember that when the time of trial comesand it seems a hard and cruel thing that you should be called reproachful names by men and all for what was no fault of yoursremember gods pity and gods justice and though my sin shall have made you an outcast in the worldoh my child my childshe felt him kiss her as if mutely trying to comfort herit gave her strength to go onremember darling of my heart it is only your own sin that can make you an outcast from god she grew so faint that her hold of him relaxed he looked up affrighted he brought her waterhe threw it over her in his terror at the notion that she was going to die and leave him he called her by every fond name imploring her to open her eyes when she partially recovered he helped her to the bed on which she lay still wan and deathlike she almost hoped the swoon that hung around her might be death and in that imagination she opened her eyes to take a last look at her boy she saw him pale and terrorstricken and pity for his affright roused her and made her forget herself in the wish that he should not see her death if she were indeed dying go to aunt faith whispered she i am weary and want sleep leonard arose slowly and reluctantly she tried to smile upon him that what she thought would be her last look might dwell in his remembrance as tender and strong she watched him to the door she saw him hesitate and return to her he came back to her and said in a timid apprehensive tone motherwill they speak to me aboutit ruth closed her eyes that they might not express the agony she felt like a sharp knife at this question leonard had asked it with a childs desire of avoiding painful and mysterious topicsfrom no personal sense of shame as she understood it shame beginning thus early thus instantaneously no she replied you may be sure they will not so he went but now she would have been thankful for the unconsciousness of fainting that one little speech bore so much meaning to her hot irritable brain mr and miss benson all in their house would never speak to the boybut in his home alone would he be safe from what he had already learnt to dread every form in which shame and opprobrium could overwhelm her darling haunted her she had been exercising strong selfcontrol for his sake ever since she had met him at the housedoor there was now a reaction his presence had kept her mind on its perfect balance when that was withdrawn the effect of the strain of power was felt and athwart the fevermists that arose to obscure her judgment all sorts of willothewisp plans flittered before her tempting her to this and that course of actionto anything rather than patient enduranceto relieve her present state of misery by some sudden spasmodic effort that took the semblance of being wise and right gradually all her desires all her longing settled themselves on one point what had she donewhat could she do to leonard but evil if she were away and gone no one knew wherelost in mystery as if she were deadperhaps the cruel hearts might relent and show pity on leonard while her perpetual presence would but call up the remembrance of his birth thus she reasoned in her hot dull brain and shaped her plans in accordance leonard stole downstairs noiselessly he listened to find some quiet place where he could hide himself the house was very still miss benson thought the purposed expedition had taken place and never dreamed but that ruth and leonard were on distant sunny scaursidehill and after a very early dinner she had set out to drink tea with a farmers wife who lived in the country two or three miles off mr benson meant to have gone with her but while they were at dinner he had received an unusually authoritative note from mr bradshaw desiring to speak with him so he went to that gentlemans house instead sally was busy in her kitchen making a great noise not unlike a groom rubbing down a horse over her cleaning leonard stole into the sittingroom and crouched behind the large oldfashioned sofa to ease his sore aching heart by crying with all the prodigal waste and abandonment of childhood mr benson was shown into mr bradshaws own particular room the latter gentleman was walking up and down and it was easy to perceive that something had occurred to chafe him to great anger sit down sir said he to mr benson nodding to a chair mr benson sat down but mr bradshaw continued his walk for a few minutes longer without speaking then he stopped abruptly right in front of mr benson and in a voice which he tried to render calm but which trembled with passionwith a face glowing purple as he thought of his wrongs and real wrongs they were he began mr benson i have sent for you to aski am almost too indignant at the bare suspicion to speak as becomes mebut did youi really shall be obliged to beg your pardon if you are as much in the dark as i was yesterday as to the character of that woman who lives under your roof there was no answer from mr benson mr bradshaw looked at him very earnestly his eyes were fixed on the groundhe made no inquiryhe uttered no expression of wonder or dismay mr bradshaw ground his foot on the floor with gathering rage but just as he was about to speak mr benson rose upa poor deformed old manbefore the stern and portly figure that was swelling and panting with passion hear me sir stretching out his hand as if to avert the words which were impending nothing you can say can upbraid me like my own conscience no degradation you can inflict by word or deed can come up to the degradation i have suffered for years at being a party to a deceit even for a good end for a good endnay what next the taunting contempt with which mr bradshaw spoke these words almost surprised himself by what he imagined must be its successful power of withering but in spite of it mr benson lifted his grave eyes to mr bradshaws countenance and repeated for a good end the end was not as perhaps you consider it to have been to obtain her admission into your familynor yet to put her in the way of gaining her livelihood my sister and i would willingly have shared what we have with her it was our intention to do so at first if not for any length of time at least as long as her health might require it why i advised perhaps i only yielded to advice a change of namean assumption of a false state of widowhoodwas because i earnestly desired to place her in circumstances in which she might work out her selfredemption and you sir know how terribly the world goes against all such as have sinned as ruth did she was so young too you mistake sir my acquaintance has not lain so much among that class of sinners as to give me much experience of the way in which they are treated but judging from what i have seen i should say they meet with full as much leniency as they deserve and supposing they do noti know there are plenty of sickly sentimentalists just now who reserve all their interest and regard for criminalswhy not pick out one of these to help you in your task of washing the blackamoor white why choose me to be imposed uponmy household into which to intrude your protegee why were my innocent children to be exposed to corruption i say said mr bradshaw stamping his foot how dared you come into this house where you were looked upon as a minister of religion with a lie in your mouth how dared you single me out of all people to be gulled and deceived and pointed at through the town as the person who had taken an abandoned woman into his house to teach his daughters i own my deceit was wrong and faithless yes you can own it now it is found out there is small merit in that i think sir i claim no merit i take shame to myself i did not single you out you applied to me with your proposal that ruth should be your childrens governess pah and the temptation was too great no i will not say thatbut the temptation was greater than i could standit seemed to open out a path of usefulness now dont let me hear you speak so said mr bradshaw blazing up i cant stand it it is too much to talk in that way when the usefulness was to consist in contaminating my innocent girls god knows that if i had believed there had been any danger of such contaminationgod knows how i would have died sooner than have allowed her to enter your family mr bradshaw you believe me dont you asked mr benson earnestly i really must be allowed the privilege of doubting what you say in future said mr bradshaw in a cold contemptuous manner i have deserved this mr benson replied but continued he after a moments pause i will not speak of myself but of ruth surely sir the end i aimed at the means i took to obtain it were wrong you cannot feel that more than i do was a right one and you will notyou cannot say that your children have suffered from associating with her i had her in my family under the watchful eyes of three anxious persons for a year or more we saw faultsno human being is without themand poor ruths were but slight venial errors but we saw no sign of a corrupt mindno glimpse of boldness or forwardnessno token of want of conscientiousness she seemed and was a young and gentle girl who had been led astray before she fairly knew what life was i suppose most depraved women have been innocent in their time said mr bradshaw with bitter contempt oh mr bradshaw ruth was not depraved and you know it you cannot have seen herhave known her daily all these years without acknowledging that mr benson was almost breathless awaiting mr bradshaws answer the quiet selfcontrol which he had maintained so long was gone now i saw her dailyi did not know her if i had known her i should have known she was fallen and depraved and consequently not fit to come into my house nor to associate with my pure children now i wish god would give me power to speak out convincingly what i believe to be his truth that not every woman who has fallen is depraved that manyhow many the great judgment day will reveal to those who have shaken off the poor sore penitent hearts on earthmany many crave and hunger after a chance for virtuethe help which no man gives to themhelpthat gentle tender help which jesus gave once to mary magdalen mr benson was almost choked by his own feelings come come mr benson let us have no more of this morbid way of talking the world has decided how such women are to be treated and you may depend upon it there is so much practical wisdom in the world that its way of acting is right in the long run and that no one can fly in its face with impunity unless indeed they stoop to deceit and imposition i take my stand with christ against the world said mr benson solemnly disregarding the covert allusion to himself what have the worlds ways ended in can we be much worse than we are speak for yourself if you please is it not time to change some of our ways of thinking and acting i declare before god that if i believe in any one human truth it is thisthat to every woman who like ruth has sinned should be given a chance of selfredemptionand that such a chance should be given in no supercilious or contemptuous manner but in the spirit of the holy christ such as getting her into a friends house under false colours i do not argue on ruths case in that i have acknowledged my error i do not argue on any case i state my firm belief that it is gods will that we should not dare to trample any of his creatures down to the hopeless dust that it is gods will that the women who have fallen should be numbered among those who have broken hearts to be bound up not cast aside as lost beyond recall if this be gods will as a thing of god it will stand and he will open a way i should have attached much more importance to all your exhortation on this point if i could have respected your conduct in other matters as it is when i see a man who has deluded himself into considering falsehood right i am disinclined to take his opinion on subjects connected with morality and i can no longer regard him as a fitting exponent of the will of god you perhaps understand what i mean mr benson i can no longer attend your chapel if mr benson had felt any hope of making mr bradshaws obstinate mind receive the truth that he acknowledged and repented of his connivance at the falsehood by means of which ruth had been received into the bradshaw family this last sentence prevented his making the attempt he simply bowed and took his leavemr bradshaw attending him to the door with formal ceremony he felt acutely the severance of the tie which mr bradshaw had just announced to him he had experienced many mortifications in his intercourse with that gentleman but they had fallen off from his meek spirit like drops of water from a birds plumage and now he only remembered the acts of substantial kindness rendered the ostentation all forgottenmany happy hours and pleasant eveningsthe children whom he had loved dearer than he thought till nowthe young people about whom he had cared and whom he had striven to lead aright he was but a young man when mr bradshaw first came to his chapel they had grown old together he had never recognised mr bradshaw as an old familiar friend so completely as now when they were severed it was with a heavy heart that he opened his own door he went to his study immediately he sat down to steady himself into his position how long he was theresilent and alonereviewing his lifeconfessing his sinshe did not know but he heard some unusual sound in the house that disturbed himroused him to present life a slow languid step came along the passage to the front doorthe breathing was broken by many sighs ruths hand was on the latch when mr benson came out her face was very white except two red spots on each cheekher eyes were deepsunk and hollow but glittered with feverish lustre ruth exclaimed he she moved her lips but her throat and mouth were too dry for her to speak where are you going asked he for she had all her walking things on yet trembled so even as she stood that it was evident she could not walk far without falling she hesitatedshe looked up at him still with the same dry glittering eyes at last she whispered for she could only speak in a whisper to helmsbyi am going to helmsby helmsby my poor girlmay god have mercy upon you for he saw she hardly knew what she was saying where is helmsby i dont know in lincolnshire i think but why are you going there hush hes asleep said she as mr benson had unconsciously raised his voice who is asleep asked mr benson that poor little boy said she beginning to quiver and cry come here said he authoritatively drawing her into the study sit down in that chair i will come back directly he went in search of his sister but she had not returned then he had recourse to sally who was as busy as ever about her cleaning how long has ruth been at home asked he ruth she has never been at home sin morning she and leonard were to be off for the day somewhere or other with them bradshaw girls then she has had no dinner not here at any rate i cant answer for what she may have done at other places and leonardwhere is he how should i know with his mother i suppose leastways that was what was fixed on ive enough to do of my own without routing after other folks she went on scouring in no very good temper mr benson stood silent for a moment sally he said i want a cup of tea will you make it as soon as you can and some dry toast too ill come for it in ten minutes struck by something in his voice she looked up at him for the first time what ha ye been doing to yourself to look so grim and grey tiring yourself all to tatters looking after some naught ill be bound well well i mun make ye your tea i reckon but i did hope as you grew older youd ha grown wiser mr benson made no reply but went to look for leonard hoping that the childs presence might bring back to his mother the power of selfcontrol he opened the parlourdoor and looked in but saw no one just as he was shutting it however he heard a deep broken sobbing sigh and guided by the sound he found the boy lying on the floor fast asleep but with his features all swollen and disfigured by passionate crying poor child this was what she meant then thought mr benson he has begun his share of the sorrows too he continued pitifully no i will not waken him back to consciousness so he returned alone into the study ruth sat where he had placed her her head bent back and her eyes shut but when he came in she started up i must be going she said in a hurried way nay ruth you must not go you must not leave us we cannot do without you we love you too much love me said she looking at him wistfully as she looked her eyes filled slowly with tears it was a good sign and mr benson took heart to go on yes ruth you know we do you may have other things to fill up your mind just now but you know we love you and nothing can alter our love for you you ought not to have thought of leaving us you would not if you had been quite well do you know what has happened she asked in a low hoarse voice yes i know all he answered it makes no difference to us why should it oh mr benson dont you know that my shame is discovered she replied bursting into tearsand i must leave you and leave leonard that you may not share in my disgrace you must do no such thing leave leonard you have no right to leave leonard where could you go to to helmsby she said humbly it would break my heart to go but i think i ought for leonards sake i know i ought she was crying sadly by this time but mr benson knew the flow of tears would ease her brain it will break my heart to go but i know i must sit still here at present said he in a decided tone of command he went for the cup of tea he brought it to her without sallys being aware for whom it was intended drink this he spoke as you would do to a child if desiring it to take medicine eat some toast she took the tea and drank it feverishly but when she tried to eat the food seemed to choke her still she was docile and she tried i cannot said she at last putting down the piece of toast there was a return to something of her usual tone in the words she spoke gently and softly no longer in the shrill hoarse voice she had used at first mr benson sat down by her now ruth we must talk a little together i want to understand what your plan was where is helmsby why did you fix to go there it is where my mother lived she answered before she was married she lived there and wherever she lived the people all loved her dearly and i thoughti think that for her sake some one would give me work i meant to tell them the truth said she dropping her eyes but still they would perhaps give me some employmenti dont care whatfor her sake i could do many things said she suddenly looking up i am sure i could weedi could in gardensif they did not like to have me in their houses but perhaps some one for my mothers sakeoh my dear dear motherdo you know where and what i am she cried out sobbing afresh mr bensons heart was very sore though he spoke authoritatively and almost sternly ruth you must be still and quiet i cannot have this i want you to listen to me your thought of helmsby would be a good one if it was right for you to leave eccleston but i do not think it is i am certain of this that it would be a great sin in you to separate yourself from leonard you have no right to sever the tie by which god has bound you together but if i am here they will all know and remember the shame of his birth and if i go away they may forget and they may not and if you go away he may be unhappy or ill and you who above all others haveand have from godremember that ruththe power to comfort him the tender patience to nurse him have left him to the care of strangers yes i know but we ourselves are as strangers dearly as we love him compared to a mother he may turn to sin and want the long forbearance the serene authority of a parent and where are you no dread of shame either for yourself or even for him can ever make it right for you to shake off your responsibility all this time he was watching her narrowly and saw her slowly yield herself up to the force of what he was saying besides ruth he continued we have gone on falsely hitherto it has been my doing my mistake my sin i ought to have known better now let us stand firm on the truth you have no new fault to repent of be brave and faithful it is to god you answer not to men the shame of having your sin known to the world should be as nothing to the shame you felt at having sinned we have dreaded men too much and god too little in the course we have taken but now be of good cheer perhaps you will have to find your work in the world very lownot quite working in the fields said he with a gentle smile to which she downcast and miserable could give no response nay perhaps ruth he went on you may have to stand and wait for some time no one may be willing to use the services you would gladly render all may turn aside from you and may speak very harshly of you can you accept all this treatment meekly as but the reasonable and just penance god has laid upon youfeeling no anger against those who slight you no impatience for the time to come and come it surely willi speak as having the word of god for what i say when he having purified you even as by fire will make a straight path for your feet my child it is christ the lord who has told us of this infinite mercy of god have you faith enough in it to be brave and bear on and do rightly in patience and in tribulation ruth had been hushed and very still until now when the pleading earnestness of his question urged her to answer yes said she i hopei believe i can be faithful for myself for i have sinned and done wrong but leonard she looked up at him but leonard he echoed ah there it is hard ruth i own the world is hard and persecuting to such as he he paused to think of the true comfort for this sting he went on the world is not everything ruth nor is the want of mens good opinion and esteem the highest need which man has teach leonard this you would not wish his life to be one summers day you dared not make it so if you had the power teach him to bid a noble christian welcome to the trials which god sendsand this is one of them teach him not to look on a life of struggle and perhaps of disappointment and incompleteness as a sad and mournful end but as the means permitted to the heroes and warriors in the army of christ by which to show their faithful following tell him of the hard and thorny path which was trodden once by the bleeding feet of one ruth think of the saviours life and cruel death and of his divine faithfulness oh ruth exclaimed he when i look and see what you may bewhat you must be to that boy i cannot think how you could be coward enough for a moment to shrink from your work but we have all been cowards hitherto he added in bitter selfaccusation god help us to be so no longer ruth sat very quiet her eyes were fixed on the ground and she seemed lost in thought at length she rose up mr benson said she standing before him and propping herself by the table as she was trembling sadly from weakness i mean to try very very hard to do my duty to leonardand to god she added reverently i am only afraid my faith may sometimes fail about leonard ask and it shall be given unto you that is no vain or untried promise ruth she sat down again unable longer to stand there was another long silence i must never go to mr bradshaws again she said at last as if thinking aloud no ruth you shall not he answered but i shall earn no money added she quickly for she thought that he did not perceive the difficulty that was troubling her you surely know ruth that while faith and i have a roof to shelter us or bread to eat you and leonard share it with us i knowi know your most tender goodness said she but it ought not to be it must be at present he said in a decided manner perhaps before long you may have some employment perhaps it may be some time before an opportunity occurs hush said ruth leonard is moving about in the parlour i must go to him but when she stood up she turned so dizzy and tottered so much that she was glad to sit down again immediately you must rest here i will go to him said mr benson he left her and when he was gone she leaned her head on the back of the chair and cried quietly and incessantly but there was a more patient hopeful resolved feeling in her heart which all along through all the tears she shed bore her onwards to higher thoughts until at last she rose to prayers mr benson caught the new look of shrinking shame in leonards eye as it first sought then shunned meeting his he was pained too by the sight of the little sorrowful anxious face on which until now hope and joy had been predominant the constrained voice the few words the boy spoke when formerly there would have been a glad and free utteranceall this grieved mr benson inexpressibly as but the beginning of an unwonted mortification which must last for years he himself made no allusion to any unusual occurrence he spoke of ruth as sitting overcome by headache in the study for quietness he hurried on the preparations for tea while leonard sat by in the great armchair and looked on with sad dreamy eyes he strove to lessen the shock which he knew leonard had received by every mixture of tenderness and cheerfulness that mr bensons gentle heart prompted and now and then a languid smile stole over the boys face when his bedtime came mr benson told him of the hour although he feared that leonard would have but another sorrowful crying of himself to sleep but he was anxious to accustom the boy to cheerful movement within the limits of domestic law and by no disobedience to it to weaken the power of glad submission to the supreme to begin the new life that lay before him where strength to look up to god as the lawgiver and ruler of events would be preeminently required when leonard had gone upstairs mr benson went immediately to ruth and said ruth leonard is just gone up to bed secure in the instinct which made her silently rise and go up to the boycertain too that they would each be the others best comforter and that god would strengthen each through the other now for the first time he had leisure to think of himself and to go over all the events of the day the halfhour of solitude in his study that he had before his sisters return was of inestimable value he had leisure to put events in their true places as to importance and eternal significance miss faith came in laden with farm produce her kind entertainers had brought her in their shandry to the opening of the court in which the chapelhouse stood but she was so heavily burdened with eggs mushrooms and plums that when her brother opened the door she was almost breathless oh thurstan take this basketit is such a weight oh sally is that you here are some magnumbonums which we must preserve tomorrow there are guineafowl eggs in that basket mr benson let her unburden her body and her mind too by giving charges to sally respecting her housekeeping treasures before he said a word but when she returned into the study to tell him the small pieces of intelligence respecting her day at the farm she stood aghast why thurstan dear whats the matter is your back hurting you he smiled to reassure her but it was a sickly and forced smile no faith i am quite well only rather out of spirits and wanting to talk to you to cheer me miss faith sat down straight sitting boltupright to listen the better i dont know how but the real story about ruth is found out oh thurstan exclaimed miss benson turning quite white for a moment neither of them said another word then she went on does mr bradshaw know yes he sent for me and told me does ruth know that it has all come out yes and leonard knows how who told him i do not know i have asked no questions but of course it was his mother she was very foolish and cruel then said miss benson her eyes blazing and her lips trembling at the thought of the suffering her darling boy must have gone through i think she was wise i am sure it was not cruel he must have soon known that there was some mystery and it was better that it should be told him openly and quietly by his mother than by a stranger how could she tell him quietly asked miss benson still indignant well perhaps i used the wrong wordof course no one was byand i dont suppose even they themselves could now tell how it was told or in what spirit it was borne miss benson was silent again was mr bradshaw very angry yes very and justly so i did very wrong in making that false statement at first no i am sure you did not said miss faith ruth has had some years of peace in which to grow stronger and wiser so that she can bear her shame now in a way she never could have done at first all the same it was wrong in me to do what i did i did it too as much or more than you and i dont think it wrong im certain it was quite right and i would do just the same again perhaps it has not done you the harm it has done me nonsense thurstan dont be morbid im sure you are as goodand better than ever you were no i am not i have got what you call morbid just in consequence of the sophistry by which i persuaded myself that wrong could be right i torment myself i have lost my clear instincts of conscience formerly if i believed that such or such an action was according to the will of god i went and did it or at least i tried to do it without thinking of consequences now i reason and weigh what will happen if i do so and soi grope where formerly i saw oh faith it is such a relief to me to have the truth known that i am afraid i have not been sufficiently sympathising with ruth poor ruth said miss benson but at any rate our telling a lie has been the saving of her there is no fear of her going wrong now gods omnipotence did not need our sin they did not speak for some time you have not told me what mr bradshaw said one cant remember the exact words that are spoken on either side in moments of such strong excitement he was very angry and said some things about me that were very just and some about ruth that were very hard his last words were that he should give up coming to chapel oh thurstan did it come to that yes does ruth know all he said no why should she i dont know if she knows he has spoken to me at all poor creature she had enough to craze her almost without that she was for going away and leaving us that we might not share in her disgrace i was afraid of her being quite delirious i did so want you faith however i did the best i could i spoke to her very coldly and almost sternly all the while my heart was bleeding for her i dared not give her sympathy i tried to give her strength but i did so want you faith and i was so full of enjoyment i am ashamed to think of it but the dawsons are so kindand the day was so fine where is ruth now with leonard he is her great earthly motivei thought that being with him would be best but he must be in bed and asleep now i will go up to her said miss faith she found ruth keeping watch by leonards troubled sleep but when she saw miss faith she rose up and threw herself on her neck and clung to her without speaking after a while miss benson said you must go to bed ruth so after she had kissed the sleeping boy miss benson led her away and helped to undress her and brought her up a cup of soothing violet teanot so soothing as tender actions and soft loving tones chapter xxviii an understanding between lovers it was well they had so early and so truly strengthened the spirit to bear for the events which had to be endured soon came thick and threefold every evening mr and miss benson thought the worst must be over and every day brought some fresh occurrence to touch upon the raw place they could not be certain until they had seen all their acquaintances what difference it would make in the cordiality of their reception in some cases it made much and miss benson was proportionably indignant she felt this change in behaviour more than her brother his great pain arose from the coolness of the bradshaws with all the faults which had at times grated on his sensitive nature but which he now forgot and remembered only their kindness they were his old familiar friendshis kind if ostentatious patronshis great personal interest out of his own family and he could not get over the suffering he experienced from seeing their large square pew empty on sundaysfrom perceiving how mr bradshaw though he bowed in a distant manner when he and mr benson met face to face shunned him as often as he possibly could all that happened in the household which once was as patent to him as his own was now a sealed book he heard of its doings by chance if he heard at all just at the time when he was feeling the most depressed from this cause he met jemima at a sudden turn of the street he was uncertain for a moment how to accost her but she saved him all doubt in an instant she had his hand in both of hers her face flushed with honest delight oh mr benson i am so glad to see you i have so wanted to know all about you how is poor ruth dear ruth i wonder if she has forgiven me my cruelty to her and i may not go to her now when i should be so glad and thankful to make up for it i never heard you had been cruel to her i am sure she does not think so she ought she must what is she doing oh i have so much to ask i can never hear enough and papa saysshe hesitated a moment afraid of giving pain and then believing that they would understand the state of affairs and the reason for her behaviour better if she told the truth she went on papa says i must not go to your housei suppose its right to obey him certainly my dear it is your clear duty we know how you feel towards us oh but if i could do any goodif i could be of any use or comfort to any of youespecially to ruth i should come duty or not i believe it would be my duty said she hurrying on to try and stop any decided prohibition from mr benson no dont be afraid i wont come till i know i can do some good i hear bits about you through sally every now and then or i could not have waited so long mr benson continued she reddening very much i think you did quite right about poor ruth not in the falsehood my dear no not perhaps in that i was not thinking of that but i have been thinking a great deal about poor ruthsyou know i could not help it when everybody was talking about itand it made me think of myself and what i am with a father and mother and home and careful friends i am not likely to be tempted like ruth but oh mr benson said she lifting her eyes which were full of tears to his face for the first time since she began to speak if you knew all i have been thinking and feeling this last year you would see how i have yielded to every temptation that was able to come to me and seeing how i have no goodness or strength in me and how i might just have been like ruth or rather worse than she ever was because i am more headstrong and passionate by nature i do so thank you and love you for what you did for her and will you tell me really and truly now if i can ever do anything for ruth if youll promise me that i wont rebel unnecessarily against papa but if you dont i will and come and see you all this very afternoon remember i trust you said she breaking away then turning back she came to ask after leonard he must know something of it said she does he feel it much very much said mr benson jemima shook her head sadly it is hard upon him said she it is mr benson replied for in truth leonard was their greatest anxiety indoors his health seemed shaken he spoke half sentences in his sleep which showed that in his dreams he was battling on his mothers behalf against an unkind and angry world and then he would wail to himself and utter sad words of shame which they never thought had reached his ears by day he was in general grave and quiet but his appetite varied and he was evidently afraid of going into the streets dreading to be pointed at as an object of remark each separately in their hearts longed to give him change of scene but they were all silent for where was the requisite money to come from his temper became fitful and variable at times he would be most sullen against his mother and then give way to a passionate remorse when mr benson caught ruths look of agony at her childs rebuffs his patience failed or rather i should say he believed that a stronger severer hand than hers was required for the management of the lad but when she heard mr benson say so she pleaded with him have patience with leonard she said i have deserved the anger that is fretting in his heart it is only i who can reinstate myself in his love and respect i have no fear when he sees me really striving hard and long to do what is right he must love me i am not afraid even while she spoke her lips quivered and her colour went and came with eager anxiety so mr benson held his peace and let her take her course it was beautiful to see the intuition by which she divined what was passing in every fold of her childs heart so as to be always ready with the right words to soothe or to strengthen him her watchfulness was unwearied and with no thought of selftainting in it or else she might have often paused to turn aside and weep at the clouds of shame which came over leonards love for her and hid it from all but her faithful heart she believed and knew that he was yet her own affectionate boy although he might be gloomily silent or apparently hard and cold and in all this mr benson could not choose but admire the way in which she was insensibly teaching leonard to conform to the law of right to recognise duty in the mode in which every action was performed when mr benson saw this he knew that all goodness would follow and that the claims which his mothers infinite love had on the boys heart would be acknowledged at last and all the more fully because she herself never urged them but silently admitted the force of the reason that caused them to be for a time forgotten byandby leonards remorse at his ungracious and sullen ways to his motherways that alternated with passionate fitful bursts of clinging loveassumed more the character of repentance he tried to do so no more but still his health was delicate he was averse to going outofdoors he was much graver and sadder than became his age it was what must be an inevitable consequence of what had been and ruth had to be patient and pray in secret and with many tears for the strength she needed she knew what it was to dread the going out into the streets after her story had become known for days and days she had silently shrunk from this effort but one evening towards dusk miss benson was busy and asked her to go an errand for her and ruth got up and silently obeyed her that silence as to inward suffering was only one part of her peculiar and exquisite sweetness of nature part of the patience with which she accepted her penance her true instincts told her that it was not right to disturb others with many expressions of her remorse that the holiest repentance consisted in a quiet and daily sacrifice still there were times when she wearied pitifully of her inaction she was so willing to serve and work and every one despised her services her mind as i have said before had been well cultivated during these last few years so now she used all the knowledge she had gained in teaching leonard which was an employment that mr benson relinquished willingly because he felt that it would give her some of the occupation that she needed she endeavoured to make herself useful in the house in every way she could but the waters of housekeeping had closed over her place during the time of her absence at mr bradshawsand besides now that they were trying to restrict every unnecessary expense it was sometimes difficult to find work for three women many and many a time ruth turned over in her mind every possible chance of obtaining employment for her leisure hours and nowhere could she find it now and then sally who was her confidante in this wish procured her some needlework but it was of a coarse and common kind soon done lightly paid for but whatever it was ruth took it and was thankful although it added but a few pence to the household purse i do not mean that there was any great need of money but a new adjustment of expenditure was requireda reduction of wants which had never been very extravagant ruths salary of forty pounds was gone while more of her keep as sally called it was thrown upon the bensons mr benson received about eighty pounds a year for his salary as minister of this he knew that twenty pounds came from mr bradshaw and when the old man appointed to collect the pewrents brought him the quarterly amount and he found no diminution in them he inquired how it was and learnt that although mr bradshaw had expressed to the collector his determination never to come to chapel again he had added that of course his pewrent should be paid all the same but this mr benson could not suffer and the old man was commissioned to return the money to mr bradshaw as being what his deserted minister could not receive mr and miss benson had about thirty or forty pounds coming in annually from a sum which in happier days mr bradshaw had invested in canal shares for them altogether their income did not fall much short of a hundred a year and they lived in the chapelhouse free of rent so ruths small earnings were but very little in actual hard commercial account though in another sense they were much and miss benson always received them with quiet simplicity by degrees mr benson absorbed some of ruths time in a gracious and natural way he employed her mind in all the kind offices he was accustomed to render to the poor around him and as much of the peace and ornament of life as they gained now was gained on a firm basis of truth if ruth began low down to find her place in the world at any rate there was no flaw in the foundation leonard was still their great anxiety at times the question seemed to be could he live through all this trial of the elasticity of childhood and then they knew how precious a blessinghow true a pillar of fire he was to his mother and how black the night and how dreary the wilderness would be when he was not the child and the mother were each messengers of godangels to each other they had long gaps between the pieces of intelligence respecting the bradshaws mr bradshaw had at length purchased the house at abermouth and they were much there the way in which the bensons heard most frequently of the family of their former friends was through mr farquhar he called on mr benson about a month after the latter had met jemima in the street mr farquhar was not in the habit of paying calls on any one and though he had always entertained and evinced the most kind and friendly feeling towards mr benson he had rarely been in the chapelhouse mr benson received him courteously but he rather expected that there would be some especial reason alleged before the conclusion of the visit for its occurrence more particularly as mr farquhar sat talking on the topics of the day in a somewhat absent manner as if they were not the subjects most present to his mind the truth was he could not help recurring to the last time when he was in that room waiting to take leonard a ride and his heart beating rather more quickly than usual at the idea that ruth might bring the boy in when he was equipped he was very full now of the remembrance of ruth and yet he was also most thankful most selfgratulatory that he had gone no further in his admiration of herthat he had never expressed his regard in wordsthat no one as he believed was cognisant of the incipient love which had grown partly out of his admiration and partly out of his reason he was thankful to be spared any implication in the ninedays wonder which her story had made in eccleston and yet his feeling for her had been of so strong a character that he winced as with extreme pain at every application of censure to her name these censures were often exaggerated it is true but when they were just in their judgment of the outward circumstances of the case they were not the less painful and distressing to him his first rebound to jemima was occasioned by mrs bradshaws account of how severely her husband was displeased at her daughters having taken part with ruth and he could have thanked and almost blessed jemima when she dropped in she dared do no more her pleading excuses and charitable explanations on ruths behalf jemima had learnt some humility from the discovery which had been to her so great a shock standing she had learnt to take heed lest she fell and when she had once been aroused to a perception of the violence of the hatred which she had indulged against ruth she was more reticent and measured in the expression of all her opinions it showed how much her character had been purified from pride that now she felt aware that what in her was again attracting mr farquhar was her faithful advocacy of her rival wherever such advocacy was wise or practicable he was quite unaware that jemima had been conscious of his great admiration for ruth he did not know that she had ever cared enough for him to be jealous but the unacknowledged bond between them now was their grief and sympathy and pity for ruth only in jemima these feelings were ardent and would fain have become active while in mr farquhar they were strongly mingled with thankfulness that he had escaped a disagreeable position and a painful notoriety his natural caution induced him to make a resolution never to think of any woman as a wife until he had ascertained all her antecedents from her birth upwards and the same spirit of caution directed inwardly made him afraid of giving too much pity to ruth for fear of the conclusions to which such a feeling might lead him but still his old regard for her for leonard and his esteem and respect for the bensons induced him to lend a willing ear to jemimas earnest entreaty that he would go and call on mr benson in order that she might learn something about the family in general and ruth in particular it was thus that he came to sit by mr bensons study fire and to talk in an absent way to that gentleman how they got on the subject he did not know more than onehalf of his attention being distracted but they were speaking about politics when mr farquhar learned that mr benson took in no newspaper will you allow me to send you over my times i have generally done with it before twelve oclock and after that it is really wastepaper in my house you will oblige me by making use of it i am sure i am very much obliged to you for thinking of it but do not trouble yourself to send it leonard can fetch it how is leonard now asked mr farquhar and he tried to speak indifferently but a grave look of intelligence clouded his eyes as he looked for mr bensons answer i have not met him lately no said mr benson with an expression of pain in his countenance though he too strove to speak in his usual tone leonard is not strong and we find it difficult to induce him to go much outofdoors there was a little silence for a minute or two during which mr farquhar had to check an unbidden sigh but suddenly rousing himself into a determination to change the subject he said you will find rather a lengthened account of the exposure of sir thomas campbells conduct at baden he seems to be a complete blackleg in spite of his baronetcy i fancy the papers are glad to get hold of anything just now who is sir thomas campbell asked mr benson oh i thought you might have heard the reporta true one i believeof mr donnes engagement to his daughter he must be glad she jilted him now i fancy after this public exposure of her fathers conduct that was an awkward speech as mr farquhar felt and he hastened to cover it by going on without much connexion dick bradshaw is my informant about all these projected marriages in high lifethey are not much in my way but since he has come down from london to take his share in the business i think i have heard more of the news and the scandal of what i suppose would be considered high life than ever i did before and mr donnes proceedings seem to be an especial object of interest to him and mr donne is engaged to a miss campbell is he was engaged if i understood right she broke off the engagement to marry some russian prince or othera better match dick bradshaw told me i assure you continued mr farquhar smiling i am a very passive recipient of all such intelligence and might very probably have forgotten all about it if the times of this morning had not been so full of the disgrace of the young ladys father richard bradshaw has quite left london has he asked mr benson who felt far more interest in his old patrons family than in all the campbells that ever were or ever would be yes he has come to settle down here i hope he may do well and not disappoint his father who has formed very high expectations from him i am not sure if they are not too high for any young man to realise mr farquhar could have said more but dick bradshaw was jemimas brother and an object of anxiety to her i am sure i trust such a mortificationsuch a grief as any disappointment in richard may not befall his father replied mr benson jemimamiss bradshaw said mr farquhar hesitating was most anxious to hear of you all i hope i may tell her you are all well with an emphasis on all that thank you thank her for us we are all well all except leonard who is not strong as i said before but we must be patient time and such devoted tender love as he has from his mother must do much mr farquhar was silent send him to my house for the papers it will be a little necessity for him to have some regular exercise and to face the world he must do it sooner or later the two gentlemen shook hands with each other on parting but no further allusion was made to either ruth or leonard so leonard went for the papers stealing along by back streetsrunning with his head bent downhis little heart panting with dread of being pointed out as his mothers childso he used to come back and run trembling to sally who would hush him up to her breast with many a roughspoken word of pity and sympathy mr farquhar tried to catch him to speak to him and tame him as it were and byandby he contrived to interest him sufficiently to induce the boy to stay a little while in the house or stables or garden but the race through the streets was always to be dreaded as the end of ever so pleasant a visit mr farquhar kept up the intercourse with the bensons which he had thus begun he persevered in paying callsquiet visits where not much was said political or local news talked about and the same inquiries always made and answered as to the welfare of the two families who were estranged from each other mr farquhars reports were so little varied that jemima grew anxious to know more particulars oh mr farquhar said she do you think they tell you the truth i wonder what ruth can be doing to support herself and leonard nothing that you can hear of you say and of course one must not ask the downright question and yet i am sure they must be pinched in some way do you think leonard is stronger i am not sure he is growing fast and such a blow as he has had will be certain to make him more thoughtful and full of care than most boys of his age both these circumstances may make him thin and pale which he certainly is oh how i wish i might go and see them all i could tell in a twinkling the real state of things she spoke with a tinge of her old impatience i will go again and pay particular attention to anything you wish me to observe you see of course i feel a delicacy about asking any direct questions or even alluding in any way to these late occurrences and you never see ruth by any chance never they did not look at each other while this last question was asked and answered i will take the paper tomorrow myself it will be an excuse for calling again and i will try to be very penetrating but i have not much hope of success oh thank you it is giving you a great deal of trouble but you are very kind kind jemima he repeated in a tone which made her go very red and hot must i tell you how you can reward mewill you call me waltersay thank you walterjust for once jemima felt herself yielding to the voice and tone in which this was spoken but her very consciousness of the depth of her love made her afraid of giving way and anxious to be wooed that she might be reinstated in her selfesteem no said she i dont think i can call you so you are too old it would not be respectful she meant it half in joke and had no idea he would take the allusion to his age so seriously as he did he rose up and coldly as a matter of form in a changed voice wished her goodbye her heart sank yet the old pride was there but as he was at the very door some sudden impulse made her speak i have not vexed you have i walter he turned round glowing with a thrill of delight she was as red as any rose her looks dropped down to the ground they were not raised when half an hour afterwards she said you wont forbid my going to see ruth will you because if you do i give you notice i shall disobey you the arm around her waist clasped her yet more fondly at the idea suggested by this speech of the control which he should have a right to exercise over her actions at some future day tell me said he how much of your goodness to me this last happy hour has been owing to the desire of having more freedom as a wife than as a daughter she was almost glad that he should think she needed any additional motive to her love for him before she could have accepted him she was afraid that she had betrayed the deep passionate regard with which she had long looked upon him she was lost in delight at her own happiness she was silent for a time at length she said i dont think you know how faithful i have been to you ever since the days when you first brought me pistachiocandy from londonwhen i was quite a little girl not more faithful than i have been to you for in truth the recollection of his love for ruth had utterly faded away and he thought himself a model of constancy and you have tried me pretty well what a vixen you have been jemima sighed smitten with the consciousness of how little she had deserved her present happiness humble with the recollection of the evil thoughts that had raged in her heart during the time which she remembered well though he might have forgotten it when ruth had had the affection which her jealous rival coveted i may speak to your father may not i jemima no for some reason or fancy which she could not define and could not be persuaded out of she wished to keep their mutual understanding a secret she had a natural desire to avoid the congratulations she expected from her family she dreaded her fathers consideration of the whole affair as a satisfactory disposal of his daughter to a worthy man who being his partner would not require any abstraction of capital from the concern and richards more noisy delight at his sisters having hooked so good a match it was only her simplehearted mother that she longed to tell she knew that her mothers congratulations would not jar upon her though they might not sound the full organpeal of her love but all that her mother knew passed onwards to her father so for the present at any rate she determined to realise her secret position alone somehow the sympathy of all others that she most longed for was ruths but the first communication of such an event was due to her parents she imposed very strict regulations on mr farquhars behaviour and quarrelled and differed from him more than ever but with a secret joyful understanding with him in her heart even while they disagreed with each otherfor similarity of opinion is not alwaysi think not oftenneeded for fulness and perfection of love after ruths detection as mr bradshaw used to call it he said he could never trust another governess again so mary and elizabeth had been sent to school the following christmas and their place in the family was but poorly supplied by the return of mr richard bradshaw who had left london and been received as a partner chapter xxix sally takes her money out of the bank the conversation narrated in the last chapter as taking place between mr farquhar and jemima occurred about a year after ruths dismissal from her situation that year full of small events and change of place to the bradshaws had been monotonous and long in its course to the other household there had been no want of peace and tranquillity there had perhaps been more of them than in the preceding years when though unacknowledged by any all must have occasionally felt the oppression of the falsehoodand a slight glancing dread must have flashed across their most prosperous state lest somehow or another the mystery should be disclosed but now as the shepherdboy in john bunyan sweetly sang he that is low need fear no fall still their peace was as the stillness of a grey autumnal day when no sun is to be seen above and when a quiet film seems drawn before both sky and earth as if to rest the wearied eyes after the summers glare few events broke the monotony of their lives and those events were of a depressing kind they consisted in ruths futile endeavours to obtain some employment however humble in leonards fluctuations of spirits and health in sallys increasing deafness in the final and unmendable wearingout of the parlour carpet which there was no spare money to replace and so they cheerfully supplied its want by a large hearthrug that ruth made out of ends of list and what was more a subject of unceasing regret to mr benson than all the defection of some of the members of his congregation who followed mr bradshaws lead their places to be sure were more than filled up by the poor who thronged to his chapel but still it was a disappointment to find that people about whom he had been earnestly thinkingto whom he had laboured to do goodshould dissolve the connexion without a word of farewell or explanation mr benson did not wonder that they should go nay he even felt it right that they should seek that spiritual help from another which he by his error had forfeited his power to offer he only wished they had spoken of their intention to him in an open and manly way but not the less did he labour on among those to whom god permitted him to be of use he felt age stealing upon him apace although he said nothing about it and no one seemed to be aware of it and he worked the more diligently while it was yet day it was not the number of his years that made him feel old for he was only sixty and many men are hale and strong at that time of life in all probability it was that early injury to his spine which affected the constitution of his mind as well as his body and predisposed him in the opinion of some at least to a feminine morbidness of conscience he had shaken off somewhat of this since the affair with mr bradshaw he was simpler and more dignified than he had been for several years before during which time he had been anxious and uncertain in his manner and more given to thought than to action the one happy bright spot in this grey year was owing to sally as she said of herself she believed she grew more nattered as she grew older but that she was conscious of her natteredness was a new thing and a great gain to the comfort of the house for it made her very grateful for forbearance and more aware of kindness than she had ever been before she had become very deaf yet she was uneasy and jealous if she were not informed of all the family thoughts plans and proceedings which often had however private in their details to be shouted to her at the full pitch of the voice but she always heard leonard perfectly his clear and belllike voice which was similar to his mothers till sorrow had taken the ring out of it was sure to be heard by the old servant though every one else had failed sometimes however she got her hearing sudden as she phrased it and was alive to every word and noise more particularly when they did not want her to hear and at such times she resented their continuance of the habit of speaking loud as a mortal offence one day her indignation at being thought deaf called out one of the rare smiles on leonards face she saw it and said bless thee lad if it but amuses thee they may shout through a rams horn to me and ill never let on im not deaf its as good a use as i can be of she continued to herself if i can make that poor lad smile a bit if she expected to be everybodys confidante she made leonard hers there said she when she came home from her marketing one saturday night look here lad heres fortytwo pound seven shillings and twopence its a mint of money isnt it i took it all in sovereigns for fear of fire what is it all for sally said he aye lad thats asking its mr bensons money said she mysteriously that ive been keeping for him is he in the study think ye yes i think so where have you been keeping it never you mind she went towards the study but thinking she might have been hard on her darling in refusing to gratify his curiosity she turned back and said i sayif thou wilt thou mayst do me a job of work some day im wanting a frame made for a piece of writing and then she returned to go into the study carrying her sovereigns in her apron here master thurstan said she pouring them out on the table before her astonished master take it its all yours all mine what can you mean asked he bewildered she did not hear him and went on lock it up safe out o the way dunnot go and leave it about to tempt folks ill not answer for myself if moneys left about i may be cribbing a sovereign but where does it come from said he come from she replied where does all money come from but the bank to be sure i thought any one could tell that i have no money in the bank said he more and more perplexed no i knowed that but i had dunnot ye remember how you would raise my wage last martinmas eighteen year you and faith were very headstrong but i was too deep for you see thee i went and put it i th bank i was never going to touch it and if i had died it would have been all right for id a will made all regular and tightmade by a lawyer leastways he would have been a lawyer if he hadnt got transported first and now thinks i i think ill just go and get it out and give it em banks is not always safe ill take care of it for you with the greatest pleasure still you know banks allow interest dye suppose i dont know all about interest and compound interest too by this time i tell ye i want ye to spend it its your own its not mine it always was yours now youre not going to fret me by saying you think it mine mr benson held out his hand to her for he could not speak she bent forward to him as he sat there and kissed him eh bless ye lad its the first kiss ive had of ye sin ye were a little lad and its a great refreshment now dont you and faith go and bother me with talking about it its just yours and make no more ado she went back into the kitchen and brought out her will and gave leonard directions how to make a frame for it for the boy was a very tolerable joiner and had a box of tools which mr bradshaw had given him some years ago its a pity to lose such fine writing said she though i cant say as i can read it perhaps youd just read it for me leonard she sat openmouthed with admiration at all the long words the frame was made and the will hung up opposite to her bed unknown to any one but leonard and by dint of his repeated reading it over to her she learnt all the words except testatrix which she would always call testy tricks mr benson had been too much gratified and touched by her unconditional gift of all she had in the world to reject it but he only held it in his hands as a deposit until he could find a safe investment befitting so small a sum the little rearrangements of the household expenditure had not touched him as they had done the women he was aware that meat dinners were not now everyday occurrences but he preferred puddings and vegetables and was glad of the exchange he observed too that they all sat together in the kitchen in the evenings but the kitchen with the wellscoured dresser the shining saucepans the wellblacked grate and whitened hearth and the warmth which seemed to rise up from the very flags and ruddily cheer the most distant corners appeared a very cozy and charming sittingroom and besides it appeared but right that sally in her old age should have the companionship of those with whom she had lived in love and faithfulness for so many years he only wished he could more frequently leave the solitary comfort of his study and join the kitchen party where sally sat as mistress in the chimneycorner knitting by firelight and miss benson and ruth with the candle between them stitched away at their work while leonard strewed the ample dresser with his slate and books he did not mope and pine over his lessons they were the one thing that took him out of himself as yet his mother could teach him though in some respects it was becoming a strain upon her acquirements and powers mr benson saw this but reserved his offers of help as long as he could hoping that before his assistance became absolutely necessary some mode of employment beyond that of occasional plainwork might be laid open to ruth in spite of the communication they occasionally had with mr farquhar when he gave them the intelligence of his engagement to jemima it seemed like a glimpse into a world from which they were shut out they wonderedmiss benson and ruth did at leastmuch about the details ruth sat over her sewing fancying how all had taken place and as soon as she had arranged the events which were going on among people and places once so familiar to her she found some discrepancy and setto afresh to picture the declaration of love and the yielding blushing acceptance for mr farquhar had told little beyond the mere fact that there was an engagement between himself and jemima which had existed for some time but which had been kept secret until now when it was acknowledged sanctioned and to be fulfilled as soon as he returned from an arrangement of family affairs in scotland this intelligence had been enough for mr benson who was the only person mr farquhar saw as ruth always shrank from the post of opening the door and mr benson was apt at recognising individual knocks and always prompt to welcome mr farquhar miss benson occasionally thoughtand what she thought she was in the habit of sayingthat jemima might have come herself to announce such an event to old friends but mr benson decidedly vindicated her from any charge of neglect by expressing his strong conviction that to her they owed mr farquhars callshis all but outspoken offers of servicehis quiet steady interest in leonard and moreover repeating the conversation he had had with her in the street the first time they met after the disclosure mr benson told his sister how glad he was to find that with all the warmth of her impetuous disposition hurrying her on to rebellion against her father she was now attaining to that just selfcontrol which can distinguish between mere wishes and true reasonsthat she could abstain from coming to see ruth while she could do but little good reserving herself for some great occasion or strong emergency ruth said nothing but she yearned all the more in silence to see jemima in her recollection of that fearful interview with mr bradshaw which haunted her yet sleeping or waking she was painfully conscious that she had not thanked jemima for her generous loving advocacy it had passed unregarded at the time in intensity of agonybut now she recollected that by no word or tone or touch had she given any sign of gratitude mr benson had never told her of his meeting with jemima so it seemed as if there were no hope of any future opportunity for it is strange how two households rent apart by some dissension can go through life their parallel existences running side by side yet never touching each other near neighbours as they are habitual and familiar guests as they may have been ruths only point of hope was leonard she was weary of looking for work and employment which everywhere seemed held above her reach she was not impatient of this but she was very very sorry she felt within her such capability and all ignored her and passed her by on the other side but she saw some progress in leonard not that he could continue to have the happy development and genial ripening which other boys have leaping from childhood to boyhood and thence to youth with glad bounds and unconsciously enjoying every age at present there was no harmony in leonards character he was as full of thought and selfconsciousness as many men planning his actions long beforehand so as to avoid what he dreaded and what she could not yet give him strength to face coward as she was herself and shrinking from hard remarks yet leonard was regaining some of his lost tenderness towards his mother when they were alone he would throw himself on her neck and smother her with kisses without any apparent cause for such a passionate impulse if any one was by his manner was cold and reserved the hopeful parts of his character were the determination evident in him to be a law unto himself and the serious thought which he gave to the formation of this law there was an inclination in him to reason especially and principally with mr benson on the great questions of ethics which the majority of the world have settled long ago but i do not think he ever so argued with his mother her lovely patience and her humility was earning its reward and from her quiet piety bearing sweetly the denial of her wishesthe refusal of her beggingthe disgrace in which she lay while others less worthy were employedthis which perplexed him and almost angered him at first called out his reverence at last and what she said he took for his law with proud humility and thus softly she was leading him up to god his health was not strong it was not likely to be he moaned and talked in his sleep and his appetite was still variable part of which might be owing to his preference of the hardest lessons to any outdoor exercise but this last unnatural symptom was vanishing before the assiduous kindness of mr farquhar and the quiet but firm desire of his mother next to ruth sally had perhaps the most influence over him but he dearly loved both mr and miss benson although he was reserved on this as on every point not purely intellectual his was a hard childhood and his mother felt that it was so children bear any moderate degree of poverty and privation cheerfully but in addition to a good deal of this leonard had to bear a sense of disgrace attaching to him and to the creature he loved best this it was that took out of him the buoyancy and natural gladness of youth in a way which no scantiness of food or clothing or want of any outward comfort could ever have done two years had passed awaytwo long eventless years something was now going to happen which touched their hearts very nearly though out of their sight and hearing jemima was going to be married this august and byandby the very day was fixed it was to be on the th on the evening of the th ruth was sitting alone in the parlour idly gazing out on the darkening shadows in the little garden her eyes kept filling with quiet tears that rose not for her own isolation from all that was going on of bustle and preparation for the morrows event but because she had seen how miss benson had felt that she and her brother were left out from the gathering of old friends in the bradshaw family as ruth sat suddenly she was aware of a figure by her she started up and in the gloom of the apartment she recognised jemima in an instant they were in each others armsa long fast embrace can you forgive me whispered jemima in ruths ear forgive you what do you mean what have i to forgive the question is can i ever thank you as i long to do if i could find words oh ruth how i hated you once it was all the more noble in you to stand by me as you did you must have hated me when you knew how i was deceiving you all no that was not it that made me hate you it was before that oh ruth i did hate you they were silent for some time still holding each others hands ruth spoke first and you are going to be married tomorrow yes said jemima tomorrow at nine oclock but i dont think i could have been married without coming to wish mr benson and miss faith goodbye i will go for them said ruth no not just yet i want to ask you one or two questions first nothing very particular only it seems as if there had been such a strange long separation between us ruth said she dropping her voice is leonard stronger than he was i was so sorry to hear about him from walter but he is better asked she anxiously yes he is better not what a boy of his age should be replied his mother in a tone of quiet but deep mournfulness oh jemima continued she my sharpest punishment comes through him to think what he might have been and what he is but walter says he is both stronger in health and not sonervous and shy jemima added the last words in a hesitating and doubtful manner as if she did not know how to express her full meaning without hurting ruth he does not show that he feels his disgrace so much i cannot talk about it jemima my heart aches so about him but he is better she continued feeling that jemimas kind anxiety required an answer at any cost of pain to herself he is only studying too closely now he takes to his lessons evidently as a relief from thought he is very clever and i hope and trust yet i tremble to say it i believe he is very good you must let him come and see us very often when we come back we shall be two months away we are going to germany partly on walters business ruth i have been talking to papa tonight very seriously and quietly and it has made me love him so much more and understand him so much better does he know of your coming here i hope he does said ruth yes not that he liked my doing it at all but somehow i can always do things against a persons wishes more easily when i am on good terms with themthats not exactly what i meant but now tonight after papa had been showing me that he really loved me more than i ever thought he had done for i always fancied he was so absorbed in dick he did not care much for us girls i felt brave enough to say that i intended to come here and bid you all goodbye he was silent for a minute and then said i might do it but i must remember he did not approve of it and was not to be compromised by my coming still i can tell that at the bottom of his heart there is some of the old kindly feeling to mr and miss benson and i dont despair of its all being made up though perhaps i ought to say that mamma does mr and miss benson wont hear of my going away said ruth sadly they are quite right but i am earning nothing i cannot get any employment i am only a burden and an expense are you not also a pleasure and leonard is he not a dear object of love it is easy for me to talk i know who am so impatient oh i never deserved to be so happy as i am you dont know how good walter is i used to think him so cold and cautious but now ruth will you tell mr and miss benson that i am here there is signing of papers and i dont know what to be done at home and when i come back i hope to see you often if youll let me mr and miss benson gave her a warm greeting sally was called in and would bring a candle with her to have a close inspection of her in order to see if she was changedshe had not seen her for so long a time she said and jemima stood laughing and blushing in the middle of the room while sally studied her all over and would not be convinced that the old gown which she was wearing for the last time was not one of the new wedding ones the consequence of which misunderstanding was that sally in her short petticoats and bedgown turned up her nose at the oldfashioned way in which miss bradshaws gown was made but jemima knew the old woman and rather enjoyed the contempt for her dress at last she kissed them all and ran away to her impatient mr farquhar who was awaiting her not many weeks after this the poor old woman whom i have named as having become a friend of ruths during leonards illness three years ago fell down and broke her hipbone it was a seriousprobably a fatal injury for one so old and as soon as ruth heard of it she devoted all her leisure time to old ann fleming leonard had now outstript his mothers powers of teaching and mr benson gave him his lessons so ruth was a great deal at the cottage both night and day there jemima found her one november evening the second after their return from their prolonged stay on the continent she and mr farquhar had been to the bensons and had sat there some time and now jemima had come on just to see ruth for five minutes before the evening was too dark for her to return alone she found ruth sitting on a stool before the fire which was composed of a few sticks on the hearth the blaze they gave was however enough to enable her to read and she was deep in study of the bible in which she had read aloud to the poor old woman until the latter had fallen asleep jemima beckoned her out and they stood on the green just before the open door so that ruth could see if ann awoke i have not many minutes to stay only i felt as if i must see you and we want leonard to come to us to see all our german purchases and hear all our german adventures may he come tomorrow yes thank you oh jemima i have heard somethingi have got a plan that makes me so happy i have not told any one yet but mr wynne the parish doctor you know has asked me if i would go out as a sick nursehe thinks he could find me employment you a sick nurse said jemima involuntarily glancing over the beautiful lithe figure and the lovely refinement of ruths face as the light of the rising moon fell upon it my dear ruth i dont think you are fitted for it dont you said ruth a little disappointed i think i am at least that i should be very soon i like being about sick and helpless people i always feel so sorry for them and then i think i have the gift of a very delicate touch which is such a comfort in many cases and i should try to be very watchful and patient mr wynne proposed it himself it was not in that way i meant you were not fitted for it i meant that you were fitted for something better why ruth you are better educated than i am but if nobody will allow me to teachfor that is what i suppose you mean besides i feel as if all my education would be needed to make me a good sick nurse your knowledge of latin for instance said jemima hitting in her vexation at the plan on the first acquirement of ruth she could think of well said ruth that wont come amiss i can read the prescriptions which the doctors would rather you did not do still you cant say that any knowledge of any kind will be in my way or will unfit me for my work perhaps not but all your taste and refinement will be in your way and will unfit you you have not thought about this so much as i have or you would not say so any fastidiousness i shall have to get rid of and i shall be better without but any true refinement i am sure i shall find of use for dont you think that every power we have may be made to help us in any right work whatever that is would you not rather be nursed by a person who spoke gently and moved quietly about than by a loud bustling woman yes to be sure but a person unfit for anything else may move quietly and speak gently and give medicine when the doctor orders it and keep awake at night and those are the best qualities i ever heard of in a sick nurse ruth was quite silent for some time at last she said at any rate it is work and as such i am thankful for it you cannot discourage meand perhaps you know too little of what my life has beenhow set apart in idleness i have beento sympathise with me fully and i wanted you to come to see usme in my new home walter and i had planned that we would persuade you to come to us very often she had planned and mr farquhar had consented and now you will have to be fastened up in a sickroom i could not have come said ruth quickly dear jemima it is like you to have thought of itbut i could not come to your house it is not a thing to reason about it is just feeling but i do feel as if i could not go dear jemima if you are ill or sorrowful and want me i will come so you would and must to any one if you take up that calling but i should come to you love in quite a different way i should go to you with my heart full of loveso full that i am afraid i should be too anxious i almost wish i were ill that i might make you come at once and i am almost ashamed to think how i should like you to be in some position in which i could show you how well i remember that daythat terrible day in the schoolroom god bless you for it jemima chapter xxx the forged deed mr wynne the parish surgeon was right he could and did obtain employment for ruth as a sick nurse her home was with the bensons every spare moment was given to leonard and to them but she was at the call of all the invalids in the town at first her work lay exclusively among the paupers at first too there was a recoil from many circumstances which impressed upon her the most fully the physical sufferings of those whom she tended but she tried to lose the sense of theseor rather to lessen them and make them take their appointed placesin thinking of the individuals themselves as separate from their decaying frames and all along she had enough selfcommand to control herself from expressing any sign of repugnance she allowed herself no nervous haste of movement or touch that should hurt the feelings of the poorest most friendless creature who ever lay a victim to disease there was no rough getting over of all the disagreeable and painful work of her employment when it was a lessening of pain to have the touch careful and delicate and the ministration performed with gradual skill ruth thought of her charge and not of herself as she had foretold she found a use for all her powers the poor patients themselves were unconsciously gratified and soothed by her harmony and refinement of manner voice and gesture if this harmony and refinement had been merely superficial it would not have had this balmy effect that arose from its being the true expression of a kind modest and humble spirit by degrees her reputation as a nurse spread upwards and many sought her good offices who could well afford to pay for them whatever remuneration was offered to her she took it simply and without comment for she felt that it was not hers to refuse that it was in fact owing to the bensons for her and her childs subsistence she went wherever her services were first called for if the poor bricklayer who broke both his legs in a fall from the scaffolding sent for her when she was disengaged she went and remained with him until he could spare her let who would be the next claimant from the happy and prosperous in all but health she would occasionally beg off when some one less happy and more friendless wished for her and sometimes she would ask for a little money from mr benson to give to such in their time of need but it was astonishing how much she was able to do without money her ways were very quiet she never spoke much any one who has been oppressed with the weight of a vital secret for years and much more any one the character of whose life has been stamped by one event and that producing sorrow and shame is naturally reserved and yet ruths silence was not like reserve it was too gentle and tender for that it had more the effect of a hush of all loud or disturbing emotions and out of the deep calm the words that came forth had a beautiful power she did not talk much about religion but those who noticed her knew that it was the unseen banner which she was following the lowbreathed sentences which she spoke into the ear of the sufferer and the dying carried them upwards to god she gradually became known and respected among the roughest boys of the rough populace of the town they would make way for her when she passed along the streets with more deference than they used to most for all knew something of the tender care with which she had attended this or that sick person and besides she was so often in connexion with death that something of the superstitious awe with which the dead were regarded by those rough boys in the midst of their strong life surrounded her she herself did not feel changed she felt just as faultyas far from being what she wanted to be as ever she best knew how many of her good actions were incomplete and marred with evil she did not feel much changed from the earliest ruth she could remember everything seemed to change but herself mr and miss benson grew old and sally grew deaf and leonard was shooting up and jemima was a mother she and the distant hills that she saw from her chamber window seemed the only things which were the same as when she first came to eccleston as she sat looking out and taking her fill of solitude which sometimes was her most thorough restas she sat at the attic window looking abroadshe saw their nextdoor neighbour carried out to sun himself in his garden when she first came to eccleston this neighbour and his daughter were often seen taking long and regular walks byandby his walks became shorter and the attentive daughter would convoy him home and set out afresh to finish her own of late years he had only gone out in the garden behind his house but at first he had walked pretty briskly there by his daughters helpnow he was carried and placed in a large cushioned easychair his head remaining where it was placed against the pillow and hardly moving when his kind daughter who was now middleaged brought him the first roses of the summer this told ruth of the lapse of life and time mr and mrs farquhar were constant in their attentions but there was no sign of mr bradshaw ever forgiving the imposition which had been practised upon him and mr benson ceased to hope for any renewal of their intercourse still he thought that he must know of all the kind attentions which jemima paid to them and of the fond regard which both she and her husband bestowed on leonard this latter feeling even went so far that mr farquhar called one day and with much diffidence begged mr benson to urge ruth to let him be sent to school at his mr farquhars expense mr benson was taken by surprise and hesitated i do not know it would be a great advantage in some respects and yet i doubt whether it would in others his mothers influence over him is thoroughly good and i should fear that any thoughtless allusions to his peculiar position might touch the raw spot in his mind but he is so unusually clever it seems a shame not to give him all the advantages he can have besides does he see much of his mother now hardly a day passes without her coming home to be an hour or so with him even at her busiest times she says it is her best refreshment and often you know she is disengaged for a week or two except the occasional services which she is always rendering to those who need her your offer is very tempting but there is so decidedly another view of the question to be considered that i believe we must refer it to her with all my heart dont hurry her to a decision let her weigh it well i think she will find the advantages preponderate i wonder if i might trouble you with a little business mr farquhar as you are here certainly i am only too glad to be of any use to you why i see from the report of the star life assurance company in the times which you are so good as to send me that they have declared a bonus on the shares now it seems strange that i have received no notification of it and i thought that perhaps it might be lying at your office as mr bradshaw was the purchaser of the shares and i have always received the dividends through your firm mr farquhar took the newspaper and ran his eye over the report ive no doubt thats the way of it said he some of our clerks have been careless about it or it may be richard himself he is not always the most punctual and exact of mortals but ill see about it perhaps after all it maynt come for a day or two they have always such numbers of these circulars to send out oh im in no hurry about it i only want to receive it some time before i incur any expenses which the promise of this bonus may tempt me to indulge in mr farquhar took his leave that evening there was a long conference for as it happened ruth was at home she was strenuously against the school plan she could see no advantages that would counterbalance the evil which she dreaded from any school for leonard namely that the good opinion and regard of the world would assume too high an importance in his eyes the very idea seemed to produce in her so much shrinking affright that by mutual consent the subject was dropped to be taken up again or not according to circumstances mr farquhar wrote the next morning on mr bensons behalf to the insurance company to inquire about the bonus although he wrote in the usual formal way he did not think it necessary to tell mr bradshaw what he had done for mr bensons name was rarely mentioned between the partners each had been made fully aware of the views which the other entertained on the subject that had caused the estrangement and mr farquhar felt that no external argument could affect mr bradshaws resolved disapproval and avoidance of his former minister as it happened the answer from the insurance company directed to the firm was given to mr bradshaw along with the other business letters it was to the effect that mr bensons shares had been sold and transferred above a twelvemonth ago which sufficiently accounted for the circumstance that no notification of the bonus had been sent to him mr bradshaw tossed the letter on one side not displeased to have a good reason for feeling a little contempt at the unbusinesslike forgetfulness of mr benson at whose instance some one had evidently been writing to the insurance company on mr farquhars entrance he expressed this feeling to him really he said these dissenting ministers have no more notion of exactitude in their affairs than a child the idea of forgetting that he has sold his shares and applying for the bonus when it seems he has transferred them only a year ago mr farquhar was reading the letter while mr bradshaw spoke i dont quite understand it said he mr benson was quite clear about it he could not have received his halfyearly dividends unless he had been possessed of these shares and i dont suppose dissenting ministers with all their ignorance of business are unlike other men in knowing whether or not they receive the money that they believe to be owing to them i should not wonder if they wereif benson was at any rate why i never knew his watch to be right in all my lifeit was always too fast or too slow it must have been a daily discomfort to him it ought to have been depend upon it his money matters are just in the same irregular state no accounts kept ill be bound i dont see that that follows said mr farquhar half amused that watch of his is a very curious onebelonged to his father and grandfather i dont know how far back and the sentimental feelings which he is guided by prompt him to keep it to the inconvenience of himself and every one else mr farquhar gave up the subject of the watch as hopeless but about this letter i wrote at mr bensons desire to the insurance office and i am not satisfied with this answer all the transaction has passed through our hands i do not think it is likely mr benson would write and sell the shares without at any rate informing us at the time even though he forgot all about it afterwards probably he told richard or mr watson we can ask mr watson at once i am afraid we must wait till richard comes home for i dont know where a letter would catch him mr bradshaw pulled the bell that rang into the headclerks room saying as he did so you may depend upon it farquhar the blunder lies with benson himself he is just the man to muddle away his money in indiscriminate charity and then to wonder what has become of it mr farquhar was discreet enough to hold his tongue mr watson said mr bradshaw as the old clerk made his appearance here is some mistake about those insurance shares we purchased for benson ten or a dozen years ago he spoke to mr farquhar about some bonus they are paying to the shareholders it seems and in reply to mr farquhars letter the insurance company say the shares were sold twelve months since have you any knowledge of the transaction has the transfer passed through your hands by the way turning to mr farquhar who kept the certificates did benson or we i really dont know said mr farquhar perhaps mr watson can tell us mr watson meanwhile was studying the letter when he had ended it he took off his spectacles wiped them and replacing them he read it again it seems very strange sir he said at length with his trembling aged voice for i paid mr benson the account of the dividends myself last june and got a receipt in form and that is since the date of the alleged transfer pretty nearly twelve months after it took place said mr farquhar how did you receive the dividends an order on the bank along with old mrs cranmers asked mr bradshaw sharply i dont know how they came mr richard gave me the money and desired me to get the receipt its unlucky richard is from home said mr bradshaw he could have cleared up this mystery for us mr farquhar was silent do you know where the certificates were kept mr watson said he ill not be sure but i think they were with mrs cranmers papers and deeds in box a i wish old cranmer would have made any other man his executor she too is always coming with some unreasonable request or other mr bensons inquiry about his bonus is perfectly reasonable at any rate mr watson who was dwelling in the slow fashion of age on what had been said before now spoke ill not be sure but i am almost certain mr benson said when i paid him last june that he thought he ought to give the receipt on a stamp and had spoken about it to mr richard the time before but that mr richard said it was of no consequence yes continued he gathering up his memory as he went on he didi remember nowand i thought to myself that mr richard was but a young man mr richard will know all about it yes said mr farquhar gravely i shant wait till richards return said mr bradshaw we can soon see if the certificates are in the box watson points out if they are there the insurance people are no more fit to manage their concern than that cat and i shall tell them so if they are not there as i suspect will prove to be the case it is just forgetfulness on bensons part as i have said from the first you forget the payment of the dividends said mr farquhar in a low voice well sir what then said mr bradshaw abruptly while he spokewhile his eye met mr farquharsthe hinted meaning of the latter flashed through his mind but he was only made angry to find that such a suspicion could pass through any ones imagination i suppose i may go sir said watson respectfully an uneasy consciousness of what was in mr farquhars thoughts troubling the faithful old clerk yes go what do you mean about the dividends asked mr bradshaw impetuously of mr farquhar simply that i think there can have been no forgetfulnessno mistake on mr bensons part said mr farquhar unwilling to put his dim suspicion into words then of course it is some blunder of that confounded insurance company i will write to them today and make them a little brisker and more correct in their statements dont you think it would be better to wait till richards return he may be able to explain it no sir said mr bradshaw sharply i do not think it would be better it has not been my way of doing business to spare any one or any company the consequences of their own carelessness nor to obtain information secondhand when i could have it direct from the source i shall write to the insurance office by the next post mr farquhar saw that any further remonstrance on his part would only aggravate his partners obstinacy and besides it was but a suspicionan uncomfortable suspicion it was possible that some of the clerks at the insurance office might have made a mistake watson was not sure after all that the certificates had been deposited in box a and when he and mr farquhar could not find them there the old man drew more and yet more back from his first assertion of belief that they had been placed there mr bradshaw wrote an angry and indignant reproach of carelessness to the insurance company by the next mail one of their clerks came down to eccleston and having leisurely refreshed himself at the inn and ordered his dinner with care he walked up to the great warehouse of bradshaw and co and sent in his card with a pencil notification on the part of the star insurance company to mr bradshaw himself mr bradshaw held the card in his hand for a minute or two without raising his eyes then he spoke out loud and firm desire the gentleman to walk up stay i will ring my bell in a minute or two and then show him upstairs when the errandboy had closed the door mr bradshaw went to a cupboard where he usually kept a glass and a bottle of wine of which he very seldom partook for he was an abstemious man he intended now to take a glass but the bottle was empty and though there was plenty more to be had for ringing or even simply going into another room he would not allow himself to do this he stood and lectured himself in thought after all i am a fool for once in my life if the certificates are in no box which i have yet examined that does not imply they may not be in some one which i have not had time to search farquhar would stay so late last night and even if they are in none of the boxes here that does not prove he gave the bell a jerking ring and it was yet sounding when mr smith the insurance clerk entered the manager of the insurance company had been considerably nettled at the tone of mr bradshaws letter and had instructed the clerk to assume some dignity at first in vindicating as it was well in his power to do the character of the proceedings of the company but at the same time he was not to go too far for the firm of bradshaw and co was daily looming larger in the commercial world and if any reasonable explanation could be given it was to be received and bygones be bygones sit down sir said mr bradshaw you are aware sir i presume that i come on the part of mr dennison the manager of the star insurance company to reply in person to a letter of yours of the th addressed to him mr bradshaw bowed a very careless piece of business he said stiffly mr dennison does not think you will consider it as such when you have seen the deed of transfer which i am commissioned to show you mr bradshaw took the deed with a steady hand he wiped his spectacles quietly without delay and without hurry and adjusted them on his nose it is possible that he was rather long in looking over the documentat least the clerk had just begun to wonder if he was reading through the whole of it instead of merely looking at the signature when mr bradshaw said it is possible that it may beof course you will allow me to take this paper to mr benson toto inquire if this be his signature there can be no doubt of it i think sir said the clerk calmly smiling for he knew mr bensons signature well i dont know siri dont know he was speaking as if the pronunciation of every word required a separate effort of will like a man who has received a slight paralytic stroke you have heard sir of such a thing as forgeryforgery sir said he repeating the last word very distinctly for he feared that the first time he had said it it was rather slurred over oh sir there is no room for imagining such a thing i assure you in our affairs we become aware of curious forgetfulness on the part of those who are not of business habits still i should like to show it mr benson to prove to him his forgetfulness you know i believe on my soul it is some of his careless forgetfulnessi do sir said he now he spoke very quickly it must have been allow me to convince myself you shall have it back tonight or the first thing in the morning the clerk did not quite like to relinquish the deed nor yet did he like to refuse mr bradshaw if that very uncomfortable idea of forgery should have any foundation in truthand he had given up the writing there were a thousand chances to one against its being anything but a stupid blunder the risk was more imminent of offending one of the directors as he hesitated mr bradshaw spoke very calmly and almost with a smile on his face he had regained his selfcommand you are afraid i see i assure you you may trust me if there has been any fraudif i have the slightest suspicion of the truth of the surmise i threw out just nowhe could not quite speak the bare naked word that was chilling his hearti will not fail to aid the ends of justice even though the culprit should be my own son he ended as he began with a smilesuch a smilethe stiff lips refused to relax and cover the teeth but all the time he kept saying to himself i dont believe iti dont believe it im convinced its a blunder of that old fool benson but when he had dismissed the clerk and secured the piece of paper he went and locked the door and laid his head on his desk and moaned aloud he had lingered in the office for the two previous nights at first occupying himself in searching for the certificates of the insurance shares but when all the boxes and other repositories for papers had been ransacked the thought took hold of him that they might be in richards private desk and with the determination which overlooks the means to get at the end he had first tried all his own keys on the complicated lock and then broken it open with two decided blows of a poker the instrument nearest at hand he did not find the certificates richard had always considered himself careful in destroying any dangerous or telltale papers but the stern father found enough in what remained to convince him that his pattern sonmore even than his pattern son his beloved pridewas far other than what he seemed mr bradshaw did not skip or miss a word he did not shrink while he read he folded up letter by letter he snuffed the candle just when its light began to wane and no sooner but he did not miss or omit one paperhe read every word then leaving the letters in a heap upon the table and the broken desk to tell its own tale he locked the door of the room which was appropriated to his son as junior partner and carried the key away with him there was a faint hope even after this discovery of many circumstances of richards life which shocked and dismayed his fatherthere was still a faint hope that he might not be guilty of forgerythat it might be no forgery after allonly a blunderan omissiona stupendous piece of forgetfulness that hope was the one straw that mr bradshaw clung to late that night mr benson sat in his study every one else in the house had gone to bed but he was expecting a summons to someone who was dangerously ill he was not startled therefore at the knock which came to the front door about twelve but he was rather surprised at the character of the knock so slow and loud with a pause between each rap his studydoor was but a step from that which led into the street he opened it and there stoodmr bradshaw his large portly figure not to be mistaken even in the dusky night he said that is right it was you i wanted to see and he walked straight into the study mr benson followed and shut the door mr bradshaw was standing by the table fumbling in his pocket he pulled out the deed and opening it after a pause in which you might have counted five he held it out to mr benson read it said he he spoke not another word until time had been allowed for its perusal then he added that is your signature the words were an assertion but the tone was that of question no it is not said mr benson decidedly it is very like my writing i could almost say it was mine but i know it is not recollect yourself a little the date is august the third of last year fourteen months ago you may have forgotten it the tone of the voice had a kind of eager entreaty in it which mr benson did not noticehe was so startled at the fetch of his own writing it is most singularly like mine but i could not have signed away these sharesall the property i havewithout the slightest remembrance of it stranger things have happened for the love of heaven think if you did not sign it its a deed of transfer for those insurance shares you see you dont remember it you did not write this namethese words he looked at mr benson with craving wistfulness for one particular answer mr benson was struck at last by the whole proceeding and glanced anxiously at mr bradshaw whose manner gait and voice were so different from usual that he might well excite attention but as soon as the latter was aware of this momentary inspection he changed his tone all at once dont imagine sir i wish to force any invention upon you as a remembrance if you did not write this name i know who did once more i ask youdoes no glimmering recollection ofhaving needed money well sayi never wanted you to refuse my subscription to the chapel god knowsof having sold these accursed sharesoh i see by your face you did not write it you need not speak to mei know he sank down into a chair near him his whole figure drooped in a moment he was up and standing straight as an arrow confronting mr benson who could find no clue to this stern mans agitation you say you did not write these words pointing to the signature with an untrembling finger i believe you richard bradshaw did write them my dear sirmy dear old friend exclaimed mr benson you are rushing to a conclusion for which i am convinced there is no foundation there is no reason to suppose that because there is reason sir do not distress yourselfi am perfectly calm his stony eyes and immovable face did indeed look rigid what we have now to do is to punish the offence i have not one standard for myself and those i loveand mr benson i did love himand another for the rest of the world if a stranger had forged my name i should have known it was my duty to prosecute him you must prosecute richard i will not said mr benson you think perhaps that i shall feel it acutely you are mistaken he is no longer as my son to me i have always resolved to disown any child of mine who was guilty of sin i disown richard he is as a stranger to me i shall feel no more at his exposurehis punishment he could not go on for his voice was choking of course you understand that i must feel shame at our connexion it is that that is troubling me that is but consistent with a man who has always prided himself on the integrity of his name but as for that boy who has been brought up all his life as i have brought up my children it must be some innate wickedness sir i can cut him off though he has been as my right handbeloved let me be no hindrance to the course of justice i beg he has forged your namehe has defrauded you of moneyof your all i think you said someone has forged my name i am not convinced that it was your son until i know all the circumstances i decline to prosecute what circumstances asked mr bradshaw in an authoritative manner which would have shown irritation but for his selfcommand the force of the temptationthe previous habits of the person of richard he is the person mr bradshaw put in mr benson went on without taking any notice i should think it right to prosecute if i found out that this offence against me was only one of a series committed with premeditation against society i should then feel as a protector of others more helpless than myself it was your all said mr bradshaw it was all my money it was not my all replied mr benson and then he went on as if the interruption had never been against an habitual offender i shall not prosecute richard not because he is your sondo not imagine that i should decline taking such a step against any young man without first ascertaining the particulars about him which i know already about richard and which determine me against doing what would blast his character for lifewould destroy every good quality he has what good quality remains to him asked mr bradshaw he has deceived mehe has offended god have we not all offended him mr benson said in a low tone not consciously i never do wrong consciously but richardrichard the remembrance of the undeceiving lettersthe forgeryfilled up his heart so completely that he could not speak for a minute or two yet when he saw mr benson on the point of saying something he broke in it is no use talking sir you and i cannot agree on these subjects once more i desire you to prosecute that boy who is no longer a child of mine mr bradshaw i shall not prosecute him i have said it once for all tomorrow you will be glad that i do not listen to you i should only do harm by saying more at present there is always something aggravating in being told that the mood in which we are now viewing things strongly will not be our mood at some other time it implies that our present feelings are blinding us and that some more clearsighted spectator is able to distinguish our future better than we do ourselves the most shallow person dislikes to be told that any one can gauge his depth mr bradshaw was not soothed by this last remark of mr bensons he stooped down to take up his hat and be gone mr benson saw his dizzy way of groping and gave him what he sought for but he received no word of thanks mr bradshaw went silently towards the door but just as he got there he turned round and said if there were more people like me and fewer like you there would be less evil in the world sir its your sentimentalists that nurse up sin although mr benson had been very calm during this interview he had been much shocked by what had been let out respecting richards forgery not by the fact itself so much as by what it was a sign of still he had known the young man from childhood and had seen and often regretted that his want of moral courage had rendered him peculiarly liable to all the bad effects arising from his fathers severe and arbitrary mode of treatment dick would never have had pluck enough to be a hardened villain under any circumstances but unless some good influence some strength was brought to bear upon him he might easily sink into the sneaking scoundrel mr benson determined to go to mr farquhars the first thing in the morning and consult him as a calm clearheaded family friendpartner in the business as well as son and brotherinlaw to the people concerned chapter xxxi an accident to the dover coach while mr benson lay awake for fear of oversleeping himself and so being late at mr farquhars it was somewhere about six oclockdark as an october morning is at that time sally came to his door and knocked she was always an early riser and if she had not been gone to bed long before mr bradshaws visit last night mr benson might safely have trusted to her calling him heres a woman down below as must see you directly shell be upstairs after me if youre not down quick is it any one from clarkes no no not it master said she through the keyhole i reckon its mrs bradshaw for all shes muffled up he needed no other word when he went down mrs bradshaw sat in his easychair swaying her body to and fro and crying without restraint mr benson came up to her before she was aware that he was there oh sir said she getting up and taking hold of both his hands you wont be so cruel will you i have got some money somewheresome money my father settled on me sir i dont know how much but i think its more than two thousand pounds and you shall have it all if i cant give it you now ill make a will sir only be merciful to poor dickdont go and prosecute him sir my dear mrs bradshaw dont agitate yourself in this way i never meant to prosecute him but mr bradshaw says that you must i shall not indeed i have told mr bradshaw so has he been here oh is not he cruel i dont care ive been a good wife till now i know i have i have done all he bid me ever since we were married but now i will speak my mind and say to everybody how cruel he ishow hard to his own flesh and blood if he puts poor dick in prison i will go too if im to choose between my husband and my son i choose my son for he will have no friends unless i am with him mr bradshaw will think better of it you will see that when his first anger and disappointment are over he will not be hard or cruel you dont know mr bradshaw said she mournfully if you think hell change i might beg and begi have done many a time when we had little children and i wanted to save them a whippingbut no begging ever did any good at last i left it off hell not change perhaps not for human entreaty mrs bradshaw is there nothing more powerful the tone of his voice suggested what he did not say if you mean that god may soften his heart replied she humbly im not going to deny gods poweri have need to think of him she continued bursting into fresh tears for i am a very miserable woman only think he cast it up against me last night and said if i had not spoilt dick this never would have happened he hardly knew what he was saying last night i will go to mr farquhars directly and see him and you had better go home my dear mrs bradshaw you may rely upon our doing all that we can with some difficulty he persuaded her not to accompany him to mr farquhars but he had indeed to take her to her own door before he could convince her that at present she could do nothing but wait the result of the consultation of others it was before breakfast and mr farquhar was alone so mr benson had a quiet opportunity of telling the whole story to the husband before the wife came down mr farquhar was not much surprised though greatly distressed the general opinion he had always entertained of richards character had predisposed him to fear even before the inquiry respecting the insurance shares but it was still a shock when it came however much it might have been anticipated what can we do said mr benson as mr farquhar sat gloomily silent that is just what i was asking myself i think i must see mr bradshaw and try and bring him a little out of this unmerciful frame of mind that must be the first thing will you object to accompany me at once it seems of particular consequence that we should subdue his obduracy before the affair gets wind i will go with you willingly but i believe i rather serve to irritate mr bradshaw he is reminded of things he has said to me formerly and which he thinks he is bound to act up to however i can walk with you to the door and wait for you if youll allow me in the street i want to know how he is today both bodily and mentally for indeed mr farquhar i should not have been surprised last night if he had dropped down dead so terrible was his strain upon himself mr benson was left at the door as he had desired while mr farquhar went in oh mr farquhar what is the matter exclaimed the girls running to him mamma sits crying in the old nursery we believe she has been there all night she will not tell us what it is nor let us be with her and papa is locked up in his room and wont even answer us when we speak though we know he is up and awake for we heard him tramping about all night let me go up to him said mr farquhar he wont let you in it will be of no use but in spite of what they said he went up and to their surprise after hearing who it was their father opened the door and admitted their brotherinlaw he remained with mr bradshaw about half an hour and then came into the diningroom where the two girls stood huddled over the fire regardless of the untasted breakfast behind them and writing a few lines he desired them to take his note up to their mother saying it would comfort her a little and that he should send jemima in two or three hours with the babyperhaps to remain some days with them he had no time to tell them more jemima would he left them and rejoined mr benson come home and breakfast with me i am off to london in an hour or two and must speak with you first on reaching his house he ran upstairs to ask jemima to breakfast alone in her dressingroom and returned in five minutes or less now i can tell you about it said he i see my way clearly to a certain point we must prevent dick and his father meeting just now or all hope of dicks reformation is gone for ever his father is as hard as the nether millstone he has forbidden me his house forbidden you yes because i would not give up dick as utterly lost and bad and because i said i should return to london with the clerk and fairly tell dennison hes a scotchman and a man of sense and feeling the real state of the case by the way we must not say a word to the clerk otherwise he will expect an answer and make out all sorts of inferences for himself from the unsatisfactory reply he must have dennison will be upon honourwill see every side of the casewill know you refuse to prosecute the company of which he is manager are no losers well when i said what i thought wise of all thiswhen i spoke as if my course were a settled and decided thing the grim old man asked me if he was to be an automaton in his own house he assured me he had no feeling for dickall the time he was shaking like an aspen in short repeated much the same things he must have said to you last night however i defied him and the consequence is im forbidden the house and what is more he says he will not come to the office while i remain a partner what shall you do send jemima and the baby theres nothing like a young child for bringing people round to a healthy state of feeling and you dont know what jemima is mr benson no though youve known her from her birth if she cant comfort her mother and if the baby cant steal into her grandfathers heart whyi dont know what you may do to me i shall tell jemima all and trust to her wit and wisdom to work at this end while i do my best at the other richard is abroad is not he he will be in england tomorrow i must catch him somewhere but that i can easily do the difficult point will be what to do with himwhat to say to him when i find him he must give up his partnership thats clear i did not tell his father so but i am resolved upon it there shall be no tampering with the honour of the firm to which i belong but what will become of him asked mr benson anxiously i do not yet know but for jemimas sakefor his dear old fathers sakei will not leave him adrift i will find him some occupation as clear from temptation as i can i will do all in my power and he will do much better if he has any good in him as a freer agent not cowed by his father into a want of individuality and selfrespect i believe i must dismiss you mr benson said he looking at his watch i have to explain all to my wife and to go to that clerk you shall hear from me in a day or two mr benson half envied the younger mans elasticity of mind and power of acting promptly he himself felt as if he wanted to sit down in his quiet study and think over the revelations and events of the last twentyfour hours it made him dizzy even to follow mr farquhars plans as he had briefly detailed them and some solitude and consideration would be required before mr benson could decide upon their justice and wisdom he had been much shocked by the discovery of the overt act of guilt which richard had perpetrated low as his opinion of that young man had been for some time and the consequence was that he felt depressed and unable to rally for the next few days he had not even the comfort of his sisters sympathy as he felt bound in honour not to tell her anything and she was luckily so much absorbed in some household contest with sally that she did not notice her brothers quiet languor mr benson felt that he had no right at this time to intrude into the house which he had been once tacitly forbidden if he went now to mr bradshaws without being asked or sent for he thought it would seem like presuming on his knowledge of the hidden disgrace of one of the family yet he longed to go he knew that mr farquhar must be writing almost daily to jemima and he wanted to hear what he was doing the fourth day after her husbands departure she came within half an hour of the postdelivery and asked to speak to mr benson alone she was in a state of great agitation and had evidently been crying very much oh mr benson said she will you come with me and tell papa this sad news about dick walter has written me a letter at last to say he has found himhe could not at first but now it seems that the day before yesterday he heard of an accident which had happened to the dover coach it was overturnedtwo passengers killed and several badly hurt walter says we ought to be thankful as he is that dick was not killed he says it was such a relief to him on going to the placethe little inn nearest to where the coach was overturnedto find that dick was only severely injured not one of those who was killed but it is a terrible shock to us all we had had no more dreadful fear to lessen the shock mamma is quite unfit for anything and we none of us dare to tell papa jemima had hard work to keep down her sobs thus far and now they overmastered her how is your father i have wanted to hear every day asked mr benson tenderly it was careless of me not to come and tell you but indeed i have had so much to do mamma would not go near him he has said something which she seems as if she could not forgive because he came to meals she would not she has almost lived in the nursery taking out all dicks old playthings and what clothes of his were left and turning them over and crying over them then mr bradshaw has joined you again i was afraid from what mr farquhar said he was going to isolate himself from you all i wish he had said jemima crying afresh it would have been more natural than the way he has gone on the only difference from his usual habits is that he has never gone near the office or else he has come to meals just as usual and talked just as usual and even done what i never knew him do before tried to make jokesall in order to show us how little he cares does he not go out at all only in the garden i am sure he does care after all he must care he cannot shake off a child in this way though he thinks he can and that makes me so afraid of telling him of this accident will you come mr benson he needed no other word he went with her as she rapidly threaded her way through the bystreets when they reached the house she went in without knocking and putting her husbands letter into mr bensons hand she opened the door of her fathers room and sayingpapa here is mr benson left them alone mr benson felt nervously incapable of knowing what to do or to say he had surprised mr bradshaw sitting idly over the firegazing dreamily into the embers but he had started up and drawn his chair to the table on seeing his visitor and after the first necessary words of politeness were over he seemed to expect him to open the conversation mrs farquhar has asked me said mr benson plunging into the subject with a trembling heart to tell you about a letter she has received from her husband he stopped for an instant for he felt that he did not get nearer the real difficulty and yet could not tell the best way of approaching it she need not have given you that trouble i am aware of the reason of mr farquhars absence i entirely disapprove of his conduct he is regardless of my wishes and disobedient to the commands which as my soninlaw i thought he would have felt bound to respect if there is any more agreeable subject that you can introduce i shall be glad to hear you sir neither you nor i must think of what we like to hear or to say you must hear what concerns your son i have disowned the young man who was my son replied he coldly the dover coach has been overturned said mr benson stimulated into abruptness by the icy sternness of the father but in a flash he saw what lay below that terrible assumption of indifference mr bradshaw glanced up in his face one look of agonyand then went greypale so livid that mr benson got up to ring the bell in affright but mr bradshaw motioned to him to sit still oh i have been too sudden sirhe is alive he is alive he exclaimed as he saw the ashy face working in a vain attempt to speak but the poor lips so wooden not a minute ago went working on and on as if mr bensons words did not sink down into the mind or reach the understanding mr benson went hastily for mrs farquhar oh jemima said he i have done it so badlyi have been so cruelhe is very ill i fearbring water brandy and he returned with all speed into the room mr bradshawthe great strong iron manlay back in his chair in a swoon a fit fetch my mother mary send for the doctor elizabeth said jemima rushing to her father she and mr benson did all in their power to restore him mrs bradshaw forgot all her vows of estrangement from the deadlike husband who might never speak to her or hear her again and bitterly accused herself for every angry word she had spoken against him during these last few miserable days before the doctor came mr bradshaw had opened his eyes and partially rallied although he either did not or could not speak he looked struck down into old age his eyes were sensible in their expression but had the dim glaze of many years of life upon them his lower jaw fell from his upper one giving a look of melancholy depression to the face although the lips hid the unclosed teeth but he answered correctly in monosyllables it is true all the questions which the doctor chose to ask and the medical man was not so much impressed with the serious character of the seizure as the family who knew all the hidden mystery behind and had seen their father lie for the first time with the precursor aspect of death upon his face rest watching and a little medicine were what the doctor prescribed it was so slight a prescription for what had appeared to mr benson so serious an attack that he wished to follow the medical man out of the room to make further inquiries and learn the real opinion which he thought must lurk behind but as he was following the doctor hethey allwere aware of the effort mr bradshaw was making to rise in order to arrest mr bensons departure he did stand up supporting himself with one hand on the table for his legs shook under him mr benson came back instantly to the spot where he was for a moment it seemed as if he had not the right command of his voice but at last he said with a tone of humble wistful entreaty which was very touching he is alive sir is he not yes sirindeed he is he is only hurt he is sure to do well mr farquhar is with him said mr benson almost unable to speak for tears mr bradshaw did not remove his eyes from mr bensons face for more than a minute after his question had been answered he seemed as though he would read his very soul and there see if he spoke the truth satisfied at last he sank slowly into his chair and they were silent for a little space waiting to perceive if he would wish for any further information just then at length he put his hands slowly together in the clasped attitude of prayer and saidthank god chapter xxxii the bradshaw pew again occupied if jemima allowed herself now and then to imagine that one good would result from the discovery of richards delinquency in the return of her father and mr benson to something of their old understanding and their old intercourseif this hope fluttered through her mind it was doomed to disappointment mr benson would have been most happy to go if mr bradshaw had sent for him he was on the watch for what might be even the shadow of such an invitationbut none came mr bradshaw on his part would have been thoroughly glad if the wilful seclusion of his present life could have been broken by the occasional visits of the old friend whom he had once forbidden the house but this prohibition having passed his lips he stubbornly refused to do anything which might be construed into unsaying it jemima was for some time in despair of his ever returning to the office or resuming his old habits of business he had evidently threatened as much to her husband all that jemima could do was to turn a deaf ear to every allusion to this menace which he threw out from time to time evidently with a view to see if it had struck deep enough into her husbands mind for him to have repeated it to his wife if mr farquhar had named itif it was known only to two or three to have been but for one halfhour even his resolutionmr bradshaw could have adhered to it without any other reason than the maintenance of what he called consistency but which was in fact doggedness jemima was often thankful that her mother was absent and gone to nurse her son if she had been at home she would have entreated and implored her husband to fall back into his usual habits and would have shown such a dread of his being as good as his word that he would have been compelled to adhere to it by the very consequence affixed to it mr farquhar had hard work as it was in passing rapidly enough between the two placesattending to his business at eccleston and deciding comforting and earnestly talking in richards sickroom during an absence of his it was necessary to apply to one of the partners on some matter of importance and accordingly to jemimas secret joy mr watson came up and asked if her father was well enough to see him on business jemima carried in this inquiry literally and the hesitating answer which her father gave was in the affirmative it was not long before she saw him leave the house accompanied by the faithful old clerk and when he met her at dinner he made no allusion to his morning visitor or to his subsequent going out but from that time forwards he went regularly to the office he received all the information about dicks accident and his progress towards recovery in perfect silence and in as indifferent a manner as he could assume but yet he lingered about the family sittingroom every morning until the post had come in which brought all letters from the south when mr farquhar at last returned to bring the news of dicks perfect convalescence he resolved to tell mr bradshaw all that he had done and arranged for his sons future career but as mr farquhar told mr benson afterwards he could not really say if mr bradshaw had attended to one word that he said rely upon it said mr benson he has not only attended to it but treasured up every expression you have used well i tried to get some opinion or sign of emotion out of him i had not much hope of the latter i must own but i thought he would have said whether i had done wisely or not in procuring that glasgow situation for dickthat he would perhaps have been indignant at my ousting him from the partnership so entirely on my own responsibility how did richard take it oh nothing could exceed his penitence if one had never heard of the proverb when the devil was sick the devil a monk would be i should have had greater faith in him or if he had had more strength of character to begin with or more reality and less outward appearance of good principle instilled into him however this glasgow situation is the very thing clear defined duties no great trust reposed in him a kind and watchful head and introductions to a better class of associates than i fancy he has ever been thrown amongst before for you know mr bradshaw dreaded all intimacies for his son and wanted him to eschew all society beyond his own familywould never allow him to ask a friend home really when i think of the unnatural life mr bradshaw expected him to lead i get into charity with him and have hopes by the way have you ever succeeded in persuading his mother to send leonard to school he may run the same risk from isolation as dick not be able to choose his companions wisely when he grows up but be too much overcome by the excitement of society to be very discreet as to who are his associates have you spoken to her about my plan yes but to no purpose i cannot say that she would even admit an argument on the subject she seemed to have an invincible repugnance to the idea of exposing him to the remarks of other boys on his peculiar position they need never know of it besides sooner or later he must step out of his narrow circle and encounter remark and scorn true said mr benson mournfully and you may depend upon it if it really is the best for leonard she will come round to it byandby it is almost extraordinary to see the way in which her earnest and most unselfish devotion to this boys real welfare leads her to right and wise conclusions i wish i could tame her so as to let me meet her as a friend since the baby was born she comes to see jemima my wife tells me that she sits and holds it soft in her arms and talks to it as if her whole soul went out to the little infant but if she hears a strange footstep on the stair what jemima calls the wildanimal look comes back into her eyes and she steals away like some frightened creature with all that she has done to redeem her character she should not be so timid of observation you may well say with all that she has done we of her own household hear little or nothing of what she does if she wants help she simply tells us how and why but if notperhaps because it is some relief to her to forget for a time the scenes of suffering in which she has been acting the part of comforter and perhaps because there always was a shy sweet reticence about herwe never should know what she is and what she does except from the poor people themselves who would bless her in words if the very thought of her did not choke them with tears yet i do assure you she passes out of all this gloom and makes sunlight in our house we are never so cheerful as when she is at home she always had the art of diffusing peace but now it is positive cheerfulness and about leonard i doubt if the wisest and most thoughtful schoolmaster could teach half as much directly as his mother does unconsciously and indirectly every hour that he is with her her noble humble pious endurance of the consequences of what was wrong in her early life seems expressly fitted to act upon him whose position is unjustly for he has done no harm so similar to hers well i suppose we must leave it alone for the present you will think me a hard practical man when i own to you that all i expect from leonards remaining a homebird is that with such a mother it will do him no harm at any rate remember my offer is the same for a yeartwo years hence as now what does she look forward to making him into finally i dont know the wonder comes into my mind sometimes but never into hers i think it is part of her characterpart perhaps of that which made her what she wasthat she never looks forward and seldom back the present is enough for her and so the conversation ended when mr benson repeated the substance of it to his sister she mused awhile breaking out into an occasional whistle although she had cured herself of this habit in a great measure and at last she said now do you know i never liked poor dick and yet im angry with mr farquhar for getting him out of the partnership in such a summary way i cant get over it even though he has offered to send leonard to school and here hes reigning lordparamount at the office as if you thurstan werent as well able to teach him as any schoolmaster in england but i should not mind that affront if i were not sorry to think of dick though i never could abide him labouring away in glasgow for a petty salary of nobody knows how little while mr farquhar is taking halves instead of thirds of the profits here but her brother could not tell herand even jemima did not know till long afterwardsthat the portion of income which would have been dicks as a junior partner if he had remained in the business was carefully laid aside for him by mr farquhar to be delivered up with all its accumulated interest when the prodigal should have proved his penitence by his conduct when ruth had no call upon her time it was indeed a holiday at chapelhouse she threw off as much as she could of the care and the sadness in which she had been sharing and returned fresh and helpful ready to go about in her soft quiet way and fill up every measure of service and heap it with the fragrance of her own sweet nature the delicate mending that the elder women could no longer see to do was put by for ruths swift and nimble fingers the occasional copying or patient writing to dictation that gave rest to mr bensons weary spine was done by her with sunny alacrity but most of all leonards heart rejoiced when his mother came home then came the quiet confidences the tender exchange of love the happy walks from which he returned stronger and strongergoing from strength to strength as his mother led the way it was well as they saw now that the great shock of the disclosure had taken place when it did she for her part wondered at her own cowardliness in having even striven to keep back the truth from her childthe truth that was so certain to be made clear sooner or later and which it was only owing to gods mercy that she was alive to encounter with him and by so encountering shield and give him good courage moreover in her secret heart she was thankful that all occurred while he was yet too young to have much curiosity as to his father if an unsatisfied feeling of this kind occasionally stole into his mind at any rate she never heard any expression of it for the past was a sealed book between them and so in the bright strength of good endeavour the days went on and grew again to months and years perhaps one little circumstance which occurred during this time had scarcely external importance enough to be called an event but in mr bensons mind it took rank as such one day about a year after richard bradshaw had ceased to be a partner in his fathers house mr benson encountered mr farquhar in the street and heard from him of the creditable and respectable manner in which richard was conducting himself in glasgow where mr farquhar had lately been on business i am determined to tell his father of this said he i think his family are far too obedient to his tacit prohibition of all mention of richards name tacit prohibition inquired mr benson oh i dare say i use the words in a wrong sense for the correctness of a scholar but what i mean is that he made a point of immediately leaving the room if richards name was mentioned and did it in so marked a manner that by degrees they understood that it was their fathers desire that he should never be alluded to which was all very well as long as there was nothing pleasant to be said about him but tonight i am going there and shall take good care he does not escape me before i have told him all i have heard and observed about richard he will never be a hero of virtue for his education has drained him of all moral courage but with care and the absence of all strong temptation for a time he will do very well nothing to gratify paternal pride but certainly nothing to be ashamed of it was on the sunday after this that the little circumstance to which i have alluded took place during the afternoon service mr benson became aware that the large bradshaw pew was no longer unoccupied in a dark corner mr bradshaws white head was to be seen bowed down low in prayer when last he had worshipped there the hair on that head was irongrey and even in prayer he had stood erect with an air of conscious righteousness sufficient for all his wants and even some to spare with which to judge others now that white and hoary head was never uplifted part of his unobtrusiveness might it is true be attributed to the uncomfortable feeling which was sure to attend any open withdrawal of the declaration he had once made never to enter the chapel in which mr benson was minister again and as such a feeling was natural to all men and especially to such a one as mr bradshaw mr benson instinctively respected it and passed out of the chapel with his household without ever directing his regards to the obscure place where mr bradshaw still remained immovable from this day mr benson felt sure that the old friendly feeling existed once more between them although some time might elapse before any circumstance gave the signal for a renewal of their intercourse chapter xxxiii a mother to be proud of old people tell of certain years when typhus fever swept over the country like a pestilence years that bring back the remembrance of deep sorrowrefusing to be comfortedto many a household and which those whose beloved passed through the fiery time unscathed shrink from recalling for great and tremulous was the anxietymiserable the constant watching for evil symptoms and beyond the threshold of home a dense cloud of depression hung over society at large it seemed as if the alarm was proportionate to the previous lightheartedness of fancied securityand indeed it was so for since the days of king belshazzar the solemn decrees of doom have ever seemed most terrible when they awe into silence the merry revellers of life so it was this year to which i come in the progress of my story the summer had been unusually gorgeous some had complained of the steaming heat but others had pointed to the lush vegetation which was profuse and luxuriant the early autumn was wet and cold but people did not regard it in contemplation of some proud rejoicing of the nation which filled every newspaper and gave food to every tongue in eccleston these rejoicings were greater than in most places for by the national triumph of arms it was supposed that a new market for the staple manufacture of the place would be opened and so the trade which had for a year or two been languishing would now revive with redoubled vigour besides these legitimate causes of good spirits there was the rank excitement of a coming election in consequence of mr donne having accepted a government office procured for him by one of his influential relations this time the cranworths roused themselves from their magnificent torpor of security in good season and were going through a series of pompous and ponderous hospitalities in order to bring back the eccleston voters to their allegiance while the town was full of these subjects by turnsnow thinking and speaking of the great revival of tradenow of the chances of the election as yet some weeks distantnow of the balls at cranworth court in which mr cranworth had danced with all the belles of the shopocracy of ecclestonthere came creeping creeping in hidden slimy courses the terrible feverthat fever which is never utterly banished from the sad haunts of vice and misery but lives in such darkness like a wild beast in the recesses of his den it had begun in the low irish lodginghouses but there it was so common it excited little attention the poor creatures died almost without the attendance of the unwarned medical men who received their first notice of the spreading plague from the roman catholic priests before the medical men of eccleston had had time to meet together and consult and compare the knowledge of the fever which they had severally gained it had like the blaze of a fire which had long smouldered burst forth in many places at oncenot merely among the looseliving and vicious but among the decently poornay even among the welltodo and respectable and to add to the horror like all similar pestilences its course was most rapid at first and was fatal in the great majority of caseshopeless from the beginning there was a cry and then a deep silence and then rose the long wail of the survivors a portion of the infirmary of the town was added to that already set apart for a feverward the smitten were carried thither at once whenever it was possible in order to prevent the spread of infection and on that lazarhouse was concentrated all the medical skill and force of the place but when one of the physicians had died in consequence of his attendancewhen the customary staff of matrons and nurses had been swept off in two daysand the nurses belonging to the infirmary had shrunk from being drafted into the pestilential feverwardwhen high wages had failed to tempt any to what in their panic they considered as certain deathwhen the doctors stood aghast at the swift mortality among the untended sufferers who were dependent only on the care of the most ignorant hirelings too brutal to recognise the solemnity of death all this had happened within a week from the first acknowledgment of the presence of the plagueruth came one day with a quieter step than usual into mr bensons study and told him she wanted to speak to him for a few minutes to be sure my dear sit down said he for she was standing and leaning her head against the chimneypiece idly gazing into the fire she went on standing there as if she had not heard his words and it was a few moments before she began to speak then she said i want to tell you that i have been this morning and offered myself as matron to the feverward while it is so full they have accepted me and i am going this evening oh ruth i feared this i saw your look this morning as we spoke of this terrible illness why do you say fear mr benson you yourself have been with john harrison and old betty and many others i dare say of whom we have not heard but this is so different in such poisoned air among such malignant cases have you thought and weighed it enough ruth she was quite still for a moment but her eyes grew full of tears at last she said very softly with a kind of still solemnity yes i have thought and i have weighed but through the very midst of all my fears and thoughts i have felt that i must go the remembrance of leonard was present in both their minds but for a few moments longer they neither of them spoke then ruth said i believe i have no fear that is a great preservative they say at any rate if i have a little natural shrinking it is quite gone when i remember that i am in gods hands oh mr benson continued she breaking out into the irrepressible tearsleonard leonard and now it was his turn to speak out the brave words of faith poor poor mother said he be of good heart he too is in gods hands think what a flash of time only will separate you from him if you should die in this work but hebut heit will be long to him mr benson he will be alone no ruth he will not god and all good men will watch over him but if you cannot still this agony of fear as to what will become of him you ought not to go such tremulous passion will predispose you to take the fever i will not be afraid she replied lifting up her face over which a bright light shone as of gods radiance i am not afraid for myself i will not be so for my darling after a little pause they began to arrange the manner of her going and to speak of the length of time that she might be absent on her temporary duties in talking of her return they assumed it to be certain although the exact time when was to them unknown and would be dependent entirely on the duration of the fever but not the less in their secret hearts did they feel where alone the issue lay ruth was to communicate with leonard and miss faith through mr benson alone who insisted on his determination to go every evening to the hospital to learn the proceedings of the day and the state of ruths health it is not alone on your account my dear there may be many sick people of whom if i can give no other comfort i can take intelligence to their friends all was settled with grave composure yet still ruth lingered as if nerving herself up for some effort at length she said with a faint smile upon her pale face i believe i am a great coward i stand here talking because i dread to tell leonard you must not think of it exclaimed he leave it to me it is sure to unnerve you i must think of it i shall have selfcontrol enough in a minute to do it calmlyto speak hopefully for only think continued she smiling through the tears that would gather in her eyes what a comfort the remembrance of the last few words may be to the poor fellow if the words were choked but she smiled bravely on no said she that must be done but perhaps you will spare me one thingwill you tell aunt faith i suppose i am very weak but knowing that i must go and not knowing what may be the end i feel as if i could not bear to resist her entreaties just at last will you tell her sir while i go to leonard silently he consented and the two rose up and came forth calm and serene and calmly and gently did ruth tell her boy of her purpose not daring even to use any unaccustomed tenderness of voice or gesture lest by so doing she should alarm him unnecessarily as to the result she spoke hopefully and bade him be of good courage and he caught her bravery though his poor boy had root rather in his ignorance of the actual imminent danger than in her deep faith when he had gone down ruth began to arrange her dress when she came downstairs she went into the old familiar garden and gathered a nosegay of the last lingering autumn flowersa few roses and the like mr benson had tutored his sister well and although miss faiths face was swollen with crying she spoke with almost exaggerated cheerfulness to ruth indeed as they all stood at the front door makingbelieve to have careless nothings to say just as at an ordinary leavetaking you would not have guessed the strained chords of feeling there were in each heart they lingered on the last rays of the setting sun falling on the group ruth once or twice had roused herself to the pitch of saying goodbye but when her eye fell on leonard she was forced to hide the quivering of her lips and conceal her trembling mouth amid the bunch of roses they wont let you have your flowers im afraid said miss benson doctors so often object to the smell no perhaps not said ruth hurriedly i did not think of it i will only keep this one rose here leonard darling she gave the rest to him it was her farewell for having now no veil to hide her emotion she summoned all her bravery for one parting smile and smiling turned away but she gave one look back from the street just from the last point at which the door could be seen and catching a glimpse of leonard standing foremost on the step she ran back and he met her halfway and mother and child spoke never a word in that close embrace now leonard said miss faith be a brave boy i feel sure she will come back to us before very long but she was very near crying herself and she would have given way i believe if she had not found the wholesome outlet of scolding sally for expressing just the same opinion respecting ruths proceedings as she herself had done not two hours before taking what her brother had said to her as a text she delivered such a lecture to sally on want of faith that she was astonished at herself and so much affected by what she had said that she had to shut the door of communication between the kitchen and the parlour pretty hastily in order to prevent sallys threatened reply from weakening her belief in the righteousness of what ruth had done her words had gone beyond her conviction evening after evening mr benson went forth to gain news of ruth and night after night he returned with good tidings the fever it is true raged but no plague came nigh her he said her face was ever calm and bright except when clouded by sorrow as she gave the accounts of the deaths which occurred in spite of every care he said he had never seen her face so fair and gentle as it was now when she was living in the midst of disease and woe one evening leonard for they had grown bolder as to the infection accompanied him to the street on which the hospital abutted mr benson left him there and told him to return home but the boy lingered attracted by the crowd that had gathered and were gazing up intently towards the lighted windows of the hospital there was nothing beyond to be seen but the greater part of these poor people had friends or relations in that palace of death leonard stood and listened at first their talk consisted of vague and exaggerated accounts if such could be exaggerated of the horrors of the fever then they spoke of ruthof his mother and leonard held his breath to hear they say she has been a great sinner and that this is her penance quoth one and as leonard gasped before rushing forward to give the speaker straight the lie an old man spoke such a one as her has never been a great sinner nor does she do her work as a penance but for the love of god and of the blessed jesus she will be in the light of gods countenance when you and i will be standing afar off i tell you man when my poor wench died as no one would come near her head lay at that hour on this womans sweet breast i could fell you the old man went on lifting his shaking arm for calling that woman a great sinner the blessing of them who were ready to perish is upon her immediately there arose a clamour of tongues each with some tale of his mothers gentle doings till leonard grew dizzy with the beatings of his glad proud heart few were aware how much ruth had done she never spoke of it shrinking with sweet shyness from overmuch allusion to her own work at all times her left hand truly knew not what her right hand did and leonard was overwhelmed now to hear of the love and the reverence with which the poor and outcast had surrounded her it was irrepressible he stepped forward with a proud bearing and touching the old mans arm who had first spoken leonard tried to speak but for an instant he could not his heart was too full tears came before words but at length he managed to say sir i am her son thou thou her bairn god bless you lad said an old woman pushing through the crowd it was but last night she kept my child quiet with singing psalms the night through low and sweet low and sweet they tell metill many poor things were hushed though they were out of their minds and had not heard psalms this many a year god in heaven bless you lad many other wild woebegone creatures pressed forward with blessings on ruths son while he could only repeat she is my mother from that day forward leonard walked erect in the streets of eccleston where many arose and called her blessed after some weeks the virulence of the fever abated and the general panic subsidedindeed a kind of foolhardiness succeeded to be sure in some instances the panic still held possession of individuals to an exaggerated extent but the number of patients in the hospital was rapidly diminishing and for money those were to be found who could supply ruths place but to her it was owing that the overwrought fear of the town was subdued it was she who had gone voluntarily and with no thought of greed or gain right into the very jaws of the fierce disease she bade the inmates of the hospital farewell and after carefully submitting herself to the purification recommended by mr davis the principal surgeon of the place who had always attended leonard she returned to mr bensons just at gloaming time they each vied with the other in the tenderest cares they hastened tea they wheeled the sofa to the fire they made her lie down and to all she submitted with the docility of a child and when the candles came even mr bensons anxious eye could see no change in her looks but that she seemed a little paler the eyes were as full of spiritual light the gently parted lips as rosy and the smile if more rare yet as sweet as ever chapter xxxiv i must go and nurse mr bellingham the next morning miss benson would insist upon making ruth lie down on the sofa ruth longed to do many things to be much more active but she submitted when she found that it would gratify miss faith if she remained as quiet as if she were really an invalid leonard sat by her holding her hand every now and then he looked up from his book as if to make sure that she indeed was restored to him he had brought her down the flowers which she had given him the day of her departure and which he had kept in water as long as they had any greenness or fragrance and then had carefully dried and put by she too smiling had produced the one rose which she had carried away to the hospital never had the bond between her and her boy been drawn so firm and strong many visitors came this day to the quiet chapelhouse first of all mrs farquhar appeared she looked very different from the jemima bradshaw of three years ago happiness had called out beauty the colouring of her face was lovely and vivid as that of an autumn day her berryred lips scarce closed over the short white teeth for her smiles and her large dark eyes glowed and sparkled with daily happiness they were softened by a mist of tears as she looked upon ruth lie still dont move you must be content today to be waited upon and nursed i have just seen miss benson in the lobby and had charge upon charge not to fatigue you oh ruth how we all love you now we have you back again do you know i taught rosa to say her prayers as soon as ever you were gone to that horrid place just on purpose that her little innocent lips might pray for youi wish you could hear her say itplease dear god keep ruth safe oh leonard are not you proud of your mother leonard said yes rather shortly as if he were annoyed that any one else should know or even have a right to imagine how proud he was jemima went on now ruth i have got a plan for you walter and i have partly made it and partly its papas doing yes dear papa has been quite anxious to show his respect for you we all want you to go to the dear eagles crag for this next month and get strong and have some change in that fine air at abermouth i am going to take little rosa there papa has lent it to us and the weather is often very beautiful in november thank you very much it is very tempting for i have been almost longing for some such change i cannot tell all at once whether i can go but i will see about it if you will let me leave it open a little oh as long as you like so that you will but go at last and master leonard you are to come too now i know i have you on my side ruth thought of the place her only reluctance arose from the remembrance of that one interview on the sands that walk she could never go again but how much remained how much that would be a charming balm and refreshment to her what happy evenings we shall have together do you know i think mary and elizabeth may perhaps come a bright gleam of sunshine came into the room look how bright and propitious for our plans dear ruth it seems like an omen for the future almost while she spoke miss benson entered bringing with her mr grey the rector of eccleston he was an elderly man short and stoutlybuilt with something very formal in his manner but any one might feel sure of his steady benevolence who noticed the expression of his face and especially of the kindly black eyes that gleamed beneath his grey and shaggy eyebrows ruth had seen him at the hospital once or twice and mrs farquhar had met him pretty frequently in general society go and tell your uncle said miss benson to leonard stop my boy i have just met mr benson in the street and my errand now is to your mother i should like you to remain and hear what it is and i am sure that my business will give these ladiesbowing to miss benson and jemimaso much pleasure that i need not apologise for entering upon it in their presence he pulled out his double eyeglass saying with a grave smile you ran away from us yesterday so quietly and cunningly mrs denbigh that you were perhaps not aware that the board was sitting at that very time and trying to form a vote sufficiently expressive of our gratitude to you as chairman they requested me to present you with this letter which i shall have the pleasure of reading with all due emphasis he read aloud a formal letter from the secretary to the infirmary conveying a vote of thanks to ruth the good rector did not spare her one word from date to signature and then folding the letter up he gave it to leonard saying there sir when you are an old man you may read that testimony to your mothers noble conduct with pride and pleasure for indeed continued he turning to jemima no words can express the relief it was to us i speak of the gentlemen composing the board of the infirmary when mrs denbigh came forward the panic was at its height and the alarm of course aggravated the disorder the poor creatures died rapidly there was hardly time to remove the dead bodies before others were brought in to occupy the beds so little help was to be procured on account of the universal terror and the morning when mrs denbigh offered us her services we seemed at the very worst i shall never forget the sensation of relief in my mind when she told us what she proposed to do but we thought it right to warn her to the full extent nay madam said he catching a glimpse of ruths changing colour i will spare you any more praises i will only say if i can be a friend to you or a friend to your child you may command my poor powers to the utmost he got up and bowing formally he took his leave jemima came and kissed ruth leonard went upstairs to put the precious letter away miss benson sat crying heartily in a corner of the room ruth went to her and threw her arms round her neck and said i could not tell him just then i durst not speak for fear of breaking down but if i have done right it was all owing to you and mr benson oh i wish i had said how the thought first came into my head from seeing the things mr benson has done so quietly ever since the fever first came amongst us i could not speak and it seemed as if i was taking those praises to myself when all the time i was feeling how little i deserved themhow it was all owing to you under god ruth said miss benson speaking through her tears oh i think there is nothing humbles one so much as undue praise while he was reading that letter i could not help feeling how many things i have done wrong could he know ofof what i have been asked she dropping her voice very low yes said jemima he kneweverybody in eccleston did knowbut the remembrance of those days is swept away miss benson she continued for she was anxious to turn the subject you must be on my side and persuade ruth to come to abermouth for a few weeks i want her and leonard both to come im afraid my brother will think that leonard is missing his lessons sadly just of late we could not wonder that the poor childs heart was so full but he must make haste and get on all the more for his idleness miss benson piqued herself on being a disciplinarian oh as for lessons walter is so very anxious that you should give way to his superior wisdom ruth and let leonard go to school he will send him to any school you fix upon according to the mode of life you plan for him i have no plan said ruth i have no means of planning all i can do is to try and make him ready for anything well said jemima we must talk it over at abermouth for i am sure you wont refuse to come dearest dear ruth think of the quiet sunny days and the still evenings that we shall have together with little rosa to tumble about among the fallen leaves and theres leonard to have his first sight of the sea i do think of it said ruth smiling at the happy picture jemima drew and both smiling at the hopeful prospect before them they partednever to meet again in life no sooner had mrs farquhar gone than sally burst in oh dear dear said she looking around her if i had but known that the rector was coming to call id ha put on the best covers and the sunday tablecloth youre well enough continued she surveying ruth from head to foot youre always trim and dainty in your gowns though i reckon they cost but tuppence a yard and youve a face to set em off but as for you as she turned to miss benson i think you might ha had something better on than that old stuff if it had only been to do credit to a parishioner like me whom he has known ever sin my father was his clerk you forget sally i have been making jelly all the morning how could i tell it was mr grey when there was a knock at the door miss benson replied you might ha letten me do the jelly ise warrant i could ha pleased ruth as well as you if i had but known he was coming id ha slipped round the corner and bought ye a neckribbon or summut to lighten ye up ise loath he should think im living with dissenters that dont know how to keep themselves trig and smart never mind sally he never thought of me what he came for was to see ruth and as you say shes always neat and dainty well i reckon it cannot be helped now but if i buy ye a ribbon will you promise to wear it when churchfolks come for i cannot abide the way they have of scoffing at the dissenters about their dress very well well make that bargain said miss benson and now ruth ill go and fetch you a cup of warm jelly oh indeed aunt faith said ruth i am very sorry to balk you but if youre going to treat me as an invalid i am afraid i shall rebel but when she found that aunt faiths heart was set upon it she submitted very graciously only dimpling up a little as she found that she must consent to lie on the sofa and be fed when in truth she felt full of health with a luxurious sensation of languor stealing over her now and then just enough to make it very pleasant to think of the salt breezes and the sea beauty which awaited her at abermouth mr davis called in the afternoon and his visit was also to ruth mr and miss benson were sitting with her in the parlour and watching her with contented love as she employed herself in household sewing and hopefully spoke about the abermouth plan well so you had our worthy rector here today i am come on something of the same kind of errand only i shall spare you the reading of my letter which ill answer for it he did not please to take notice said he putting down a sealed letter that i have delivered you a vote of thanks from my medical brothers and open and read it at your leisure only not just now for i want to have a little talk with you on my own behoof i want to ask you a favour mrs denbigh a favour exclaimed ruth what can i do for you i think i may say i will do it without hearing what it is then youre a very imprudent woman replied he however ill take you at your word i want you to give me your boy leonard aye there it is you see mr benson one minute she is as ready as can be and the next she looks at me as if i was an ogre perhaps we dont understand what you mean said mr benson the thing is this you know ive no children and i cant say ive ever fretted over it much but my wife has and whether it is that she has infected me or that i grieve over my good practice going to a stranger when i ought to have had a son to take it after me i dont know but of late ive got to look with covetous eyes on all healthy boys and at last ive settled down my wishes on this leonard of yours mrs denbigh ruth could not speak for even yet she did not understand what he meant he went on now how old is the lad he asked ruth but miss benson replied hell be twelve next february umph only twelve hes tall and oldlooking for his age you look young enough it is true he said this last sentence as if to himself but seeing ruth crimson up he abruptly changed his tone twelve is he well i take him from now i dont mean that i really take him away from you said he softening all at once and becoming grave and considerate his being your sonthe son of one whom i have seenas i have seen you mrs denbigh out and out the best nurse i ever met with miss benson and good nurses are things we doctors know how to valuehis being your son is his great recommendation to me not but what the lad himself is a noble boy i shall be glad to leave him with you as long and as much as we can he could not be tied to your apronstrings all his life you know only i provide for his education subject to your consent and good pleasure and he is bound apprentice to me i his guardian bind him to myself the first surgeon in eccleston be the other who he may and in process of time he becomes partner and some day or other succeeds me now mrs denbigh what have you got to say against this plan my wife is just as full of it as me come begin with your objections youre not a woman if you have not a whole bagfull of them ready to turn out against any reasonable proposal i dont know faltered ruth it is so sudden it is very very kind of you mr davis said miss benson a little scandalised at ruths nonexpression of gratitude pooh pooh ill answer for it in the long run i am taking good care of my own interests come mrs denbigh is it a bargain now mr benson spoke mr davis it is rather sudden as she says as far as i can see it is the best as well as the kindest proposal that could have been made but i think we must give her a little time to think about it well twentyfour hours will that do ruth lifted up her head mr davis i am not ungrateful because i cant thank you she was crying while she spoke let me have a fortnight to consider about it in a fortnight i will make up my mind oh how good you all are very well then this day fortnightthursday the thyou will let me know your decision mind if its against me i shant consider it a decision for im determined to carry my point im not going to make mrs denbigh blush mr benson by telling you in her presence of all i have observed about her this last three weeks that has made me sure of the good qualities i shall find in this boy of hers i was watching her when she little thought it do you remember that night when hector obrien was so furiously delirious mrs denbigh ruth went very white at the remembrance why now look there how pale she is at the very thought of it and yet i assure you she was the one to go up and take the piece of glass from him which he had broken out of the window for the sole purpose of cutting his throat or the throat of any one else for that matter i wish we had some others as brave as she is i thought the great panic was passed away said mr benson aye the general feeling of alarm is much weaker but here and there there are as great fools as ever why when i leave here i am going to see our precious member mr donne mr donne said ruth mr donne who lies ill at the queenscame last week with the intention of canvassing but was too much alarmed by what he heard of the fever to set to work and in spite of all his precautions he has taken it and you should see the terror they are in at the hotel landlord landlady waiters servantsall theres not a creature will go near him if they can help it and theres only his grooma lad he saved from drowning im toldto do anything for him i must get him a proper nurse somehow or somewhere for all my being a cranworth man ah mr benson you dont know the temptations we medical men have think if i allowed your member to die now as he might very well if he had no nursehow famously mr cranworth would walk over the coursewheres mrs denbigh gone to i hope ive not frightened her away by reminding her of hector obrien and that awful night when i do assure you she behaved like a heroine as mr benson was showing mr davis out ruth opened the studydoor and said in a very calm low voice mr benson will you allow me to speak to mr davis alone mr benson immediately consented thinking that in all probability she wished to ask some further questions about leonard but as mr davis came into the room and shut the door he was struck by her pale stern face of determination and awaited her speaking first mr davis i must go and nurse mr bellingham said she at last clenching her hands tight together but no other part of her body moving from its intense stillness mr bellingham asked he astonished at the name mr donne i mean said she hurriedly his name was bellingham oh i remember hearing he had changed his name for some property but you must not think of any more such work just now you are not fit for it you are looking as white as ashes i must go she repeated nonsense heres a man who can pay for the care of the first hospital nurses in londonand i doubt if his life is worth the risk of one of theirs even much more of yours we have no right to weigh human lives against each other no i know we have not but its a way we doctors are apt to get into and at any rate its ridiculous of you to think of such a thing just listen to reason i cant i cant cried she with sharp pain in her voice you must let me go dear mr davis said she now speaking with soft entreaty no said he shaking his head authoritatively ill do no such thing listen said she dropping her voice and going all over the deepest scarlet he is leonards father now you will let me go mr davis was indeed staggered by what she said and for a moment he did not speak so she went on you will not tell you must not tell no one knows not even mr benson who it was and nowit might do him so much harm to have it known you will not tell no i will not tell replied he but mrs denbigh you must answer me this one question which i ask you in all true respect but which i must ask in order to guide both myself and you arightof course i knew leonard was illegitimatein fact i will give you secret for secret it was being so myself that first made me sympathise with him and desire to adopt him i knew that much of your history but tell me do you now care for this man answer me trulydo you love him for a moment or two she did not speak her head was bent down then she raised it up and looked with clear and honest eyes into his face i have been thinkingbut i do not knowi cannot telli dont think i should love him if he were well and happybut you said he was illand alonehow can i help caring for himhow can i help caring for him repeated she covering her face with her hands and the quick hot tears stealing through her fingers he is leonards father continued she looking up at mr davis suddenly he need not knowhe shall notthat i have ever been near him if he is like the others he must be deliriousi will leave him before he comes to himselfbut now let me goi must go i wish my tongue had been bitten out before i had named him to you he would do well enough without you and i dare say if he recognises you he will only be annoyed it is very likely said ruth heavily annoyedwhy he may curse you for your unaskedfor care of him i have heard my poor motherand she was as pretty and delicate a creature as you arecursed for showing tenderness when it was not wanted now be persuaded by an old man like me who has seen enough of life to make his heart acheleave this fine gentleman to his fate ill promise you to get him as good a nurse as can be had for money no said ruth with dull persistencyas if she had not attended to his dissuasions i must go i will leave him before he recognises me why then said the old surgeon if youre so bent upon it i suppose i must let you it is but what my mother would have donepoor heartbroken thing however come along and let us make the best of it it saves me a deal of trouble i know for if i have you for a right hand i need not worry myself continually with wondering how he is taken care of go get your bonnet you tenderhearted fool of a woman let us get you out of the house without any more scenes or explanations ill make all straight with the bensons you will not tell my secret mr davis she said abruptly no not i does the woman think i had never to keep a secret of the kind before i only hope hell lose his election and never come near the place again after all continued he sighing i suppose it is but human nature he began recalling the circumstances of his own early life and dreamily picturing scenes in the grey dying embers of the fire and he was almost startled when she stood before him ready equipped grave pale and quiet come along said he if youre to do any good at all it must be in these next three days after that ill ensure his life for this bout and mind i shall send you home then for he might know you and ill have no excitement to throw him back again and no sobbing and crying from you but now every moment your care is precious to him i shall tell my own story to the bensons as soon as i have installed you mr donne lay in the best room of the queens hotelno one with him but his faithful ignorant servant who was as much afraid of the fever as any one else could be but who nevertheless would not leave his masterhis master who had saved his life as a child and afterwards put him in the stables at bellingham hall where he learnt all that he knew he stood in a farther corner of the room watching his delirious master with affrighted eyes not daring to come near him nor yet willing to leave him oh if that doctor would but come hell kill himself or meand them stupid servants wont stir a step over the threshold how shall i get over the night blessings on himheres the old doctor back again i hear him creaking and scolding up the stairs the door opened and mr davis entered followed by ruth heres the nurse my good mansuch a nurse as there is not in the three counties now all youll have to do is to mind what she says oh sir hes mortal bad wont you stay with us through the night sir look there whispered mr davis to the man see how she knows how to manage him why i could not do it better myself she had gone up to the wild raging figure and with soft authority had made him lie down and then placing a basin of cold water by the bedside she had dipped in it her pretty hands and was laying their cool dampness on his hot brow speaking in a low soothing voice all the time in a way that acted like a charm in hushing his mad talk but i will stay said the doctor after he had examined his patient as much on her account as his and partly to quieten the fears of this poor faithful fellow chapter xxxv out of darkness into light the third night after this was to be the crisisthe turningpoint between life and death mr davis came again to pass it by the bedside of the sufferer ruth was there constant and still intent upon watching the symptoms and acting according to them in obedience to mr daviss directions she had never left the room every sense had been strained in watchingevery power of thought or judgment had been kept on the full stretch now that mr davis came and took her place and that the room was quiet for the night she became oppressed with heaviness which yet did not tend to sleep she could not remember the present time or where she was all times of her earliest youththe days of her childhoodwere in her memory with a minuteness and fulness of detail which was miserable for all along she felt that she had no real grasp on the scenes that were passing through her mindthat somehow they were long gone by and gone by for everand yet she could not remember who she was now nor where she was and whether she had now any interests in life to take the place of those which she was conscious had passed away although their remembrance filled her mind with painful acuteness her head lay on her arms and they rested on the table every now and then she opened her eyes and saw the large room handsomely furnished with articles that were each one incongruous with the other as if bought at sales she saw the flickering nightlightshe heard the ticking of the watch and the two breathings each going on at a separate rateone hurried abruptly stopping and then panting violently as if to make up for lost time and the other slow steady and regular as if the breather was asleep but this supposition was contradicted by an occasional repressed sound of yawning the sky through the uncurtained window looked dark and blackwould this night never have an end had the sun gone down for ever and would the world at last awaken to a general sense of everlasting night then she felt as if she ought to get up and go and see how the troubled sleeper in yonder bed was struggling through his illness but she could not remember who the sleeper was and she shrunk from seeing some phantomface on the pillow such as now began to haunt the dark corners of the room and look at her jibbering and mowing as they looked so she covered her face again and sank into a whirling stupor of sense and feeling byandby she heard her fellowwatcher stirring and a dull wonder stole over her as to what he was doing but the heavy languor pressed her down and kept her still at last she heard the words come here and listlessly obeyed the command she had to steady herself in the rocking chamber before she could walk to the bed by which mr davis stood but the effort to do so roused her and although conscious of an oppressive headache she viewed with sudden and clear vision all the circumstances of her present position mr davis was near the head of the bed holding the nightlamp high and shading it with his hand that it might not disturb the sick person who lay with his face towards them in feeble exhaustion but with every sign that the violence of the fever had left him it so happened that the rays of the lamp fell bright and full upon ruths countenance as she stood with her crimson lips parted with the hurrying breath and the feverflush brilliant on her cheeks her eyes were wide open and their pupils distended she looked on the invalid in silence and hardly understood why mr davis had summoned her there dont you see the change he is betterthe crisis is past but she did not speak her looks were riveted on his softlyunclosing eyes which met hers as they opened languidly she could not stir or speak she was held fast by that gaze of his in which a faint recognition dawned and grew to strength he murmured some words they strained their sense to hear he repeated them even lower than before but this time they caught what he was saying where are the waterlilies where are the lilies in her hair mr davis drew ruth away he is still rambling said he but the fever has left him the grey dawn was now filling the room with its cold light was it that made ruths cheek so deadly pale could that call out the wild entreaty of her look as if imploring help against some cruel foe that held her fast and was wrestling with her spirit of life she held mr daviss arm if she had let it go she would have fallen take me home she said and fainted dead away mr davis carried her out of the chamber and sent the groom to keep watch by his master he ordered a fly to convey her to mr bensons and lifted her in when it came for she was still half unconscious it was he who carried her upstairs to her room where miss benson and sally undressed and laid her in her bed he awaited their proceedings in mr bensons study when mr benson came in mr davis said dont blame me dont add to my selfreproach i have killed her i was a cruel fool to let her go dont speak to me it may not be so bad said mr benson himself needing comfort in that shock she may recover she surely will recover i believe she will no no she wont but by she shall if i can save her mr davis looked defiantly at mr benson as if he were fate i tell you she shall recover or else i am a murderer what business had i to take her to nurse him he was cut short by sallys entrance and announcement that ruth was now prepared to see him from that time forward mr davis devoted all his leisure his skill his energy to save her he called on the rival surgeon to beg him to undertake the management of mr donnes recovery saying with his usual selfmockery i could not answer it to mr cranworth if i had brought his opponent round you know when i had had such a fine opportunity in my power now with your patients and general radical interest it will be rather a feather in your cap for he may want a good deal of care yet though he is getting on famouslyso rapidly in fact that its a strong temptation to me to throw him backa relapse you know the other surgeon bowed gravely apparently taking mr davis in earnest but certainly very glad of the job thus opportunely thrown in his way in spite of mr daviss real and deep anxiety about ruth he could not help chuckling over his rivals literal interpretation of all he had said to be sure what fools men are i dont know why one should watch and strive to keep them in the world i have given this fellow something to talk about confidentially to all his patients i wonder how much stronger a dose the man would have swallowed i must begin to take care of my practice for that lad yonder welladay welladay what was this sick fine gentleman sent here for that she should run a chance of her life for him or why was he sent into the world at all for that matter indeed however much mr davis might labour with all his professional skillhowever much they might all watchand prayand weepit was but too evident that ruth home must go and take her wages poor poor ruth it might be that utterly exhausted by watching and nursing first in the hospital and then by the bedside of her former lover the power of her constitution was worn out or it might be her gentle pliant sweetness but she displayed no outrage or discord even in her delirium there she lay in the atticroom in which her baby had been born her watch over him kept her confession to him made and now she was stretched on the bed in utter helplessness softly gazing at vacancy with her open unconscious eyes from which all the depth of their meaning had fled and all they told was of a sweet childlike insanity within the watchers could not touch her with their sympathy or come near her in her dim worldso mutely but looking at each other from time to time with tearful eyes they took a poor comfort from the one evident fact that though lost and gone astray she was happy and at peace they had never heard her sing indeed the simple art which her mother had taught her had died with her early joyousness at that dear mothers death but now she sang continually very soft and low she went from one childish ditty to another without let or pause keeping a strange sort of time with her pretty fingers as they closed and unclosed themselves upon the counterpane she never looked at any one with the slightest glimpse of memory or intelligence in her face no not even at leonard her strength faded day by day but she knew it not her sweet lips were parted to sing even after the breath and the power to do so had left her and her fingers fell idly on the bed two days she lingered thusall but gone from them and yet still there they stood around her bedside not speaking or sighing or moaning they were too much awed by the exquisite peacefulness of her look for that suddenly she opened wide her eyes and gazed intently forwards as if she saw some happy vision which called out a lovely rapturous breathless smile they held their very breaths i see the light coming said she the light is coming she said and raising herself slowly she stretched out her arms and then fell back very still for evermore they did not speak mr davis was the first to utter a word it is over said he she is dead out rang through the room the cry of leonard mother mother mother you have not left me alone you will not leave me alone you are not dead mother mother they had pent in his agony of apprehension till then that no wail of her child might disturb her ineffable calm but now there was a cry heard through the house of one refusing to be comforted mother mother but ruth lay dead chapter xxxvi the end a stupor of grief succeeded to leonards passionate cries he became so much depressed physically as well as mentally before the end of the day that mr davis was seriously alarmed for the consequences he hailed with gladness a proposal made by the farquhars that the boy should be removed to their house and placed under the fond care of his mothers friend who sent her own child to abermouth the better to devote herself to leonard when they told him of this arrangement he at first refused to go and leave her but when mr benson said she would have wished it leonard do it for her sake he went away very quietly not speaking a word after mr benson had made the voluntary promise that he should see her once again he neither spoke nor cried for many hours and all jemimas delicate wiles were called forth before his heavy heart could find the relief of tears and then he was so weak and his pulse so low that all who loved him feared for his life anxiety about him made a sad distraction from the sorrow for the dead the three old people who now formed the household in the chapelhouse went about slowly and dreamily each with a dull wonder at their hearts why they the infirm and wornout were left while she was taken in her lovely prime the third day after ruths death a gentleman came to the door and asked to speak to mr benson he was very much wrapped up in furs and cloaks and the upper exposed part of his face was sunk and hollow like that of one but partially recovered from illness mr and miss benson were at mr farquhars gone to see leonard and poor old sally had been having a hearty cry over the kitchen fire before answering the doorknock her heart was tenderly inclined just then towards any one who had the aspect of suffering so although her master was out and she was usually chary of admitting strangers she proposed to mr donne for it was he that he should come in and await mr bensons return in the study he was glad enough to avail himself of her offer for he was feeble and nervous and come on a piece of business which he exceedingly disliked and about which he felt very awkward the fire was nearly if not quite out nor did sallys vigorous blows do much good although she left the room with an assurance that it would soon burn up he leant against the chimneypiece thinking over events and with a sensation of discomfort both external and internal growing and gathering upon him he almost wondered whether the proposal he meant to make with regard to leonard could not be better arranged by letter than by an interview he became very shivery and impatient of the state of indecision to which his bodily weakness had reduced him sally opened the door and came in would you like to walk upstairs sir asked she in a trembling voice for she had learnt who the visitor was from the driver of the fly who had run up to the house to inquire what was detaining the gentleman that he had brought from the queens hotel and knowing that ruth had caught the fatal fever from her attendance on mr donne sally imagined that it was but a piece of sad civility to invite him upstairs to see the poor dead body which she had laid out and decked for the grave with such fond care that she had grown strangely proud of its marble beauty mr donne was glad enough of any proposal of a change from the cold and comfortless room where he had thought uneasy remorseful thoughts he fancied that a change of place would banish the train of reflection that was troubling him but the change he anticipated was to a wellwarmed cheerful sittingroom with signs of life and a bright fire therein and he was on the last flight of stairsat the door of the room where ruth laybefore he understood whither sally was conducting him he shrank back for an instant and then a strange sting of curiosity impelled him on he stood in the humble lowroofed attic the window open and the tops of the distant snowcovered hills filling up the whiteness of the general aspect he muffled himself up in his cloak and shuddered while sally reverently drew down the sheet and showed the beautiful calm still face on which the last rapturous smile still lingered giving an ineffable look of bright serenity her arms were crossed over her breast the wimplelike cap marked the perfect oval of her face while two braids of the waving auburn hair peeped out of the narrow border and lay on the delicate cheeks he was awed into admiration by the wonderful beauty of that dead woman how beautiful she is said he beneath his breath do all dead people look so peacefulso happy not all replied sally crying few has been as good and as gentle as she was in their lives she quite shook with her sobbing mr donne was disturbed by her distress come my good woman we must all die he did not know what to say and was becoming infected by her sorrow i am sure you loved her very much and were very kind to her in her lifetime you must take this from me to buy yourself some remembrance of her he had pulled out a sovereign and really had a kindly desire to console her and reward her in offering it to her but she took her apron from her eyes as soon as she became aware of what he was doing and still holding it midway in her hands she looked at him indignantly before she burst out and who are you that think to pay for my kindness to her by money and i was not kind to you my darling said she passionately addressing the motionless serene bodyi was not kind to you i frabbed you and plagued you from the first my lamb i came and cut off your pretty locks in this very roomi didand you said never an angry word to meno not then nor many a time after when i was very sharp and cross to youno i never was kind to you and i dunnot think the world was kind to you my darlingbut you are gone where the angels are very tender to such as youyou are my poor wench she bent down and kissed the lips from whose marble unyielding touch mr donne recoiled even in thought just then mr benson entered the room he had returned home before his sister and come upstairs in search of sally to whom he wanted to speak on some subject relating to the funeral he bowed in recognition of mr donne whom he knew as the member for the town and whose presence impressed him painfully as his illness had been the proximate cause of ruths death but he tried to check this feeling as it was no fault of mr donnes sally stole out of the room to cry at leisure in her kitchen i must apologise for being here said mr donne i was hardly conscious where your servant was leading me to when she expressed her wish that i should walk upstairs it is a very common idea in this town that it is a gratification to be asked to take a last look at the dead replied mr benson and in this case i am glad to have seen her once more said mr donne poor ruth mr benson glanced up at him at the last word how did he know her name to him she had only been mrs denbigh but mr donne had no idea that he was talking to one unaware of the connexion that had formerly existed between them and though he would have preferred carrying on the conversation in a warmer room yet as mr benson was still gazing at her with sad lingering love he went on i did not recognise her when she came to nurse me i believe i was delirious my servant who had known her long ago in fordham told me who she was i cannot tell how i regret that she should have died in consequence of her love of me mr benson looked up at him again a stern light filling his eyes as he did so he waited impatiently to hear more either to quench or confirm his suspicions if she had not been lying there very still and calm he would have forced the words out of mr donne by some abrupt question as it was he listened silently his heart quickbeating i know that money is but a poor compensationis no remedy for this event or for my youthful folly mr benson set his teeth hard together to keep in words little short of a curse indeed i offered her money to almost any amount beforedo me justice sir catching the gleam of indignation on mr bensons face i offered to marry her and provide for the boy as if he had been legitimate its of no use recurring to that time said he his voice faltering what is done cannot be undone but i came now to say that i should be glad to leave the boy still under your charge and that every expense you think it right to incur in his education i will defrayand place a sum of money in trust for himsay two thousand poundsor more fix what you will of course if you decline retaining him i must find some one else but the provision for him shall be the same for my poor ruths sake mr benson did not speak he could not till he had gathered some peace from looking at the ineffable repose of the dead then before he answered he covered up her face and in his voice there was the stillness of ice leonard is not unprovided for those that honoured his mother will take care of him he shall never touch a penny of your money every offer of service you have made i reject in his nameand in her presence said he bending towards the dead men may call such actions as yours youthful follies there is another name for them with god sir i will follow you downstairs all the way down mr benson heard mr donnes voice urging and entreating but the words he could not recognise for the thoughts that filled his brainthe rapid putting together of events that was going on there and when mr donne turned at the door to speak again and repeat his offers of service to leonard mr benson made answer without well knowing whether the answer fitted the question or not i thank god you have no right legal or otherwise over the child and for her sake i will spare him the shame of ever hearing your name as his father he shut the door in mr donnes face an illbred puritanical old fellow he may have the boy i am sure for aught i care i have done my duty and will get out of this abominable place as soon as i can i wish my last remembrance of my beautiful ruth was not mixed up with all these people mr benson was bitterly oppressed with this interview it disturbed the peace with which he was beginning to contemplate events his anger ruffled him although such anger had been just and such indignation well deserved and both had been unconsciously present in his heart for years against the unknown seducer whom he met face to face by the deathbed of ruth it gave him a shock which he did not recover from for many days he was nervously afraid lest mr donne should appear at the funeral and not all the reasons he alleged to himself against this apprehension put it utterly away from him before then however he heard casually for he would allow himself no inquiries that he had left the town no ruths funeral passed over in calm and simple solemnity her child her own household her friend and mr farquhar quietly walked after the bier which was borne by some of the poor to whom she had been very kind in her lifetime and many others stood aloof in the little buryingground sadly watching that last ceremony they slowly dispersed mr benson leading leonard by the hand and secretly wondering at his selfrestraint almost as soon as they had let themselves into the chapelhouse a messenger brought a note from mrs bradshaw with a pot of quince marmalade which she said to miss benson she thought that leonard might fancy and if he did they were to be sure and let her know as she had plenty more or was there anything else that he would like she would gladly make him whatever he fancied poor leonard he lay stretched on the sofa white and tearless beyond the power of any such comfort however kindly offered but this was only one of the many homely simple attentions which all came round him to offer from mr grey the rector down to the nameless poor who called at the back door to inquire how it fared with her child mr benson was anxious according to dissenting custom to preach an appropriate funeral sermon it was the last office he could render to her it should be done well and carefully moreover it was possible that the circumstances of her life which were known to all might be made effective in this manner to work conviction of many truths accordingly he made great preparation of thought and paper he laboured hard destroying sheet after sheethis eyes filling with tears betweenwhiles as he remembered some fresh proof of the humility and sweetness of her life oh that he could do her justice but words seemed hard and inflexible and refused to fit themselves to his ideas he sat late on saturday writing he watched through the night till sunday morning was far advanced he had never taken such pains with any sermon and he was only half satisfied with it after all mrs farquhar had comforted the bitterness of sallys grief by giving her very handsome mourning at any rate she felt oddly proud and exulting when she thought of her new black gown but when she remembered why she wore it she scolded herself pretty sharply for her satisfaction and took to crying afresh with redoubled vigour she spent the sunday morning in alternately smoothing down her skirts and adjusting her broad hemmed collar or bemoaning the occasion with tearful earnestness but the sorrow overcame the little quaint vanity of her heart as she saw troop after troop of humblydressed mourners pass by into the old chapel they were very poorbut each had mounted some rusty piece of crape or some faded black ribbon the old came halting and slowthe mothers carried their quiet awestruck babes and not only these were therebut othersequally unaccustomed to nonconformist worship mr davis for instance to whom sally acted as chaperone for he sat in the ministers pew as a stranger and as she afterwards said she had a fellowfeeling with him being a churchwoman herself and dissenters had such awkward ways however she had been there before so she could set him to rights about their fashions from the pulpit mr benson saw one and allthe wellfilled bradshaw pewall in deep mourning mr bradshaw conspicuously so he would have attended the funeral gladly if they would have asked himthe farquharsthe many strangersthe still more numerous poorone or two wildlooking outcasts who stood afar off but wept silently and continually mr bensons heart grew very full his voice trembled as he read and prayed but he steadied it as he opened his sermonhis great last effort in her honourthe labour that he had prayed god to bless to the hearts of many for an instant the old man looked on all the upturned faces listening with wet eyes to hear what he could say to interpret that which was in their hearts dumb and unshaped of gods doings as shown in her life he looked and as he gazed a mist came before him and he could not see his sermon nor his hearers but only ruth as she had beenstricken low and crouching from sight in the upland field by llandhulike a woeful hunted creature and now her life was over her struggle ended sermon and all was forgotten he sat down and hid his face in his hands for a minute or so then he arose pale and serene he put the sermon away and opened the bible and read the seventh chapter of revelations beginning at the ninth verse before it was finished most of his hearers were in tears it came home to them as more appropriate than any sermon could have been even sally though full of anxiety as to what her fellowchurchman would think of such proceedings let the sobs come freely as she heard the words and he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes he preaches sermons sometimes said sally nudging mr davis as they rose from their knees at last i

on monday morning to take measurement and receive directions for a tombstone they threaded their way among the grassy heaps to where ruth was buried in the south corner beneath the great wychelm when they got there leonard raised himself up from the newstirred turf his face was swollen with weeping but when he saw mr bradshaw he calmed himself and checked his sobs and as an explanation of being where he was when thus surprised he could find nothing to say but the simple words my mother is dead sir his eyes sought those of mr bradshaw with a wild look of agony as if to find comfort for that great loss in human sympathy and at the first wordthe first touch of mr bradshaws hand on his shoulderhe burst out afresh come come my boymr francis i will see you about this tomorrowi will call at
