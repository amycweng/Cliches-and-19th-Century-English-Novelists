mysteries of london illustration chapter i the travellingcarriage it was about nine oclock in the evening of the nd of november that a travellingcarriage stopped on its way to london to change horses at the principal hotel in the little town of staines the inmates of the vehicle were two ladiesan elderly domestic in livery and a female attendant occupied the box the night was clear fine and frosty the moon shone brightly and the carriage lamps threw a strong glare to a considerable distance in front of the vehicle the active ostlers speedily unharnessed the four wearied steeds and substituted as many fresh ones in their place the two postboys leapt into their saddles the landlord cried all rightand the carriage rolled rapidly away from the inn the horses shoes striking fire against the stones if there be any thing particularly calculated to raise the spirits said one lady to the other a few minutes after the chariot had left the peaceful town behind it is travelling upon such a beauteous night as this i am delighted to observe that you are in good spirits this evening my dear lady hatfield was the reply after passing four long months at sir ralph walsinghams country seat london will present fresh attractions for your ladyship my dear miss mordaunt returned lady hatfield in a serious tone you are aware that i am indifferent to those formal parties and ceremonial assemblies which are reckoned amongst the pleasures of the fashionable world and i can assure you that had not my uncle purported to return to london in a few days my own inclinations would have urged me to prolong my stay at walsingham manor for my part said miss mordaunt i am quite delighted with the idea of hastening back to the great metropolis a summer in the country is only tolerable because each day brings one nearer to the enjoyments of a winter in town but really my dear lady hatfield you are not reasonable rich young and beautiful as you areyour own mistressand with the handsomest man in england dying to lay his coronet at your feet i shall never marry julia hastily interrupted lady hatfield pray let us change the conversation a few minutes ago i was in excellent spirits and now she pausedand a deep sigh escaped her bosom did i not say that you were quite unreasonable exclaimed her companion here am ifive years older than yourselffor i do not mind telling you my dear friend that i shall never see thirty againand yet i have not renounced the idea of changing my condition i know that i am neither so goodlooking nor so wealthy as youstill i have my little ambition sir christopher blunt would deem himself honoured were i to smile graciously upon him but my brother the lieutenantwho by the by expects his captaincy in a few days thanks to the interest of your kind uncle sir ralphdeclares that if ever i marry a mere knight he will never speak to me again lady hatfield had fallen into a profound reverie and paid not the slightest regard to the confidential outpourings of her garrulous companion miss mordaunt who laboured under the pleasing impression that lady hatfields silence was occasioned by the deep interest which she took in the present topic continued to rattle away with her tongue as fast as the carriage did with its wheels i am sure it was a very great act of kindness in you to ask me to spend the winter with you in london for as papa is compelled to reside in ireland in consequence of the unsettled state of his tenantry i should have been under the necessity of returning to the emerald isle after my four months visit with you to walsingham manor had you not taken that compassion on me but let us speak of yourself dear lady hatfield without a soul in the world to control your actionswith the means of procuring every enjoymentand with lord ellingham going mad on your account julia said lady hatfield with a startagain i beseech you to drop this subject and as you will be my companion for some months to come let me now once for all enjoin you to abstain from such topics as you cannot read the secrets of my heart pray bear in mind the fact that many a light word uttered thoughtlessly and with no malicious intent may touch a chord that will thrill she added calmly but bitterly to the inmost recesses of my soul oh my dear lady hatfield exclaimed miss mordaunt who in spite of her loquacity was a very goodnatured person i am rejoiced that you have given me this warning and how foolish of me not to have observedwhat indeed i now rememberthat the topic of love never was agreeable to you to be sure it was during the sermon upon the felicity of the wedded state that you fainted and were taken into the vestry lady hatfield writhed in mental agony and bitterly at that moment did she repent the invitation which she had given her thoughtless companion to pass the winter with her in london the carriage had now reached the little town of bedfont which it traversed without stopping and continued its rapid way towards hounslow but all of a sudden the course of the chariot was checkedas if by an unexpected impediment in the way and the horses began to plunge frightfully at the same time the ladysmaid on the box uttered a dreadful scream lady hatfield drew down the window nearest to her the chaise that moment came to a full stop and a stern but evidently disguised voice exclaimed keep your horses quiet you damned foolsand dont mind me if you stir till i give you leave ill blow out the brains of both of you robbers shrieked miss mordaunt in a despairing tone oh what will become of us lady hatfield looked from the window and at the same instant a man mounted on horseback with a black mask over his countenance and a pistol in each hand was by the side of the vehicle villain cried the liveryservant on the box but you shall swing for this perhaps i may said the highwayman coolly though still speaking in a feigned tone as is the custom with individuals of his profession upon such occasions as the one we are describing and if you attempt to move old fellow from where you are an ounce of lead shall tumble you down from your perch beg pardon maam continued the robber turning towards lady hatfield who had shrunk back into the corner of the carriage the moment the desperado appeared at the window sorry to inconvenience you butyour purse lady hatfield handed the highwayman her reticule good said he perceiving by its weight and a certain jingling sound which it sent forth that it contained gold but you have a companion maamher purse miss mordaunt complied with this demand and implored the good gentleman not to murder her the highwayman gave no reply but vouchsafed a most satisfactory proof of his intended forbearance in that respect by putting spurs to his steed and darting off like an arrow in the direction of hounslow cowardly villains that you are ejaculated the liveryservant hurling this reproach against the postboys and what are you old fool cried the postillion who rode the wheelhorse but hell be nabbed yet drive ondrive on exclaimed lady hatfield from the window we are all frightenedand not hurt indeed my dear said miss mordaunt as the carriage started off rapidly once more i am seriously hurtgrievously wounded you julia cried her ladyship in unfeigned surprise yesin pocket was the answer implying deep vexation all the remainder of my quarters allowance oh compose yourself on that head interrupted lady hatfield you shall not be compelled to acquaint mr mordaunt with your loss this assurance conveying a promise of pecuniary assistance materially tended to tranquillise the mind of miss mordaunt but the event which had just occurredapart from the mere robbery of her reticuleawoke the most painful reflections in the mind of lady hatfield by the by said miss mordaunt after a short pausefor she never remained long silentthis audacious outrage reminds me of something your uncle sir ralph walsingham was telling me one day when you interrupted him in the middle i think he informed me that about six or seven years agowhen you were only eighteen or nineteenyou were staying at your dear lamented fathers countryhouse where you were quite alonefor of course one does not call the servants anybody when the mansion was broken into by robbers during the night julia exclaimed lady hatfield her whole frame fearfully convulsed by the powerful though useless efforts which she made to subdue her agitation never i implore you again allude to that dreadful event welli never will said miss mordaunt and yet if one must not speak of lovenor yet of marriagenor yet of midnight burglaries nayi was wrong to cut you short thus abruptly remarked lady hatfield now endeavouring to rob her prayer of the importance with which her solemn earnestness of manner had invested it only do choose some more enlivening topic after the fright which we have just experienced the first thing tomorrow morning said miss mordaunt who had not noticed the full extent of the impression which her allusion to the burglary of some years back had made upon her companionfor julia was too flippant superficial and volatile to pay much attention to the emotions of othersthe first thing tomorrow morning we must give information to the bow street runners concerning this highway robbery secondly we must write to the landlord at staines to tell him what a couple of cowardly fellows he has got in the shape of these postillionsand thirdly you must discharge old mason who is evidently incapable of protecting his mistress much less her friends discharge old mason exclaimed lady hatfield impossible how could he have protected us he is unarmedwhereas the highwayman flourished two large pistols doubtless loaded but here we are safe at hounslow the carriage drew up at the door of the hotel in this town and the postillions immediately narrated the particulars of the robbery to the landlord and his attendant tribe of hangerson well this is fortunate cried the landlord when the tale was told quite a godsend as one may say as how please sir exclaimed the elder postboy astonished at the remark whyit happens that dykes the famous bow street officer is in the hotel at this very instant said the landlord john he added turning to a waiter who stood near beg mr dykes to step this way and whats dykes doing down here asked the postboy when the waiter had disappeared to execute the commission he had received hes been investigating a cendiary fire replied an ostler for the landlord disdaining to hold any farther converse with a postillion had stepped up to the window to inquire whether the ladies chose to alight having received a negative answer accompanied with an intimation that the sooner the carriage was allowed to proceed the more agreeable it would be to lady hatfield and miss mordaunt the landlord returned towards the spot where the postillions the hangerson of the hotel and other loungers were grouped together mr dykes almost immediately afterwards made his appearance in the form of a tall stout heavy but powerfully built man shabbygenteel in his attire and carrying a strong ashstick in his hand the particulars of the highway robbery were described to him in a very few moments how was the fellow dressed asked the officer a black coat said the first postboy noit wasnt cried the second then what was it demanded mr dykes i dont knowbut im sure it wasnt a black un was the highly satisfactory answer describe his horse said dykes impatiently brownswitch tailstanding about fourteen hands nonsense ejaculated the second postillion interrupting his companion who had volunteered the explanation it was a light baythe moon fell full upon itso did the carriagelights come i see we are only losing time cried the officer which way did he go he galloped off in this direction was the reply which remained uncontradicted then hell be in london tonight whichever road he took said mr dykes if your ladies will give me a cast as far as town ill be after the villain perhaps he turned off to the left towards hatton and so over by hanwell and then shepherds bush or else he made straight for richmond and so over into surrey but one way or another hes sure to be in london by midnight and ten to one if i dont pounce on him my business is done down here and i may just as well toddle back tonight as tomorrow morning the substance of these remarks was communicated to lady hatfield who could not well do otherwise than accord a seat on the box to mr dykes charlotte the ladysmaid removing to the interior of the carriage these arrangements having been effected the vehicle pursued its way and shortly after eleven oclock it drew up at the door of a mansion on piccadilly hill mr dykes having asked the ladies a few questions promised to communicate the result of his efforts to capture the highwayman and then took his departure lady hatfield and miss mordaunt shortly retired to their respective bedchambers the latter to dream of the delights of londonthe former to moisten her pillow with tears for the recent adventure had awakened in her mind feelings of the most agonising description chapter ii tom rain and old death it was about halfpast eight on the following morning when two individuals entered a publichouse in white hart street drury lane one was a man of about thirty years of age with florid complexion light hair and red whiskersyet possessing a countenance which viewed as a whole was very far from disagreeable his eyes were of a deep blue and indicated not only goodhumour but a certain generosity of disposition which was not impaired by an association with many less amiable qualitiessuch as a wild recklessness of character an undaunted bravery a love of perilous adventure and a sad deficiency of principle on particular points the nature of which will hereafter transpire he was evidently proud of a very fine set of teeth the brilliancy of which compensated for the somewhat coarse thickness of his lips and the delicate whiteness of his hands showed that he did not earn his livelihood by any arduous labour in person he was about the middleheightby no means inclined to corpulencyand yet possessing a wellknit frame with a muscular power indicative of great physical strength his dress partook of the halfsporting halfrakish characterconsisting of a high chimneypot kind of hat with very narrow brims a checked blue silk neckerchief fine linen a buff waistcoat cutaway newmarketstyle of green coat drabbreeches and topboots the proper name of this flash gentleman was thomas rainford but his friends had taken the liberty of docking each word of a syllable and he was invariably known as tom rain the other individual was an old man of at least sixty with white hair but eyes of fire glaring from beneath a pair of thick shaggy grey brows he was upwards of six feet in height and but little bowed by the weight of years which he bore having lost all his teeth his mouth had fallen in so as to form a complete angle the depth of which was rendered the more remarkable by the extreme prominence of his hooked nose and his projecting chin he was as thin as it was possible to be without having the bones actually protruding through the skin which hung upon them like a tanned leather casing he was dressed in a long grey surtout coat reaching below his knees a pair of shabby black trousers very short and black cloth gaiters fitting loosely over that description of shoes generally denominated highlows on his head he wore a greasy cap with a large front his linen was by no means of the cleanest and his appearance altogether was excessively unprepossessingif not absolutely revolting what his real name was very few of even his most intimate acquaintances were aware for his dreadful emaciation of form had procured for him the frightful pseudonym of old death tom rain and his hideous companion entered the publichouse in white hart street nodded familiarly to the landlord as they passed by the bar and ascended the stairs to a private room on the first floor having seated themselves at the table tom rain began the conversation well have you considered my proposal he asked i have replied the old man in a deep sepulchral tone but i am cautiousvery cautious my good friend so you told me when i saw you three days ago for the first time observed rain impatiently but tullock the landlord of this place is a pal of yours and he knows me well too hasnt he satisfied you about me wellwell i cant say that he hasnt answered old death still a cautious man like me never says yes in a hurry tullock knew you eight or nine years ago down in the country and theres no doubt that you was then a right sort of blade and so i am now cried tom rain striking the table angrily with his clenched fist softlysoftly my good friend said old death we shall agree better afterwards if we have a good understanding at first i was going to observe that for some years tullock loses sight of you he comes up to town takes this public and doesnt even remember that theres such a fellow in existence as yourself until you make your appearance here a few days back when he received me with open arms and introduced me to you added tom rain but go on what next ah what next replied old death with a horrible chuckle that issued from his throat as if it come from the depths of a tomb whyyou frankly and candidly told me your intentions and views i admitbut you cant do without meyou cant do without me my dear boyand you know it again the hideous old man chuckled in his cavernlike tones i never denied what you say answered tom rain on the contrary i am well aware that no one in my line can think of doing business about london and making london his headquarters without your assistance to be sure not said the old man evidently pleased by this compliment ive had the monopoly of it all for this thirty years and never once got into trouble but then i do my business with cautionsuch caution ive dealings with all that are worth having dealings with and not one of them knows even where i live only let me find a sure and readymoney market for my goods exclaimed tom rain and ill do more business with you than all the chaps you speak of put together well i suppose we must come to terms said old death after a short pause tullock assures me that you were straightforward when he knew you in the country and though time changes mens minds as well as their faces ill take it for granted that youre all right you remember the conditions not a word you uttered three days ago has escaped my memory answered rain good when shall you commence business i opened my shop last night replied tom with a hearty laugh nonsense cried the old man fixing a glance of delight upon his new friend you dont mean to say thatin a word is this yours as he spoke old death drew from his pocket the mornings newspaper pointed to a particular advertisement and held the journal towards his companion tom rains countenance was overclouded for a moment but almost immediately afterwards it expanded into an expression of mingled surprise and satisfaction and snapping his fingers joyfully he exclaimed is it possible could it have been her oh this business is speedily settled and rising from his seat he rang the bell violently a potboy answered the summons pen ink and paper and a messenger to carry a letter said tom rain with extraordinary rapidity of utterance the boy disappeared and old death recovering partially from the astonishment into which his companions ejaculations and manner on reading the advertisement had thrown him exclaimed what the devil are you after now you shall see in a moment was the reply but i dont promise you any explanation of what you will see he added with another hearty laugh the boy returned bringing writing materials and intimating that he was willing to be the bearer of the letter tom rain told him to wait then having hastily written a few lines upon a sheet of paper he tossed the note over to old death who read as follows remember the night of the th of october and stop the inquiries instituted in respect to the little business referred to by the advertisement in this mornings times this is past all comprehension exclaimed the old man still keeping his eyes fixed upon the paper the note has not even a signature it does not require one coolly observed tom rain as he snatched the letter from his companion and proceeded to fold it up and do you hope to crush the business by means of that scrap of writing asked old death evidently perplexed what to think i dont merely hopei am certain of accomplishing my object was the reply now mind you aint deceiving yourself tom said old death the man who has taken up the affair is persevering as a beaver and crafty as a fox you may see that he is in earnest by the expedition he must have made to get the advertisement into this mornings paper i should have hardly thought it possible to be done however done it isand though it gives no description of the person yet it offers a good reward for his apprehension no one knows what trivial circumstance may afford a trace and enough of this old friend cried tom and handing the letter now duly folded wafered and directed to the boy he said take this to the address written upon it see if theres any answer and i shall wait here till you come back look aliveand youll earn a crown by the job the boy hastened away to execute the commission which he had received and so that was your business master tom observed old death as soon as the messenger had disappeared wellyou have made a good beginning it promises bright things what do you fancy that i havent had plenty of experience down in the country cried rainford ah i could tell you a tale or twobut no matter now and the little business tom inquired the old mandid it turn out worth the trouble the advertisement says harkee master death exclaimed rainford firmly that business does not regard you our compact dates from this morning oh very goodvery good interrupted old death in a surly tone be it as you say but rememberif you do get into any trouble on account of this you mustnt expect me to help you out of it neither do i answered tom however i am a generous chap in my way and i dont mind yielding to you in this instance for you must suppose that i can see your drift plain enough the advertisement says a purse containing a banknote for fifty pounds and eleven sovereigns and a reticule containing a purse in which there were three tenpound notes and sixteen sovereigns this is accurate enough the reticule i flung away the two purses i keptand here they are thus speaking tom rainford threw upon the table the objects last mentioned old deaths eyes glared with a kind of savage joy as they caught a glimpse of the yellow metal and the flimsy paper through the network of the purses pretty thingspretty things he muttered between his toothless gums i think youll do well tom and i am sure i shall but turn the money out on the table you care more about the handling of it than i do old death grinned horribly a ghastly smile and lost no time in obeying the hint conveyed twentyseven golden boys and eighty pounds in banknotes said the hideous man the gold is yoursthats part of our conditions half the value of the banknotes is mine for the risk and trouble in cashing themthats also part and parcel of our conditions so if i give you forty sovereignsforty golden sovereigns tomwe shall be square just so carelessly observed rain old death produced a greasy leather bag from a pocket in the breast of his greycoat and counted thence the forty sovereigns on which he had laid such emphasis tom rain thrust the coin into his breeches pocket without reckoning it while his companion first secured the banknotes in the greasy bag and then threw the two purses into the fire youre a good fellow toma generoushearted fellowand im much pleased with you said the old man i shall leave you now as i have some little trifling matters to attend to in another part of the town when you want me you know where to leave a message all right ejaculated tom rainford who did not appear over anxious to detain his new friend they accordingly separatedold death taking his departure and the other remaining behind to await the return of his messenger it is necessary to state that when old death quitted the publichouse he was joined a few paces up the street by a sharplooking illclad youth of about fifteen whose pale countenance bright eyes and restless glances denoted mental activity struggling against bad health approaching the old man the youth walked by his side without uttering a syllable jacob said death after a brief pause and sinking his voice to a whisper you saw that swelllooking chap who went into tullocks with me just now welli told you to be here this morning at a particular hour on purpose that you might see him he will be useful to mevery useful but i must know more of himand he is not the man to be pumped do you wait here and watch him dog him aboutfind out where he goeswhere he liveswhether he has a mistress or a wife or neither or both added jacob with a low chuckle yesany thing that concerns him in fine continued old death i am going to toby bunces in the dials where i shall be for the next three or four hours if im wanted very goodi understand said jacob and retracing his steps he hid himself in a court which commanded a view of tullocks publichouse let us now return to tom rain who was waiting for the reappearance of his messenger it was shortly before ten when the potboy once more stood in his presence well said rainford interrogatively i seed the lady herself was the reply and i gived her the note i thought it was somethink particklerand so i told the flunkey id ony deliver it into her hands and how did she receive it asked tom i was showed into a parlour and told to wait in a few minutes the door opened and in come a ladysuch a splendid creatur i never seed such a fine ooman in my life before our bargals nothink to her so i gived her the note she looked at the writing on the outside but didnt seem to know it then she opened the letterand my eye didnt she give a start i thought shed have fell slap on her face for a minute or so she couldnt recover herself at last she says tell the writer of this note that it shall be attended toand she put halfacrown into my hand thats all i knew it would be so cried tom rain in a triumphant tone heres the five shillings i promised you my boy and i dont think youve made a bad mornings work of it the lad grinned a smile of satisfaction and withdrew rainford soon after descended to the bar conversed for a few minutes with his friend tullock the landlord and then took his departureduly watched by jacob he had reached the corner of drury lane when he felt himself somewhat rudely tapped on the shoulder turning hastily round he was confronted by a tall stout man who without any ceremonial preface exclaimed youre wanted my good fellow i know i am replied tom coolly as he measured the stranger from head to foot with a calm but searching glance and im now on my way to the place where my presence is required just so said the stout man because you are going to favour me with your company that i may introduce you to a party who wishes to become better acquainted with you whos the friend you speak of asked tom in an easy offhand kind of manner sir walter ferguson was the reply so come along with these words the stout man took rainfords arm and led him away to the police court in bow street jacob who was an unsuspected witness of the whole proceeding immediately took the shortest way to seven dials chapter iii bow street the moment mr dykes had lodged his prisoner in one of the cells attached to the court he hurried off to piccadilly hill and knocked loudly at the door of lady hatfields residence upon explaining the nature of his business to the domestic who answered the summons he was admitted into an apartment where lady hatfield and miss mordaunt almost immediately joined him lady hatfield was the orphan daughter of the earl and countess of mauleverer she was an only child the proud title of mauleverer had become extinct with the demise of her father but the family property had devolved to her she was in her twentyfifth year and surpassingly beautifulthe style of her loveliness was fascinating and intellectualrendered the more interesting too by the tinge of melancholy which characterised her countenance her eyes were large and of a deep blue the soul sate enthroned on her pale and lofty foreheadher smile though always plaintively mournful denoted amiability and kindness in stature she was of the middle height and though in the least degree inclining to embonpoint yet the fulness of her form marred not its lightness nor its grace the bust was rounded in voluptuous luxurianceand the hips were expandedbut the waist was naturally smallthe limbs tapered gradually downwardsand her step was so elastic while her gait was easy though dignified that even the most critical judge of female attractions could not have found it in his heart to cavil at her symmetry miss mordaunt was a lady who had seen thirtyfive summers although she would have gone into hysterics had any one suggested that such was really the fact she was short thin and not particularly goodlooking for her hair was of so decided a red that it would have been a mockery instead of a compliment to term it auburn her eyes were grey and her nose suspiciously inclining to the species called pugbut her complexion was good her teeth well preserved and white and her hand very beautifully formed thus when she looked in her glasswhich was as often as she passed near itshe mentally summed up the good and the bad points of her personal appearance invariably striking a balance in favour of the first and thence arriving at the very logical conclusion that she should yet succeed in escaping from a condition of single blessedness it was a little after eleven oclock when lady hatfield and miss mordaunt were informed that mr dykes requested an immediate interview with them some event of that mornings occurrence had already produced a strangean almost alarming effect upon georgianasuch was lady hatfields christian name and in order to regain her spiritsto recover indeed from a sudden shock which she had receivedher ladyship had proposed an early airing in the carriage to this julia who had some shopping to do readily assented they had accordingly just completed their toilette for the purpose and were now waiting in the drawingroom for the arrival of the chariot when the announcement of mr dykess name called such an ejaculation of anguish from lady hatfields lips that miss mordaunt was seriously alarmed but georgianathe expression of whose countenance indicated for an instant the agony of a heart wounded to its very coresubdued her emotions by a violent effort and then in answer to her friends solicitous inquiries attributed the temporary agitation she had experienced to a sudden pain passing through her head it was nevertheless with feelings of mingled terror and repugnance that georgiana accompanied julia to the room where the bow street officer awaited them her very eyelids quivered with suspense when she found herself in the presence of the celebrated thieftaker well ladies exclaimed mr dykes rising from a chair and making an awkward bow as they entered ive good news for you the highwayman is is repeated georgiana with nervous impatience is in custody my lady and all i now want who is in custody demanded georgiana hope for a moment wildly animating her the man that robbed you last night my lady answered the officer or else im dambeg pardonvery much mistaken but how do you know he is the same exclaimed lady hatfield perhaps you may have erredyour suspicions may have misled you ah my lady interrupted dykes totally mistaking the cause of georgianas warmth you surely aint going to plead in favour of a chap that stopped you on the kings highway and did then and there steal from your person and from the person of your friend describe the individual whom you have arrested said lady hatfield abruptly to a nicety i will answered the officer who was now completely in his element about thirty years of agegood complexionlight curly hairred whiskersdark blue eyessplendid teeththick lipsbut heres your carriage come round to the door my lady and nothing could possibly be more convenient please not to waste timeas i think we can get him committed today the moment dykes had begun his description lady georgianas eyes expressed the agonising nature of the suspense which she endured but as he continued and his portraiture became the more definite an ashy paleness overspread her countenance this agitation on her part was not however perceived by either the bow street officer or miss mordaunt for the former had a habit of fixing his eyes on the knob of his ash stick when he was engrossed in a professional topic and the latter was drinking in with greedy ears the description of the supposed highwayman whom she was quite astonished to hear represented as so very discrepant from her idea of what a midnight desperado must be the arrival of the carriage was under the circumstances quite a relief to georgiana and without uttering another objection she allowed mr dykes to have his own way in the matter that experienced officer rang the bell as coolly as if the house was his own and desired that the manservant and ladysmaid who were in attendance on their mistress the preceding night would prepare to accompany him to bow street mason and charlotte speedily obeyed this request and the chariot instead of taking the ladies up bond street conveyed them the two servants and mr dykes to the policeoffice on their arrival mr dykes conducted his witnesses into a private room and after an absence of about five minutes returned with the intelligence that the night charges were just disposed of and that the prisoner was about to be placed in the dock a shudder passed through georgianas frame but with a desperate effort to compose herself she followed mr dykes into the court miss mordaunt and the two servants remaining in the private room until they should be summoned individually to give their testimony as georgiana was a lady of rank and fortune she was not treated as a humble witness would have been but was accommodated with a chair mr dykes assuring her in a confidential whisper that she need not stand up to give her evidence the body of the court was crowded with a motley assembly of spectators the news that a highwayman was about to be examined having spread like wildfire throughout the neighbourhood scarcely was georgiana seated when a sensation on the part of the crowd enabled her to judge that the accused was being brought in and as tom rain leapt nimbly into the dock she cast a rapid glance towards hima glance in which terror was combined with indescribable disgust and aversion the accused affected not to notice her but lounged in a very easy and familiar fashion over the front of the dock surveying first sir walter ferguson and then the clerk with a complacency which would have almost induced an uninitiated stranger to imagine that they were the prisoners and he was the magistrate mr dykes being called upon by sir walter to explain the nature of the charge against the prisoner declared that in consequence of information which he had received the invariable phraseology of old policeofficers he had arrested the accused on suspicion of having stopped lady hatfields carriage on the preceding evening and robbed her ladyship and her ladyships friend of certain monies specified in an advertisement which he had caused to be inserted in that mornings paper mr dykes further stated that having searched the prisoner he had found upon him a considerable sum in gold but none of the banknotes stolen lady hatfield was then sworn and she corroborated the officers statement relative to the robbery has your ladyship any reason to suppose that the prisoner in the dock is the person by whom your carriage was stopped inquired the magistrate i feel well convinced sir was the reply delivered however in a tremulous tone that the prisoner at the bar is not the man by whom i was robbed a smile of triumph curled the lips of tom rain but mr dykes surveyed georgiana with stupid astonishment not the man my lady he ejaculated at length why last night your ladyship could give no description of what the robber was or what he was not dykes hold your tongue cried the magistrate her ladyship is upon her oath your worship said georgiana in a firmer voice than before i was so bewildered last eveningso overcome with terror naturally so lady hatfield observed the magistrate with a very courteous smile which seemed to say that he would rather believe the bare word of a member of the aristocracyespecially a ladythan the oaths of all his officers and runners out together in fact continued sir walter blandly you were too much flurried to use a common expression to reply calmly and deliberately to any questions which dykes may have put to you last evening such was indeed the case your worship answered georgiana this morning however i have been enabled to collect my ideas and to recall to mind the smallest details of the robbery the highwayman had a black mask upon his face but by a sudden movement of his horse as he stood by the carriage window the mask slipped aside and i caught a glimpse of his countenance by the moonlight and that countenance said the magistrate was quite different from the prisoners replied lady hatfield firmly your ladyship did not make that statement when i gave you the description of the prisoner just now said dykes evidently bewildered by the nature of georgianas testimony because you hurried me away together with my friend and two of my servants in a manner so precipitate that i had no time to utter a word returned lady hatfield moreover as you had taken the prisoner into custody i believed it to be necessary that his case should be brought beneath the cognizance of his worship georgiana spoke in a tone apparently so decided and calm that the officer knew not how to reply although in his heart he suspected her sincerity the magistrate consulted the clerk and after the interchange of a few whispers sir walter said i see no reason for detaining the prisoner there is evidently some mistake on your part dykes your worship exclaimed the officer i know not what to think can the prisoner give a good account of himself he rides into london from richmond at six oclock this morning puts his horse up at an inn in the borough goes to a coffeehouse in another street to have his breakfast and leaves a pair of pistols for the waiter to take care of for him then walks over to a suspicious public not a hundred miles from this court meets there a man that me and my partners have long had our eyes on and when he is searched has a large sum in gold about his person do you hear what the officer says prisoner inquired the magistrate i do your worship answered tom rain coolly and i can explain it all i come up to london on business which requires the sum of money found upon me i put up my horse where i think fit and i go elsewhere to get my breakfast because i can have it cheaper than at the inn i was armed with pistols because i had to travel a lonely road in the dark and i left them at the coffeehouse because i did not choose to drag them about with me all day long mr dykes was about to reply when two decentlydressed men who had entered the court a few minutes previously stepped forward please your worship said the first i have known mr rainford the last four years and a more respectable man does not exist he came up to london to buy a couple of horses of me and he was to pay ready money my names watkins your worship and ive kept livery and bait stables in great queen street lincolnsinnfields for the last seventeen years and i your worship said the other person in his turn can answer for mr rainford if you doubt my respectability your worship send one of your officers round to compton street and see if the name of bertinshaw isnt painted up in precious large letters over the best jewellers shop and pawnbrokers interrupted mr dykes significantly welland pawnbrokers too added bertinshaw im not ashamed of the calling then you are both prepared to guarantee the prisoners appearance at any future time said the magistrate certainly your worship was the joint reply to answer any charge that may be brought against him continued sir walter the response was again in the affirmative on the part of watkins and bertinshaw the magistrate stated the amount of the recognizances which were to be entered into and tom rain was desired to stand down from the dock this intimation he obeyed with the same air of calm indifference which had characterized him throughout the proceedings and which had only been for a moment disturbed by the profound astonishment he had experienced when two men whom he had never before seen nor even heard of in his life stepped forward to give him so excellent a character and become his bail but a moments reflection convinced him that old death was the unseen friend who worked the machinery of this manuvre while the clerk was filling up the bailbond lady georgiana retired from the office her bosom a prey to feelings of a strangely conflicting naturejoy at having passed through an ordeal which she had dreadedgrief at having stained her soul with the fell crime of deliberate perjuryand agony at the sad reminiscences which the presence of rainford had recalled so forcibly to her mind miss mordaunt and the two servants were astonished to hear the unexpected turn which the proceedings had taken but their attention was almost immediately absorbed in the condition of lady hatfield who scarcely had time to communicate to them the result of her examination in the court when a sudden faintness came over her she had exhausted all her energies in the endeavour to maintain an air of calmness and to reply in a tone of sincerity when in the presence of the magistrate and now a reaction took placeher courage gave waythe weight of fearful reminiscences overpowered herthe glow of excitement which had mantled her cheeks changed to a deathlike pallorand she fainted in the arms of her friend fortunately miss mordaunt had a bottle of volatile salts with her and by these means georgiana was speedily recovered she was then led to her carriage but she did not appear to breathe freely until the vehicle was some distance from the policecourt illustration chapter iv esther de medina let us now return to the interior of the policeoffice the clerk was drawing up the bailbond the two securities were conversing in whispers with tom rain whom they had affected to greet when he descended from the dock as an old acquaintance and mr dykes was leaning gloomily against the partition which separated the magistrates desk from the body of the courtwhen the entrance of two persons produced a new sensation amongst the crowd one was an officer of the court the other was a lady closely veiled and enveloped in a cloak of rich material her form was tall and even though her entire frame was now convulsed with intense anguish as she passed amidst the gaping throng to the chair which lady hatfield had occupied two or three minutes previously yet that excess of grief and terror did not bow her down nor impair the graceful dignity of her gait the officer motioned her to seat herself an intimation which she evidently accepted with gratitude what is it bingham inquired the magistrate of the officer please your worship was the reply its a serious charge and the prosecutor will be here in a moment very well said the magistrate i will take it directly who is she whispered dykes accosting his brother officer her name is esther de medina she tells me returned bingham the question and answer were overheard by tom rainford who was standing close by the officers and the announcement of the ladys name produced a strange and almost electrical effect upon him the devilmecare recklessness of his manner suddenly disappeared and a sentiment of profound commiseration and deep interest in respect to esther de medina seemed to occupy his mind he was about to question mr bingham relative to the charge which he had against her when the clerk called upon him and his securities to sign the bond this ceremony was speedily performed and rains money was returned to him by mr dykes who however looked at him in a manner which seemed to sayi know i am not mistaken in you although you have contrived to get off but ill have you another time tom cared nothing for the sinister looks of the bow street officer neither did he pay much attention to the gold which he now poured back into his pocket for all his thoughts appeared to be absorbed in the presence of the veiled lady come along with us whispered bertinshaw and well celebrate your escape over a bottle of wine at my place nonot now replied tom hastily i mean to stay and hear this case it interests me will you join us presently asked his new friend who had just now pretended to be a very old one yes yes answered tom in an hour or so bertinshaw and watkins then took their departure now bingham cried the clerk what is it at that moment a gentleman of handsome appearance and middle age entered the court heres the prosecutor who will explain the matter said the officer the prisoner suddenly remembering the respect due to the bench raised her veil and at the same time she glanced in an eager inquiring manner towards the individual who now appeared against her but we must pause to describe her she was not more than eighteen years of age and surpassingly lovely her complexion was a clear transparent olive beneath which the delicate tinge of carnation was not entirely chased away from her cheeks by the terror and grief that now oppressed her her face was of the aquiline casther forehead broad high and intelligent her nose curved but not too prominent in shape her mouth small with thin vermilion lips revealing teeth of pearly whiteness her chin sweetly rounded and her eyes large black and brilliant and never did more splendid orbs of light mirror the whole power of the soul or flash brighter glances from beneath richlyfringed lids then her brows were so delicately pencilled and so finely arched that they gave an air of dignity to that lovelythat fascinating countenance her hair too was of the deepest blacka black so intense that the ravens wing might not have compared with it silken and glossy the luxuriant mass was parted above the forehead and flowing in two shining bandsone on each side of the face for which they appeared to form an ebony framewas gathered behind the ears in stature she was tall sylphlike and graceful her shoulders had that fine slope which the italian masters so much admired and with which they were delighted to endow the heroines of their pictures her waist was admirably proportioned and not rendered too thin by the unnatural art of tightlacing her hand was of exceeding beauty her feet and ankles were in perfect keeping with the exquisite symmetry of her form and her gestures were full of dignity and grace she was a jewess and if the most glorious beauty were honoured with a diadem then should esther de medina have become queen of the scattered race the moment she raised her veil all who could catch a glimpse of her countenance were struck with astonishment at the dazzling loveliness thus revealed and even the magistrate felt anxious to learn what misadventure could have placed so peerless a being within the grasp of justice her crime could scarcely be robbery for she was welldressed and had the appearance of belonging to even a wealthy family besides her faceher eyes seemed to denote a conscious purity of soul in spite of the painful emotions which her present situation had excited within her bosom but the person who was most interestedmost astonished by the sudden revelation of that exquisite countenance was tom rain it was not with lustful desire that he surveyed her it was not with any unholy passion on the contrary it was with a sentiment of deep devotion and profound sympathy he also manifested extreme curiosity to learn upon what possible charge esther de medina could have been brought thither on her part she was evidently altogether unacquainted with the person of tom rain for as she cast a rapid and timid glance around her eyes lingered not upon him the middleaged handsomelooking man who had just entered the office was now desired to state the grounds upon which esther de medina was in custody this witness deposed that his name was edward gordon and that he was a diamondmerchant residing in arundel street strand on the st of october at about five oclock in the evening a female called upon him and requested him to purchase of her a diamond ring which she produced he examined it by the light of the lamp burning in the apartment where he received her and finding that it was really a jewel of some value he offered her a price which he considered fair that sum was thirty guineas she endeavoured to obtain more but he did not consider himself justified in acceding to her wish finally she accepted his proposal received the amount left the ring and departed he went out immediately after carefully locking the door of the room having an engagement to dine with a friend he returned home late and did not enter that particular room until the following morning when he discovered that a set of diamonds which he remembered to have been lying in an open case upon the table at the time the female called on the preceding evening was missing he searched vainly in all parts of the room and at length came to the fixed conclusion that the female in question had stolen the diamonds he gave immediate information to bingham the officer together with an accurate description of the suspected person for she was upwards of twenty minutes with him on the evening of the st and he had therefore seen enough of her to know her again moreover added the prosecutor two clear days only have elapsed since the interview which took place between us and i appeal to your worship whether the countenance of the prisoner when once seen can be readily forgotten for painful as it is to accuse so young and interesting a person of such a crime my duty to society compels me to take this step and i have no hesitation in declaring that the prisoner is the female who sold me the ring a profound sigh escaped from the bosom of esther but she uttered not a word bingham the officer then proved that he called about half an hour previously upon mr gordon to inform him that he had vainly endeavoured to discover a clue to the supposed thief mr gordon was on the point of going out upon particular business and the officer in order not to detain him walked a part of the way in his company so that they might converse upon the subject of the robbery as they went along they were passing through lincolnsinnfields when they met the prisoner at the bar mr gordon instantly recognised her and the officer took her into custody she manifested much indignation and said that there must be some mistake but when the nature of the charge was stated to her she turned deadly pale and burst into tears rainford had listened to these statements with the deepestthe most intense interest and his countenance underwent various changes especially while mr gordon was giving his evidence at one moment tom exhibited surprisethen indignationand lastly the most unfeigned sorrow but suddenly an idea seemed to strike him for a minute did he reflect profoundly and then joy animated his features hastily quitting the court he hurried to the coffeehouse opposite called for writing materials and penned the following letter nov my lordesther de medina is at bow street accused of a crime which is alleged to have been committed at about five oclock in the evening of the st of october it is for you to prove her innocence delay not then an instant an unknown friend to esther throwing a shilling upon the table tom rain hurried away took a hackneycoach at the nearest station and desired to be driven to the mansion of lord ellingham pallmall west a halfguinea which he slipped into the coachmans hand as he entered the vehicle produced the desired effect for the horses were urged into a pace the rapidity of which seemed to astonish themselves as a proof of what they could do if they chose and in a very short time rainford leapt out at the door of his lordships abode the nobleman was fortunately at home and tom rain delivered the letter to the servant who answered his summons then having desired the coachman to wait as he might have a fare back to bow street rainford hurried away at his utmost speed retracing his steps to the policeoffice in the meantime the clerk had taken down the depositions of mr edward gordon and bingham while the most extraordinary sensation prevailed in the court the youththe lovelinessthe modest yet dignified appearance of esther de medina enlisted all sympathies in her favour and many a rude heart then present felt a pang at the idea of believing her to be guilty she had stood up when the prosecutor was called against her but when he reached that point in his evidence which mentioned the loss of his diamonds she clasped her hand convulsively together and trembling with agitation sank into the chair from which she had risen when the depositions were taken down the magistrate said prisoner you have heard the very serious charge made against you have you any thing to say in your defence then she spoke for the first time since she had entered the court and though her words were delivered with impassioned emphasis the melodious tones of her voice sounded like a silver bell upon the ears of all present sir i am innocenti am innocent she exclaimed oh god knows that i am innocent the glance she darted from beneath her darkly fringed lids spoke even more eloquently than her words and every feature of her fine countenance seemed to bear testimony to the truth of her declaration would you not do well to send for your friends asked the magistrate in a kind tone these words seemed to touch her most acutely they summed up as it were all the painful features of her most distressing position oh my fathermy dear dear father she exclaimed her countenance expressing so much bitterbitter anguish that there was scarcely an unmoistened eye in the court your worship i do not wish to prosecute this casei am sorry i have gone so far said the diamondmerchant wiping away the tears from his cheeksfor he was really a goodnatured man it is not in my power to stay the proceedings replied sir walter ferguson the evidence is unfortunately strong against the prisoner she would do well to send for her friends let the case stand over for half an hour esther was accordingly conducted into the magistrates private room where she was visited by the femalesearcher who endeavoured to persuade her with as much gentleness as she could command to mention the residence of her parents alas my mother has long been dead was the mournful reply and my poor fatheroh it would break his heart were he to know she checked herself and fell into a profound reveriedespair expressed in her countenance during the remainder of the half hour which intervened ere she was led back to the office she replied only in vague and unsatisfactory but not selfinculpating monosyllables to the questions addressed to her at length the femalesearcher gave her an indirect intimation that her punishment on trial would be more lenient if she admitted her guilt and expressed her contrition what she exclaimed with a recovering sob do you really deem me culpable of this most heinous charge my god have the christians no mercyno compassion oh i should not speak thus to you but i know that our race is looked upon with suspicion we are prejudged because we are jews and yet she added in a different and prouder tone there are as noble sentimentsas generous feelingsas estimable qualities amongst the members of the scattered tribe as in the hearts of those christians who have persecuted our nation for centuries and centuries the woman to whom these words were addressed was astonished at the enthusiastic manner in which the beautiful jewess spoke for there was something at that moment sublimely interestingeloquently commanding about esther de medina as the rich colour glowed more deeply upon her cheeks the blue veins dilated on her proud forehead and the whole power of her soul seemed thrown into her magnificent eyes it was at this moment that the usher of the court entered to conduct the jewess back into the office once more she stood in the presence of the magistratenow no longer subdued and crushed with terror but nerved as it were by conscious innocence to meet the accusation brought against her tom rain had returned to the court and by mingling with the crowd of spectators anxiously watched the countenance of esther de medina prisoner said the magistrate have you anything now to offer in your defence or have you sent to communicate with your friends relative to the position in which you are placed sir answered esther her soft and musical tones falling like a delicious harmony upon the ears i have but one word to utter in my defence and if i did not speak it when i first stood before you it was simply because this terrible accusation bursting so abruptly upon the head of an innocent person stupefied medeprived me of the power of collecting my ideas neither was it until within a moment of my return into the court that the fact which i am about to state flashed to my memory siri was not in london from two oclock in the afternoon until halfpast ten oclock at night on the st of october a gentlea very gentle smile played upon her vermilion lips as she uttered these words and it was during the interval which you name that the prosecutor was visited by the female whom he believes to have robbed him of his diamonds observed the magistrate i deny having visited the prosecutor at all answered esther in a firm but respectful tone i never sold him a ringi never sold an article of jewellery to a living being placed by the honest industry of my father above want she continued proudly i labour not under the necessity of parting with my jewellery to obtain money at this moment a fine tall handsome young man of about six and twenty years of age entered the court he was dressed in an elegant but unassuming manner his bearing was lofty without being proud and his fine blue eyes indicated a frank and generous disposition slightly inclining in acknowledgment of the respect with which the crowd made way for him to pass he advanced towards the magistrate who instantly recognised him as an acquaintance at the same moment esther started with surprise and murmured the name of lord ellingham to the astonishment of all presenttom rain perhaps exceptedthe nobleman shook esther kindly by the hand saying in the name of heaven miss de medina what unfortunateor rather ridiculous mistake has brought you hither sir walter ferguson immediately directed the clerk to read over the depositions what ejaculated lord ellingham who had scarcely been able to restrain his indignation during the recital of the previous proceedings the daughter of a respectable and wealthy gentleman to be placed in such a position as this but in a moment i will make her innocence apparent at the very time when this robbery was alleged to have taken placeat the hour when the female for whom this young lady has evidently been mistaken called upon the prosecutormiss de medina was not within six miles of arundel street these words produced in the court a sensation which was the more lively because they seemed to corroborate the prisoners own defencea defence which lord ellingham had not heard mr gordon the prosecutor looked astoundedand yet not altogether grieved at the prospect of the prisoners discharge mr de medina continued lord ellingham has only recently arrived in london having retired from an extensive commercial business which he long carried on at liverpool he has become my tenant for a house and small estate situated at a distance of about seven miles from the metropolis and on the st of october i accompanied him and his daughterthe lady now presenton a visit to the property thus leased we left london in my own carriage at about two oclock on the day named and it was between ten and eleven at night when we returned during that interval of several hours miss de medina never quitted her father and myself a murmur of satisfaction arose on the part of the spectators but it was almost immediately interrupted by the entrance of an elderly and venerablelooking man whose countenanceof that cast which ever characterises the sons of the scattered tribehad once been strikingly handsome though not deficient in an expression of generosity it nevertheless exhibited great firmness of disposition and his keen black eyes denoted a resolute unbending and determined soul he was upwards of fiftyfive years of age and was plainly though neatly dressed advancing into the body of the court he cast a rapid glance around my father exclaimed esther and springing forward she threw herself into her parents arms he held her tenderly for a few moments then gently disengaging himself from her embrace he murmured in her ear oh estheresther i can understand it all you have brought this upon yourself but these words were heard only by lord ellingham who had advanced to shake hands with the jew that reproach appeared for the moment to be singular and altogether misplaced as it was impossible that esther could have perpetrated the crime imputed to her but the nobleman had not leisure to reflect upon it for mr de medina now perceived him and accepted the outstretched hand i was accidentally passing by the court said the jew and hearing my own name mentioned by some loungers outside paused to listen their conversation induced me to make inquiries and i learnt all the particulars of this charge and some unknown friend of miss de medina sent me a hasty note conveying the unpleasant intelligence answered lord ellingham but i believe that i have fully convinced his worship of your daughters innocence these last words were uttered in a louder tone than the former part of the observation and were evidently addressed to the magistrate for my part said mr gordon i am perfectly satisfied that there is a grievous misunderstanding in this matter miss de medina is evidently unconnected with it and yet he added as his eyes dwelt upon her countenance never was resemblance so striking howeveri am well pleased to think that miss de medina is not the person by whom i was plundered and i most sincerely implore her pardon for the inconveniencenay the ignominy to which she has been subjected esther turned an appealing glance towards her father as if to remind him of some duty which he ought to perform or to convey some silent prayer which he could well understand but he affected not to notice that rapid but profoundly significant glance the magistrate then declared that the young lady was discharged without the slightest stain upon her character hastily drawing down her thick black veil esther de medina bowed deferentially to the bench and passed out of the office leaning on her fathers arm and accompanied by the earl of ellingham tom rain followed her with his eyes until the door closed behind her for a few moments he remained wrapped up in a deep reverie then heaving a profound sigh he also took his departure chapter v the appeal of love it was about eight oclock in the evening of the day on which so many strange incidents occurred at bow street that lady hatfield was reclining in a melancholy mood upon the sofa in the drawingroom of her splendid mansion she was dressed in black satin which set off the beauty of her complexion to the greatest advantage one of her fair hands drooped over the back of the sofa the other listlessly held a book to the perusal of which she had vainly endeavoured to settle herself there was a mysterious air of mournfulness about her that contrasted strangely with the elegance of the apartment the cheerful blaze of the fire the brilliant lustre of the lamps and the general appearance of wealth and luxury by which she was surrounded that sorrowful expression too was the more unaccountable inasmuch as the social position of georgiana hatfield seemed to be enviable in the extreme beautiful in person possessing rank and wealth and free to follow her own inclinations she might have shone the star of fashionthe centre of that human galaxy whose sphere is the west end of london oh brightgloriously bright are the planets which move in that heaven of their ownand yet how useless is their brilliancy the planets of gods own sky are made to bestow their light upon the orbs which without them would revolve in darkness but the planets of the sphere of aristocracy and fashion throw not a single ray upon the millions of inferior stars which are compelled to circle around them to lady hatfield the pleasures and dissipation of the west end were unwelcome and she seldom entered into society save when a refusal would prove an offence up to the age of seventeen or eighteen she had been remarkable for a happy joyous and gay disposition but a sudden change came over her at that period of her life and since then her habits had grown retiredher disposition mournful but let us return to her as she lay reclining on the sofa in the drawingroom the robbery of the preceding night and the events of the morning had evidently produced a powerful impression upon her mind at times an expression of acute anguish distorted her fair countenance for a moment and once or twice she compressed her lips forcibly as if to restrain a burst of mental agony the timepiece upon the mantel had just proclaimed the hour of eight when a domestic entered the room and announced the earl of ellingham georgiana started upassumed a placid expression of countenanceand advanced to receive the young nobleman who as he took her hand respectfully pressed it to his lips your ladyship will i hope pardon me for intruding at this hour he said as he conducted her back to the sofa and then took a chair at a short distance but i was not aware of your return to town until an hour ago when i perused in the evening paper an account of the outrage of last night and the investigation at bow street this morning how annoying it must have been to you my dear lady hatfield to have gone through the ordeal of a visit to a policecourt there is something gloomy and dispiriting in the aspect of these tribunals which the crimes of the human race have rendered necessary observed georgiana the countenances of those persons whom i beheld at the policeoffice this morning had all a certain sinister expression which i cannot define but which seemed to proclaim that they never contemplated aught save the dark side of society the same idea struck me this day said lord ellingham for i also paid a visit to bow streetand scarcely an hour i should conceive after you must have left the office but enough of this subject the words bow streetpoliceand tribunal grate painfully upon the ear even of the innocentthat is if they possess hearts capable of sorrowing for the woes and crimes of their fellowcreatures lady hatfield continued the earl drawing his chair a little closer it was to converse upon another topicyes another and a more tender topicthat i have hastened to your presence this evening georgiana was about to replybut the words died upon her quivering lipsand an oppressive feeling kept her silent yes my dear lady hatfield continued the earl drawing his chair still more nighi can no longer exist in this state of suspense during the whole of last winter i was often in your society you were kind enough to permit my visitsand it was impossible to be much with you and not learn to love you you departed suddenly for the country last july but i dared not followfor you had not even informed me of your intended retirement from london at so early a period pardon me if i say i felt hurtyes hurt lady hatfieldbecause i loved you and yet neverduring that interval of four monthshas your image been absent from my mind and now i am again attracted towards you by a spell stronger than my powers of resistance oh you must long ago have read my heart georgianasay thencan you do you love me in return there was something so sincereso earnestand yet so manly in the fluent language of the earl of ellinghamhis fine countenance was lighted up with so animated an expression of hope and loveand his eyes bore such complete testimony to the candour of his speechthat georgiana must have been ungenerous indeed had she heard that appeal with coldness nor was it so and the earl read in the depths of her melting blue orbs a sentiment reciprocal with his own my lordarthur she murmured you ask me if i can loveif i do love youand oh you know not the pang which that question excites in my heart yes she added hastily seeing that the earl was astonished at her words i do love you arthurfor you are all that is good generous and handsome butmy godhow can i force my lips to utter the sad avowal speak georgianaspeak i conjure you exclaimed lord ellingham you alarm me oh keep me not in suspense you say that you love me i never loved until i knew youi shall never love another answered georgiana fixing her deep silently expressive and intellectual eyes upon the countenance of the earl a thousand thanks for that declaration my hearts sole joy he cried in an impassioned tone and falling on his knees by the side of the sofa he threw his arms around herhe clasped her to his breasthis lips pressed hers for the first time but that joy lasted only for a moment with rebounding heartand with almost a scream of anguishgeorgiana drew herself back and abruptly repulsed her ardent lover then covering her face with her hands she burst into a flood of tears my god what signifies this strange conduct ejaculated the earl as with wounded pride he retreated a few paces from the weeping lady forgive meforgive me arthur she wildly cried turning her streaming eyes towards him in a beseeching manner i am unhappyvery unhappyand you should pity me pity you exclaimed the earl again approaching the sofa and taking her hand which she did not attempt to withdraw how can you be an object of pity beautifulbeloved by one whose life shall be devoted to ensure the felicity of yours oh your generous affection arthur gives me more pain than all the rest cried georgiana in a rapidhalfhysterical tone as a weak woman i have dared to love youas an imprudent one i have confessed that lovebut now she added in a slower and firmer tone while her vermilion lips quivered with a bitter smilenow as a strong womanas a woman restored to a sense of dutydo i make the avowaland my heart is ready to break as i thus speak good heavens relieve me from this cruelthis agonizing suspense passionately exclaimed the earl i willi will returned lady hatfield arthurdearly fondly devotedly as i love youproud as i should be to call you my husbandhappy happy as i should feel to link my fate with yoursalas it cannot benevernever she added with a frantic vehemence that caused every chord to thrill in the heart of her admirer georgiana is this possible he asked in a faint tone while a deadly pallor overspread his countenance would that it were not she murmured clasping her hands together in visible anguish of soul and yet it is incomprehensible cried the earl starting back and even manifesting somewhat of impatience you are not a foolish girl who takes delight in trifling with the sincere attachment of an honest man who adores heryou are not a heartless coquette looking upon her admirer as a slave whom she is justified to torture nono you yourself possess a generous soulyou have no sympathy with the frivolous portion of your sexyou are as strongminded as sincere as you are beautiful tell me then georgianawhat signifies this strange contradiction you love meyou would be happy and proud to become mineand yetmy godand yet you the next moment annihilate every hope in my breast alas how unpardonable must my conduct seemhow inexplicable my behaviour exclaimed lady hatfield in a tone of despair i am not indeed a heartless coquettenor a weak frivolous girlin the sincerity of my heart do i speak arthurand if you be generous you will forgive mebut i never can be thine then you love another cried the earl impatiently have i not solemnly assured you that i never loved till i knew youand shall never never love again she added with a convulsive sob as if her heart were breaking but perhaps you were betrothed to another in your youthperadventure that other has some sacred pledgesome irrevocable bond nono i am my own mistressnone can control me interrupted georgiana her nervous state of excitement growing each moment more painful and your uncleyour friendsyour advisers said the earlit is possible that they have become acquainted with my attachment towards youthat they have some motive to counsel you against my suit on the contrarybut my god do not question me thus almost shrieked the unhappy lady i shall go madi shall go mad oh there is some dreadful mystery in all this cried the earl and i too shall go mad if it be not explained merciful heavens a terrible suspicion flashes across my mind and yetnono it cannot befor you declare that you never loved another stillstill what motive save that can render you thus resolute not to become mine georgiana he said sinking his voice to a low tone and speaking with a solemn seriousness which had something even awful in its effectgeorgiana i conjure you to answer meme who am your devoted lover and your sincerest friendas you would reply to your god sayif in your giddy and inexperienced girlhoodignorant through extreme innocence of the snare spread for youand in a moment of weaknessyou just heavens that you should suppose me criminalguilty shrieked georgiana covering her face with her hands pardonpardon cried the earl again falling on his knees at the feet of her whom he adored and forcibly possessing himself of one of her hands he conveyed it to his lips pardon me for the outrageous idea that i dared to expressforgive the insulting suspicion which for a moment occupied my mind alas alas that i should have provoked the look of indignation which you ere now cast upon me when i withdrew your hand from before your eyes but ahnow you smileand i am forgiven georgiana did smilebut in a manner so plaintively melancholy that although it implied forgiveness for the injurious suspicion it still conveyed no hope there was a long and mournful pause the earl of ellingham burned to penetrate the deep mystery in which the conduct of lady hatfield was shrouded and yet he knew not what other hypothesis to suggest he had no rival in her affectionsher friends offered no objection to his suitshe was under no pledge to bestow her hand upon any particular individualand the evanescent suspicion that she might have once been frail and was too honourable to bring a polluted person to the marriagebed had been banished beyond the possibility of returnwhat then could influence her conduct he knew not how to elicit the truth and yet his happiness was too deeply interested to permit him to depart in uncertainty and suspense georgiana he said at length and speaking in a tone which showed how profoundly his feelings were excitedi appeal to your sense of justice whether you have acted candidly and generously in respect to me throughout the whole of last winter you permitted my visitsi will not say encouraged them because you have too much delicacy to have done that but you were never denied to me and you gave me not to understand that my calls were unwelcome when they began to exceed the usual limits of mere friendly visits at length my attentions became marked towards youand you must have read my feelings in my mannermy languageand my attentions alas why did you permit me to encourage the blossoming of hopes which are now so cruelly blighted by the unaccountable decision that you have uttered today oh do not reproach me arthur exclaimed georgiana and yet i know that i have acted imprudently but it was so sweet to be beloved by you that i had not courage to destroy the charming vision at length i took a decided stepor at least what seemed to me to be so i departed suddenly to my uncles countryseat without previously intimating my resolution to you and rememberno avowal of affection on your part had then met my ears and it was impossible that i could have acquainted you with my proposed departure even if i had wished so to dobecause i did not see you on the day when i determined to quit london and had i written to you then would you not have thought that my note conveyed a hint for you to follow me foolidiot that i was not to have declared my passion months and months ago ejaculated the earl but say georgianahad i solicited your hand last summer ere you left london would those reasons which influence you now yesthey were in existence then was the hasty reply and am i to remain in ignorance of the motives which compel you to refuse my suit asked lord ellingham bitterly is there no chance of their influence ceasing oh give me but a glimpse of hope and so powerful is my attachmentso devoted my love merciful heavens exclaimed georgiana wildlyam i then to lose such a man as this and again she clasped her hands convulsively together oh you love meyou do love me my angel cried the earl and yet you refuse me what stern fatewhat terrible destiny can possibly separate us this mystery is appalling and a mystery it must remain said georgiana suddenly assuming that quiet and passive manner which indicated despair then farewell lady hatfield exclaimed the earl and be not surprised if i must attribute the disappointmentthe anguishthe deep humiliation which i now experience to some inexplicable caprice of the female mind but madam he added drawing himself up haughtily and speaking in a tone of offended pride the earl of ellingham whose wealth and rank may enable him to vie with the mightiest peers of england will not be made the sport of the whims and wavering fancies of even the beautiful lady hatfield thus speaking the nobleman bowed coldly and advanced towards the door oh this is cruelthis is cruel cried georgiana throwing herself hysterically back upon the sofa no madamit is you who are cruel to reject the honourable suit of one like me without deigning to vouchsafe an explanation said the earl persisting in his severity of tone and manner against the promptings of his generous nature but with the hope of eliciting a satisfactory reply then go my lorddepartleave me cried georgiana for i never can be yours the earl lingered for a moment convulsive sobs broke from the lips of the unhappy lady hatfieldbut not a word to invite him to remain his pride would not permit him to offer farther entreatyand suffering cruelly at heart he rushed from the room in less than a minute georgiana heard the streetdoor close and then burying her face in the cushion of the sofa she gave way unrestrainedly to all the violence of her grief chapter vi dr lascelles the interview between lady hatfield and the earl of ellingham was as long as it was painful and ten oclock struck by the thousand churches of london as the nobleman quitted the mansion there was such a fierce struggle in his breast between wounded pride and fervent affection that his sorrow for the blighted hope of the latter was rendered less acute by being united with the indignation inspired by the former in spite of his generous nature he could not help thinking that he had been trifled with to some extent for it naturally seemed preposterous that georgiana should refuse him without a candid explanation of the motives and when every earthly circumstance appeared favourable to their union then again he pondered upon the wildness of her griefthe delirious anguish which she had shown at several stages of their interviewher solemn avowal of love for him aloneand her voluntary assurance that she should be happy and proud to call him her husband he moreover reflected upon the steadiness of her characterher aversion to the frivolities of the fashionable worldher apparent candour of dispositionand her total want of any thing approaching to coquetryand he endeavoured to persuade himself that he had acted harshly by leaving her in anger yet what alternative had i he asked himself and would not any other man have in the same way cut short an interview of so mysterious and unsatisfactoryso perplexing and humiliating a nature alas the earl of ellingham found himself the very next minute dwelling with an aching and compassionate heart upon the agonised state in which he had left the being whom he so tenderly lovedhe thought of her fascinating beautyher bewitching mannersher wellcultivated mindher amiable dispositionand then he said within himself oh if i have indeed lost her i have lost an angel he had reached the immediate vicinity of hatchetts hotel when he turned back with the resolution of seeking another interview with georgiana but scarcely had he retraced ten steps of the way ere he stopped short and asked himself what advantage could be gained by such a proceeding the decision is given he reasoned she can nevernever be mine wherefore should i renew her grief and my humiliationevoke fresh tears from her eyes and add sharpness to the sting of my disappointment no it may not be some terrible mystery shrouds her conduct from my penetrationbut shall i who am defeated in love give way to a base sentiment of curiosity it would be unmanlyignoblecowardly to attempt to extort her secret from herfor a profound secret she doubtless cherishesa secret which has this evening influenced her conduct and perhaps he thought following the natural channel of his meditations that secret is of a nature which a modest woman could not reveal to one of the opposite sex this idea suddenly flashing across his brain suggested a proceeding which after a few minutes of profound reflection he determined to adopt passing rapidly up dover street lord ellingham entered grafton street where he knocked at a door on which was a brassplate engraved with the name of dr lascelles the physician was at home and the nobleman was immediately ushered into a parlour where he was shortly joined by the individual whom he sought dr lascelles was a short thin sallowfaced man of about fifty he had small restless sparkling eyes a prim mouth and an intelligent though by no means prepossessing countenance he was devoted to the art which he practised and was reputed the most scientific man of the whole faculty his anatomical researches had been prosecuted with an energy and a perseverance which afforded occupation to half the resurrectionmen in london and more than once to the doctors own personal danger in respect to the law it was whispered in wellinformed circles that he never hesitated to encounter any peril in order to possess himself of the corpse of a person who died of an unusual malady his devotion to anatomy had materially blunted his feelings and deadened the kinder sympathies of his nature but his immense talents added to a reputation acquired by several wonderful cures rendered him the most fashionable physician of the day such was the medical gentleman whom lord ellingham called to consult excuse this late visit doctor said the earl but i knew that i might take the liberty of intruding upon you the words early and late are not in my vocabulary so far as they regard myself was the reply my hours are at the disposal of my patrons amongst whom i have the honour to include your lordship then without farther apology i shall proceed to state the object of my visit said the nobleman give me your handyou look dejectedyou are very paleyour pulse it is not concerning myself altogether that i have to speak interrupted the earl withdrawing the hand which the doctor had seized i wish to consult you upon a subject intimately affecting my happiness the physician looked surprised and drew his chair closer to that in which the earl was seated to tell you the truth continued arthur i am deeply enamoured of a lady whose social position beauty fortune and intellect render her in every way worthy to become my wife wellwhy dont you propose to her demanded the physician drily i haveand am rejected was the answer accompanied by a profound sigh the devil said the physician but what can i do for you in the matter surely your lordship does not believe in philtres and lovedraughts ridiculous cried the earl impatiently if you will grant me a few moments i will explain myself dr lascelles folded his arms threw himself back in the chair and prepared to listen to his young friends narrative the lady to whom i am attached continued the earl is as i ere now informed you in every way worthy of an alliance with me and she is moreover deeply attached to me she has never loved another and declares that she never can no apparent circumstances interfere with our union and she has done me the honour to assure me that she should be alike proud and happy to own me as her husband she is entirely her own mistress and even if she were not her friends would present no barrier to our marriage yet she refuses meand for some mysterious cause which she will not explain i have just left herleft her in a state of anguish such as i never before witnessedsuch as i hope never to behold again illustration perhaps she has been guilty of some weakness which she is afraid you would discover suggested dr lascelles oh nono exclaimed arthur enthusiastically in an unguarded momentcarried away by a hasty suspicion of the kindi hinted at that possibilityand i soon repented of my rashness the ladys countenance flushed with a glow of honest indignation and instantly veiling her blushes with her hand she burst into tears i could pledge my existence doctor that she is purity itself but wherefore do you consult me in the matter asked lascelles you must admit doctor answered ellingham that my position is a singular one in reference to the lady of whom i speak what am i to conjecture suspense is terrible and yet not for worlds would i again attempt to extort her secret from her the motive may be a physical one said the doctor that was the idea which ere now struck me and which has brought me hither to consult you exclaimed the earl she may be the prey to some insidious disease which impairs not her exterior aspect at present continued doctor lascelles say for instance a cancer in the breast or again her motive may be a moral one inasmuch as she may be aware from some secret warnings that she is in danger of suffering an aberration of reason and if the lady were a patient of your own doctor asked the earl should you be enabled to judge whether she were menaced by that dreadful mental malady to which you have alluded decidedly so replied the physician the earl rose from his seat and walked two or three times up and down the apartment dr lascelles followed him with his eyes and as he surveyed the strong wellknit but slender and graceful form of the young nobleman the votary of science could not help thinking what a splendid skeleton he would make at length the earl stopped abruptly opposite the doctor and said in an impressive tone you will never reveal the particulars of this interview it is scarcely probable returned lascelles with a smile but you promise meyou pledge your word never to breathe a syllable which may betray the motive of my present visit or the topic of our conversation persisted the earl never exclaimed the physician then listen said the earl sinking his voice almost to a whisperthe lady of whom i have spoken is lady hatfield observed lascelles what you have guessed simply because every one said last winter that you were dying for her interrupted the doctor coolly and therefore i presume you have availed yourself of her ladyships return to town to place your coronet at her feet yesi do allude to georgiana whose professional attendant you are cried the earl and believe me when i solemnly declare that no sentiment of impertinent curiosity never mind the motives said the doctor let us keep to the facts i have known lady hatfield for upwards of five years and i can positively assure your lordship that there is not the slightest cause physical or moral with which i am acquainted that can influence her conduct towards you then what can this mystery be exclaimed arthur more perplexed than ever my god must i again fall back upon the hypothesis of a womans idle capricethe theory of her unaccountable whims is she the victim of an idiosyncracy which she cannot control and must i be made its sport throughout the sphere of my extensive practice observed dr lascelles i know not a woman less likely to be swayed by idle caprice or unaccountable whims than lady hatfield her mind is strongher intellect bright and uncharacterised by the slightest eccentricity i have however frequently observed that her ladyship is the prey to a secret melancholythat she has her dark moments as one may denominate them but at those times the vigour of her soul is not subdued to a degree that would produce so strange a result as a decision affecting her own happiness you say she loves you i have not a doubt of the sincerity of her attachment cried the earl emphatically and yet she will not marry you said the doctor i cannot comprehend it nor i observed arthur with exceeding bitterness of tone my happiness is at stake what can i do had she explained the motive of her refusal and were that motive a strong onedid it reveal some cause which would render our union infelicitousi might have borne up against this cruelcruel disappointment my love for her would then have been converted by admiration of her generous candour into a permanent friendship and we might henceforth have met as brother and sister but how can i ever visit her again how can i meet her beautiful and amiable as she is i adore herand yet i dare not in future trust myself in her presence noi must crush this love in my heartstifle itsubdue it altogether oh fool that i am to talk thusas if it were practicable to forget heras if it were possible to cease to worship her ere now as i walked through the streets i endeavoured to blunt the keenness of my affection by placing it in contact with the amount of wrong which i deemed myself to have experienced at her hands but unjustly perhaps as she has treated mehumiliated as i felt and still feel myself to bechagrineddisappointedrejected without explanationoh all these injuries are absorbed in the immensity of the love which i bear her and in a state of extraordinary excitement arthur paced the room with agitated steps the doctor sate musing upon his chair he had ever been too much devoted to scientific pursuits to afford leisure for the delights of love and though he was married he had entered the connubial state only through motives of selfinterest well aware that ladies prefer a medical attendant whose propriety of conduct isor at least appears to beguaranteed by marriage he had one day cast his mental eyes around the circle of his acquaintance and his glances were at length fixed upon a wealthy widow who was one of his patients jumping into his cab he called upon her and in order not to waste time proposed while he felt her pulse she simpered an assentand as she could not name the day he did it for her while he wrote out a prescription then he pocketed her guinea all the samenot through meanness but from the regularity of professional habit and had she offered him a fee as an acknowledgment for his loss of time on the morning when they issued from the church he would also have taken it this union was sterile but the doctor found that he had obtained an excellent wife who kept his house in good orderdid the honours of his table to admirationand never interrupted him when he was engaged in his study we have only introduced this little episode in the life of dr lascelles just to convince our readers that he was not at all the man to comprehend the vehemence of lord ellinghams love thus while the nobleman was pacing the apartment in the manner described above and declaiming in reference to his passion the physician was meditating profoundly upon the conduct of lady hatfield in refusing so excellent a match his mind habituated to connect every thing as much as possible with the special sphere of science wherein he moved soon lost itself in a field of conjecture as to whether there might not be some physical cause carefully concealed even from himself which would elucidate the mystery the result of his meditations was not at all satisfactory to himself but he resolved that he would not allow the matter to remain just where it was this determination he did not however communicate to lord ellingham who took his leave more bewildered than ever as to the motive which could have possibly induced lady hatfield to assure him of her love and yet refuse him her hand chapter vii the beautiful patient ten minutes had scarcely elapsed since lord ellingham took his departure from the doctors abode and the learned gentleman himself was still pondering on the strange communication which had been made to him when a loud and hasty knock at the frontdoor echoed through the house a servant answered the summons and in a few moments ushered tom rain into the presence of dr lascelles sir said the visitor who was painfully excited a femalea young woman in whom i am deeply interestedhas taken poison come with me this instant i implore you dr lascelles snatched up his hat and followed rainford without pausing to ask a single question a hackneycoach was waiting at the door the two individuals leapt in and the vehicle drove rapidly away the doctor now thought it expedient to make a few inquiries relative to the case which was about to engage his attention what poison has the young woman taken he asked arsenic was the reply for i found the paper which had contained it and how long ago ten minutes before i knocked at your door has there been any vomiting i did not delay a single moment in hastening to fetch you after the unhappy creature took the poison and therefore i am unable to answer that question the physician remained silent and in a few minutes the coach stopped at a house in south moulton street the door was opened by a servantgirl and rainford led the physician to a bedroom on the second floor whither the servantgirl followed them by the light of a candle placed upon a chest of drawers dr lascelles beheld a young female of great beauty and with no other garment on than her nightdress writhing in excruciating agonies upon the bed from the reply given by the servantgirl to a question put by the doctor it appeared that the young lady had been seized with violent vomiting the moment after tom rain had left to procure medical aid and lascelles accordingly proceeded to adopt the usual treatment which is pursued in such cases in the course of half an hour the patient was pronounced to be out of danger and tom rain who had in the meantime manifested the utmost anxiety and uneasiness now exhibited a proportionate liveliness of joy shall i recover sir oh tell meshall i recover asked the young woman in a strange thrilling piteous tone as she fixed her large dark eyes upon the countenance of the physician you are in a fair way to survive this madthis wicked attempt upon your life answered lascelles in a compassionately reproachful rather than a severe tone but you must be kept quietand all sources of mental irritation must be removed or forgotten as much as possible he added glancing towards rainford oh sirdo not imagine for a moment that he will upbraid or illtreat me exclaimed the young woman darting a fond look towards tom rain then drawing a long and heavy respiration she said in a different and more subdued tone in justice to him doctor i must assure you that no harshness on his part urged me to this shocking deed but yes my dearest girl interrupted rain rushing to the bed and taking one of her hands which he pressed fondly to his lips i did upbraid youi did speak severely to you nononot more than i deserved cried the young woman for i was very wrongoh i was very wrong but say tom can you forgive me he does forgive youhe has forgiven you exclaimed the physician and now abandon that subject which is naturally a painful one tomorrow morning i shall call and see you early dr lascelles took up his hat to depart and rainford followed him into the passage where he said in a low but earnest tone one word sir in private please to step into this room and he conducted the physician into a front apartment the door of which he carefully closed in the first place sir began rainford when they were thus alone together allow me to thank you for your prompt and effectual aid in this most painful affairand he slipped five guineas into the doctors hand secondly let me implore of you to grant the favour which i am about to ask speak sir said lascelles and if your request be not inconsistent with my honour as a physician and as a gentleman far from it exclaimed rainford it is thispromise me on your solemn word of honour as a physician and as a gentleman that when once your professional visits here have ceased you will forget that you ever beheld that young woman who is lying in the next room promise me i say in the most binding manner that should you ever henceforth meet her alone or in company you will not even appear to recognise her much less attempt to speak to her unless you be formally introduced to her when you will consider your acquaintance with her to begin only from the moment of such introduction promise me all this sir i implore youfor you know not what vitally important interests may be compromised by your conduct in this matter i have not the slightest objection to tranquillise your mind by giving the pledge which you demand returned dr lascelles without a moments hesitation a thousand thanks sir cried rainford joyfully you fully understand the precise nature of the reserve and silence which i require never to allude in any way to the incident of this night nor to appear to recognise elsewhere nor henceforth the young lady whom i have just seen said the doctor you may rely upon me the secret shall never transpire from my lips again i express my gratitude cried rainford with undisguised satisfaction dr lascelles then took his leave and as he retraced his way to grafton street he never once ceased to think of the strange promise which he had been required to give in respect to the beautiful creature who had made so resolute an attempt upon her own existence on the following morning shortly after eight oclock the physicians cab stopped at the door of the house in south moulton street but to his surprise he learnt from the landlady that mr and mrs jameson by which names rainford and the young woman had been known at their lodgings had taken their departure at seven oclock before it was even light had they resided long with you inquired the doctor only a week sir was the answer the lady kept herself very quiet and seldom went out when she did she always had a thick black veil over her face and you may think it strange sirbut its true for all thatwhich is sir that i never once caught a glimpse of her countenance all the time she was in this house but the servantgal says she was very beautifulvery beautiful indeed you must however be able to judge whether that report is true or not sir i know little and think less of those matters my good woman said the doctor hastily and returning to his cab he drove off to visit another patient footnote the first great object which we must keep in view is to promote the speedy evacuation of the stomach if the poison itself has not produced vomiting from ten to twenty grains of sulphate of zinc must be given if it can be readily procured this generally acts as a powerful emetic if this however cannot be obtained a mustard emetic should be administered and the vomiting promoted by drinking large quantities of barley water linseed tea milk or tepid water the two first being of a mucilaginous nature are to be preferred tickling the back of the throat with a feather will often cause the stomach to reject its contents it frequently happens that this treatment alone is sufficient for relief in accidents of this nature after the stomach has been cleansed by the emetic c as described above limewater or chalk diffused in water if it can be procured may be given in large quantities hahnemann has recommended soap to be dissolved in water in the proportion of a pound to four pints and a teacupful to be given every five or six minutes this undoubtedly is the best treatment if limewater is not at hand powdered charcoal may also be administered with advantage if the other remedies are not immediately attainable the above remedies may be used with some degree of confidence although their good effects are not sufficiently certain to establish them as antidotesready remedies in cases of poisoning c by james johnson mrcs chapter viii seven dials there is not in all london a more extraordinary locality than that which bears the denomination of seven dials situate in the midst of one of the lowest and worst neighbourhoods throughout the metropolis and forming a focus where seven streets converging towards that point meet like as many streams flowing into a common reservoir the open spot of ground called seven dials is a lounge for all the idle vagabonds and illlooking persons men and women who occupy the cellars and garrets in the vicinity from the centre of the open space alluded to the eyes may plunge their glances down into the circumjacent thoroughfaresnarrow dark filthy and formed by dwellings of an appearance so miserable or so repulsive that they equally pain the heart and shock the sight if the wanderer amidst the mazes of this vast city were desired to point out the chosen abode of poverty and crime taking as his guide the physical aspect of all the worst neighbourhoods he would probably indicate seven dials and its branching streets the shops are all of the lowest and dirtiest description nauseous odours impregnate the atmosphere in winter the streets are kneedeep in mud save when hardened by the frost and in summer they are strewed with the putrefying remnants of vegetables offal and filth of every description halfnaked children paddle about in the mire or wallow on the heaps of decomposing substances just alluded togreedily devouring the parings of turnips and carrots sucking the marrow out of the rotting bones and rejoicing when they happen to find a mouldy crust a morsel of putrid meat or the maggoteaten head of a fish neglected beings too are theyknowing nothing save blows curses and hunger at home and learning naught save every corrupt habit and ruinous vice abroad how can we be surprised if such an infancy becomes imbued with those evil principles which gaols and treadmills only tend afterwards to confirm and which give ample promise of occupation for turnkeys penalsettlements and the hangman the established church is maintained at an annual expense of several millions sterling the clergy belonging to that church claim the right of educating and instructing the peopleand yet in no country in the civilised world is there such an appalling amount of juvenile depravity as in england for ourselves we declarewe repeat that our government our legislature our clergy and our great landowners are all guilty of the blackest turpitude in permitting hundreds of thousandsaye millions of children to be neglected in so horrible a manner if a child be seized with a malignant infectious and dangerous disease what would be said of the father who looked on indifferentlywho omitted to call in medical adviceand who beheld with equal calmness the furious malady spreading amongst the rest of his offspring should we not denounceshould we not execrate such a man as a monster deserving of any penalty which our statutes could inflict yesa thousand times yes by a parity of reasoning then do we hold up to abhorrence those men who seize upon the reins of power merely to gratify their own selfish ambition also those men who accept seats in the legislative assemblies and fritter away the time of a great nation in their own partysquabblesthose men too who put on black gowns preach sermons as a duty rendered in return for the enjoyment of enormous revenues and then declaim against the wickedness of those millions whom they do not attempt to reformand lastly those men who wring the sweat from the poor mans brow to distil pearls for themselves but who care not for the welfare of that poor mans offspring hundreds of thousands of pounds are annually subscribed to further the objects of foreign missions the scene of whose labours is in faroff lands scarcely known to us by name and amongst a race with whom our sympathies cannot existbut beneath our very eyescrossing our pathsconstantly displaying their loathsome rags to our view are small children innumerable whose only training is for the prison the hulks and the gallows talk not to us of christianizing barbarians in the remote islands of the south seas when the children of so many of our own fellowcountrymen and countrywomen are but barbarous christians at home let the reader who imagines that we exaggerate the amount of the evil we denouncelet him take his stand any evening in the midst of seven dials and well consider the scenes around him it is said that there are seven cardinal sins at the point where we would wish our sceptical reader to post himself he may command a view of seven streets each one presenting to his contemplation some new phase in the common sphere of hideous poverty and terrible demoralisation mark the population of that neighbourhood consisting of seven principal streets with all their connecting lanes and alleyswith their dark filthy courts and their murderouslooking nooks and passages of what does this population consist men brutalised by drink or rendered desperate by poverty and in either state ready to commit a crimewomen of squalid wasted and miserable appearance who being beaten by their husbands and fathers revenge themselves upon their children or their little brothers and sisterspoor shopkeepers who endeavour to make up for the penury of their petty dealings by cheating their famished customerswretched boys and girls whose growth is stunted by suffering whose forms are attenuated through want and whose minds are poisoned by the scenes of vice dissipation and immorality which open upon them at their very birth what hopewhat promise for the future do such beings as these hold out in consternation and sorrow mingled with the most awful misgivings do we survey the picture which we are now compelled to drawand our feelings are thus painful because we know this picture to be correct and yet we call our country merry england merciful heavens what a mockery is this name can england be merry while the most hideous poverty is the lot of half her population while her workhouses are crowded with miserable beings who must for ever resign all hope or idea of again enjoying the comforts of home while the streets are filled with loathsome wretches clad in filthy rags which barely cover themshivering with the cold or fainting beneath the intolerable heatand spurned from the doors not only of the rich but also of the very officers appointed to relieve distress while the poor mother maddened with the idea of her own destitution and houseless condition presses her famishing child to her breast which yields no milk and then rushes in desperation to consign the innocent being to the waters of the nearest stream while the wretched father stifles his children that he may hush for ever in their throats the cry of bread breadthat vain and useless cry to which he cannot respond while innocent babes and prattling infants bear upon their countenances and exhibit in their attenuated frames all the traces of the dread and agonising pangs of a constant gnawingcravingnever satisfied hunger and while hundreds annually die around us of starvation and absolute want merry england indeed what is england joyous when the shop of the pawnbroker thrives royally upon the immense interest wrung from the very vitals of the poor when the gaols the hospitals and the workhouses are more numerous than the churches when the hulks are swarming with convicts pent up in frightful floating dungeons amidst a ftid atmosphere when the streets throng with unfortunate girls who ask to be redeemed from an appalling traffic but who see no avenue of escape from their loathsome calling when the voice of starvation the voice of crime the voice of discontent and the voice of barbarian ignorance echo up to heaven and form such a chorus as could scarcely be expected to meet the ears beyond the precincts of hell and when seventenths of the entire population are wretchedoppressedenslavedtrampled onmiserabledegradeddemoralised merry england but let us continue the thread of our narrative two of the thoroughfares which converge to seven dials bear each the name of earl street passing from high street st giless towards st martins lane we must request the reader to turn with us to the right into that earl street which lies between the dials and one extremity of monmouth street half way up earl street stood a house of even a darker and more gloomy appearance than its companions its doorway was lower than the level of the street and was reached by descending three steps the windows were small and as many of the panes were broken the holes were mended with pieces of dirty paper or stopped up with old rags altogether there was something so povertystricken and yet so sinister about the appearance of that tottering dingy repulsivelooking dwelling that no one possessing an article of jewellery about his person or having gold in his pocket would have chosen to venture amongst its inmates and who were those inmates the neighbours scarcely knew certain it was however that over the rickety door of the house were painted the wordstobias bunce tailor but few were the jobs which mr bunce ever obtained from the inhabitants in the vicinity for his manners were too reservedtoo repulsive to gain favour with the class of persons who might have patronised him and yet there appeared to be no signs of absolute poverty in that dwelling mrs bunce was one of the adjacent butchers best customers a publichouse in the dials was known to be regularly visited by her for the beer at dinner and supper times and pints of gin were occasionally purchased by the same mysterious customer at the same establishment she was as averse to gossiping as her husband and her neighbours declared that they could not make her out at all she always paid ready money for every thing she had and therefore the tradespeople were the stanch defenders of the bunces whenever a word of suspicion was uttered against them who then were these bunces let us step inside their dwelling and see if we can ascertain it was about eight oclock in the evening a few days after the incidents related in the preceding chapters that toby bunce his wife old death and the lad jacob sate down to tea in the groundfloor back room of the house which we have been describing toby bunce was a short thin palefaced sneakinglooking man of about forty he was dressed in a suit of very shabby black and his linen was not remarkable for cleanliness his coarse brown hair was suffered to grow to a considerable length and as he seldom treated it to an acquaintance with the comb it hung in matted curls over his shoulders his nails were equally neglected and resembled claws terminating with blackened points his betterhalfas mrs bunce indeed was not only figuratively but also literallywas a tall thin scraggy lanternfaced woman with a sharp green eye a vixenish pugnose and a querulous voice for although she was excessively reserved when she went out to do her marketing she made up for that silence abroad by an extra amount of garrulity at home her age exceeded by a year or two that of her husband and as she was totally devoid of that sentiment which is so generally ascribed to the sexwe mean vanityshe did not scruple to acknowledge the above fact indeed she often advanced it as an argument to prove that she must know better than he and as a reason for her assertion and maintenance of petticoat government but if vanity were not her failing avarice was her ruling vice and to gratify her love for gold she never hesitated at a crime in this latter respect mr bunce was no better than his spousesave that his anxiety to obtain money was not always equalled by his readiness to face the danger occasionally involved in procuring it any act of turpitude that might be accomplished safely and quietly would find no moral opponent in the person of toby bunce but when some little daring or display of firmness was required he was forced to supply himself with an artificial energy through the medium of the ginbottle the room to which we have introduced our readers was furnished with bare necessaries and nothing more a rickety greasy dealtable four or five of the commonest description of rushbottomed chairs a long form to accommodate extra company an old portable cupboard fitting into one of the angles of the apartment and a shelf to serve as a larderthese were the principal articles of the domestic economy the table was spread with a varied assortment of crockery none of the cups matching with the saucers and no two cups or no two saucers alike toby bunce having succeeded in inducing the kettle to boil by means of sundry bits of wood sparingly applied his wife betsy made the tea while jacob cut the breadandbutter i wonder whether tom will keep his appointment said old death as he sipped his tea its a full hour past the time that i told him to be here and weve been a waiting for him till the fire got so low that it took a power of wood to make it burn up again observed toby bunce spose it did cried his wife you know very well that we dont care about any expense when our best friend mr bones is with us she added glancing towards old death for the bunces were amongst the very few of that individuals acquaintances who knew his real name and yet i should think he would not fail continued old death in a musing strain his conduct seemed straightforward and right enough the very first day we agreed to terms and he even gave me my regulars in a matter that id nothing to do with but it was well for him that he did so or else hed have been laid up in lavender for want of bail bertinshaw and watkins did it pretty tidy said jacob who was making prodigious inroads upon the breadandbutter keep your observations to yourself growled old death in a surly tone remember i havent forgot your negligence in losing sight of tom rain the other day when he left the policeoffice it wasnt my fault returned the lad his dark eyes flashing angrily i kept lurking about the court after i had been up here to tell you that dykes had nabbed mr rainford i saw him go over to the coffeehouse soon after he was dischargedi followed him when he went in a coach to pall malli dogged him back again to bow streetand then and then when the jewesss case was over you saw him come out and you lost sight of him interrupted old death angrily but never mind he added softening a little i will set you to watch him another day when youve nothing better to do and we will find out all i want to know about him when did you see him last inquired toby bunce this morning at tullocks and old death was interrupted by a knock at the street door to which summons jacob hastened to respond in a few moments he returned accompanied by tom rain who sauntered into the room with a complaisant air and the chimneypot hat stuck on the right side of his head so you are come at last tom said bones alias old death his toothless jaws grinning a ghastly satisfaction well better late than never but let me introduce you to my very particular friends mr and mrs bunce and as they are good friends of mine they will be good friends to you this crib of theirs is convenient in more ways than one added the old man significantly and you will find it so if you ever want to lay up for a time until the storm which must menace one sometimes blows over the hint may not prove useless at a pinch said tom carelessly as he seated himself on the form but theres some one present whose name youve not yet mentioned old chap and he glanced towards the sickly lad who was still occupied with the edible portion of the repast oh thats my mercurymy messengermy confidantor any thing else you like to call him said bones his name is jacob smith for want of a betterand hes a perfect treasure in his way he can scent an officer two streets off and would prove the best scout that ever a general commanding an army could possibly employ now you know his qualifications and if you ever want to make use of them he is at your service well my lad exclaimed tom rain your master gives a good character of you and mind you continue to deserve it he added with an ironical smile but what is to be done now old fellow this question was addressed to bones who accordingly prepared himself to answer it theres something to be done tomorrow night my dear boy began the old villain his dark eyes gleaming from beneath their shaggy overhanging brows and theres moneymuch moneyto be got but the thing is a difficult one and requires great tact as well as courage you must suppose beforehand that i am the person to manage it properly said rain or i should think you would not have applied to me very true tom returned old death with a sepulchral chuckle very true the fact is youre a dashing genteellooking and wellspoken fellow when you choose and you can insinuate yourself into the good graces of the bestborn gentlemen in the land i am sure you can do thisdont you think you can tom i should rather fancy i can replied rainford by no means displeased with the compliment just paid him but go onexplain yourselfand we shall then see what can be done listen attentively said old death between streatham and norwood there stands a pretty but lonely house occupied by a gentleman named torrens he is a widower and has two daughters the eldest of these girls is to be married the day after tomorrow to a certain mr frank curtis the nephew of the wealthy sir christopher blunt it appears that mr torrens has fallen into some difficulty through overspeculation in building houses at norwood and sir christopher has consented to advance him five thousand pounds on condition that this match takes place for the girl it seems is totally opposed to it she has another lover whom she lovesand she hates mr frank curtis but the father insists on sacrificing his daughter to whom curtis is greatly attached and curtis possesses influence enough over his uncle sir christopher to persuade him to advance the money all this is clear enough said rain and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to baulk sir christopher frank curtis and the selfish old father but i do not see how the business can in any way benefit us i will tell you my dear boy replied old death with another chuckle expressive of deep satisfaction tomorrow evening sir christopher the nephew and sir christophers lawyer will set out for torrens cottage as the place is called they will settle all the preliminary business with the father tomorrow night so that the marriage may take place the first thing on the ensuing morning well said tom inquiringly seeing that old death paused and two thousand pounds out of the five will be conveyed from london to torrens cottage tomorrow night continued bones unless he added significantly something happens to stop the money on its way but who will have the money about himsir christopher the nephew or the lawyer demanded tom ah thats the point to ascertain cried old death you must exercise your tact in solving this doubt and your courage will afterwards effect the rest did i not say that the business required alike tact and courage you did indeed answered rain and i can scarcely see how the deuce the thing is to be managed still two thousand pounds would prove very welcome but how came you to learn all this the knights servant my dear boy is in my pay returned old death with a triumphant grin ah i have many gentlemens and noblemens domestics devoted to my interests in the same manner and by their means i learn a great deal but to return to our present business two thousand pounds are to be paid down as an earnest of the bargain tomorrow night and those two thousand pounds will be much better appropriated to our uses i perfectly agree with you old fellow said rain could not the knights servant inform you who is likely to take charge of the money impossible cried bones he will most probably accompany the party and how will they go demanded rain a thought striking him on horseback answered old death sir christopher and his nephew have a great opinion of themselves as riders and the lawyer mr howard is a sporting character it is therefore sure that they will all go on horseback then leave the rest to me cried tom rain snapping his fingers what time do they set out at six oclock was the answer good again observed tom its as dark then as at midnight this time of the year say no more upon the subject the thing is just the same as if it was doneprovided your information is correct and no change takes place in the plan as at present laid down by these gentlemen one word howeverdescribe sir christophers servant to me a shortthindappermade fellowdark curly hairface marked with the smallpox replied old death drab livery turned up with red his name is john jeffreys enough said tom i shall call at tullocks tomorrow between two and three in the afternoon and if you have any thing fresh to communicate you can either leave a note or meet me there if i neither see nor hear from you at that time and place i shall consider that all remains as you have now represented you have nothing more to say at present nothing returned bones after a moments reflection wont you take a drop of brandyandwater mr rainfordjust a leetle drop inquired toby bunce with a deferential glance towards his better half a leetle drop stupida good big drop you mean cried the shrew isnt mr rainford a friend of mr bonesand aint all mr boness friends our friends im sure if mr rainford would drink aa quara pint of brandy she added emphatically defining the quantity she felt disposed to place at the service of the new acquaintance he is quite welcome no thankee said rainford i must be off the business of tomorrow night requires consideration and he was interrupted by a knock at the streetdoor and toby bunce hastened to answer the summons chapter ix a deathscenelocks fields the roomdoor was left open and the inmates could therefore hear every thing that took place in the passage toby bunce opened the streetdoor cautiously and said whos there in the name of heaven grant me a nights lodging exclaimed the appealing voice of a female if not for myselfat least for this poor dear child toby shut the door screamed the querulous tones of mrs bunce from the backroom we dont want beggars and poor children here stay cried tom rain never be hardhearted and hastening to the streetdoor he saw by the light of a shopwindow opposite the form of a miserablelooking female crouching upon the steps and with one arm round the neck of a little boy who was crying bitterly come in my good woman said rainford i will pay any expenses that your presence may entail on the people of the housecome in i say but the poor creature fell back insensible toby take care of the child cried tom rain in an authoritative tone while i lift the woman off the steps and suiting the action to the word he raised the senseless being in his arms and conveyed her into the passage toby following with the little boy who seemed to be about five or six years old surely youre mad tom exclaimed old death advancing from the backroom to bring strangers into this house i should be a brute to see a dying woman turned away from the door of this or any other house said rainford firmly stand back and let me have my way my purse shall satisfy the bunces for any trouble this business may give them well wellbe it as you will growled old death then in a hasty whisper to betsy bunce he added you had better let him do as he likes he is a queer fellow but very usefuland must not be offended thus advised and cheered moreover by rains liberal promise of payment mrs bunce suddenly exhibited a vast amount of sympathy on behalf of the poor creature and having fetched a candle from the backroom she lighted rainford who carried the still senseless woman in his arms up stairs to a chamber where there was a sordid kind of bed rainford placed his burden on the miserable pallet and betsy bunce applied such restoratives as the circumscribed economy of her household furnished in the meantime toby had brought the little boy into the chamber and the child hastening towards the bed exclaimed mammadear mammaspeak to mewhy dont you speak to me the woman opened her eyes languidly but the moment they encountered the face of the child they were lighted up with joy and snatching the boy to her breast she murmured in a faint tone i thought i had lost you charlesi dreamt that we were separated oh my headit seems to split and she pressed her open palm to her forehead with all the appearance of intense suffering we must pause a moment to observe that this woman seemed to be about fiveandthirty years of age that she was dressed in widows weeds of the coarsest materials and that her entire aspect denoted dreadful privations and great sufferings mental as well as physical the boy was also attired in mourning garments and though his little cheeks were wan and his form emaciated still was he a very interesting child my good woman said tom rain approaching the bed banish all misgivings relative to the present for you shall be taken care of then turning towards mrs bunce he directed her to procure food and to send jacob for a surgeon nono its useless cried the poor woman alluding to the latter order i feel that i am dyingmy last hour is come the child threw his little arms about her neck and wept piteously oh my god cried the wretched stranger who will now take care of you my poor deardear little charles i who have been to you as a mother yesyou are my mammamy own mamma exclaimed the child his heart ready to burst although he scarcely understood the real nature of the misgivings which oppressed him sir said the woman after a few moments of profound silence during which the sobbings of the boy and the uneasy palpitations of her own breast were alone heard in the chambersir she said addressing herself abruptly to rainford you spoke to me kindlyyou look kindly upon meand if i may judge by your countenance you possess a kind heart speak poor woman cried rain softened almost to tears if there is any thing i can do for you confide in meand i swear the gratitude of a dying being is all that i can offer you in return for what i am about to ask interrupted the woman in a faint yet hurried tonefor she seemed to feel that she had not long to live draw near sirthereand now listen attentively dreadful privationexposure to the coldsleeping in the fieldsand painful wanderings have reduced me to this state but i shall die contentednay even happy if i thought i understand you cried rain you are anxious for the welfare of this boy compose your mindbanish those painful reflectionsi swear to protect him there was something so earnest and sincere in the manner the voice and the countenance of rainford who was a creature of the most generous impulses that the dying woman believed him and her heart bounded with fervent gratitude then making a sign for rainford to draw nearer to her still she collected all her remaining force to utter a few last words but physical exhaustion almost completely choked her utterance this boy she murmured in a faint and dying voice is not mine do not weep charles lovei am not your mammaalthough i love youas if you was my own child but the moment you were bornin secretand mysterythe nurse brought you to meall having been so arrangedandfrom that moment ibut my god i am dyingoh give me strength to declare thatyour motheris speak speak cried tom rain breathe but the name of his motheri shall catch itand i declare most solemnlyo god she is dead and it was so vain were her last last efforts to give utterance to the name which trembled upon her tongue the deathrattle stifled the words in her throather eyes glazedher countenance settled in inanimationand she was no more the little charles would not believe that she was really dead to him she only appeared to sleepand this infantine delusion tom rain gradually dissipated making him aware of his sad bereavement in so delicate a manner that a stranger would have believed him to be a father himself as well as an individual of the most upright and noble principles illustration but if rainfords morality was in some points of the most indifferent nature he nevertheless possessed kind feelings and a generous heart and the tears trickled down his cheeks as he exerted himself to console the little stranger children seem to be endowed with an intuitive power of discrimination between those who would treat them well and those whose dispositions are severe and harsh and charles speedily acquired confidence in the good intentions of rainford at length when tom fancied that he had obtained some degree of influence over the boys mind he led him away from the chamber where the poor woman had breathed her last old death had remained in the room below and jacob had been sent to fetch a surgeon who now arrived but departed again immediately upon learning that his services could no longer be rendered available toby and mrs bunce had quitted the chamber of death the moment rain ejaculated o god she is deadand thus the child had no leisure to take particular notice of any one save the individual who manifested so much kindness towards him fearing that the repulsive appearance of old death might alarm the boy and even fill his mind with misgivings relative to the person who now took charge of him rainford stopped in the dark passage down stairs and calling mrs bunce from the backroom he placed five guineas in her hand saying the burial of that poor creature who has just breathed her last must be your care see that it is performed decently and if there are any papers about her personany proofs of who she iskeep them for me be faithful in this respectand what i have now given you may be considered as an earnest of additional recompense rainford then left the house leading the boy by the hand proceeding to the nearest hackneycoach stand tom hired one of the vehicles and desired to be driven to the elephant and castle previously however to entering the vehicle the thoughtful tom rain purchased some of the very best cakes which a shop in such a neighbourhood could produce and though the little boy kept sobbing as he repeated to himself mamma is deadfor he was too young to understand that she had denied this maternity with her dying breathyet he ate greedily of the foodfor he was famished rainford said but little to him beyond a few occasional cheering and consolatory words as they rode along because the heavy rumbling of the vehicle rendered it difficult to hear what was uttered within in about threequarters of an hour the coach stopped at the elephant and castle and rainford conducting the boy tenderly by the hand plunged into the maze of streets which form a neighbourhood requiring a detailed description any one who is acquainted with that part of london or who with the map of the great metropolis before him takes the trouble to follow us in this portion of our narrative will understand us when we state that almost immediately behind the elephant and castle tavern there is a considerable district totally unexplored by thousands and thousands of persons dwelling in other parts of the english capital this district is now bounded on the north by the new kent road on the east by the kent or greenwich road on the south by walworth and on the west by the walworth road built upon a low damp and unhealthy soil the dwellings of the poor there throng in frightful abundanceforming narrow streets half choked up with dirt miserable alleys where the very air is stagnant and dark courts to enter which seems like going into the ftid vault of a church many of the streets that appear to have been huddled together without any architectural plan but merely upon a studied system of crowding together as many hovels as possible have their back windows looking upon ditches the black mire and standing water of which exhale vapours sufficiently noxious to breed a pestilence when the sun shines upon these noisome ditches their surface displays a thousand prismatic hues thrown out by the decomposing offal and putrid vegetables which have been emptied into those open sewers but sewers they cannot be calledfor instead of carrying off the filth of the neighbourhood those ditches preserve it stagnant a considerable portion of the district we are describing is known by the name of locks fields and the horrible condition of this locality can only be properly understood by a visit the pen cannot convey an adequate idea of the loathsome squalor of that povertythe heartrending proofs of that wretchednessand the revolting examples of that utter demoralization which characterise this section of the metropolis the houses for the most part contain each four rooms every room serving as the domicile of a separate family perhaps one of the members of such a family may be afflicted with some infectious malady there he must lie upon his flock mattress or his bundle of rags or his heap of straw until he become through neglect so offensive as to render one minute with him intolerable and yet his relativesfour five or even six in numberare compelled to sleep in the same apartment with him inhaling the stench from that mass of putrefaction hearing his groans breathing the steam from his corrupted lungs and swarming with the myriads of loathsome animalcule engendered by the filth of the place in another room perhaps we shall find some old man living by himselfstarving upon the miserable pittance obtained by picking up bones or rags doing an odd job now and then for a neighbour and filling up the intervals of such pursuits by begginghis entire furniture consisting of a cup a kettle and a knifeno chair no tablebut with a heap of rubbish in one corner for a bed on which he sleeps with his clothes on in a third room there is most likely a family consisting of a man and his wife who at night occupy one mattress and their grownup sons and daughters who all pig together upon another shame and decency exist not amongst thembecause they could never have known either they have all been accustomed from their infancy to each others nakedness and as their feelings are brutalised by such a mode of existence they suffer no scruples to oppose that fearful intercourse which their sensuality suggests thusfor we must speak plainly as we speak the truththe very wretchedness of the poor which compels this family commingling in one room and as it were in one bed leads to incesthorrible revolting incest the fourth room in the house which we take for our example of the dwellings in locks fields is occupied by the landlord or landlady or both and there is perhaps no more morality nor cleanliness in their chamber than in either of the others the shops in locks fields are naturally in keeping with the means and habits of their customers beershops and publichouses abound the lower and the poorer the locality the greater the number of such establishments but who can wonder crime requires its stimulantsand poverty its consolation men drink to nerve themselves to perpetrate misdeeds which are attended with peril women drink to supply that artificial flow of spirits necessary to the maintenance of a career of prostitutionand the honest poor drink to save themselves from the access of maddening despair children drink also because they see their parents drink and because they have acquired the taste from their earliest infancyand thus beershops and publichouses thrive most gloriously in the most wretched neighbourhoods locks fields abound with small general shops where every thing is sold in the minutest detaila pennyworth of sugar a pennyfarthingworth of tea a farthing candle or a quarter of a pound of bacon for a penny there are also many eatinghouses where legofbeef soup can be procured for five farthings the bowl the knackers do a good business with the owners of those establishments tripeshops are likewise far from rare and upon their boards in the open windows may be seen gory slices of blacklooking liver tongues and brains in a dish sheeps heads huge cowheels chitterlings piles of horses flesh and rolls of boiled offal upon sticksthe two lastmentioned species of article being intended for catsmeatbut the whole heaped pellmell together loathsome to behold and emitting odours of the most ftid and nauseating description coalsheds where potatoes and greens may likewise be purchased abound in locks fields as do also pieshops and that kind of eatinghouses where pudding fried in grease stockingpudding and sopinthepan are displayed in the windows to tempt with their succulent appearance the appetites of hungry men passing to their work or of halffamished children wearied of playing in the gutter it is wretchedheartrending to linger on a description of this kind but we must endeavour to make it as complete as possible the generality of the inhabitants of locks fields are in a state of barbarian ignorance ninetenths of the children even of ten or twelve years old are unable to read and know not who jesus christ is nor that the saviour of mankind suffered upon the cross to save them as well as the proudest peers or the most brilliant peeresses that shine in the realms of fashion look more closely at the aspect of the population in locks fields what care is depicted upon the pale cheek of that emaciated woman who is hanging the one change of linen upon the elderbushes skirting the black ditch behind her dwelling and yet she is better off than many of her neighboursbecause her family does possess the one change of linen behold that man sitting on the threshold of his door smoking his pipehis elbows rest upon his kneeshe stares vacantly before himnot even the opiatic influence of tobacco soothes him he is thinking of what will become of his wife and children when he shall be out of workbecause the job on which he has lately been engaged will be finished on the coming saturday his wife comes out to speak to himand he answers her harshly his children approach him and endeavour to climb up his kneesbut he knocks them away yet that man is not brutal by nature he loves his wife and childrenand was even debating within himself whether he should not soon turn thief in order to support them when they thus accosted him and were repulsed let another person insult his wifelet a stranger lay a finger upon that mans children and the demon will be raised within his breast but he speaks harshly and treats them all brutally because he is miserablebecause he is dissatisfied with every thing and every bodybecause he is reduced to despair the unfeeling aspect of the cold world around himthat world which frowns so sternly upon poverty and smiles so sweetly upon wealthhas rendered him unfeeling his hard fate drives him to the publichousetalk of the infamy of which that man is guilty in spending a few pencethe pence which would buy his children more breadupon beer or ginit is ridiculous that man must drinkhe must drown his care thought drives him madand from thought he must therefore fly but whither can he fly the rich and the welltodo have their theatres and places of amusement if a penny teagarden or a penny theatre be opened in locks fields or in any other poor neighbourhood the magistrates must put it downit is a source of demoralisationit is a focus of thieves and prostitutes but the swellmob and flash women frequent the haymarket theatreand the lyceumand the surreyand the victoriaaye and coventgarden and drury lane theatres also oh cries the magistrate that is very different yesevery thing in this country is different when the wealthy or the welldressed are concerned on one side and the poor and the ragged on the other then whither can this pauperised despairing man in locks fields go to escape the bitterness of his reflections to the publichouseor to throw himself into the canalthose are the only alternatives is it not dreadful to think that we have a sovereign and a royal family on whom the country lavishes money by hundreds of thousandswhose merest whims cost sums that would feed and clothe from year to year all the inhabitants of such a place as locks fieldsthat we have also an hereditary aristocracy and innumerable sleek and comfortable dignitaries of the church who devour the fruits of the earth and throw the parings and the peelings contemptuously to the poorin a word that we have an oligarchy feasting upon the fatted calf and flinging the offal to the patient enduring toiling oppressed millionsis it not dreadful we ask to think how much those millions do for royalty aristocracy church and landed interest and how littlehow miserably little royalty aristocracy church and landed interest do for them in return but let us go back to thomas rainford and the little boy whom we left on their way to locks fieldsfor it was to this district that the excellenthearted man was leading his young charge and as they went along many were the kind words that tom rain uttered to cheer his artless companion come dont cry my dear little fellow he would say here is another cakeand when we get home you shall have something nice for supper are you cold charley well you shall soon warm yourself by the side of a good blazing fire and tonight you shall sleep in a soft bed and tomorrow morning you shall have some new clothes i am going to take you where you will find a pretty lady who will be as kind to you as the mamma you have just lost are you tired charley well ill take you up and carry you and tom rain lifted the poor child in his arms and kissed away the tears which ran down his cheeks the boy threw his little arms around the neck of his kind protector and said oh you are as good to me as my dear papa was and how long has your papa been dead charley asked rainford supposing that the child meant by his father the husband of the woman who had died that evening in toby bunces house not very longbut i dont know how long was the reply oh stayi think i heard mamma say this morning that he died six months ago and where did you live then charley at a cottage near a great townoh i rememberwinchester winchester cried rainford i know all that part of the country wellor at least i ought to do so he murmured to himself with a profound sigh but what made you leave your cottage when papa was buried mamma had no money replied the child and some naughty people came at last and took away all the things in the cottage and turned mamma and me out of doors and then mamma cried so muchoh so much and we were very often hungry after thatand we sometimes had no bed to sleep in poor little fellow cried rainford hugging the child closer still to his breast what was your papas name wattsand my name is charley watts said the boy at this moment rainford stopped at one of the few decentlooking houses in locks fields and knocked at the door which was immediately opened by a young and beautiful woman who appeared overjoyed at his return i have brought you a present in the shape of this poor little boy said rainford as he entered the house if you wish to please me you will behave to him as kindly as i shall the young woman took charley in her arms and kissed him as a proof that toms request should be attended to and rainford well pleased at that demonstration closed the streetdoor behind him chapter x a scene at the house of sir christopher blunt on the following afternoon shortly after four oclock three gentlemen sate sipping their wine after an early dinner in a magnificently furnished room in jermyn street the one who occupied the head of the table was a redfaced stout elderly gentleman with hair of that blueishblack which denotes the use of an artificial dye and with large bushy whiskers of a similar tint he was dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons white waistcoat and black kerseymere trousers fitting very tight a massive gold chain depended from his neck and on his fingers he wore several rings of great value in manner he was authoritative even to rudeness for being immensely rich he firmly believed that money constituted an aristocracy which had a perfect right to command his pride was the more excessive too as he had risen from nothing that is he had begun life as an errand boy in a linendrapers shop and had finished his mercantile career as a warehouseman in wood street where he amassed a considerable fortune he had filled the office of sheriff but had vainly endeavoured to procure an aldermanic gown and having failed to persuade the liverymen of portsoken ward that he was the very best person they could possibly choose to represent them in the superior city court he had ever since affected to rejoice at his rejection and to look upon all city men and city matters with contempt in reality too he was dreadfully mortified at the fact of his low origin but with that clumsy duplicity which vulgar minds often employ in such cases he pretended to make a boast of his humble beginning and used the subject as a means of constantly reminding his friends and acquaintances of what he had done for himself while he held the shrievalty it fell to his lot to present an address to the prince regent and on that occasion he received the honour of knighthood such was sir christopher blunt the gentleman who sate at the bottom of the table was mr frank curtis sir christophers nephew he was a tall spare thin sicklylooking young man of threeandtwenty with long straight black hair large staring dark eyes very bad teeth and a disagreeable impudent pert expression of countenance he was an orphan and totally dependent upon his uncle who had brought him up to no business inasmuch as he had looked upon the young man as his heir sir christopher however having reached his fiftieth year without ever thinking of matrimony was suddenly smitten with miss julia mordaunt lady hatfields friend and as miss mordaunt belonged to a very ancient though a greatly impoverished family sir christopher thought that he should gain his darling wishnamely obtain standing and consideration in the fashionable worldby conducting that lady to the hymeneal altar this ardent desire he nevertheless kept to himself as much as possible his first object being to get rid of his nephew in some way or another for mr frank curtis had acquired considerable influence over his uncle and the latter was too much of a moral coward to be able to tell his nephew boldly and frankly that he proposed to change his condition the passion which frank had conceived for miss adelais torrens seemed to furnish the knight with an opportunity to settle the young man and thus throw off an influence which impeded his own matrimonial designs hence the readiness of sir christopher to lend mr torrens five thousand pounds as an inducement for that gentleman to compel his portionless daughter to accept mr frank curtis for a husband we must add that frank had passed six months on the continent and this brief sojourn in france had supplied the staple commodity of his entire conversational powers nor must we forget to observe that he was as arrogant a boaster as he was in reality a coward and that he was so afflicted with the vice of mendaciousness he could scarcely speak the truth by accident the third gentleman present in sir christophers splendid diningroom was mr howard the knights solicitor we need not say more relative to this individual than that he was about fiveandforty years old enjoyed an excellent practice was considered a finelooking man by the ladies and was noted for his devotion to the turf the table was spread with a choice dessert and an assortment of the most exquisite wines to which the three gentlemen appeared to be doing ample justice sir christopher drank copiously because he felt particularly well pleased at the prospect of getting rid of his nephew for whom and the intended bride he had taken and furnished a beautiful house at clapham frank had frequent recurrence to the bottle because he felt nervous and anxiousand the lawyer stuck fast to the burgundy because he liked it take care frank how you fill your glass too often said mr howard or the young ladies will not find you very agreeable presently dont mind me old fellow exclaimed curtis i can drink you under the table any day why when i was in paris i used to think nothing of a bottle of brandy with my breakfast i recollect once betting thirty napoleons with an old major of grenadiers at boulogne a drummajor i suppose frank said the lawyer with a smile frank could not so far forget himself as to associate with a drummajor observed sir christopher in a voice like that of a man who goes about with a punch and judy show thanks to my honest exertions i have placed myselfand in placing myself have placed himin a position which you will permit me to call brilliant you know i make no secret of what i was i rose from nothingand im proud of it and if his gracious majesty in acknowledgment of my humble merits condescended to bestow upon me the honour of knighthood oh blow that old story uncle cried the dutiful nephew i was telling you how i laid fifty napoleons with a colonel of french engineers that i would drink two bottles of champagne to every one of his share what time will the horses be round at the door demanded howard of the knight for the lawyer was anxious to escape the menaced tale at six oclock precise answered sir christopher i am always punctual i learnt punctuality when i was a lad and i firmly believe it helped to make me what i am when i look around and see how i am now situated and think of what i was do let me tell you this story interrupted frank refilling his glass it is a capital one i can assure you well so the french majorgeneral and me we sate down at table and spread out the hundred and fifty napoleons that we had bet then we rang the bell and ordered three bottles of burgundy to begin withtwo for me and one for him burgundy was it said the lawyer sipping his wine noclaret and i told you so exclaimed curtis but how provoking you are well so the lieutenantgeneral and me we began to drink the champagne just as if it was so much waterboth of us eyeing the two hundred napoleons halfpast four said mr howard looking at his watch and with difficulty suppressing a yawn for i felt sure of winningand so did he continued frank curtis well i soon disposed of my two bottles of port and the general drank his one like a trojan to work we went againtwo more for me and another for him then i proposed cigars because i knew that i could stand smoking better than him he agreed and we puffed away like two factorychimnies at last he showed signs of distress ah got quite groggy like a prizefighter at the fortieth round observed mr howard exactly said frank and so by the time i had finished my sixth bottle of sherry and the fieldmarshal had only got halfway through his third he was completely sewn up i pocketed the five hundred napoleons as a matter of courserang the bell to desire the waiter to take the admiral off to bedand then went and did the amiable at an evening party where no one could tell that i had ever been drinking at all and so you think that a very pleasant adventure master frank said sir christopher now for my part i leave guzzling and harddrinking to those vulgar citizens the other side of temple bar do you know howard that i really believe it was the most fortunate day of my life when i lost the election for portsoken if i had become an alderman you would have looked the alderman to perfection sir christopher observed the lawyer wellwelli might have been dignified on the benchor i might not said the knight complacently that is a mere matter of opinionalthough i have been told by a friend who is not accustomed to flatter that i have more sensesound sense i meanin my little finger than all the aldermen and common councilmen put together but it was fortunate for mevery fortunatethat i escaped from the vulgar contact of those citizens at this moment a servant entered the room to announce that a gentleman desired to speak to sir christopher blunt show him upshow him up cried the knight i have no secrets that my nephew and solicitor may not hear the domestic retired and in a few minutes he reappeared ushering in rainford by the name of captain sparks tom was dressed in his usual sporting garb over which he wore a white topcoatan article of attire much in vogue in those days amongst gentlemen who were accustomed to ride much on horseback as he walked his silver spurs clinked on the heels of his wellpolished boots and in his right hand he carried a whip beg your pardon gentlemen for this intrusion said tom as he entered the room but having heard from my very particular friend mr torrens of the little affair that is to take place tomorrow morning pray sit down captain sparks interrupted sir christopher any friend of mr torrens is welcome in this house i do not however remember that he has mentioned your name in my hearing very likely not said rainford drawing a chair close to the table the fact is i have been travelling in the north for my amusement during the last two years and i only returned to town this morning the first thing i did was to run down and see my dear friend torrens and you may fancy how surprised and pleased i was to learn what an excellent match his eldest daughter was about to make there is the bridegroom captain sparks said the knight pompously waving his hand towards his nephew very happy to form your acquaintance mr curtis exclaimed tom with a polite bow equally delighted to know you captain replied the nephew heres a clean glassand theres the bottle help yourself with much pleasure said tom suiting the action to the word but i was about to tell you that mr torrens did me the honour to invite me to the wedding and as i was obliged to come back to town to have my portmanteau sent down to the cottage i have made bold to intrude myself upon you gentlemen with the view of joining your partythat is if you will permit me we shall be quite charmed captain sparks answered sir christopher blunt i need not inquire if you proceed to the cottage on horseback oh yesnone of your coaches or carriages for me returned tom i have put up my horse at the stables close by in york street for my groom was taken ill a couple of hours ago our horses are also there interrupted sir christopher and one of my grooms he added ostentatiously shall bring round yours when he fetches ours but i beg pardon for my rudeness captain sparksthis gentleman is mr howardmy solicitor rainford and the lawyer bowed to each other the wine went round and tom chuckled inwardly at the success of his stratagem to obtain access to the knight you see captain sparks said sir christopher in a dictatorial tone this projected alliance has met with some little opposition on the part of the young lady herself so torrens told me this afternoon observed tom coolly but the qualifications of your nephew sir christopher are doubtless such i flatter myself exclaimed curtis pleased with this compliment that i have the knack of making myself agreeable to the women when i choose why the day that i left paris a french marchioness took poison and a countess went melancholy madboth without any apparent cause but i knew deuced well what was the reason though youre a sad fellow frank said the lawyer now why should you assert that cried the young man affecting to be annoyed by the remark did i tell you that any thing particular occurred between me and those ladies suppose the duchess did have a little partiality for meand suppose the baroness was the least thing jealouseh what then ah what then indeed said tom rain mr curtis is too much a man of honour to betray those fair ones who were weak enough to be beguiled by his soft nonsense egad youre right exclaimed frank in whose good opinion the selfstyled captain was rapidly rising i would not give a fig for a fellow that boasts of his conquests but if any one might boast on that subject i think it is your humble servant what do you say howard havent i told you some queer tales at times you have indeed answered the lawyer drily talking of boasting captain sparks said the knight who now found means to thrust in a word it is my opinion that the only legitimate boast is that which a man can make of having risen from nothing now i never attempt to conceal my origin on the contrary i glory in it why sir i began life without a sixpence and without a friend and now look at me tom rain did look at sir christopher as he was requested to do and it struck our friend that there was nothing very particular to admire in the worthy knight after all you see me captain sparks continued sir christopher in an authoritative tone well sirsuch as i am now i made myself and the more to your credit said tom who could not help thinking that if the knights words were to be taken literally it was a great pity that he had not made himself a trifle handsomer while he was about it come howard pass the bottle old fellow cried frank curtis who always got disgustingly familiar when he was in his cupswhich was so often that he was seldom out of them and as is the case with all persons who boast of the quantity they can drink it did not require much to upset him remember he added we have rather a lonely road to travel part of the way whyyou surely cannot be afraid of robbers mr curtis exclaimed tom bursting out into a merry laugh i afraid ejaculated the young man not i i should think not indeed why when i was travelling from abbeville to paris in the mail we were stopped by three highwaymen in the middle of the night the governmentcourier and myself tackled them in a moment we were the only persons in the mail and the postboy was so frightened that he got off his seat and hid himself under one of the horses well the poor courier was soon disabled but i was not easily done up egad in less than three minutes i forced the whole five scoundrels to sheer off oh i have no doubt of it said tom very quietly a powerful and courageous young gentleman like you must be a match for any five highwaymen in the world come come now exclaimed frank i dont say that exactly but i will assert this muchthat i have no more fears of a robber than i should have of a childs stopping me on the highway in that case observed mr howard throwing a pocketbook across the table towards curtis you had better take charge of the money thats to be paid over to mr torrens presently oh as for thatbut never mind cried frank not appearing particularly to relish the office of treasurer thus forced upon him yet unable to decline the trust after his magniloquent vaunting ill keep the two thousand safe enough depend upon it sir christopher looked at his watch and finding that the hour for departure was approaching he rang the bell to order the horses precisely as the clock struck six the party attended by john jeffreys with whom rain had found an opportunity to exchange a word or two quitted jermyn street and rode towards westminster bridge chapter xi the two thousand poundstorrens cottage the evening was bright clear and frosty and the stars shone resplendently on the wide arch of heaven well wrapped up in their great coats the party of horsemen pursued their way and at about seven oclock they turned from the mainroad near streatham common into a byelane leading towards torrens cottage thus leaving streatham itself on their right hand sir christopher and the lawyer rode about a hundred yards in advance tom rain and frank curtis having stopped at a publichouse to procure cigars jeffreys the groom was about fifty yards in the rear you must come and see us captain sparks after the honeymoon said curtis we shall be delighted to make you welcome i shall avail myself of your kind offer returned tom and you and me will try who can stand his bottle best continued the young man but what atrocious cigars these are i remember when i was in paris i was very intimate with a certain foreign prince who was staying thereand i dont mind hinting to you that i was a great favourite with the princess too she was a charming womana very charming woman i never saw such eyes in my life well the prince was a great smoker and he one day gave me a box of his prime cigarssuch cigars i never smoked such beauties before or since poor fellow he was killed in a duel shortly afterwards killed in a duel exclaimed tom whatby you oh noi was his second replied curtis who as usual invented the story as he went on it seems that an officer of french horseguards had been boasting of the favours which he pretended to have received from the marchioness and the marquis heard of it he instantly sent for me and desired me to carry the grenadierofficer a message i did so and the hostile encounter took place in boulognewood the hussarofficer pinked the count slap through in no time for it appeared that he was the best swordsman in all france well of course i was desperately savage to see my poor friend the duke knocked off the hooks in that unceremonious way and i determined to avenge him so i challenged the lightinfantry officer on the spot and we fought for six hours without either of us getting a scratch or yielding a foot of ground our swords were worn as thin as skewers i have no doubt of it said tom coolly it must have been a splendid sight it was indeed returned frank but at last i obtained a trifling advantage the artilleryofficer had a cold and i watched him anxiously to catch him off his guard when he sneezed egad that was a glorious idea of mine and it succeeded toofor after nine hours hard fighting i ran him through just as a cook spits a joint you cannot imagine what a reputation that affair gave me in paris every one was desirous to see the young englishman who had killed the best swordsman in france and after all without boasting it was a feat to be proud of decidedly so observed tom but you are too brave a man mr curtis to indulge in idle boasts of course cried frank fellows like you and me captain who know what swords and pistols mean are the last to brag of their exploits do you carry pistols with you mr curtis asked tom generallygenerally was the reply but i did not think it necessary to take them with me this evening well i did said rainford and here is one he added producing the weapon from the pocket of his white greatcoat pray dont hold it near me captain cried frank reining in his horse with a trepidation most remarkable on the part of a gentleman who had performed such gallant deeds in resisting highwaymen and as a duellist yesbut i shall not only hold it near you said tom i shall also fire itunless you instantly and without noise hand me over that pocketbook which you have about you captain sparks ejaculated the trembling young man this passes a joke come now i never was more serious in my life interrupted rainford sharply give me the pocketbook or and the sharp click of the pistol as tom cocked it sounded like a deathwarrant upon the cowardly boasters ears in fact he sate paralysedmotionlessspeechless upon his horse at a loss how to act come be quick cried rain seizing him by the collar of his coat i have no time for any of your nonsense youyoucantmean stammered the young man thatyou yesi mean that i am a highwayman if you like to call me so interrupted tom impatiently and so give me the pocketbook curtis obeyed with trembling hand and sinking heart and now said tom as the sounds of the trampling of a horse announced that the groom was approaching one word of caution you are going to drag a young lady into a match most unwelcome to her beware how you accomplish her unhappiness by forcing her to accept as a husband such a contemptible boaster and arrant liar as you are beware i sayor you will see more than you like of captain sparks having thus spoken rainford turned his horse round and galloped away with lightningspeed john jeffreys whom he passed in the lane did not of course attempt to molest him but when the groom overtook frank curtis he said any thing the matter sir i saw the captain gallop back again like an arrow captain ejaculated the young man he is a robbera thiefa gallowsbird what do you mean sir asked jeffreys affecting profound astonishment he has plundered me of two thousand pounds john cried frank in so lamentable a tone that the groom could hardly suppress a violent indication to laugh robbed you sir exclaimed jeffreys youre joking sir no two men in england could rob you we had a desperate tussle for it john replied curtis but the villain knocked me off my horse with the buttend of his pistol it was a cowardly blowand i was not prepared for it most likely not sir said the groom drily but i thought he must have used some underhand means because i know what sort of a customer you must be youre right enough there my man returned curtis i had got the better of him at one time and although he has gone off with the two thousand pounds he has carried away with him such a drubbing that he wont forget in a hurry but let us ride after my uncle and mr howardbecause he might come back added frank casting a terrified glance behind him the young gentleman and the servant put spurs to their horses and in a quarter of an hour overtook the knight and the lawyer to whom frank related in his own style the adventure which had just occurred and you mean to say that you surrendered the pocketbookthat you gave up two thousand pounds exclaimed sir christopher in a passion what could i do said frank the scoundrel took the money from me by main force he was stronger than the five highwaymen in france observed the lawyer quietly stronger i believe you cried curtis and then he was armed to the very teeth why when he threw open his green cutaway coat i could see by the starlight a belt stuck round with pistols daggers and sharp knives or else do you think for a moment that he could have mastered me well the mischief is done said the knight in a doleful tone and a pretty figure we shall cut at the torrenss i dare swear that the rascal is no more an acquaintance of the family than he is of the king of england it is to be hoped he is not observed mr howard who was mightily pleased to think that he had handed over the money into franks keeping previously to setting outit is to be hoped nototherwise your nephew sir christopher would be marrying into a nice family really mr howard this is no time for jesting exclaimed the knight but why didnt you try and stop the villain john i sir said the groom how should i know that he had committed a robbery when he galloped past me besides if he is such a terrible chap as mr frank represents him it would have been useless for me to try my hand with him certainly john is quite right observed mr curtis if i could do nothing with him im sure no one else could he is as strong as a lion and egad how he did swear it was quite horrible to hear him but what shall we do do indeed ejaculated sir christopher we shall look like so many fools when we arrive at the cottage but mr torrens will take your cheque sir christopher remarked the lawyer true we can manage it in that way said the knight still the cash would have appeared more businesslike on such an occasion but it is growing late let us push on yeslet us push on echoed frank casting troubled glances around and trembling lest the highwayman should take it into his head to return and rob the remainder of the party in twenty minutes they reached torrens cottage the inmates of which we must pause to describe mr torrens was a widower and had numbered about fiveandfifty years he was a tall thin drylooking man with a very sallow complexion a cold grey eye and a stern expression of countenance after having long held a situation in a government office he retired with a pension and just at the same period a relation died leaving him a few thousand pounds with this sum he bought a beautiful little villa which he denominated torrens cottage and the leasehold of some land at norwood where he set busily to work to build a row of houses to be called torrens terrace he had long made architecture an amateurstudy during his leisure hours and the moment he was enabled to retire from his situation in the ordnance office and became possessed of capital he resolved to put his numerous architectural theories into practice but as it frequently happens in such matters he grew embarrassed and the works were menaced with stoppage for want of funds when mr curtis became enamoured of his eldest daughter whom he met at the house of some of mr torrenss relations in london the bargain already described was soon after struck between sir christopher blunt and mr torrens who did not hesitate to sacrifice his daughters happiness to his own pecuniary interests unfortunately too for the young lady he did not regard the contemplated union in the light of a sacrifice at all inasmuch as he naturally looked upon frank curtis as sir christophers heir not dreaming that the worthy knight entertained the remotest idea of perpetrating matrimony mr torrens therefore considered that his daughter adelais was about to form a most eligible connexion and although he was aware that her affections were engaged in another quarter he acted upon the belief that parents must know best how to ensure their childrens happiness his two daughters adelais and rosamond were both charming girls of the respective ages of eighteen and sixteen their dark clustering locks their deep hazel eyes lustrous with liquid light and their symmetrical figures filled all beholders with admiration adelais was now pale melancholy and drooping for she loathed the alliance that was in contemplation for herloathed it not only because her heart was anothers but also because the manners conversation and personal appearance of frank curtis were revolting in her estimation rosamond possessed a rich complexion in which glowed all the innate feelings of her soul animating and imparting to every feature of her beautiful face an additional charm she was naturally the confidant of her sister whose hard fate she deeply deplored and many were the plans which the amiable girls had devised and discussed with a view to overcome their fathers cruel pertinacity in insisting on the sacrifice of adelais to frank curtis but each and all of those projects had either failed or involved proceedings repugnant to their pure and artless minds for instance they had thought of abandoning the paternal roof and endeavouring to seek their livelihood by needlework in some safe retirement then adelais would not permit rosamond to dare the misfortunes of the world by flying from a home which shethe younger sisterhad at least no personal motive to desert and rosamond on her side would not allow adelais to set out alone again a clandestine marriage between adelais and her lover was often debated the young man urged it himselfbut the daughters dreaded the fathers eternal anger and thus this project had been abandoned also to be brief the dreaded moment was now at hand and the seal of misery was about to be set on the roll of the elder maidens destinies and who was the lover of adelais a handsome generoushearted honourable young man occupying a situation in the very government office where mr torrens had himself served for many years but although clarence villiers was so far provided for and had every prospect of rising rapidly on account of his steady habits and assiduous attention to his employment yet he was at present only a poor clerk with ninety pounds ayear and he had no capital mr torrens as we have seen required capital and thus frank curtis was preferred to clarence villiers we cannot quit this description without alluding to the ardent affection which existed between the sisters having lost their mother in their childhood and their father being almost constantly from home throughout the day they were naturally thrown entirely upon each other for companionship an illimitable confidence sprang up between thema confidence more intimate far than even that which usually subsists between sisters because this confidence on the part of adelais and rosamond extended to a mutual outpouring of their most trivial as well as of their most important thoughts hopes or aspirations thus the reader will cease to be astonished that when adelais in the anguish of her heart had contemplated flight from the paternal roof as the only alternative save a hateful marriage rosamond insisted upon accompanying her much as they loved and revered their father they were both prepared to sacrifice even filial affection and filial duty for each others sake this feeling may be looked upon as one involving a grievous fault on their side it was not however the less firmly rooted in their mindsfor they were all and all to each other illustration chapter xii adelais and rosamond sir christopher blunt mr howard and frank curtis were soon seated in mr torrens comfortable parlour the walls of which were adorned with an infinite variety of architectural plans set in carved oaken frames a cheerful fire blazed in the grate wine was placed upon the table and the travellers were speedily as much at their ease as they could wish or as their host could render them the young ladies were in another apartment mr torrens having desired them to remain in the drawingroom while the commercial part of the projected matrimonial arrangement was being settled in the parlour when the usual complimentary phrases had been exchanged and sir christopher had observed that the weather was remarkably fine but very colda proposition to which mr torrens entirely assentedfor somehow or another people never do contradict each other when commenting on that subjectwhen also a glass or two of wine had been imbibed by each the knight inquired whether mr torrens happened to be acquainted with a captain sparks the answer was a negative sir christopher then began to relate the adventure of the evening and although he was constantly interrupted by his nephew who was anxious to interpolate in the narrative certain saving clauses respecting his own valour towards the highwayman the worthy knight nevertheless succeeded at length in bringing the tale to an end it is clear said mr torrens that you were first duped and then robbed by an infamous scoundrel but have you any notion how he could have learnt enough of the pending arrangements to be enabled to talk so familiarly with regard to them when he first introduced himself to you that puzzles me my dear sir returned sir christopher and it is likely to continue to puzzle you uncle observed frank for the whole business defies conjecture i remember when i was in france the villain evidently knew that you would leave town with a considerable sum of money in your possession said torrens and his aim was to get it he did get it too but not without a deuced good thrashing into the bargain cried frank and thats some consolation i dare say captain sparks as he calls himself would gladly be thrashed every hour in the day on the same terms observed the lawyer but i think that when our little business is concluded i should do well to return to london and give information at bow street as speedily as possible by no means exclaimed sir christopher we must keep the tale to ourselves if it got into the newspapers with all the particulars it would only make us look ridiculous we might punish the man but we should never get back the money nono let the matter dropfor all our sakes thank heaven continued the knight assuming a slower and more pompous tone the loss is paltryvery paltry in my estimation i shall not miss the amount i can assure you but you have no objection to my giving the scoundrel another good drubbing uncle the first time i meet him again inquired frank curtis with great apparent earnestness oh there can be no objection to thatif the captain will allow you so to operate on him said the lawyer drily allow me indeed i should like to know how he could prevent it exclaimed frank affecting deep indignation at the remark you should have seen the struggle we had very likely but i noticed your greatcoat when we came in just nowand it was not soiled said howard of course not i had him down all the time then it was a great pity you did not keep him there comecomeenough of this fencing cried sir christopher produce the deeds mr howard my friend torrens will take my cheque for the two thousand oh certainly replied the venal father and tomorrow let us hope that i shall have to give you another for three thousand more added sir christopher thank heaven my cheque is as good as a banknote but it wasnt twenty years ago though times have altered since then and yet as my friend howard knows i am proud of my humble origin yesyes uncle exclaimed frank we all know that perfectly but lets to business and then join the young ladies i shall make them laugh with the story of the highwayman its the first time in my life i was ever conqueredever overcome and now it hasnt been by fair means i remember once when i was at montreuil three french peasants had some of their nonsense with me but i just here are the documents gentlemen said mr howard frank shall conclude his story presently the agreements for the loan of the five thousand pounds were then read over mr torrens signed them sir christopher blunt wrote him a cheque for two thousand on accountthe remaining three to be advanced only on condition that the proposed marriage took placeand thus terminated the commercial part of the business the four gentlemen then proceeded to the drawingroom where the two young ladies were seated adelais was excessively pale and when the odious mr frank curtis tripped smirkingly up to her and taking her fair hand pressed it to his lipshis breath heated with wine and rendered offensive by the fumes of the cigar steaming upon that delicate skinthe maiden recoiled as if from something loathsome her father who observed her narrowly cast upon her a rapid but ireful glance and adelais exerted herself strenuously to recover her composure like a victim about to be sacrificed at the altar of some avenging god she suffered her admirer to lead her to a seat in a remote part of the room and placing himself by her side frank curtis darted a triumphant look at howard and sir christopher as much as to say just see how successfully i am going to play the amiable in this quarter then turning towards the lovely adelais whose large blue eyes were bent timidly down and whose bosom palpitated with a variety of painful emotions he observed in what he considered to be a most endearing whisper come my sweet gal cheer up theres nothing to be frightened at in marriage i know that im not quite a ladys man but we shall get on better together by and bye you see my dear ive always been used to manly sports or to seeking adventures where some glory was to be gainedsuch as knocking down watchmen or fighting with highwaymen or killing my man in a dueland things of that kind but ive no doubt it will be pleasant enough to be tied to your apronstringif the string itself isnt too tight adelais raised her fine blue eyes turned them for a moment upon her admirer and then again fixed them on the carpet a profound sigh escaping her bosom at the same timebut that glance so involuntarily thrown towards her companion was one of sudden curiosityas if she were anxious to discover by the expression of his face whether he were indeed serious in the insufferable rhodomontade with which he sought to captivate her therethats right my dear gal said curtis mistaking the motive of that rapid look which was directed towards him dont stand on any ceremony with me in a few hours more we shall be husband and wife adelais shuddered visibly ah i like this little modestyits all very proper on your part continued the disgusting young man but it will soon wear offnaturally so the young lady now started indignantlyher countenance became crimsonand then large tears burst from her eyes curtis caught hold of her handbut she withdraw itshe literally snatched it away as if from the jaws of a hideous reptile you neednt think im going to eat you miss said frank in a surly tone but i forgot to tell you what an adventure i had just now with a couple of highwaymen he continued in a milder voice you see as me and my uncle and howard were coming down the lane i fell back a littlejust to think of you my dear at leisure when all of a sudden three chaps jumped over a bank and pointed their blunderbusses at me i didnt care a rap for that but taking the ridingwhip by the thin end i knocked down three of themone after the otherwith the handlepart you know and had just made up my mind to tackle the fourth when my horse reared and threw me for a moment i was insensible and during that time the fifth scoundrel picked my pocket of the two thousand pounds which i may call the purchasemoney of your own dear pretty little self sir exclaimed adelais aloud is it your intention to insult me and without waiting for a reply but yielding to the tide of anguish and indignation which now impelled her she rushed from the room rosamond who while engaged in conversation with her father sir christopher and mr howard at the other end of the room had never ceased to watch her sister with the most lively interest now immediately followed the almost heartbroken girl the moment the sisters had reached their bedchamber adelais threw herself into rosamonds arms exclaiming i will never marry himi will die sooner has he offended you inquired rosamond affectionately embracing her disconsolate sister but i need not ask your changing countenanceyour anxious looksyour convulsive movementsand then your tears while he sate by you oh my very soul revolts against him cried adelais emphatically the conflicts of agonising emotions painfully expressed on her countenance at firstwhen he approached meit required all the exertions of which my fortitude was capable to subdue the feelings of aversion and disgustof bitter woe and heartfelt miserywith which i was agitatedbut when his coarse language met my earsoh rosamond exclaimed the distracted maiden i must flyi must avoid this dreadful fateor my heart will break at this moment mr torrens slowly opened the door and entered the room his countenance wore an expression which gave evidence that anger and compunction were maintaining a fierce struggle in his breast but the former feeling was rapidly obtaining the ascendancy rashdisobedient girl he exclaimed fixing his stern cold eyes upon adelais who still clung to her younger sister what signifies this folly spare mespare me my dearest father cried adelais suddenly tearing herself from rosamonds embrace and falling on her knees before her sire i cannot marry that horrible man mr torrens bit his lip almost till the blood came listen to me my dear father continued the despairing girl joining her hands together while her cheeks were of marble whiteness unanimated by a tinge of vital colouringi am your daughter and must obey you but if you persist in saying receive that man as your husband it is the same as if you were to utter the word die oh noyou cannotyou will not sacrifice me in this cruel cruel manner what have i done to offend you that my unhappiness has become your aim dearest fatherrelenti implore you on my knees i beseech you to save me ere it be too late adelais exclaimed mr torrens arming himself with that fatal sophistry which led him to believe that he was the only judge of what was fitting for his daughters welfare and happinessadelais risei command you the miserable girl obeyed but staggered with vacillating and irregular steps towards a chair in which she sank the agony of her soul now expelling all power of reflection from its seat i have gone too far to retreateven if i were so disposed continued mr torrens your happiness will be ensured by this union her happiness father said rosamond reproachfully oh nonever never undutiful girl cried the venal parent do you league with your sister against me i tell you that adelais is about to become the wife of a young man who can give her an enviable position in society and who at his uncles death will inherit an immense fortune it is true that mr curtis is somewhat rough in manner and incautious with his tongue but perfection exists not in this world to be brief this marriage shall take placeit musti dare not retract father one word more exclaimed adelais suddenly recovering her power of thought and speechthose powers which anguish had for a few minutes completely subdued you are about to sell your daughter to that manhe boasted to me that a few thousand pounds were the purchasemoneyand hence my abrupt departure from the room the phrase was wrongillchosencoarse ejaculated mr torrens evidently smarting under this announcement but we must not judge of words themselveswe must only look to the motives of him who utters them mr curtis is incapable of insulting you oh you know not how abhorrent is the coarseness of his language cried adelais bursting into a torrent of tears you provoke me beyond the limits of human patience ejaculated mr torrens stamping his foot with rage but no more of this you know my willprepare to obey it i ask you not to return to the drawingroom tonighttomorrow morning let me hope that you will show yourself a dutiful daughter towards a father who is anxious only to ensure your prosperity mr torrens then imprinted a cold kiss upon the fair foreheads of adelais and rosamond and hastily quitted the apartment for some minutes after the door had closed behind them the sisters sat gazing upon each other in the silence of painful and awful reflection yet beautiful were they in their sorrow for the unstudied attitudes and abandonment of limb which such a state of mind produces gave additional grace to the just proportions of their forms and imparted an expression of the most tender interest to the perfect composition of their features sister at length said rosamond in a soft and mournful tone as she approached adelais what will you do this question suddenly aroused the unhappy young lady to a sense of the urgent necessity of adopting some decisive measure winding her arms around rosamonds neck she said i must fly from my fathers housei must abandon the paternal dwelling o heaven wherefore am i reduced to so fearful an alternative speak not only of yourself beloved adelais murmured rosamond chidingly for you know that my fate as well as my heart is inseparably linked with thine oh i doubt not the sincerity of your love for me dearest sister exclaimed miss torrens but i tremble at the idea of making you the companion of my flight have we not read in books dear girl that london is a dreadful placeabounding in perils of all kinds and concealing pitfalls beneath its most pleasant places oh rosamond you are so youngso very young to quit your fathers home and venture in that great city of danger and crime but with you as my companion adelais i shall have courage to meet all those perils of which you speak responded rosamond the tones of her voice becoming so gentle so melting and so persuasive that never did she seem so dearso very dear unto her sister as at this moment and now all hesitation was banished on the part of adelaisit was settledit was determinedrosamond should become the companion of her flight chapter xiii the elopement let us now return to rainford whom we left on his way back to london after having so triumphantly eased the vainglorious mr frank curtis of the two thousand pounds the highwaymanfor such indeed was the gay generoushearted and brave tom rainscarcely condescended to bestow even a chuckle of satisfaction upon a victory so easily wonan exploit so readily accomplished he would have valued the prize far more had it been obtained by means of hard blows and as the result of a desperate encounter for the love of adventure was inherent in his dispositionand he had often courted danger in his life for the exciting pleasure of freeing himself from its intricacy having galloped his good steed to the beginning of the lane he checked its celerity and then proceeded at a moderate pace along the main road to the publichouse where curtis and himself had stopped to purchase their cigars about half an hour previously riding up to the door of the little establishment the highwayman leapt from his horse and threw the reins to a dependant of the place who was conversing with the postillion of a chaise and pair that had stopped at the door when rainford sauntered leisurely up to the bar with his chimneypot hat set rakishly on one side his white coat comfortably buttoned up and his ridingwhip in his hand the landlord instantly recollected him again and observed as he drew the liquor which the highwayman ordered back to london sir tonight yes replied tom carelessly i just escorted my friend as far as torrens cottage and shall now get home again these words produced a visible emotion on the part of a tall handsome darkhaired young man who was also standing at the bar he was well protected by a great coat against the cold and tom therefore very naturally concluded that he was the traveller journeying in the postchaise outside torrens cottage cried the landlord why i do declare thats the very ticket this gentleman here was just making inquiries whether i had any one that could take a note there in a confidential way the landlord blurted forth this announcement without heeding the significant coughs and hems of the tall young gentleman who seemed greatly annoyed that the object of his call at the publichouse should thus be published to the very first stranger who entered the place after him you should keep a closer tongue in your head said tom rain how do you know what harm might be done by your stupidity in letting out the gentlemans business in this kind of way fortunately i am not the kind of fellow to do mischief and in this case it may be that i can effect some good indeed exclaimed the tall young gentleman his countenance suddenly exchanging the expression of annoyance which the landlords garrulity had excited for one indicative of hope and joy yesi think so said tom but we must have a few words in private walk into the parlour gentlemen cried the landlord theres no one in that room at present rainford and the tall stranger followed this suggestion and when the door was closed behind them the highwayman said if i am not very much mistaken you must be the gentleman whom that lying braggart frank curtis is endeavouring to cut out my name is clarence villiers sir was the guarded reply and you are the lover of mr torrenss eldest daughter continued rainford now do not waste valuable time by reflecting whether you shall make me your confidant or not i am disposed to serve you tell me how i can do it you will excuse me said villiers in a polite but somewhat reserved tone if i first request to be informed to whom i have the honour of speaking captain sparks was the immediate reply i happen to know old sir christopher and his precious nephew and i rode down with them nearly as far as the cottage but i did not accept their invitation to go infor particular reasons of my own you may however suppose that i am well acquainted with all the particulars of this infamous case miss adelais torrens loves mr clarence villiers and hates mr frank curtis but mr frank curtis is the successful suitor with the mercenary father because a certain five thousand pounds enough captain sparks ejaculated villiers i see that you do indeed know all and will you serve me in this strait i willhonour bright cried tom theres my hand upon it now say what is to be done it is already past eight oclock he added after a hasty reference to a handsome gold watch which he drew from his fob my object was to obtain an interview with adelais in some way or another and urge her toto speak plainly my friend cried rain to elope with you welldo you mean every thing that is honourable as god is my judge said the young man solemnly i have frequently urged the dear girl to consent to a clandestine marriage with me but the purity of her soul has ever revolted against a course which she considers to be marked with duplicity where would you convey her during the interval that must necessarily elapse before you can marry her asked rainford because as she is a minor i suppose you could not obtain a special licence without her fathers consent i have an aunt in london devoted to my interests answered clarence and she would receive her with even maternal affection until i should acquire a legal right to protect her so far so good observed tom and yet a young lady eloping at night with a young manremember i am only speaking for the good of both of you i had foreseen that difficulty also said villiers hastily the fact is adelais and her sister rosamond are so linked together by the tenderest bonds of affection that the one would not move a step unaccompanied by the other the devil cried rainford two ladies to carry off that increases the embarrassment of the business now it is very clear that it is perfectly useless for us to send a messenger down with a note it would be intercepted by the father but if you will sit down and write what you choose i will undertake to have it delivered to the young lady herself you exclaimed clarence joyfully yes what i promise i will perform said rainford follow my directionsand all shall go well clarence rang the bell ordered writing materials and in a few minutes completed a note to his beloved adelais which he read to his companion seal it said tom because it may pass through the hands of another person after it leaves mine and before it reaches miss torrens this suggestion was instantaneously complied with and rainford secured the letter about his person now he continued after a moments reflection do you proceed with the chaise down the lane and stop as near the cottage as is consistent with prudence i shall retrace my way there at once fear nothingbut wait patiently at the place where you pull up until i make my appearance villiers promised to fulfil these instructions and rainford having taken a temporary leave of him remounted his horse and galloped towards torrens cottage the highwayman had his plan of proceeding ready digested by the time the white walls of the building rendered particularly conspicuous in the starlight met his view alighting from his horse at a distance of about a hundred yards he tied the animal to a tree and then repaired towards the dwelling having reconnoitred the premises he speedily discovered the stable and to his infinite joy a light streamed from one of the windows of that building leaping over the palings which separated the kitchengarden from the adjacent fields tom rain proceeded to the stable and there as he had anticipated he found john jeffreys the groom busily employed with his masters horses john was alone and his surprise was great when upon being tapped on the shoulder he turned round and beheld the highwayman silence said tom in a whisper we have no time to lose in idle chatter heres five guineas for you and you must get this note conveyed secretly to miss torrensadelais the eldestyou know it shall be done sir replied jeffreys i am already far in the good graces of the housemaid the cook is old and deaf and so theres no fear of my not being able to succeed good and you will bring me the answer up the lane where i shall wait for you and how can you read it when you get it demanded jeffreys the night is not quite clear enough for that the answer will be a verbal oneyes or no replied tom jeffreys promised that no delay should occur on his part and rainford retraced his steps to the spot where he had left his horse many novelists would here pause for the honest but somewhat tedious purpose of detailing all the reflections which passed through the mind of rainford during the mortal halfhour that elapsed ere the sounds of footsteps upon the hard soil announced the approach of some person but as we do not wish either to spin out our narrative with dry material or to keep the reader in any unnecessary suspense we will at once declare that at the expiration of the aforesaid thirty minutes john jeffreys made his appearance at the appointed spot what news demanded tom impatiently all right and the answer is yes thats well exclaimed rainford you may now go back john all that i require of you is done but i have something to say to you sir observed the servant just now sir christopher sent for me up into the parlour to give me some orders and i heard mr frank who is uncommon far gone with brandyandwater making a boast to the lawyerfellow that hed walk all round the grounds to see that every thing is safe it seems that the lawyer has been twitting him about his little business with you just now up the lane you know and so mr frank is as bumptious as possible i only thought id better tell you of thisin case youve any business in hand thats likely to keep you about the place i am very much obliged to you john said rainford heres another five guineas for youand i shall not forget to speak to old death in your favour but you had better get back as soon as you can for fear you should be missed jeffreys thanked the highwayman for the additional remuneration and returned to the cottage it was now past nine oclock and rainford murmured to himself i wonder how much longer they will be his horse which was a highspirited animal began to grow impatient of this long stoppage and he himself shivered in spite of the good great coat with the nipping chill another quarter of an hour elapsed and to the infinite joy of tom rain he suddenly beheld two female figures well muffled in shawls and furs emerge from the obscurity at a short distance all right ladies he said in as loud a voice as he dared use consistently with prudence adelais and rosamond hurried towards him as affrighted lambs to their shepherd and yet when they were close to him they seemed unable to utter a word fear not ladies exclaimed the highwayman i am the friend to whom mr villiers alluded in his note save us then sirsave us said adelais in an urgent and imploring tone for mr curtis saw us leave the house he was in the garden at that moment the sounds of voices were heard in the direction of the cottage and they were evidently approaching hasten up the lane young ladieshasten for gods sake said tom rain mr villiers is there with the postchaiseand i will remain here to bar the way adelais and rosamond could not even give utterance to the thanks which their hearts longed to express terror froze the words that started to their lips and not daring to glance behind them they hurried up the lane tom rainford now mounted his horse and took his station in the middle of the way for several persons were rapidly approaching from the house in a few moments they were near enough to enable rainford to catch what they said the disobedientselfwilled girls exclaimed one whom tom was right in supposing to be mr torrens but wasnt it fortunate that i twigged them said curtis egad it will be much more fortunate if we overtake them observed the lawyer bless meim out of breath cried sir christopher i wish john would come on with the horses did you tell him frank to be sure i did we cannot fail to overtake them but poor things suppose that highwayman should fall in with themand me not there to defend them i think it would be all the same howard was interrupted by a sudden ejaculation on the part of mr torrens who was a few paces in advance of the others but who now abruptly came to a full stop what is it demanded curtis shaking from head to foot in spite of all the liquor he had imbibed during the day some ruffian on horsebacktheredont you see exclaimed mr torrens but i am not afraid of him his presence here is in some way connected with my daughters and the incensed father rushed furiously towards the highwayman stand back cried tom in his clear stentorian voice and this command was followed by the sharp clicking of the two pistols which he cocked the robber exclaimed frank curtis clinging to the coattails of mr torrens who had retreated a few paces at the ominous sound of the pistols at him my dear sirat him im here to help you villaingive up the two thousand pounds and we will let you goon my honour as a knight ejaculated sir christopher keeping as far remote as he deemed prudent from the sinister form which wrapped in the white great coat and seated composedly on the tall horse seemed amidst the obscurity of the night to be a ghost disdaining to touch the earth i am very much obliged to you for your kindness sir christopher said tom but i am not at all in fear of the necessity of purchasing my liberty at any price whatsoever i however give you every one due warning that the first who tries to pass this way scoundrel my daughterswhere are they vociferated mr torrens thats itgive it him cried frank curtis ill be at him when youve done go on at once cried howard and why are you standing idle there because it is not my business to interfere well done lawyer exclaimed tom no fees can recompense you for an ounce of lead in the thigh for if i do fire i shall only try to lamenot kill mr curtissir christopherwill you not help me to arrest this villain who beards us to our very faces exclaimed torrens in a towering passion and again he rushed forward while frank curtis beat a precipitate retreat behind his uncle stand back or by god ill fire thundered rainford suddenly spurring his horse in such a manner that the length of the animal was made to block up nearly the entire width of the byelane you dare not murder me cried torrens my daughters will escapeand he attempted to pass in front of the horse but by a skilful manuvre rainford baffled himarrested his progressand kept him at bay using all the time the most desperate menaces which he did not however entertain the remotest idea of putting into execution mr curtis sirwill you help me cried the infuriate father my daughters are escaping before your very eyesyou are losing your bride and you the rest of the money that was to have purchased her said rainford coolly mercenary old man you are rightly punished with these words the highwayman suddenly wheeled his horse round and disappeared in a moment he had succeeded in barring the way for upwards of ten minutes against the pursuers of the two fugitive ladies and he calculated that in less than half that time they must have reached the postchaise which clarence villiers had in readiness to receive them jeffreys had purposely delayed getting the horses out and even when he did appear with them several minutes had elapsed since the highwayman had left the path free to those who thought fit to avail themselves of the services of the animals these were only twomr torrens and jeffreys himself the latter volunteering his aid for the purpose of misleading and embarrassing the father rather than of assisting him frank curtis affected to be suddenly taken very unwell sir christopher was really so and the lawyer although by no means a coward did not see any utility in hazarding his life against such a desperate character as captain sparks for by that denomination only did he know tom rain appeared to be thus while the knight his nephew and the attorney retraced their steps to the cottage leading back the horses which had been brought out for their use mr torrens and jeffreys galloped away towards london chapter xiv lady hatfield and dr lascellesesther de medina two days after the incidents which we have just related dr lascelles received a message at about noon requesting him to repair immediately to the dwelling of lady hatfield who was seriously indisposed he obeyed this summons with more than usual alacrity for ever since lord ellingham had made him his confidant the curiosity of the worthy doctor had been strangely piqued by the unaccountable fact that lady hatfield should reject the suit of a man whom she not only professed to love but who was in every way worthy of her on his arrival at lady hatfields residence he was surprised to learn from miss mordaunt that his patient was too unwell to quit her couch and when he was introduced into georgianas bedchamber he found her labouring under a strong nervous excitement in accordance with the sacred privilege of the physician he was of course left alone with her ladyship and seating himself by the side of the bed he questioned her in the usual manner georgiana explained her sensations but although she alluded to nothing beyond those physical details which directly came within the province of the medical man still dr lascelles had no difficulty in perceiving that the mind rather than the body was affected my dear lady hatfield he said in as gentle and mild a tone as he could possibly assume it is in the power of the physician to administer certain drugs which may produce temporary composure and an opiate will encourage a good nights rest but you will forgive me for observing that the condition in which i now find you is scarcely one to which medical science will apply successfullyunless seconded by aid of a more refined and delicate nature i do not comprehend you doctor exclaimed georgiana casting upon him a glance of mingled surprise and uneasiness i mean lady hatfield resumed lascelles that you are the prey to some secret griefsome source of vexation and annoyance which medical skill cannot remove the aid of a refined and delicate nature to which i refer is such as can be afforded only by a sincere and confidential friend without for an instant seeking to draw you into any explanations it is my duty to assure you that unless your mind be tranquillised medicine will not successfully encounter this nervous irritabilitythis intense anxietythis oppressive feeling of coming evil without apparent causeand this sleeplessness at nightof all which you complain i thank you most sincerely for this candour and frankness on your part doctor said lady hatfield after a long pause during which she appeared to reflect profoundly to deny that i have suffered much in mind during the last few days were to practise a useless deception upon you but i require no confidanti need not the solace of friendship to your medical skill i trust for at all events a partial restoration to health and travellingchange of scenethe excitement of visiting parisor some such means of diversion will effect the rest these last words were however accompanied with a deep sighas if upon the ladys soul were forced the sad conviction that happiness and herself must evermore remain strangers to each other i should scarcely recommend travelling in the winter time lady hatfield observed doctor lascelles surely our own city can afford that constant variety of recreation and those everchanging scenes of amusement which may produce a beneficial effect upon your spirits i abhor the pleasures of the fashionable world doctor said georgiana emphatically there is something so cold in the ostentation of that sphereso chilling in its magnificenceso formal in its pursuitsso ceremonial so thoroughly artificial in all its features and proceedings that when in the crowded ballroom or the brilliant soire i even feel more alone than when in the solitude of my own chamber and yet lady hatfield throughout the extensive circle of your acquaintance said the physician there must be at least a few endowed with intellectual qualifications adapted to render them agreeable the most pleasant parties composed of these select might be given your rankyour wealthyour own wellstored mindand pardon me your beautywould ensure to you oh doctor exclaimed georgiana i can anticipate the arguments you are about to use but alas my mind appears to be in that morbid state which discolours all objects with its own jaundiced thoughts i speak thus candidly to you doctorbecause i am aware of your friendship for mei know also that the admission i have now made will be regarded by you as a solemn secretand perhaps your advice she added slowly and hesitatingly might prove beneficial to me but nono she exclaimed her utterance suddenly assuming great rapidity it is useless to say more advice cannot serve me there is scarcely a possible case of human vexation grief or annoyance which cannot be relieved by the solace or ameliorated by the counsel of a friend observed doctor lascelles dwelling emphatically upon his words georgiana played abstractedly with the long luxuriant hair which streamed over her shoulders and spread its shining masses on the white pillow but at the same time the snowy nightdress rose and sank rapidly with the heavings of her bosom believe me lady hatfield continued doctor lascelles after a short pause during which he vainly awaited a reply to his former observation i am deeply grieved to find that one who so little deserves the sting of grief or the presence of misfortune should suffer from either the sharpness of the first or the menaces of the latter but is it not possible my dear ladyand now forgive me if i avail myself of the privilege of a physician to ask this questionis it not possible i say that you have conjured up phantoms which have no substantial existence remember that there are certain conditions of the mind when the imagination becomes a prey to the wildest delusions doctor i am no monomaniac said lady hatfield abruptly but justly indeedoh most justly and truly did you ere now assert that i little deserve the sting of grief if through any crimeany weaknessany frailty on my part i had merited the sore displeasure of heavenat that time she checked herself abruptly and burst into a flood of tears and for a few moments her countenance appeared to be the sad index of a breaking heart doctor she observed at length pardon this manifestation of weakness on my part but my spirits are so depressedmy mind feels so truly wretched that i cannot control these tears think no more of what we have been saying i wish that we had not said so much leave me a prescription and visit me again in the course of the day lascelles wrote out a prescription and then took his departure wondering more than ever what secret cause of grief was nourished in the bosom of lady hatfield that this secret grief was the motive which had induced or compelled her to refuse the hand of lord ellingham he could not doubtthat it arose from no crimeweaknessnor frailty on her part he felt assured inasmuch as her own words uttered in a paroxysm of mental anguish and not in a calm moment when deception might be her aim proved that factand that it was associated with any physical ailment he could hardly believe because if she were the prey to an insidious disease no feeling of shameno false delicacy could possibly force a woman of her good sense and naturally powerful mind to keep such a fact from her physician what then could be that secret and profoundlyrooted cause of grief was it monomania of some novel or very rare kind the curiosity of the man of science was keenly whetted he already began to suspect that he was destined to discover some new phase in the constitution of the human mind and he resolved to adopt all the means within his reach to solve the mystery this curiosity on his part was by no means of a common vulgar or base nature considering the profession and researchful disposition of the man it was a legitimate and entirely venial sentiment it was not that curiosity which loves to feed itself upon the materials of scandal it was purely in connexion with the thirst of knowledge and the passion for discovery which ever animated him in that sphere of science to which he was so enthusiastically devoted the doctor was proceeding homewards when he encountered lord ellingham the earl was walking by the side of an elderly gentleman on whose arm hung a tall and graceful young lady but the physician did not immediately catch a glimpse of her countenance as it was turned towards lord ellingham who was speaking at the moment the nobleman shook lascelles warmly by the hand and immediately introduced his companions by the names of mr and miss de medina the doctor bowed and then cast a glance at the countenance of the young lady but he started as if with a sudden pangfor in the beautiful jewess who now stood before him he beheldapparently past all possibility of errorthe same female who a few days previously had attempted selfdestruction in southmoulton street but almost simultaneously with this unexpected conviction the solemn promise which he had made to tom rainford whom he only knew on that occasion by the denomination of jameson flashed to the mind of doctor lascelles and instantly composing himself he uttered some observation of a general nature i am glad we have thus met doctor said lord ellingham who had not noticed his sudden but evanescent excitement for my friend mr de medina is a comparative stranger in london and it is as well added the nobleman with a smile that he should become acquainted with the leading physician of the day i believe that no one enjoys health so good as to be enabled to dispense altogether with our assistance said the physician bowing in acknowledgment of the compliment thus paid him the most perfect piece of mechanism must necessarily need repair sometimes decidedly so said lord ellingham but we will not assert that physicians are necessary evils doctorin the same sense as the lawyers are i appeal to miss de medina whether his lordship be not by implication too hard upon my profession exclaimed lascelles laughing his lordship replied esther was yesterday riding a very highspirited horse and had he been thrown in such a manner as to have incurred injury i question whether he would have believed that his medical attendant was an evil however necessary i owe you my profound gratitude for this powerful defence of my profession miss de medina said the doctor who had thus succeeded in compelling the young lady to speak he then raised his hat and passed on but he had not proceeded many paces when he was overtaken by lord ellingham who had parted from his companions to have a few minutes conversation with the doctor that is a lovely girl to whom your lordship has just introduced me said lascelles and as good in heart as she is beautiful in person exclaimed the nobleman ah cried the physician with a sly glance is lady hatfield already forgotten far from it said arthur his tone instantly becoming mournful and his countenance overclouded you cannot think me so fickleso vacillating doctor no the image of georgiana is never absent from my memory i had only encountered mr de medina and his daughter a few minutes before we met you and not only am i bound to show them every attention in my power as they are tenants of mine and were strongly recommended to me by mutual friends at liverpoolbut also i am glad to court intellectual society wherever it can be found in this city to distract my mind from the one topic which so constantly and so painfully engrosses it are mr de medina and his daughter such very agreeable companions inquired lascelles apparently in quite a casual manner mr de medina is a wellinformed intelligent and even erudite man answered the earl his daughter is highly accomplished sensible and amiable i feel an additional interest in them because they belong to a race whom it is the fashion to revile and often to despise it is true that my acquaintance with mr de medina and his daughter scarcely dates from a month back but i have already seenand if not i have heard enough of them to know that he is the pattern of integrity and the young lady the personification of every virtue illustration the doctor made no reply certain was he that he could a tale unfold which would totally undeceive his noble friend relative to the character of esther but his lips were sealed by a solemn vow and even if they were not there was no necessity to detail how he had been summoned to attend on the young lady and rescue her from the fate and crime of suicidehow he had good cause to know that she was either a wife or a mistress but he suspected the latterhow he had seen that splendid form stretched halfnaked upon the bed the bosom heaving convulsively with physical and mental agony and the exquisitely modelled arms flung wildly about with excruciating painhow the large black eyes had been fixed imploringly upon him and the vermillion lips had parted to give utterance to words demanding from himself the fiat of her life or deaththere was no necessity we say to narrate all this even if no vow had bound him to silence because lord ellingham sought not that lovely jewess as a wife that esther de medina and the lady of south moulton street were one and the same person the doctor felt convinced the tones of esthers voice flowing upon the ear with such silver melodythe two rows of brilliant beautiful teeththe facethe hairthe eyesthe configuration of the form with its fine but justly proportioned bust and slender waistall were identical but what chiefly amazednay bewildered the physician was the calm indifference with which esther had met his rapid searching glancethe admirable composure with which she had encountered himthe firmness amounting almost to an insolent assurance with which she had spoken to himnever once quailing nor blushing nor manifesting the slightest embarrassment but actually treating him as a person whom she saw for the first time and as if he were totally unacquainted with any thing that militated against her characterall this was naturally a subject of ineffable astonishment and wonder lord ellingham accompanied the doctor to grafton street and when they had entered the house dr lascelles made him acquainted with lady hatfields indisposition she is ill ejaculated arthur profoundly touched by these tidings and i dare not call even to inquire concerning her and wherefore should you not manifest that courtesy asked the doctor i must forget heri cannot demonstrate any farther interest in her behalf exclaimed the nobleman if there really exist reasons which render it impossible or imprudent for her to change her condition by marriage it is useless for us to meet againand if she be swayed by caprice i cannot suffer myself to be made the sport of her whims there are the wanton wilful whims of a coquette said the doctor impressively and there are the delusions of the monomaniacbut the latter are not the less conscientiously believed although they be nothing save delusions is it possible cried arthur a sudden ray of hope breaking in upon him can georgiana be subject to phantasies of that nature oh then she can be cured doctorand your skill may yet make us happy rest assured my dear earl was the reply that all the knowledge which i possess shall be devoted to that purpose my eternal gratitude will be due to you doctor said the nobleman with your permission i shall return in the evening to learn from you how your charming patient progresses the physician signified his assent and lord ellingham took his departure new hopes animating his soul chapter xv the opiate it was about seven oclock in the evening when dr lascelles returned to lady hatfields house on piccadilly hill miss mordaunt whom he encountered in the drawingroom informed him that georgiana had become more composed and tranquil since she had taken the medicine which he had prescribed for her and that she had requested to be left alone as she experienced an inclination to sleep it is nevertheless necessary that i should see her said the physician julia accordingly hastened to her friends apartment and speedily returned with the information that lady hatfield was not yet asleep and that the doctor might walk up lascelles immediately availed himself of this permission but he foundas indeed he had fully anticipatedthat his patient was rapidly yielding to the invincible drowsiness produced by the opiatic medicine which he had prescribed for her he seated himself by the bedside asked her a few ordinary questions and then suffered her to fall undisturbed into slumber at length she slept profoundly a smile of satisfaction played for a moment upon the lips of the physician but it yielded to a sombre cloud which almost immediately succeeded itfor a powerful struggle now suddenly arose in the breast of dr lascelles in his ardent devotion to the science which he professed he longed to satisfy himself on certain points at present admitting of doubt and involved in uncertainty and on the other hand he hesitated at the accomplishment of a deed which he could not help regarding as a gross abuse of his privileges as a medical man by virtue of the most sacred confidence he was admitted to the bedchamber of his female patient and he shrank from exercising that right in an illegitimate way then again he reasoned to himself that if he were enabled to ascertain beyond all doubt that no physical cause induced lady hatfield to shrink from marriage he must fall back upon the theory that she had become subject to certain monomaniac notions which influenced her mind to her own unhappiness and he at length persuaded himself that he should be acting for her best interests were he to put into execution the project which he had already formed such an opinion operating upon a man who possessed but few of the delicate and refined feelings of our nature and who was ever ready to sacrifice all considerations to the cause of the medical science speedily banished hesitation having convinced himself that georgiana slept so profoundly that there was no chance of awaking her he locked the door and again approached the bed and now his sacrilegious hands drew aside the snowwhite dress which covered the sleeping ladys bosom and the treasures of that gentlyheaving breast were exposed to his view but not a sensual thought was thereby excited in his mind cold and passionless he surveyed the beauteous spectacle only as a sculptor might measure the proportions of a marble venus or diana the huntress and not a trace of cancer was there no unseemly mark nor mole nor scar nor wound disfigured the glowing orbs that rising from a broad and ample chest swelled laterally over the upper part of the arms yet wherefore did dr lascelles abruptly start and why did his countenance suddenly assume an expression of surpriseor rather of mingled doubt and astonishmentas his glances wandered over the fair bust thus exposed to his view carefully and cautiously refastening the strings of the nightdress he now assumed the air of a man who had discovered some clue to a mystery hitherto profoundly veiled and unhesitatingly did he resolve to clear up all his doubts and all his newlyawakened suspicions five minutes afterwards dr lascelles left the room lady hatfield still remaining buried in a deep slumber his countenance expressed surprise mingled with sorrow and coldphlegmatic though his disposition was he could not help murmuring to himself is it possible having just looked into the drawingroom to take leave of miss mordaunt and state that his patient was progressing as favourably as could be expected dr lascelles returned home lord ellingham was waiting for him and this interview the physician now dreaded are your tidings favourable doctor was the noblemans hasty and anxious inquiry i regret my dear earl answered lascelles that i should have encouraged hopes which are doomed to experience disappointment added arthur bitterly oh i might have anticipated thisunfortunate being that i am but how have you ascertained that your ideas of this morning are unfounded how have you convinced yourself that georgiana is not a prey to those mental eccentricities which your skill might reach has she revealed to you her motive for refusingfor rejecting meme whom she professes to love she has revealed nothing my lord replied the doctor solemnly but i have satisfied myself that monomania and lady hatfield are total strangers to each other then must i abandon all hope exclaimed the earl for it is evident that i am the victim of a ridiculous caprice and yet he added a sudden thought striking him i will see her once again she is illshe is sufferingperhaps she will be pleased to behold meand who knows not this evening my lordnot this evening cried the doctor stopping the nobleman who had seized his hat and was darting towards the door lady hatfield sleepsand she must not be disturbed but lord ellingham was too full of his new idea to pay any attention to the physician and he rushed from the house chapter xvi the lover and the uncle a few minutes brought arthur to the residence of lady hatfield and his hand was already upon the knocker when a sudden idea struck himand he asked himself how can i demand admission to the bedchamber of georgiana the madness of his project now being evident to him he mournfully turned away when the door suddenly opened and a tall stout finelooking man dressed as a country squire issued from the house lord ellingham immediately recognised sir ralph walsingham georgianas uncle with whom he was well acquainted the baronet also perceived the earl and they shook each other cordially by the hand were you about to call inquired sir ralph i was answered lord ellingham hearing of lady hatfields illness she is bettermuch better interrupted the baronet i have just left her and she has not long awoke from a profound and refreshing slumber i am delighted to hear these tidings said the nobleman the servant seeing that sir ralph had stopped to converse with the earl still kept the door open and as arthur had admitted that he was about to call there was now no alternative save for him to leave his card the baronet then took his arm and they walked away together georgiana is a singular being observed sir ralph and although she is my niece yet there are times when i hardly know what to make of her she is too intellectualtoo steadyto be capricious and still my dear sir ralph interrupted the earl you have touched upon the very topic concerning which i longed to speak the moment i met you will you accompany me to my abode and favour me for a short period with your attention to what i am so anxious to confide to you with pleasure was the reply but i have already learnt from georgianas lips the principal fact to which your lordship doubtless alludes and it was indeed for the purpose of introducing the subject that i ere now made the remark relative to the occasional incomprehensibility of her character let us not however continue the discourse in the public street the nobleman and the baronet speedily reached the mansion of the former in pallmall west and when they were seated in an elegantly furnished apartment with a bottle of claret before them they renewed the conversation georgiana said the baronet has informed me that your lordship has honoured her by the offer of your hand and i need hardly assure you how rejoiced i should feel to welcome as a relative one whom i already esteem as a friend butto my inexpressible surprisei find thatthat that she has refused me exclaimed the earlrefused me without assigning any reason i cannot think how it is to be accounted for continued the baronet but georgiana has invariably manifested a repugnance to the topic of marriage whenever i have urged it upon her of course as her uncleand double her age my lordi can give her advice just as if i were her father and for some years past i have recommended her to consider well the propriety of obtaining a legal protector her natural ones being no more but all my reasoning has proved unavailing and if your lordship cannot persuade my obstinate niece he added with a sly laugh then no one must hope to do so i will frankly admit to you said the earl that my happiness depends on your nieces decision i am no hero of romancebut i entertain so sincere so ardent an affection for lady hatfield that my life will be embittered by a perseverance in her refusal to allow me to call her mine she will not persist in this follyshe cannot exclaimed sir ralph emphatically it is a mere whima caprice and indeed i have often thought that her disposition has somewhat altered ever since a dreadful fright which she sustained six or seven years ago ah said the earl what was the nature of the incident to which you allude i must tell your lordship returned the baronetunless indeed you are already acquainted with the factthat hampshire was for three or four yearsbetween and or the scene of the exploits of a celebrated highwayman you allude to the black mask no doubt interrupted lord ellingham interrogatively precisely so answered the baronet the black maskas the villain was calledwas one of the most desperate robbers that ever infested the highways he would stop the stagecoach as readily as he would a single traveller on horseback and such was his valour as well as his extraordinary skill that he defied all attempts to capture him i remember reading his exploits at the time said the earl the most conflicting accounts were reported concerning him some declared he was an old manothers that he was quite young but i believe that all agreed in ascribing to him a more forbearing disposition than usually characterises persons of his class i will even go so far as to assert that there was something chivalrous in his character exclaimed the baronet he invariably assured travellers whom he stopped that he should be grieved to harm them but that if they provoked him by resistance he would not hesitate to punish them severely if he fell in with a carriage containing ladies he never attempted to rifle them of their jewellery and trinkets but contented himself with simply demanding their purses those being surrendered he would gallop away i never heard of any unnecessary violencenor of any act of cruelty which he perpetrated neither did i ever meet a soul who could give anything like a credible description of his countenance the invariable black mask which concealed his features and from the use of which he derived his name seemed a portion of himself and although gossips did now and then tell strange tales about his appearance they were all too contradictory to allow a scintillation of the real truth to transpire but in what manner was the black mask connected with the fright which lady hatfield experienced some years ago asked the earl impatiently you are perhaps aware that the late earl and countess of mauleverer possessed a countryseat between winchester and new alresfordnot very far distant from walsingham manor my own rural abode said sir ralph it must have been seven years ago that georgiana who always preferred mauleverer lodge to the townmansioneven during the london seasonwas staying alone therei mean so far alone that at the time there were no other persons at the lodge save the servants well one night the black mask broke into the placethe only time he was ever known to commit a burglaryand such was the fright which georgiana experienced that for weeks and months afterwards her family frequently trembled lest her reason had received a shock it must indeed have been an alarming situation for a young ladyalone as it were in a spacious and secluded country dwelling and georgiana was but eighteen i think at the time interrupted sir ralph walsingham she certainly experienced a dreadful fright and although thank god her reason is as unimpaired as ever it was still we cannot say that the sudden shock might not have produced some strange effect which may probably account for the otherwise inexplicable whimsicalityfor i can denominate it nothing else oh i thank you my dear sir ralph for this explanation cried lord ellingham in the joy of reviving hope yesi see it all your niece experienced a shock which has produced a species of idiosyncratic effect upon her but the constant kindnessthe unwearied attention of one who loves her and whom she loves in return will restore her mind to its vigorous and healthy condition tomorrow will i visit her againoh how unkindhow ungenerous of me to remain away so long there was a pause during which arthur gave way to all the bright allurements of the pleasing vision which he now conjured up to his imagination at length sir ralph walsingham felt the silence to be irksome and awkward and he ventured to break it we were talking just now my lord he said of the famous highwayman known as the black mask he disappeared from hampshire very suddenly and the old women declared that his time being out he was carried off by the devil who had protected him against all the devices and snares imagined by the authorities to capture him and perhaps the highwayman who robbed lady hatfield the other day observed lord ellingham may be the very one who rendered himself so notorious in hampshire a few years ago your lordship judges by the fact that the scoundrel who stopped my niece near hounslow wore a black mask said the baronet but the generality of robbers on the high roads adopt that mode of disguise thank heaven public depredators of the kind are becoming very scarce in this country in such conversation did the nobleman and the baronet while away the time until eleven oclock when the latter took his leave and arthur retired to his chamber to dream of the charming but incomprehensible lady who had obtained such empire over his soul chapter xvii the mysterious letterjacob on the same evening that the interview between the earl of ellingham and sir ralph walsingham took place as narrated in the preceding chapter the following scene occurred at the house of toby bunce in earl street seven dials mrs bunce was alone in the dirty dingy back room which could not be said to be lighted but merely redeemed from total darkness by the solitary candle that stood on the table and she was busily employed in lighting the fire having succeeded in this object she placed the kettle on the grate to boil and then took from a cupboard a bottle half full of gin two common blue mugs a broken basin containing a little lump sugar and a couple of pewter spoons all of which articles she ranged around the brass candlestick with a view to make as good a show as possible then she seated herself by the fire and consulted an old silverwatch which she drew from her pocket and which was in reality the property of her husband whom she would not however trust with it under any consideration eight oclock she said aloud in a musing tone he cant be very long now and toby wont be in till ten if he is ill send him out againwith a flea in his ear she added chuckling at the idea of her supremacy in her own domestic sphere i wonder whod be ruled by a feller like toby not me indeed i should think not but i wish old bones would come she continued with a glance of satisfaction at the table every thing does look so comfortable and ive put em in such a manner that the light falls on em all at once toby never would have thought of that its only us women that know what tidiness is tidiness indeed the windows were dingy with dirtthe walls were begrimed with smoke and dustthe floor was as black as the deck of a collierand the cobwebs hung like filthy rags in the corners of the room scarcely had mrs bunce completed her survey of the place and its arrangements when a low knock summoned her to the streetdoor and in a few moments she returned accompanied by old death the hideous man was very cold and seating himself as near the fire as possible without actually burning his knees he said now betsy my dear brew me a mug of something cheering as soon as possible that i will ben returned mrs bunce in as pleasant a tone of voice as she could assume then she bustled about with great alacrity until the steaming liquid was duly compounded and old death had expressed his satisfaction by means of a short grunt after the first sip is it nice ben asked mrs bunce endearingly very now make yourself some betsy and sit down quietly for we must have a talk about you know what business has prevented me from attending to it before but now that i have got an evening to spareand toby is out of the way oh you know very well ben interrupted mrs bunce that i can always manage him as i like hes such a fool and so completely under my thumb that i shouldnt even mind telling him id been your mistress for years before i was his wife keep your tongue quiet betsykeep your tongue quiet exclaimed old death with a hyenalike growl never provoke irritation unnecessarily but lets to business jacob is out on the watch after tom rain and i told the lad to come up here before ten and now about this letter he continued drawing one from his pocketbook it proves you see that the child is wellbornand if the address had only been written on the outside we might make a good thing of the matter just so observed mrs bunce when mr rainford called this afternoon he was so particular in asking me whether i had found any papers about the womans clothes but i declared i had notand he was quite satisfied he paid me too very handsome for the funeral expenses and all my trouble if he was to know about that letter ben how can he know exclaimed old death impatiently now what i think he continued in a milder tone is just thisthe woman watts was reduced to such a desperate state of poverty that she wrote this letter to the mother of the boy charles why of course interrupted mrs bunce she says as much in the letter will you listen to me growled old death angrily you dont know what i was going to observe dont be cross ben i wont stop you again said the woman in a coaxing tone mind you dont then ejaculated bones allowing himself to be pacified well this sarah watts wrote that letter as i was saying with the intention of sending it no doubt either by post or by an acquaintance to the lady in london i think that is plain enough then when she had finished writing it something evidently made her change her mind and resolve on coming up to london herself this is also plain because if it wasnt so why did the letter never goand why did she come to london how well you do talk ben said mrs bunce i talk to the point i hope observed old death now how stands the matter here is a very important letter wanting two main things to render it completely valuable to us the first thing it wants is the name of the place from which it would have been dated had it ever been sent and the second thing it wants is the name of the lady to whom it was intended to be sent in a word it wants the address of the writer and the address of the lady to whom it was written and who is the mother of that boy charles what good would it do you to have the address of the writer since she is dead and buried asked mrs bunce because i could then visit the place where the woman was when she wrote this letter replied old death i could make inquiries concerning the late sarah watts and i know too well how to put two and two together not to arrive at some certainty in the long run to be sure ejaculated mrs bunce how clever you are dear ben i dont know about being clever betsy my dear returned the hideous old man but this i do thinkthat im rather wide awake and then he chuckled so heartily while his toothless jaws wagged up and down so horribly that he appeared to be a corpse under a process of galvanism for if a dead body could be made to utter sounds they would not be more sepulchral than those which now emanated from the throat of old death mrs bunce considered it to be her duty to chuckle also and her querulous tones seemed a humble accompaniment to the guttural sounds which we have attempted to describe at length the chuckling ceased on both sides and mrs bunce replenished the mugs with hot ginandwater but even as it is suddenly observed old death after a hasty glance at the letter which he now slowly folded up and returned to his greasy pocketbookbut even as it is we may still make something of the business if we could only find a clue to the mother of that boy it would be a fortune in itself i tell you what we must do he exclaimed emphatically what asked his ancient mistress get that boy into our own keeping replied bones with a sly smile and then we can pump him of all he may happen to know concerning the deceased sarah watts excellent cried mrs bunce clapping her hands but how will you find out where mr rainford lives jacob is after him for several reasons i want to know as much as i can about that strange fellow the very day that i made the bargain with him about smashing all the flimsies he might bring me he wrote an extraordinary note to the very lady whom he had robbed the night before and he made her go into the witnessbox at bow street and deliberately perjure herself to serve him then he starts off to pall mall when the jewess prisoner was brought up and delivers a note at the house of lord ellingham and lord ellingham comes straight down to the policecourt and swears black and blue that the jewess is innocent and was she asked mrs bunce thats more than i can say answered old death seeing that i know nothing at all about the affair well these two strange things showing an extraordinary influence on the part of rainford over lady hatfield on the one side and lord ellingham on the other have quite puzzled me he is an enigma that i must solve does not tullock know all about him demanded mrs bunce tullock knows only that tom took to the road some years ago down in the country for tullock then did at winchester just what i do now in london only added bones with a knowing glance and a compressed smile of the lips which puckered up his hideous face into one unvaried mass of wrinklesonly my dear betsy tullock never had the connexion which i have he had no correspondent at hamburg to whom he could send over the notes that are stolen and stopped at the bank he had no wellcontrived places to receive goodsplaces continued old death emphatically which have baffled the police for thirty years and will baffle them as long againif i live and why should you not dear said mrs bunce coaxingly because i cannot expect it replied old death abruptly howeveryou know what i have done for myself and in what way i manage my business you only betsy dear are acquainted with my secrets and you are as safe with me as if i was deaf and dumb and unable to write rejoined the woman i know thati know that said bones hastily then in a slower tone he added significantly because if there was a smash we should all go together betsy lor bendont talk in that waydont cried mrs bunce lets seewhat were we saying oh you was telling me about mr rainford i was only observing that tullock lost sight of him for some years and knows nothing that happened to him till he turned up in london the other day i dont suppose rainford is his proper name observed the woman inquiringly tullock never told me answered bones and as he and tom are thick together i cant ask him too many questions the fact is rainford will prove the most useful man i ever had in my service as i may call it and i must not risk offending him see how neatly he did that job the other nighthow beautifully he came off with the two thousand and it never got into the papers either observed mrs bunce not a bit of it cried old death with another chuckle tom calculated all that beforehandor he never would have been fool enough to go so quietly and introduce himself as captain sparks to the very people he meant to rob ha ha clearheaded fellow that tom he first ascertained the precise character of all the parties concerned and he knew that he might plunder them with impunity sir christopher and mr torrens were sure not to talk about it for fear of the whole disgraceful story about the purchase of the daughter coming out frank curtis is a cowardly boaster who would not like it to be known that a single highwayman had mastered himthe lawyer was sure to speak or hold his tongue just as his rich client sir christopher ordered himand jeffreys was safe tom weighed all this and boldly introduced himself to them without the least attempt at disguising his person oh it was capitally managedand tom is a valuable fellow mr bones seldom spoke so long at a time but he was carried away by his enthusiastic admiration of tom rainford and he accordingly talked himself so effectually out of breath that a fit of coughing supervened and he was nearly choked betsy however slapped him on the back and the old man gradually recovered himselfbut not before his fiercelooking eyes were dimmed with the scalding rheum which overflowed them you are afraid to offend mr rainford said mrs bunce after a pause and yet you think of taking away that boy from him pshaw cried old death whom the coughingfit had put into a bad humour do you think i should steal the child and then tell him of it of course not said mrs bunce i am a fool you are indeed betsy rejoined old death and yet you are the least foolish woman i ever knew or else i never should have made you my confidant as i have done and now i tell you betsy that i have many great schemes in my head and i shall require your assistance in the first place we must get hold of that boy charley somehow or anotherprovided we can find out rainfords abode which i think is scarcely doubtful then we must act upon all the information we can glean from the child and find out who his mother really is in the next place i must ascertain all i can concerning this jewessthis esther de medina if she did steal the diamonds she is the cleverest female thief in all englandfor she has managed to get clean off with her prize and such a woman would be invaluable to me besides if she pursues the same gamesupposing that she has really begun itshe will want my assistance to dispose of the property and she will gladly listen to my overtures such a beautiful creature as i understand she is could insinuate herself anywhere and rob the best houses in london ah betsy i must not sleep over these matters but hark thats jacobs knock poor jacob cried mrs bunce with a subdued sigh if he only knew silence woman cried bones in a furious manner go to the door mrs bunce was frightened by the vehemence of old deaths manner and hastened to obey his command in a few moments she returned followed by jacob who seemed sinking with fatigue well said old death impatiently what news give me something to eat firstfor i am famished cried jacob throwing himself upon a chair not a morsel till you tell me what you have done exclaimed bones angrily as he rose from his seat i will not speak a word on that subject before i have had food said jacob his bright eyes flashing fire and a hectic glow appearing on his pale cheeks you make me wander about all day on your business without a penny in my pocket to buy a piece of bread because he who has to earn his supper works all the better for it ejaculated bones his lips quivering with rage now speak jacobor by god you shant bully me in this way cried the lad bursting into tears and yet with all the evidences of intense passion working upon his countenance by what right do you treat me like a dog you fling me a bone when you chooseand you think i will lick your hand like a spaniel i tell you once for all i wont put up with it any longer you wont jacobyou wont eh said old death in a very low tone but at the same time he dealt the lad such a sudden and severe box on the ears that the poor youth was hurled heavily from his chair on the hard floor but springing up in a moment he flew like a tiger at old death whose small amount of strength was exhausted by the effort which it had required on the part of so aged a man to deal such a blow and jacob would have mastered him in another instant had not mrs bunce interfered with a loud scream she precipitated herself on the lad and seizing him in her bony arms forced him back into his seat sayingthere jacobfor gods sake be quiet and ill give you something nice directly the lad made no reply but darted a look of vindictive hate towards old death who had sunk back exhausted on the chair which he had ere now quitted then mrs bunce hastened to the cupboard and produced a loaf and the remains of a cold joint which she placed before jacob who enraged as he was at the treatment he had just received could not help wondering within himself how tobys wife had become so liberal as to place the viands without reserve at his disposal the woman seemed to penetrate his thoughts for she said eat as much as you like jacob dont be afraid i shant mind if you eat itnearly all the lad smothered his resentment so far as not to permit it to interfere with his appetite and he devoured his supper without once glancing towards old death who on his side appeared unable to recover from the surprise into which jacobs unusually rebellious conduct had thrown him a profound silence reigned in that room for several minutes at length jacob made an end of his meal and then old death spoke and so this is the reward he said which i receive for all my kindness towards you without me what would have become of you deserted by your parentsa foundlinga miserable infant abandoned to the tender mercies of the workhouse authorities would that i had died then interrupted jacob emphatically you make a boast of having taken care of meof having reared mesuch a rearing as it has beenand yet i wish you had left me to perish on the workhouse steps where you say you found me i have tried to be obedient to youi have done all i could to please you but do you ever utter a kind word to me even when i succeed in doing your bidding what reward is mine blowsreproachessorry meals few and far between well well jacobi think i have not quite done my duty towards you said old death who in reality could have murdered the boy at that moment but who was compelled to adopt a conciliatory tone and manner in order to retain so useful an auxiliary in his service but let us say no more about itand things shall be better in future instead of having no regular place of abode and sleeping in lodginghouses you shall have halfacrown a week jacob to hire a little room for yourself therejacob only think of that cried mrs bunce in a tone expressive of high approval of this munificence on the part of old death and you shall have threepence every day for your dinner jacob continued bones in addition to your breakfast and tea which you always get here but will you keep to that arrangement asked the lad considerably softened by this prospect which was far brighter than any he had as yet beheld i willi will replied old death and if you have brought me any good news tonight ill give you ten shillingsten whole shillings jacobto buy some nice clothes and shoes in monmouth street put down the money cried jacob now completely won back to the interests of the crafty old villain who knew so well how to curb the evanescent spirit of his miserable slave i will said bones and he laid four halfcrowns upon the table thats right exclaimed jacob his eyes glistening with delight at the prospect of fingering such a treasure then he glanced rapidly at his ragged apparel with a smile on his lip that expressed his conviction of shortly being able to procure a more comfortable attire go on said old death what have you done when mr rainford went away from here this afternoon returned jacob i followed him at a good distancebut not so far off that i stood a chance of losing sight of him well first he went to tullocks and there he stayed some little time then he walked into an eatinghouse in the strand and at that place he stopped about a couple of hourswhile i walked up and down on the other side of the way at length he came out with another gentleman what was he like demanded old death a finetallhandsome manwith dark hair and eyes responded jacob i dont know him said bones never mindgo on with your story and let it be as short as possible well continued the lad this gentleman and mr rainford walked together as far as bridge street blackfriars and there they parted the gentleman went into a house in bridge streetand mr rainford crossed the bridge it was now getting dusk and i was obliged to keep closer to him but he seldom turned roundand when he did i took good care he should not see me so on he went till he came to the elephant and castle and close by there he suddenly met a lady with a dark veil over her face and holding a little boy by the hand they stood and talked for a moment just opposite a shopwindow which was lighted up and i saw well enough that the little boy was the very same that was brought here the other night by the woman who was buried so quietly this morning then we know that the boy is still in his care ejaculated old death exchanging significant glances with mrs bunce go on jacob i can see that the ten shillings will be yours yesthat they will cried the lad apparently having forgotten the blow which he had recently received well so i knew the boy at once though he is much changednicely dressed and already quite plump and rosy mr rainford patted him on the face and the boy laughed and seemed so happy then mr rainford gave the lady his arm and they walked a little way down the road till they came to a jewellers shop where they stopped to look in at the window mr rainford pointed out some article to the lady and they went into the shop the lady still holding the little boy carefully by the hand the moment they were safe inside i watched them through the window and i saw mr rainford looking at a pair of earrings in a few moments he handed them to the lady she lifted up her veil to examine them and i knew her again in a moment but who do you think she was old death shook his head noi dont think you ever could guess cried jacob then who is she demanded bones impatiently the jewess who was accused of stealing the diamonds at bow street the other day answered jacob esther de medina cried old death the very person we were speaking about just now he added exchanging another glance with mrs bunce but go on jacobgo on i was rather surprised at that discovery continued jacob because i thought it so odd that both mr rainford and the jewess should have been had up on the very same day at bow street on different charges and that both should have got off it is strangevery strange murmured old death but did you find out tom rains address that is the chief thing i want to know dont be in a hurry said jacob let me tell my story in my own way well so the jewess seemed to like the earrings and she gave mr rainford such a sweet smileoh what a sweet smileas he pulled out his purse and paid for them i dont know how it wasbut it really went to my heart to think that such a beautiful lady should never mind what you felt jacob interrupted old death abruptly make an end of your story well the earrings were put into a nice little box with some wool to keep them from rubbing and the lady drew down her veil again before she left the shop now jacobtell me the truth said old death did either tom rain or the jewess take any little thingat a moment you know when the jewellers back was turned nonot a thing cried the lad emphatically i can swear they did not you are quite sure observed old death as sure as that im here for i never took my eyes off them from the moment they entered the shop till they came out responded jacob and when they did come out i was very near being seen by mr rainfordfor i was then in front of them and i had only just time to slip into the shade of the wall between the windows of the jewellers shop and the next one then i heard mr rainford say to the jewess now this little present is in part a recompense for the diamonds which i made you give upthe lady said something in a low tone but i could not catch itand they went on the little boy with them then she did steal the diamonds exclaimed old death but how could such a man as lord ellingham feel any interest in her and how could he have been induced to perjure himself to save her isnt it strange said mrs bunce im all in the dark at present returned bones but go on jacob they walked on till they came to a street on the lefthand side and into that street they turned i never lost sight of them once but two or three times i thought mr rainford would have twigged me he did not though and i at last traced them to a house in locks fields locks fieldseh cried old death can they possibly be living there they are returned jacob and i can take you over to the very street and the very house any time you like well done ejaculated bones indulging in another long and hearty chuckle which was echoed by mrs bunce and then they both rubbed their hands gleefully to think that they had made such important discoveries through the medium of jacob fresh supplies of grog were brewed and the lad was not only permitted to consign the four halfcrowns to his pocket but was also regaled with an occasional sip of ginandwater from mrs bunces own mug the return of toby at ten oclock prevented any further conversation on the interesting topics which had previously been discussed for mrs bunces husband was not admitted to the entire confidence of his spouse and of mr benjamin bones alias old death chapter xviii the lovers it was noon and lady hatfield sate alone in her drawingroom she felt herself so much better and dr lascelles had that morning so earnestly recommended her to quit the bedchamber and seek the change of scene which even a removal from one apartment to another ever affordsespecially to an invalid that she had not hesitated to follow her own inclination and his advice both of which were fully of accord her uncle sir ralph walsingham was announced shortly after lady hatfield had descended to the drawingroom my dear georgiana exclaimed the honest and kindhearted man as he entered the apartment i am delighted to find you here but why are you alone where is miss mordaunt in the parlour below replied lady hatfield julia has a visitor she added with an arch smile in spite of the melancholy which still oppressed her mind a visitor ejaculated the baronet sir christopher blunt ill be bound you have guessed rightly my dear uncle but how how should i know anything about it interrupted sir ralph surely georgiana you must be too well acquainted with your friends disposition to suppose that she could have possibly held her tongue relative to the presumed attachment of the worthy knight why all the time she was at the manor did she not absolutely hurl sir christophers name at every soul whom she could engage in conversation was it not sir christopher had told her this last season and sir christopher had assured her that and did she not go much farther than merely to hint that sir christopher was dying for her for my part i was sick of sir christophers name but now i suppose he has come to lay his title and fortune at her feet as the newspapers say or else what could possibly signify a visit at so unseemly an hour as midday illustration it will be an excellent match for julia remarked georgiana by way of saying something she is not one of those who believe that marriage should be only a convention of hearts and not of worldly interests and as lady hatfield made this observation a profound sigh escaped her bosom what means that sigh niece demanded the baronet are you envious of miss mordaunts worldlymindedness i am convinced you are not by the way i met lord ellingham last evening his lordship left his card said lady hatfield casting down her eyes while her bosom again rose and fell with a long and painfullydrawn sigh georgiana exclaimed sir ralph seating himself by the side of his niece and taking her hand in a kind manner your conduct towards that young earl is not justis not generousis not rational oh my dear uncle cried lady hatfield starting wildly for heavens sake renew not the discussion of last evening pardon me my dear niece said sir ralph affectionately but firmly if i give you pain by referring to the topic of that discussion i am your nearest relationi am a widower and childless you know that my property is extensiveand my fond hope has ever been since the death of your aunt lady walsingham that you would marry and that your children should inherit those estates and that fortune which i can bequeath to whomsoever i will but you refuse to accept the hand of a man who is every way worthy of youyou reject an alliance which in every human probability would be blessed by a progeny to whom my wealth and yours may alike descend nayinterrupt me not dear georgiana i am old enough to be your fatheri love you as if you were my daughterand i have your welfare deeply at heart to speak frankly i had a long conversation last evening with lord ellingham georgianas attention was for an instant broken by a wild start of despair my god what signifies this grief georgiana asked her uncle i thought to give you pleasure by the assurance i was about to disclosean assurance which conveys to you the unalterable fidelity of the earls affectionhis readiness to bury in oblivion any little whim or caprice which induced you to subject him to the humiliation of a refusal the other dayhis determination to study your happiness so entirely that any cloud of melancholy or unknown and unfounded presentimentany morbid feeling in a wordwhich hangs upon your mind shall speedily be dissipated such are his generous intentionssuch are his tender aspirations georgianacan you reject his suit again this appeal made to the unhappy lady by an individual who though only related to her by the fact of having married her mothers sister had still ever manifested towards her the sincerest affection and friendshipthis appeal we say came with such overwhelming force upon the mind of georgiana that she knew not how to answer it you consent georgianayou consent exclaimed sir ralph entirely mistaking the cause of her profound silence and starting up he rushed from the room before her lips could give utterance to a syllable that might have the effect of stopping him merciful god what does he mean to do cried georgiana clasping her hands together while a species of spasmodic shuddering came over her entire frame hasty footsteps approached the door wildly did the unhappy lady glance around herwith the terrified and imploring air of one whom the officers of justice were about to fetch to the scaffold the door flew open georgiana averted her eyesbut at the next moment her hands were grasped in those of another and warm lips were pressed upon each fair hand of hersand for a single instant there streamed through her whole being the electric warmth of ineffable delight hope and love she sank back upon the sofa whence she had risen her eyes which for a moment had seemed to lose the faculty of sight were involuntarily turned toward the earl of ellingham who was kneeling at her feetand simultaneously her uncles voice sounding like the knell of destiny upon her ears exclaimed i told you she had consented ellingham be happyfor georgiana is yours the door of the apartment was then closed hastily and lady hatfield now knew that she was alone with her lover oh my dearest georgiana murmured arthur still pressing the ladys hands in his own how happy have you at length made meand how can i ever express the joy which animates me at this moment my heart dances wildly with joy and gratitude and all the anguish which i have lately experienced is forgottenas if it never had been indeed my beloved one it is for me to implore your pardonfor i should not have remained absent from you so long but now that we are reunited and your indisposition has passednow that your mind has recovered its naturally healthy tonethere is nothing my georgiana to interrupt the free course of our felicity lady hatfield was seized with a certain involuntary horror which completely stupefied her as these impassioned exclamations fell upon her ears and vainlyvainly did she endeavour to reply arthur rose and seating himself by her side on the sofa passed his arm around her slender waist and drawing her gently towards him said in a subdued tone from this day forth beloved georgiana you must have no secrets unknown to me confide in me as your best and sincerest friendand the tenderest sympathy shall flow from my heart to solace you in those moments of melancholy which no mortal however prosperously placed can hope altogether to avoid in the society of a husband who will never cease to love youwhose constant care shall be to ensure your felicityand whose unwearied attention shall be devoted to the promotion of your happiness your life will be spent in an atmosphere into which a cloud shall seldom intrude oh what pictures of perfect bliss present themselves to my imagination the enamoured nobleman pressed the fair one closer to his breast as he thus poured forth his soul with all the ardour of his sincere and devoted love and shein spite of herselfbewildered stupefied intoxicated as she was by the suddenness with which this scene had been brought aboutshe gazed with mingled rapture and surprise upon that handsome countenance which the glow of inward passion and ineffable joy now rendered still more expressive she felt as if the hysterical shriek which for some moments past had threatened to burst from her lips were subduedstifled by some unknown power whose influence was strangely sweet and consolingher soul almost sickened in the bliss of that love by which she was surrounded and to which her womans heart could not do otherwise than respond then again she felt as if she must start from his armsreject his lovedash down that chalice of honied happiness from which they both were drinking deep draughtsand proclaim to him that it was all a hideous mistakethat she had never consented to receive him as her husbandthat her uncle had committed a fearful errorand that they must separate never never again to meet but at the very moment when she was about to do all this arthur drew her nearer to himhis breath sweet as that of flowers fell on her burning cheekhis hand pressed hersshe found herself linked to him in heart by a spell which no mortal courage could at such a moment have brokenthen she caught herself looking into his fine eyes and reading the thrilling language of love that was written thereand in another moment their lips met in one long and delicious kiss sweet georgiana i adore you murmured arthur his glances speaking more eloquently than his words and now there breathes not a happier man on the earths wide surface than i say georgianasay does not that happiness which i myself experience impart pleasure to you could you now do aught to torture my soul again with the agony of suspensewith the despair of baffled hope believe me my dearest angel that if destiny in its malignant spite were now to separate usif tomorrow i came and found you gone or here but cold and alteredin a word if any impediment were to arise to the accomplishment of our union i should not survive the blow as a distracted maniac should i be borne to a madcellor if my reason were left me my grave would be stained with a suicides blood georgiana was appalled by this terrible announcement and in the agony of feeling which it excited within her she cast a glance of profound tenderness upon the earl unwittingly pressing his hand at the same time oh now i know that you entertain the same sentiments as myself he cried mistaking those convulsive movements on her part for the tender evidences of love now i know that your heart beats in unison with mine oh thrice happy daythe happiest that i ever yet have known and happier does it seem too because it has dissipated so much previous anxietyhealed so much acutelyfelt pain yesdearest georgianai am almost glad that you rejected my suit the other day for the wretched feelings of the interval have by contrast made the present moment indescribably sweet and shall i tell you my beloved one that i am now acquainted with the nature of that secret that secret cried georgiana with a cold shudderwhich ellingham did not perceive for at the moment he pressed her fondly towards him yes dearest he continued i know all the power which that secret influence must occasionally have over you and believe me when i declare thatinstead of being any longer annoyed at the fact of that circumstance having induced you to refuse my hand the other dayi deeply sympathise with you and if i now allude to that eventthat incident which years ago at your late fathers countryresidence in hampshire a short convulsive sob burst from georgianas breast oh pardon mepardon me beloved one cried the earl again imprinting a kiss upon her lips i know that i was wrong to allude to an event which you can never entirely forget but if i mentioned it ere nowit was for the first and the last timeand merely to convince you that he whom you will soon receive as your husband is aware of that secret influence which holds a sway over your mind and that he implores you to forget itto abandon yourself only to the thoughts of that happiness which our love and our brilliant social position must ensure us and now my dearest georgiana no more on that head never again let the topic enter into our discoursenever let us allude to it even by a single syllable oh generousexcellentheartednobleminded man exclaimed georgiana and is your love for me indeed so strong as this can you doubt it dearest said the earl if sotell me how i can prove its sincerity have you not given me a proof the most convincing that man can give to woman asked lady hatfield concealing her blushing countenance on arthurs breast are you not content to receive as your wife one who no moreno more exclaimed the earl tenderly hushing her words with kisses have we not agreed never again to allude to that topic but one word arthur said georgiana only one word who could have acquainted you your uncle dearest answered lord ellinghamthat excellent man who has been mainly instrumental in procuring me the happiness which i now enjoy my uncle murmured lady hatfield her soul subdued with astonishment of the most overwhelming nature but the earls ears caught not the repetition of his answer neither did he notice the effect which it produced upon georgianafor her head was pillowed upon his breasthis hand clasped hersher fine form leant against himand he had no thought save of the pure but intoxicating happiness which he now enjoyed oh love thou art the sweetest charm of lifethe dearest solace in this sphere of trial and vicissitudethe sentiment that shining on us as a star adds the most refulgent brightness to our lot ambition never imparted consolation to the breaking spirit and places no curb on the wild passions and insatiable vices which too often dominate the human heart wealth makes its possessor envied

frank curtiss pleasant adventure about half an hour previous to the visit of lord ellingham mr frank curtis was lounging along piccadilly with a swellmob kind of ease and a bagnigge wells independence when a young female of good figure and pretty face attracted his notice as he was proceeding in one way and she in another they passed each other and mr curtis having nothing to do it struck him that he would endeavour to scrape an acquaintance with the young person alluded to he accordingly turned roundhesitated for a moment how to devise an excuse for addressing himself to herand then drawing forth his own white cambric pockethandkerchief hurried after the object of his interest i beg your pardon miss he said tapping her gently upon the shoulder but i think you dropped this handkerchief the young female immediately replied in the negative but a smile played upon her lips and her blue eyes assumed an arch expression implying that she fully saw through the young mans trick which was indeed transparent enough i really thought it was yours miss exclaimed curtis by no means abashed but if it isntwhy i must keep it till i find the ownerthats all i rather think it is with the owner now sir answered the young woman well my dear said frank i see you suspect my stratagem but you are such a sweet pretty creature that i was resolved to introduce myself to you now dont be angry my love i mean all i assertand if you will only tell me where and when i can see you again im sure you wont be sorry to make my acquaintance upon my word cried the young woman in that dubious manner which might have meant disgust or which might be taken as encouragement mr curtis strong in his selfconceit adopted the latter view and became more pressing in his attentions now do let me see you again theres a dear he exclaimed continuing to walk by her side if youll only agree to meet me this evening ill take you to the playand ill buy you a gold chain money is no object to me my love a man with ten thousand ayearand a peerage in the perspectivemay indulge his little fancies i hope these falsehoods conveyed by implication were uttered in such a tone of assurance that the young woman was evidently dazzled by their splendour and she threw a rapid but encouraging glance towards the mendacious frank come nowwill you meet me again he demanded i was going over to stay a few days with the prime minister of france early next month and i had promised to pass my christmas with his holiness the pope at romebut if you was only kind nowwhy theres no saying that i might not send excuses to both of them and stay in london for the pleasure of seeing you but you men are such gay deceivers said the young female wellwe may besometimes ejaculated frank rather looking upon the imputation as a compliment than a reproach but youre too pretty for a man to find it in his heart to deceive you my dear in one word where shall you be at seven oclock this evening i did think of calling upon a friend which is ladysmaid in a family living in conduit street replied the young woman and if your friend is a ladysmaid my dear said frank what may you be the same sir was the answer the very thing cried curtis if theres one class of young ladies that i like more than another it is the ladiesmaids why my dear when i left pariswhere i stayed some time with the archbishop of that cityfor his grace and i are as thick as two thievesthe ladiesmaids held a meeting and appointed a committee to draw up an address expressive of regret and all that sort of thing at my going away they did upon my honour but let us come to the point my dear shall you be in conduit street this evening at about seven i think its very likely sir was the answer but you must not go with me any farther nowfor i live at the house with the baywindows there but whose service are you in my dear asked frank in lady georgiana hatfields replied the young woman indeed cried curtis ive heard an uncle of mine speak of her ladyship i think but this is a great nuisance though what is asked charlotte whom our readers may remember to have been mentioned at the opening of this tale whythat you and me must separate just at the moment that we are getting so friendly togetherand without a single kiss either charlotte giggledbut said nothing you will really be in conduit street this evening my dear urged frank curtis after a brief pause i think i shall be able to get out responded charlotte but her ladyship is an invalid and miss mordaunther friend or companion or whatever she ismay want me to dress her for some ball or party and so i cannot promise for sure but you will try yes murmured the young woman and she hurried on to the frontdoor of lady hatfields house curtis stopped at a short distance and watched her as she tripped along her pretty feet and ankles peering from beneath the folds of her dress now it happened that at the very moment when charlotte was about to ring the bell the frontdoor opened and a liveryservant issued forth doubtless upon some errand after exchanging a word or two with charlotte he passed on and the young woman entered the house but ere she closed the door she turned a sly glance upon frank curtis who the instant he saw the liveryservant make his appearance sauntered very leisurely along in the most innocentlooking manner in the world the liveryservant was now out of sightand the pretty face of the ladysmaid lingered at the door which she kept ajar curtis looked hastily around and the coast being tolerably clear at the moment he darted up to the entrance charlotte had merely remained on the threshold to give him a parting glance of intelligence for the purpose of assuring him of the sincerity of her promise that she would endeavour to meet him in the eveningfor the young lady was of an intriguing disposition and flattered herself that she had captivated some very great or at all events some very wealthy personbut when she saw him thus precipitately rush towards the entrance she drew back and endeavoured to shut the door frank was however too quick for her and he fairly thrust himself into the hall closing the streetdoor behind him for gods sake go away sir said charlotte imploringly not till i have had one kissjust one cried frank and he threw his arms round the ladysmaids neck oh do let me go sirthe servants will comeand i shall be ruined she murmured vainly struggling with the young man who not only considered the adventure a capital joke but was also excited by his present contact with a pretty girl he glued his lips to hers and pressed her closely to him when a loud doubleknock suddenly echoed through the hall good heavens what shall i do exclaimed charlotte in a tone of despair then in another moment she recovered her presence of mind and throwing open a sidedoor said in a rapid and earnest tone go in there sirand if any one comes pray invent some excuse for your being herebut dont compromise me curtis darted into the parlour with which the sidedoor communicated the ladysmaid hurried away and old mason speedily made his appearance to answer the summons conveyed by the doubleknock is miss mordaunt at home inquired a voice which curtis who was listening anxiously on the inner side of the parlour door immediately recognised to be that of his worthy uncle yes sir christophermiss mordaunt is at home replied mason please to walk in sir this way sirmiss mordaunt is with lady hatfield in the drawingroom i wish to see miss mordaunt alone if you please said sir christopher give my compliments and if miss mordaunt will accord me a few minutesupon some little matter of a private nature certainly sir christopher responded the domestic have the goodness to step into this room sir and frank curtisnow as miserable as he was insolent and exulting a few moments previously when embracing charlotte in the hallheard the footsteps of mason and his uncle approaching the very door at which he was listening not a moment was to be lost he was too much confusedtoo much bewildered to think of meeting the embarrassment of his position with a good face and a bold excuse and concealment instantly suggested itself to his cowardmind a cheerful fire was burning in the grate and near it was drawn a sofa the cushion of which had rich fringes that hung all round and drooped nearly to the carpet to thrust himself beneath this friendly sofa was the work of an instant with frank curtis and so rapidly was the manuvre executed that the fringes had even ceased to rustle when sir christopher blunt stalked pompously into the apartment mason withdrew to deliver the knights message to miss mordaunt and in the meantime the knight himself paced the room in somewhat an agitated manner at length he walked straight up to a handsome mirror and looking fully at his image as it was reflected in the glass began to apostrophise himself sir christopher bluntsir christopher blunt he exclaimed aloud in a solemn tone what is it that you are about to do are you taking a wise or an imprudent step are you in a word about to ensure your own happiness ororto make a damned old fool of yourself frank curtis was astounded at this language which came from the lips of his uncle despite of his fears and the unpleasant predicament in which he found himself he was on the point of yielding to his natural propensity for mischief and blurting forth an affirmative response to the latter portion of the knights selfinterrogation when the door opened and a lady entered the room curtis accordingly held his peace and his breath too as much as he could for his curiosity was now so intense as to master even his fears miss mordaunt said the knight suddenly turning away from the glass and advancing as jauntily as his massive frame would permit to meet the lady i have to apologise for this early visit oh no apology sir christopher exclaimed julia in a most affable manner pray be seated allow me said the knight and taking her hand he led her to the very sofa beneath which his nephew lay concealed then seating himself at a respectful distance from herbut also on the sofa he continued thusi hope miss mordaunt that i shall not offend you with what i am goingthat is with what i am abouti mean with what i am on the point of very intelligible all this thought frank curtis to himself sir christopher blunt is incapable of offending a ladyespecially a young one observed miss julia blushing in the most approved style on such interesting occasionsfor she could anticipate what was coming sir christopher blunt thanks you for that compliment miss mordaunt said the knight pompously and encouraged also by the ladys tone and manner yesi am indeed incapable of giving offence wilfully although there are certain vulgar people east of temple bar who pretend that i treat them cavalierly and thank heaven miss mordaunt i was not elected alderman of portsoken for i never could have put up with all the filthy guzzling and swillingexcuse the expressions maamthat seem inseparable from city affairs you know perhaps miss mordaunt that my origin was humblei may say that it was nothing at all but i glory in that fact it is my boastmy pride true merit is sure to force its way in the world sir christopher observed julia with a smile which displaying her white teeth quite enchanted the amorous knight again i thank you for the good opinion of me implied by that remark he said edging himself a little closer to the lady my large fortunefor large it notoriously is miss mordaunthas all been acquired by my own honest industry and the title which i have the honour to bear was bestowed upon me by a gracious prince in approbation of my conduct as a public officer you occupy an enviable position in society sir christopher said julia do you really think so miss asked the knight endeavouring to assume a soft and plaintive tone but with as little success as if he were a boatswain labouring under a severe cold do you really think soand again he edged himself nearer to his companion ah my dear miss mordaunt how happy should i be to lay my fortunemy titlemy all at the feet of some charming lady who like yourself would not despise the man that has risen by his own honest exertions to i may say affluence and honour miss mordaunt cast down her eyes and worked herself up into a most interesting state of blushing excitement while sir christopher boldly took her hand and pressed it to his lips the knights foot was thrust some little way under the sofa and as he wore blucher boots it was not difficult to stick a pin into the calf of his leg if any one had felt so disposed such an idea certainly struck his dutiful nephew at that instant for mr frank curtis now fully comprehended the object of his uncles visit to miss julia mordaunt and the matrimonial designs of the said uncle foreboded any thing but essential benefit to himself thenalthough he was not the brightest young man in existencethe selfish motive of sir christopher in agreeing to purchase mr torrenss elder daughter as his franks wife flashed upon his mind and in an instant he comprehended the entire policy of sir christopher as well as the reader already understands it with regard to the recent matrimonial speculation which tom rainford had so materially aided to render abortive we digressed just at the point where sir christopher was venturesome enough to press the hand of miss mordaunt to his lips oh sir christopher murmured the lady apparently quite abashed and forgetting most probably in the agitation of the moment to withdraw her fair fingers julia my lovefor so you must now permit me to call you exclaimed the enamoured knight will my suit be rejected can you receive it favourably at this moment you see before you a man whom it is in your power to render happy or miserable for life and ah dear mewhat a dreadful dream i had last night it was that dream which made me come to you so early today to know your decision for whether it was your image my beloved juliaor the cold roast pig that i eat for supper im sure i cant say but true it is thatoh screamed the knight in a fit of agony my dear sir christopher whatwhat is the matter asked miss mordaunt alarmed by the sudden ejaculation which was accompanied by an equally sudden start oh nothingnothing said the knight endeavouring to compose himself a sudden twitch in the legjust like the pricking of a pinbut it is nothinga mere sensation i was going to tell you my dear julia about that horrid dream pray sir christopher dont tell me any thing about horrid dreams exclaimed miss mordaunt you will frighten me out of my wits well dearest i will not but you have not told me yet whether i may consider that this fair hand which i now press to my lipsoh and again the knight started violently what is the matter sir christopher asked julia earnestly reallyi cant make it outi dont knowbut this is the second time that the same sensation has seized me in the left leg stammered the knight just for all the world like the pricking of a pin and yet of course it cannot be that but pray pardon these unpleasant interruptions julia and relieve me from suspense at once saytell me dearest onewill you will you consent to be mine oh sir christopher what do you ask murmured miss mordaunt as if there were any thing extraordinary or unexpected in the question what do i ask repeated the enamoured knight i ask you to bestow upon me this fair hand how can i refuse you sir christopher sighed the lady you are so killing am i dearest ejaculated the knight and encouraged more than ever by this assurance he boldly kissed his companion but almost immediately a cry of agony burst from his lips and starting up from the sofa he exclaimed my leg my leg thethe devils in itand thats the fact the fact was however somewhat different for mr frank curtis having very quietly and deliberately taken his breastpin from the frill of his shirt was amusing himself with the very pleasant pastime of thrusting the point into his uncles leg on the third occasion of the application of the aforesaid breastpin sir christopher started up and danced about the room while miss mordaunt who was most anxious to bring the delicate topic of discourse to such a point that she might satisfy herself as to the very day on which she was to change her condition endeavoured to her utmost to console him convinced that the pain he experienced could be nothing more than some sudden but very galling spasmodic attack neither sir christopher nor julia entertained the least thought of looking beneath the sofa they therefore reseated themselves upon it and continued their tender discourse and when shall it be asked sir christopher taking it for granted that it was to be wheneverthat isso sooni meanwhen you choose murmured miss mordaunt but you will communicate your intentions to my brother who obtained his captaincy a few days ago and whom i must consult and why consult him asked sir christopher a misgiving entering his mind oh he mighti do not say that he willbut he might object answered miss mordaunt then perhaps you wish me to state my views to my nephew also said the knight somewhat testily as he might also object but a nephew sir christopher urged the ladya nephew is not a brother very true replied blunt as if some grand truth had just been made apparent to him and yet it appears julia he added in a coaxing tone that we have each a relation to whom we would rather not mention the matteruntil after it was over oh you killing manwhat would you have me understand by that remark cried miss mordaunt simply that we should should what dear sir christopher should be married privatelyor run away to gretna green answered the knight and now the truth is out oh naughtynaughty man exclaimed julia casting on her swain one of her most bewitching smiles but at the same time she imagined to herself all the excitement attending a runaway match to gretnathe rapidity of travellingthe bustle that would be excited at the wayside innsthe sensation that must arise in the fashionable worldthe paragraphs in the newspapersthe clat attached to such a proceedingand the importance with which her reappearance in town after the union would be attendedof all this she thoughtand the knights proposal was therefore most welcome to her for while she contemplated the agreeable side of the picture she never once reflected on the ridicule and absurdity that must attach themselves to such a step on the part of two persons of the respective ages of sir christopher blunt and herself well dearest what are you thinking of asked the knight of what you were saying dear sir christopher murmured the lady in a languishing tone then how shall it be a private marriageor gretna the arrangements for a private marriage might be suspected sighed julia casting down her eyes and managing a blush which was respectable enough seeing that it scarcely came voluntarily to her aid just my opinion ejaculated sir christopher i would not have that prying nephew of mine frank curtisthe young scapegracegetting a hint of it beforehand for any money nor would i wish my brother to know of it until it is all over dear sir christopher returned julia then be it gretna exclaimed the knight and now when shall it take place i could not say today sir christopherbut tomorrowtomorrow murmured the lady in a faint tone as if quite overpowered by the importance of the step she was about to take but which she would willingly have taken long before had the proposal been made to hertomorrow she added i shall be preparedto i understand you my angel interrupted the knight and this time he caught the lady fairly in his arms and subjected her to a process of hearty kissing mr frank curtis had in the meantime restored his breastpin to the frill of his shirt for since the conversation had turned upon a regular elopement the matter had become far too serious for him to trifle with he suddenly found himself menaced with something bordering on total disinheritance in respect to his uncles property for even if this projected union should yield no issue still the lady might obtain so much influence over the knight as to induce him to will all his fortune to herself frank was therefore in rather an unpleasant state of mind as well as being in an uneasy predicament under the sofa he nevertheless saw that cunning must be met with cunning and he now lay as quiet as a mouse in order to avoid detection but he vowed seriously that the moment he should escape from the kind of prison in which he found himself he would not let the grass grow under his feet ere he adopted measures to defeat the matrimonial scheme of sir christopher blunt and miss julia mordaunt at length to his unspeakable relief the knight took his leave of miss mordaunt after having settled the hour and place where they were to meet on the following evening sir christopher being gone julia also left the room and poor charlotte who had been on the tenterhooks of suspense and alarm ever since frank curtis had first entered the house now hurried to the parlour wondering how he could possibly have managed to avoid an exposure but when she entered the room and perceived no one she was more astonished still her surprise was not however of long duration for curtis having peeped through the fringe and ascertained who the newcomer was suddenly emerged from his hidingplace oh dear me sir exclaimed the young woman what a fright i have been in to be sure and what a pickle i have been in cried frank sulkily you cannot say that it was my fault sir observed charlotte reproachfully nor more i do my dear answered curtis warming himself into a better humour by means of a kiss or two on the ladysmaids red lips but i say my dear he continued after a few moments dalliance of that sort you must come to meet me this evening because independent of my desire to chat with you and all that sort of thing you can be of service to me lor sir cried charlotte astonished at this intimation indeed you can but i must not stay to explain myself now returned curtis here my deartake these five guineas as an earnest of what i will do for you and mind and be punctual in conduit street at seven oclock this evening i shall not fail sir replied charlotte and in the meantime added frank watch miss mordaunt well dont ask me any questions nowi will tell you all about it this evening but mind you watch her and if possible get into conversation with her should she ask you to do her any serviceno matter of what kindpromise her that you will and leave the rest to me do you hear yes sirand i will do as you tell me was the answer well thenthats right said curtis and now let me see if i cant slip out without running plump up against one of your liveried flunkeys here wait an instant cried charlotte and she disappeared from the room closing the door carefully behind her in a few moments she returned with the welcome tidings that the coast was clear and frank curtis succeeded in quitting lady hatfields house without being perceived by any one save the faithful charlotte chapter xx happinessthe diamondmerchant when lord ellingham took his leave of lady hatfield the latter hurried to her bedchamber and locking the door behind her sate down in an armchair near the fire to ponder unconstrainedly upon the conversation of the previous hour and that hourwhat changes had it worked in respect to the mind and prospects of this patrician lady oh how generous and noblehearted is my arthur she mused inwardly how boundless is his love for me but is it possible that i am really to become his wife or am i the sport of a wild and delusive dream noit is all true i am awakei see the various objects around methere is no confusion in my brain yesit is all true and he will marry mehe will make me his wifein spite ofbut let me avoid thinking of the past the future is now bright and glorious before me my own arthurwhom i love so fondly and who alone has ever possessed and will possess my heartmy own noble generous arthur has surmounted all prejudiceflung aside all disgustand has promised to make me happy oh not in the wildest of my dreams could i have imagined so much bliss the clouds which have so long hung heavily around the star of my destiny have been suddenly dispersed by one who views my heart arightwho understands mewho knows my sad history but recognises my innocencewho in a word rises superior to all the prejudices which shackle the world oh dearestdearest arthur how can i ever reward you adequately for this generosity on your part all the love which i bear youall the adoration i feel for youall the devotion i shall manifest towards you will not repay the immense debt that i owe you it is true that i possess great wealththat the services of my father to the state induced his majesty to create me a peeress in my own rightand that i have some pretensions to beautyall this is truebut it is not sufficient to induce my noblehearted arthur to make me the partner of his bed no for he himself is rich far beyond his desireshe also owns a proud and ancient nameand england has daughters far lovelier than i but he loves me for myselfapart from all selfish considerations and oh what bliss to be thus loved lady hatfield sank her head upon her fair hand and gave way to the new and ineffable bliss which had so suddenly enveloped her in its halo at length another idea struck her but my unclehow could he have known my secret she exclaimed aloud and how did he discover it oh he must have been aware of it from the very first the goodthe kindhearted mannever to have even appeared to georgianas reverie was interrupted by a hasty knock at her door she rose unlocked it and gave admission to her friend julia my dear lady hatfield exclaimed miss mordaunt her entire countenance illuminated with joy congratulate me it is all settled that you are to become lady blunt asked georgiana smiling yes my dearest friendlady blunt how well it sounds only think of lady blunt upon a cardprinted for instance in the old english letteror german textor whatever it is and thenlady blunts carriageand all that sort of thing really i am so happyi dont know whether to dance or singor both i am delighted to see you so happy my dear julia said lady hatfield and most sincerely do i congratulate you but have you acted prudently to accept sir christopher without communicating his proposal to your relations i think that i am quite old enough to manage my own affairs in this respect at least answered julia laughing and yetafter alli am not so very oldonly just thirty still it is high time to settle oneself in life but for the present my dear lady hatfield i must implore you to keep my engagement a profound secretfor reasons which i will explain in a few days i shall keep your secret julia without seeking to learn your motives until you may choose to communicate them replied georgiana and now i am about to surprise you in respect to myself lord ellingham has been here this morning so i heard from old mason just now said miss mordaunt but you knew he would call my dear friend after leaving his card last night andif you speak candidlyyou will confess that you hoped he would i did hope he would call julia answered georgiana but i could not imagine that our interview would have terminatedhowever she added checking herself and smiling joyously you must now congratulate me for in a few weeks i shall become the countess of ellingham i do indeed congratulate you my dearest lady hatfield replied miss mordaunt but upon my word wonders will never cease here were you only a few days ago rejecting the earl in opposition to every thing like common senseand certainly against the wishes of your very best friends let us not talk of the past julia interrupted georgiana the future opens so brightly before me that i am almost dazzled by its brilliancy and i am happysupremely happyoh almost too happy as she uttered these words georgiana threw herself into the armchair which she had quitted for the purpose of giving admission to miss mordaunt and never did the beauty of her soulspeaking countenance shine to greater advantage than at that moment and no wonder that even her friend whose volatile disposition seldom permitted her mind to settle its attention on subjects concerning another was struck by the loveliness of lady hatfield on this occasionno wonder we say that julia gazed with admiration for a long time on that beauteous woman for happiness seemed to have invested her with new charms her cheekslately so pale with mental anxiety and partial indispositionwere now tinged with a warm carnation huejoy flashed from her large liquid eyes usually of so mild though lustrous a languorand smiles played upon those rosy lips which were wont to remain apart with serious expression the earl of ellingham upon taking leave of georgiana that morningbut be it well understood with the promise of returning to pass an hour or two in the eveningexperienced that kind of heartfelt happiness which requires a vent by means of imparting the fact of its existence to a friend to the abode of dr lascelles was the earl accordingly hastening when he was suddenly accosted by a gentleman who addressed him by name and whom in another moment he remembered to be mr gordon the diamondmerchant i beg your lordships pardon for thus stopping you said that individual but i thought you might be gratified to learn that the jewels which i lost so mysteriously have been restored to me indeed exclaimed arthur i am rejoiced to hear these tidings and now i presume you are fully convinced that miss esther de medina was entirely innocent of the theft so ridiculously imputed to her on the contrary my lord answered the diamondmerchant i am more than ever certain that miss de medina was the person who took them mr gordon exclaimed the earl indignantly i should have thought that after the investigation which took place at the office in bow street you would not have clung to an opinion so dishonourableso unjust towards an innocent young lady moreover sir i should have conceived that my testimony to that young ladys character would have dispelled any doubts which had still hung on your mind that your lordship gave such testimony conscientiously i cannot for an instant question was the firm but respectful answer at the same time that your lordship was and is still deceived in that young lady i am confident illustration perhaps sir observed the earl coldly you will have no objection to communicate the reasons which have thus induced you to change your opinion for if i remember rightly you yourself declared in the public office that you were satisfied there was some grievous mistake and that miss de medina was innocent of the deed imputed to her at first i admit my lord replied the diamondmerchant that i was staggered by the singularity of the turn given to the proceedings when your lordship appeared to speak in miss de medinas defence but listen my lord to the subsequent events which revived all my suspicions upon leaving the policecourt i returned home but was scarcely able to attend to my business so bewildered was i by the occurrences of the morning and so annoyed was i also at the loss which i had so mysteriously experienced it was probably four oclock in the afternoon when a lady was announced and the moment she raised her veil i recognised miss de medina you may conceive my lord how surprised i was by this visit but much greater was my astonishment when she said to me without a single word of preface sir what is the value of the diamonds which you have lostsix hundred pounds was my answermiss de medina immediately drew forth a small packet from her dress and counted six banknotes each of a hundred pounds and which she placed before me on the tablehere is the amount sir she said and i offered her a receipt which she however declined for a few moments she lingeredas if anxious to say something more then suddenly turning away she abruptly quitted the house extraordinary cried the earl of ellingham and yet one instant my lord interrupted mr gordon the most mysterious part of the whole transaction is yet to be revealed to you not ten minutes had elapsed from the moment of miss de medinas departure when a person whom i remembered to have seen in the court was announced i do not know whether your lordship observed at the office a man of florid complexionlight curly hairred whiskersand dressed in a sporting suit i not only observed him replied the earl but from the description subsequently given by one of my servants whom i questioned after my return home from the policeoffice i have every reason to believe that the individual whom you describe was the bearer of a letter which had induced me to hasten to bow street to give my testimony in proof of miss de medinas innocence and does your lordship know that man inquired the diamondmerchant i never saw him to my knowledge until that day when the attention he appeared to devote to the proceedings attracted my noticealthough he was in the midst of the crowd congregated near the door but please to continue your own narrative this individual my lord of whom we have been speaking returned mr gordon was the person introduced to my office a few minutes after the departure of miss de medina he seated himself in a free and easy offhand manner and said i think i can give you some little information concerning the diamonds which you have lostindeed i exclaimed and anxious to hear what he was about to state i said nothing relative to the visit of miss de medina and the payment of the amount at which the lost jewels were valuedyes he continued and with the utmost coolness he produced a pistol from one pocket and a small parcel wrapped up in brown paper from the otherwhat is the meaning of this strange conduct i demanded glancing towards the weapon which the man held in his handoh it is soon explained he said this pistol is merely to defend myself in case you should take it into your head to give me into the charge of a constable on suspicion of being connected with the person who stole your property and as for the parcel open it and see what it containsthus speaking he tossed the packet across the table to me crossed his legs and began to hum a tune i opened the parcel and to my surprise perceived the diamonds which i had lostis the set complete asked the manquite perfect i replied in the most unfeigned astonishment at the singularity of the whole proceedings but how does it happen i continuedthat you have come to restore them to me when a quarter of an hour has scarcely elapsed since miss de medina herself called and paid me six hundred pounds at which they are valuedit now appeared to be the mans turn to be surprised but in another moment he exclaimedoh i understand it allwhat do you understand said i for i must candidly confess that i understand nothing of the whole transaction which is one involved in the deepest mysteryso let it remain he cried abruptly and now mark me he added in a slower and more impressive tone beware how you ever utter a word derogatory to the honour of esther de medina and he quitted the apartment leaving me in possession of my jewels and of the six hundred pounds also this narrative is so singular mr gordon said the earl of ellingham that were you not a respectable merchant and that you can have no possible interest in amusing me with a fiction i should not believe the portion which relates to miss de medina i declare before my maker ejaculated the diamondmerchant solemnly that i have not exaggerated one tittle of my history i have even more to state the restoration of my property convinced me that i had no right to retain the money which miss de medina had paid to me as a recompense for its loss i therefore determined to give it back to her but i was unacquainted with her residence then i recollected that your lordship had stated that mr de medina had become your tenant for a house and small estate about seven miles from london i immediately repaired to your lordships residence in pall mall to inquire the address of mr de medina but you were not at home your valet however furnished me with the information i required and on the following morning i proceeded to finchley i called at the house to which i had been directed and learnt that mr de medina and his daughter did not intend to settle there until the spring but from the servant in charge of the premises i ascertained where mr de medina resided in town i accordingly returned to london and forthwith repaired to great ormond street where i obtained an interview with miss de medina her father was outa circumstance which on the occasion appeared to give her pleasure because she asked the servant who announced me whether mr de medina were in his study and on receiving a reply to the effect that he had gone out a few minutes previous to my arrival she was evidently relieved of some anxiety i communicated the nature of my business but when i mentioned the particulars of the visit i had received from the lighthaired gentleman her countenance suddenly assumed so singular an expression that i can scarcely define its meaning it was not alarm alonenor surprisenor shamenor sorrow which her looks denoted but a feeling composed of all those sentiments blended together then when i explained to her that this man had restored my lost diamonds her countenance suddenly assumed an expression of joy i handed her the six hundred pounds which she received and thenas on the occasion of her visit to me the preceding eveningshe seemed anxious to make some remark to which she could not however give utterance the silence became awkwardand i took my leave your lordship now knows all and can you for one moment imagine that esther de medina was the person who stole your diamonds exclaimed lord ellingham or that she was in any way connected with that man who restored them to you my belief is that she parted with them in some way to that man answered mr gordon and that her father most probably gave her the money to recompense me for my loss but that when she paid it she was unaware that the man had the intention of restoring the jewels lord ellingham made no answer for there suddenly flashed upon his mind a reminiscence which staggered him the reader will recollect that when mr de medina encountered his daughter at the policecourt he said to her oh estheresther i can understand it all you have brought this upon yourself these words were overheard at the time by lord ellingham but they had since escaped his memoryor else failed to make any very deep impression upon himhis own mind since that day having been a prey to much acute anxiety suspense and conflicting feelings on account of lady hatfield but now when he recalled those words and considered them in all their significancewhen he pondered upon the tale which he had just heard from the lips of the diamondmerchantwhen he remembered that the man who had restored those jewels was doubtless the same who had conveyed to pall mall the letter which so mysteriously urged him to hasten to the policecourt and give his testimony in esthers defencehe began to share mr gordons belief that there must be some connexion between that florid lighthaired man and miss de medina at the same time lord ellingham was convinced that esther had not stolen the diamonds or that if she had mr gordon had mistaken the hour of the day if not the day itself on which such theft was committed because arthur remembered beyond all possibility of error that from two oclock on the afternoon until near eleven oclock at night on the day specified by the diamondmerchant esther was engaged in visiting the house which her father had hired from him lord ellingham and which was situate about a mile beyond finchley arthur himself accompanied mr de medina and esther on that occasion and esther was never absent from his sight save perhaps for a few minutes at a time during the interval above named there was a profound mystery somewhere and though the earl was not characterised by any feeling of impertinent curiosity yet he longed to clear up the doubts and misgivings which had at length arisen in his mind he entertained the greatest respect for mr de medina anduntil nowthe same sentiment towards esther whom he had hitherto looked upon as a model of purity amiability and innocence he therefore felt grievedvexeddisappointedannoyed for the honour of the human race and especially for the credit of the female sex to think it possible that he had been so grossly deceived in that beautiful jewess he walked slowly along the diamondmerchant by his side well my lord said the latter at length breaking the protracted silence what is your opinion now i confess that i am bewildered was the reply but i shall not judge hastily in the meantime i pray you so far to suspend your opinion upon the subject as to avoid the utterance of aught prejudicial to miss de medinas character and if i succeed in fathoming this mystery the fact of that young ladys guilt or innocence shall be duly communicated to you the diamondmerchant bowed respectfully and departed in another direction while lord ellingham continued his way towards grafton street chapter xxi the oath dr lascelles was at home and immediately granted an audience to the earl of ellingham popular physicians are potentates in their way and access to them save on matters of professional business is frequently difficult but the doctor had taken a greater fancy to the young nobleman than he was ever known to entertain for any of his acquaintances and he therefore received him as one who did not encroach on his very valuable time well said the physician as the earl made his appearance in the professional receptionroom something new about lady hatfield ill be bound you are right my dear doctor answered the lover and i am the happiest of men i am charmed to hear it said lascelles casting a glance of curiosity not unmingled with surprise towards the earl yes doctor cried the latter his handsome countenance irradiated with the lustre of complete felicity the beautiful georgiana has consented to become my wife your wife ejaculated the physician and wherefore not asked the earl astonished at the tone and manner of his friend do you think that i will allow what must be considered a misfortune to stand in the way of my happiness certainlyif you can rise superior to a prejudice which influences the generality of the world said the physician thrown off his guard by lord ellinghams last observation i do not see ah then you also know all ejaculated the earl but let us not dwell on this topic suffice it that i have heard from sir ralph walsingham enough to convince me that his niece is to be commiserated in a certain respect and i have had a full explanation with her on the subject in a few weeks she will be lady ellingham and it shall be my dutyas it will also prove my delightto make her so completely happy that she shall forget the incident which has had so powerful an effect upon her mind i sincerely wish you all possible felicity my dear earl said the doctor shaking the young nobleman warmly by the hand a thousand thanks doctor exclaimed arthur cordially returning the pressure but how became you acquainted with that incident in georgianas life which has exercised such influence over her i thought you told me yesterday that she had not entered into any explanations with you neither had shenor has she my dear lord observed the physician who seemed slightly surprised if not puzzled by the observations of his young friend butas you yourself ere now saidlet us not dwell on that topicit is of too delicate a nature it is delicate my dear doctor responded the earl but as i am my own master and labour not under the necessity of consulting my relatives as to those proceedings which are connected with my interest or happiness oh certainly said the doctor you love lady hatfieldand she loves you in return it is quite natural i have known many such casesmore perhaps than you could imagine i do not doubt you replied the earl but i will not longer intrude on your valuable time he added smiling for i know that you are not in the habit of receiving visits of a merely friendly nature at this period of the day to you only am i accessible on such terms replied the physician the earl then took his leave and was about to return home when he bethought himself of the strange communication he had received from mr gordon the diamondmerchant and as the weather was fine and frosty he determined to walk as far as the residence of mr de medina in great ormond street on his arrival at that gentlemans house he found the servant standing at the frontdoor in the act of receiving some articles from a tradesmans boy and this trivial fact is only recorded inasmuch as it explains the reason how lord ellingham ascended to the drawingroom without being duly announced he considered himself to be on terms of sufficient intimacy with mr de medina to take such a liberty and when the domestic made a movement to conduct him up stairs arthur desired him in a condescending manner not to take the trouble as he knew the way accordingly the earl proceeded to the drawingroom where he did not however find mr de medina and his daughter although from the statement of the servant he had expected to meet them there the floor was spread with a thick rich turkey carpet on which his footsteps fell noiselessly he was about to seat himself when voices in the adjoining apartment which was only separated from the drawingroom by foldingdoors met his ears esther said mr de medina speaking in an earnest and solemn tone this is the third anniversary of that dreadful day which oh do not refer more than is necessary to that sad event dear father exclaimed the jewess in an imploring voice heaven knows my child responded her sire thatif you feel as i do i doi do dearest father cried esther yesbut not all the degradationthe infamythe shame allall fathereven as acutely as yourself she said in a voice denoting the most intense anguish and yet undutiful girl that you are exclaimed mr de medina you persist in seeing that lostabandoned the sudden rattling of a carriage in the street drowned the remainder of this sentence oh my dearest father forgive me cried esther in a tone of the most earnest appeal you cannot imagine the extent of my lovemy boundless lovefor that unfortunate unfortunate repeated mr de medina angrily nono say that most wretchedguiltycriminal my god use not such harsh terms almost shrieked the beautiful jewess and the earl of ellingham could judge by the sound that she fell upon her knees as she spoke yesestheron your knees implore my forgiveness for your oftrepeated disobedience exclaimed mr de medina consider undutifulungrateful girlof the positionthe scandalous disgraceful position in which you were placed a few days ago that ring which was sold to the diamondmerchant pardon me dearest fatheroh pardon me cried the young lady her voice becoming wildly hysterical again a vehicle rolled along the street and of the jews reply all that the earl could distinguish were the wordsthose diamonds estherthe theft of those diamonds oh my godi shall yet go mad with the dreadful thought oh this is cruelmost cruel after all i have suffered cried esther wherefore revive those terrible reproaches now sayspeak fatherwhat do you require of me wherefore this conversation again i must remind you answered mr de medina solemnly that this is the third anniversary of that day i know iti know it oh how can i ever forget it said esther in a tone of the most painful emotion and now continued mr de medina apparently but little moved by his daughters griefnow must you swear estherupon that book which contains the principles of our creedthat you will never under any circumstances mr de medina here sank his voice to so low a tone that the earl could only catch a few disjointed phrases such as theserenew your connexion withacknowledge thatsuch infamy and disgracehonoured namefamilyseduced my daughterrobbed her of her purityalthough the world may not suspectdegradation on yourselfdiscard you for everthomas rainford i swear said esther in a tone which led the earl to imagine that she took the proscribed oath with a dreadful shudder and now rise exclaimed mr de medina it is over these words suddenly awoke the earl to a consciousness of his position and his face became scarlet as the thought flashed upon his mind that he had been playing the part of an eavesdropper he despised himself for having listened to the dialogue between mr de medina and his daughter but his attention had been so completely rivetted to this strangemysteriousand exciting conversation that he had unwittingly remained a hearer an invisible spell had nailed him as it were to the spothad forced him to linger and drink in that discourse which alas appeared to speak so eloquently to the discredit of her whose character he had so warmly defended two hours before and now suddenly awakingas we saidto a sense of his position he perceived that a subterfuge could alone save him from the imputation of being an eavesdropper and to that subterfuge was this really nobleminded peer compelled to stoop hastily stepping to the drawingroom door he opened it and closed it again with unusual violence so that the sound might fall upon the ears of mr de medina and esther and induce them to believe that he had only just entered the room the stratagem succeeded for mr de medina immediately made his appearance from the inner apartment and welcomed the earl with his wonted calmness of manner in reply to arthurs polite inquiries relative to miss de medina the father replied that his daughter was somewhat indisposed and hoped the earl would excuse her absence a quarter of an hour passed in conversation of no particular interest to the reader and lord ellingham then took his leave when he found himself once more in the open street he could scarcely believe that he was not the sport of some wild and delusive dream had he heard aright or had his ears beguiled him was it true that all those reproaches had been levelled by an angry father at the head of a daughter who did not attempt to deny her guilt but who was compelled to implore that outraged parents forgiveness had he not prescribed to her an oath which seemed to imply in plain termsalthough the earl had caught but detached portionsthat esther had been seducedrobbed of her purityand that the villain was one thomas rainford had not that oath been administered for the purpose of binding her to break off her connexion with this thomas rainford and did not mr de medina assure her that though the world might not suspect it yet she had not the less brought degradation on herself in finedid not the angry father threaten to discard her for ever unless she swore to obey his injunctions in what other way could the blanks in the terms of the oathas ellingham had gathered them by means of the few but significant disjointed passages thereofin what other way could those blanks be filled up than in the manner above detailed it is too apparent thought the earl within himself and esther is an abandonedlostdegraded girl and yet how deceptive is her appearancehow delusive her demeanour purity seems to be expressed in every glanceinnocence characterises every word she utters merciful heavens what must i think of the female sex after such a discovery as this and yet let me not judge harshly of the whole because one is frail my own georgiana is quite different from that artful hypocrite esther de medina georgiana conceals not a tainted soul beneath a chaste exterior she is purity in mind as well as in appearance and after all esther did steal the diamonds her father upbraided her with the theft he even alluded to the ring which she sold to mr gordon yesit is indeed too apparent she is utterly depraved but that name of thomas rainfordsurely i have heard it before the earl strove to recollect himself oh i remember now he thought at the expiration of a few moments it was thomas rainford who was accused of robbing my georgiana on the highway how strange is this coincidence and yet it was not that man who plundered herfor she proved his innocence of at least this imputation but it was doubtless rainford who sent me the letter desiring me to appear in the defence of esther and it must also have been he who restored the diamonds to the merchant that esther stole those diamonds is clearfor her father accused her of it at least such is the inference that must be drawn from his words but that gordon was wrong as to the day or the hour of the day on which the theft was committed is also clear inasmuch as esther was at finchley at the time stated still gordon was so positiveand when he appeared to prosecute the jewess at the policeoffice so short a time had elapsedonly a few hours indeedsince the act was perpetrated that it is difficult to believe how he could have mistaken the date there is a mystery yet attending on this affairbut that its elucidation would establish esthers innocence cannot for a moment be believed such was the train of thought into which the earl of ellingham was naturally led by the dialogue he had overheard between the jew and his daughter he was sincerely grieved to be forced to come to the conviction that esther de medina was a lost and ruined girl instead of the pure and artless being he had previously believed her to be although his affections were undividedly georgianas yet he had entertained a sentiment of friendship for the jewess and he was pained and shocked to think that he had ever experienced any interesteven the slightestin a female so utterly unworthy his notice for the father he still felt respect which was also now blended with profound commiseration for he beheld in him an honest and honourable man who was cursed with a daughter characterised by bad passions and evil propensities the earl was well aware that mr de medina was a very rich man he could not therefore suppose that necessity had induced esther either to dispose of the ring or to steal the jewels what then could he conclude that she required funds to support a worthless abandoned and lost manher paramour hence the sale of the ringhence the theft of the diamonds arthur now remembered his promise to mr gordon to make him acquainted with any particulars which he might discover relative to that business but how could he fulfil his pledge he shrank from the contemplation of the circumstance which had made him acquainted with esthers guilt he felt annoyed and vexed with himself for having allowed his curiosity so far to dominate his honourable principles as to render him an eavesdropper he would not therefore aggravate his offence by imparting its results to another and with an endeavour to banish the subject from his memory and turn his attention to more pleasurable topics he hastily pursued his way homeward chapter xxii the alarmthe letter in the meantime esther de medina had retired to her own apartment immediately after the strange painful and exciting scene which had taken place with her father seating herself upon a sofa she burst into a violent flood of tears the delicate tinge of carnation which usually appeared beneath the clear transparent olive hue of her complexion was now chased away and she was palevery pale her grief was evidently intense anguish overwhelmed her spirit oh esther if thou art indeed a guiltyfrailfallen being the eye cannot refuse a tear of pity to thy lost condition nofor never has even the enamoured poet in his dreams conceived a form and face more perfect than nature had bestowed upon her there appeared too such a virgin freshness about that charming creature who was just bursting into womanhoodsuch a halo of innocence seemed to surround herso much modesty so much propriety characterised her slightest attitudes and her most unimportant words that to contemplate her for a few minutes and yet retain the stubborn conviction that she was a wanton amounted almost to an impossibility and nowto behold her plunged in griefalone with her own wretched thoughts and weepingwho could believe that the lips on which purity appeared to dwell had ever been pressed by those of the seducerthat the sylphlike form whose sweeping undulating outlines were so gracefully set forth by the mournfulness of her attitude had ever unveiled its beauties on the bed of illicit lovethat the rude hand of licentiousness had ever disturbed the treasures of the bosom so carefully concealedwho could believe all this nevertheless says the reader appearances are so completely against herthe evidences of her guilt seem so damningthat alas there is not a hope of her innocence but let us continue the thread of our narrative for half an hour did esther remain absorbed in the most profound afflictiona prey to thoughts and reminiscences of a very painful nature at length she rose abruptly and evidently strove to conquer her grief she wiped away the tears from her fine black eyes and advanced towards the window from behind the curtains of which she gazed into the street with the view of directing her thoughts into some new channel suddenly an idea struck her and she hastened to her writingdesk at which she sate down and began to pen a letter while she was thus engaged the crystal drops ever and anon started from her eyes and trembled on the jetty fringes the glossy darkness of which no oriental dye could have enhanced in the midst of her occupationthe progress of which was marked by many an illsubdued soba female servant entered the room to acquaint miss de medina that her father had just received a letter on some business that required his immediate attention and that she was not to expect him home to dinner the domestic then withdrew and esther finished her letter which she folded and concealed in her bosom it was now five oclock and she descended to the diningroombut she had no appetiteand the ceremony of the repast to which she was compelled to sit down alone was by no means calculated to enliven her spirits quitting the table as soon as possible she returned to her chamber put on her bonnet and shawl and hurried into the fresh air which she hoped would have an exhilarating influence upon her esther drew her veil closely over her face and proceeded to southampton row where she entered a shop at which the local postoffice was stationed the woman who stood behind the counter appeared to recognise her and immediately handed her a letter which was addressed simply to a b c postoffice southampton row to be left till called for miss de medina purchased a few articles of fancy stationeryevidently with the view to recompense the shopkeeper for the trouble of receiving her letters and not because she required the things and while the woman was occupied in making up the parcel esther proceeded to read the communication just placed in her hands for this purpose she raised her veil and approached the light which burnt near the window the letter was short but its contents drew tears from the eyes of the beautiful jewess scarcely had she terminated the perusal when she was startled by hearing a voice at the door distinctly exclaim there she is by heaven instinctively glancing in that direction she beheld a very palefaced lad of apparently fifteen or sixteen gazing intently upon her from the immediate vicinity of the threshold of the shop and close behind himwith his eyes also fixed upon herstood a very tall thin old man of most repulsive aspect the instant esther looked towards them the old man laid his hand on the lads shoulder and hurried him away and esthersomewhat alarmed by the incidenttook up the little parcel of stationery wished the woman a courteous good evening and quitted the shop when she again found herself in the street she drew down her veil and hastened towards the nearest hackneycoach stand a vehicle speedily drew alongside of the kerbstone for her accommodation and as she was stepping into it she distinctly beheld through the folds of her veil the tall old man and the pale lad entering another vehicle at a little distance she could not be mistakenfor the shops sent forth a flood of light which rendered the forms of those two persons plainly visible the coachman had to repeat his inquiry whither he was to drive ere esther could recover her presence of mind sufficiently to reply to the nearest postoffice in holborn she at length said why lord bless you maamtheres one close by herenot ten yards off answered the jarvey who was an honest fellow in his way never mind said esther i wish to be taken to another the man urged no farther objection but mounted his box and drove awayquietly settling in his own mind that his fare was either mad or tipsy he neither knew nor cared which miss de medina could not shake off an oppressive suspicion which had forced itself upon her she fancied that she was watchedand for the simple reason that she knew nothing of the old man and the lad her uneasiness increased into actual alarm this feeling was enhanced too when her quick ears caught the rumbling sound of another vehicle behind and she began to blame herself for having ventured abroad at such an hour then she reasoned with herself that no harm could possibly happen to her in the midst of a densely populated city and while people were walking about in all directionsbut still in spite of this attempt at selfassurance the pale countenance of the lad and the sinister looks of the old man haunted her like spirits of evil but in a few minutes the hackneycoach entered holborn and the blaze of lightthe bustlethe throng of vehiclesthe crowd of footpassengersand the animated appearance of the whole scene dispelled nearly all her alarms the vehicle draw up nearly at the corner of fetter lane and esther alighted another hackneycoach stopped simultaneously at a short distance and her eyes were immediately directed towards it heres the postoffice maam said the driver of the vehicle which she had hired miss de medina startedrecollected herselfand hastened to thrust into the letterbox the epistle which she had written ere she left home the address on that epistle wast r no brandon street locks fields this superscription was caught by the sharp eyes of the palefaced boy who had stolenquick as thoughtup to the shopwindow and now stood by esthers side as she dropped the letter into the box when esther turned hastily to regain the vehicle she beheld the lad retreating with strange speed from the spot what can this mean she thought within herself who is it that is thus watching my movements and seriously alarmed she hurried back to the coach giving orders to be driven direct to great ormond street away went the vehicle again and the noise of crowded holborn prevented the jewess from judging by sounds whether the other hackneycoach was followingfor that she was watched she had no longer any doubt suddenly a suspicion struck her like an icy chill could her father have employed spies to dog herto mark her movements circumstances on the one hand suggested the probability of such an occurrence while on the other the character of her parent was of a nature repugnant to such a proceeding he was stern and severe but strictly honourable and esther knew that he was not a man likely to adopt underhand measures then wherefore was she watched and why had the lad crept close up to her as she put the letter into the box the coach had turned up grays inn lane which thoroughfare was more quiet than holborn and esther could hear no sounds of a second vehicle our readers are probably aware that the generality of hackneycoaches have or rather had for they are nearly extinct at the present day a little window behind covered with a sort of flap made of the same material as the lining esther turned round and raised the flap to assure herself that there was really no vehicle following the one in which she was but at the same instant a face disappeared as if it had suddenly sunk into the earth but not before the jewess had recognised the pale features and dark eyes of the lad a faint cry escaped her lips and she fell back on the seat a prey to vague but serious alarm in a few moments she recovered her selfpossession and again endeavoured to dispel her fears by arguing that no harm could possibly befall herthat if any outrage were intended her screams would speedily bring hundreds to her rescueand that after all no real cause for apprehension might exist she arrived without accident in great ormond street and when she alighted at her own door the lad who had terrified her was no longer to be seen her father had not yet returned and she was therefore again left to the companionship of her own thoughts but when she was seated by the cheerful fire in the drawingroom and with the bright lamp burning on the table she smiled at those alarms which had ere now oppressed her the entire adventure now wore quite another aspect in her imagination the old man and the boy were probably thieves who prowled about to pursue their avocation where they could she had most likely been mistaken in the idea that they had entered a hackneycoach in southampton row simultaneously with herself but they had followed her vehicle on foot and when she stepped out to post her letter the lad had taken that opportunity of creeping close up to her to pick her pocket having failed by the suddenness with which she had turned round he had afterwards got up behind the coach to dog her to the end of her journey with the hope of still succeeding in his predatory design but when she had looked through the backwindow he had disappeared such was the explanation which she now arranged in her mind for her own satisfaction but then what could mean the words uttered at the door of the shop in southampton rowthere she is by heaven fancy again came to her aid to set this point at restshe had most probably been watched by the old man and the lad before she was aware of the fact and they had lost sight of her but when they passed the shop her presence there had elicited the ejaculation from the youth such was the manner in which esther tranquillised herself relative to the little occurrence that had so much alarmed herwhether her conjectures were wellfounded or not the reader may judge by what we are about to relate no sooner had she posted her letter in holborn than jacob who had managed to get sight of its superscription darted back to the second hackneycoach which had stopped near the top of fetter lane and leaping in said to old death who was inside the letter is addressed to t r no brandon street locks fields and that is tom rains place ejaculated bones welldo you follow herget up behind the coachand meet me at bunces presently away started jacob and when he was gone old death alighted from the vehicle which he had hired in southampton row to follow esther dismissed it and walked boldly into the shop where that young lady had posted her letter a lad was in attendance behind the counter my boy said old death in as pleasant a tone as he could assume i just this minute dropped a letter into the box and i remember that i have made a mistake in a particular circumstance mentioned in its contents you cant have it back again replied the boy its against the rules well i know it is said old death coaxingly but its of the greatest consequence to me to alter a particular part of it and if youll oblige me heres halfacrown for your trouble thus speaking he displayed the proffered coin now halfacrown was a great temptation to a lad who only earned eighteenpence a week in addition to his food moreover the master of the shop was absent at the moment and not very likely to return in a hurryfor the boy knew he was with a party of friends at a neighbouring publichouseand thus old deaths silver argument was effectual welli spose i must said the youth but dont tell any body about it though whats the address t r no brandon street locks fields the boy unlocked the letterbox selected the particular epistle and handed it to old death who threw the halfcrown on the counter and marched off with the letter he could not restrain his curiosity until he reached seven dials or any other place which he was in the habit of frequenting and accordingly turned into a publichouse in the neighbourhood there he ordered some refreshment seated himself in a corner of the parlour and carefully opened the letter in such a way that it might be resealed without exciting a suspicion of having ever been tampered with he then read the contents which ran as follow i sit down in anguish of heart to pen a few lines to youto you whom i love so sincerely but whom i must never see more my father has just made me take a terrible oath to that effect and so determined was his mannerso resolute was heso sternso severealas that i should be compelled to say sothat i dared not refuse to obey his command and yet you know that i am as devotedly attached to you as everall i have sufferedall i have undergone on your account must convince you of my unchanged unchangeable affection do not then think ill of me on account of the oath which my father wrestedtore from me my god how my heart palpitates as i write these lines oh if you knew the state of my mind you would pity me i am wretchedheaven send that you are more happy than i alas cannot you take compassion upon meupon me your own tender estherand quit the path which you are pursuing it is not too late to do soit is never too late all might yet be well my father would forget the pastand we should be reunited think of thisponder well upon itand remember how much happiness will be wrecked for ever if you persist in a course which i tremble to reflect upon to be connected with a highwayman is dreadful pardon meforgive me for speaking thus plainlybut you know how sincerely i love youand if i write that terrible word highwayman it is merely to fix your thoughts the more seriously on that point what must be the end of this course of life public infamyor perhaps a scaffold again i say forgive me for writing thusi scarcely know what i commit to paperthere are moments when my brain reels as i contemplate the subject of my letter i can write no more perhaps i shall find a note from you at the post office in southampton row i hope soand i also hope that i may discover in it some cause of satisfaction to myself adieudearest adieu esther the contents of this letter sadly puzzled old death they were quite different from what he had expected to find them but without waiting to reflect upon their nature he obtained a piece of sealingwax from the waiter and so cleverly closed the letter again that even a clerk in the general postoffice could not have told it had been opened he then retraced his way to the shop in holborn where it was originally posted and threw it back into the box this being done he bent his way towards toby bunces house in earl street seven dials chapter xxiii old death when bones reached the place whither he had bent his steps he learnt to his satisfaction that toby bunce had been sent out by his wife on some errand which would keep him at least an hour away he accordingly followed mrs bunce into the back room and explained to her all that had occurred having stated how he and jacob had followed esther in the hackneycoach from southampton row to holborn he saidwhen jacob first pointed her out to me as she was reading a letter in a shop i felt sure he must be mistaken for i could not conceive why she should be up at that part of the town since from what jacob discovered last night i thought she was certainly living with tom rain in locks fields however i determined to follow her and when she got down at a shop in holborn i told jacob to jump out and get another good look at her if possible but instead of going into the shop she merely stopped there to post a letter and jacob was quick enough to catch sight of the address well when he came back to me and told me what that address was i desired him to follow her directly for i thought that if she was writing to tom rain it was clear she didnt live with him and therefore it was as well to find out where she does live to be sure said mrs bunce approvingly then it struck me continued old death that if i could only get sight of the contents of that letter which she had posted to tom rain it might open some farther clue to the nature of their connexion and i did get the letter oh you clever fellow interrupted betsy shaking her head with mock gravity but what did the letter say why it was a regular sermon answered old death it talked about how much she loved himall she had done and suffered on his accountand a lot of gammon of that kind she told him how her father had made her take an oath not to see him any more and how unhappy she was then she begged of him to repent and leave a course of life that is sure to end at tuckup fair did she use them words demanded mrs bunce no you fool cried old death she writes quite like a lady and in a beautiful hand too but after having said all i have told you she let him know that she shuddered at the idea of being connected with a highwayman and she begged his pardon for calling him so a pleasant letter for tom to receive observed mrs bunce very and she drops a hint continued old death that if he will give up his business there is a chance of her father forgiving tom for what is past and of their being reunitedthats the very word do you think they are married then asked the woman i should say not replied bones because she talks of being connected with a highwaymanand thats not a word a wife uses to her husband besides the whole letter didnt look like one written by a wifebut rather a mistress and then it ends by saying that she hopes to find a letter from him at the postoffice in southampton row find a letterwhen asked mrs bunce why todaythis evening i suppose said old death she had evidently written her letter before she went to the postoffice in southampton row where she did find one from himbecause she was reading a note when jacob first twigged her and it was singular enough that we were just talking of her at that very identical moment then the letter you read wasnt an answer to the one she received in southampton row said mrs bunce of course not stupid cried old death we followed her straight down to holborn and she never stopped or went in any where to write an answer the letter i read was already writtenwritten too in the afternoon most likely just before she came out to go to southampton row and another reason that made me anxious to get hold of her letter to tom rain was that she didnt post it at the office where she received his but took the trouble to go down to holborn to put it into another box illustration i wonder why she did that said mrs bunce oh most likely to avoid exciting any suspicion or curiosity at the office in southampton row then theres another thing that puzzles meshe was with tom rain last nightjacob saw them together and followed them home to locks fields and she is away from him todaywrites to him this afternoonand hopes to find a letter from him when she goes to southampton row this evening one would think by this that they have been in the habit of corresponding together and that the place in southampton row is where he directs his letters to her so its pretty clear that they dont live together for good and all but what perplexes me most is the sermon that she wrote him its plain she stole the diamonds from what jacob overheard tom say to her when he gave her the earrings last night and yet she doesnt reproach herself a bit in the letter to him she only tries to convert rainford and to read that letter one would think she was as innocent of a theft or suchlike thing as a child unborn oh i dare say she wrote the letter for some object or another which we cant see observed mrs bunce i scarcely think so returned bones there was so much seriousness about it but shes a precious deep one depend on it said betsy look how she got off about the diamonds and after all perhaps her father had been talking her over and so if she wrote to tom rain in a serious way the humour wont last very long wellwe shall see exclaimed old death i should like to secure her in my interests what did you do with the letter she wrote to tom rain asked mrs bunce put it back into the post was the reply fancy if esther and tom did get together again and on comparing notes he found that the letter from her had miscarried he might suspect a trick somewhere and fix foul play on me nono it was more prudent to let the note go since i had gathered its contents wellperhaps it was said mrs bunce one thing is very clear ben whats that betsy whythat since esther isnt any longer with mr rainford in the fields it will be much easier to get the little boy away i thought of that just now said old death then after a pause he added and ill tell you whats to be done the boy most be got into our power tomorrow night tomorrow night repeated mrs bunce yestomorrow night returned bones emphatically ill trump up something to get tom out of the way and me toby and jacob will go over and kidnap the child if we dont do it quick the jewess will be getting spooney on tom again and going back to live with him in spite of her oath to her father and then we may not find such another chance for some time to come mrs bunce smiled an approval of this scheme and was about to offer a comment when a knock summoned her to the frontdoor she shortly returned to the backroom followed by jacob what news demanded old death i found out where the jewess lives was the lads answer and he named the address in great ormond street good exclaimed bones that shows why she has her letters sent to southampton rowit is close by and as shes known in the neighbourhood she posts her answers at another place but give jacob his supperand brew me some grog betsy while mrs bunce was busily employed in executing these orders another knock at the frontdoor was heard jacob hastened to answer it and returned with a letter directed to mr toby bunce but which having a peculiar mark placed somewhere amidst the writing was instantly discovered by old death to be intended for himself he accordingly opened it and read as follows tim put on the tats yesterday and went out a

then sate pondering for a few moments upon the course which he should pursue under the circumstances just made known to him and while he is thus engaged in meditation we will lay before our readers a translation of the slang document tim dressed himself in rags yesterday and went out disguised as a beggar halfnaked and without shoes or stockings he robbed a gentleman and a lady of a watch and a purse his mistress muttonface sal with her reticule and looking like a respectable female was on the lookout close at hand a confederatethief who went shares with tim suddenly gave the alarm so that tim might hand him over the plunder and tim saw that a person was watching him so he hurried off home while his woman got off safely also today tim sent the watch to have the works taken out and put

interrupted old deaths observation jacob was sent to answer the summons and in a few moments tom rain walked jauntily into the room well my prince of fences he exclaimed addressing old death as he cast himself unceremoniously into a chair and stretched out his legs in a free and independent manner any thing new in the wind yesa trifling jobfor tomorrow night tom answered bones but youll be making your fortune at this rate he added with one of his hideous chuckles the sooner the better cried the highwayman and then youd be able to retire from businessmarryand settle yourself comfortably

boy you neednt wait unless you like old death then left the house footnote snammera thief chapter xxiv castle street long acre to the north of long acre runs castle streetfor many years notorious as a nest of thieves prostitutes and juvenile vagabonds of the most degraded description at the period of which we are writing a person of the name of thompson ownedand probably still possessesthe lodginghouses numbered and in castle street this individual resided in mint street borough where he had similar houses in addition to others in buckeridge street st giless the houses in buckeridge street would make up one hundred beds and those in castle street sixty at lodginghouses of this description the rooms are filled with low trucklebeds each having a straw mattress two coarse sheets a blanket and a rug the price of half a bed is threepence and it need scarcely be observed that men women and children sleep together in these filthy receptacles without the slightest regard to decency or modesty sometimes when the lodginghouses are particularly crowded three persons will share one bedor motives of economy frequently compel a poor family thus to herd together it is by no means an uncommon occurrence for a grownup girl to sleep with her father and mother or with her brothersa poor married couple will even share their bed with a male friendand no shame is known who can define where the shades of doubtful honesty and confirmed roguery meet and blend in these low lodginghouses the labouring man is in nightly company with the habitual thiefhis wife and his as yet uncorrupted daughter are forced to associate with the lowest prostitutes how long will that wife remain faithfulthat daughter taintless the very children who breathe that infected atmosphere soon become lost and triumph in their degradation the principal frequenters and patrons of these low lodginghouses are regular customers and consist of thieves prostitutes beggars coiners burglars and hawkers the casual lodgers are labouring men and their families whom poverty compels to sleep in such horrible places the hawkers make a great deal of money they can buy steelpens for d a gross pocketbooks for d each snuffboxes for d each and penknives for d each on every article they can gain one hundred per cent many of these hawkers consider nine or ten shillings to be only a reasonable and by no means a good days work some of the women who frequent the lodginghouses in castle street and elsewhere and who have no children of their own hire infants for d or d a day and obtain in the shape of alms at least four or five shillings a day each females of this class care not whether their husbands or lovers work or remain idle for they boast that they can keep themand keep them well too some of these women knit caps in the streets and they make more money than those who merely trust to the children accompanying them as the motive of charitable persons compassion in the low lodginghouses of castle street and wherever else they may be found the most frightful dissipation as well as the most appalling immorality prevails drunkenness is the presiding genius of these dens and how much has strong drink to answer for it is strong drink that helps to fill the gaolsthe hulksthe asylums for the wretched the diseased and the insane it is strong drink that calls forth so many sighs and such bitter tearsshortens existenceperpetuates family diseaseand fosters maladies of all species and of all kinds strong drink often places the criminal in the condemned cell and reduces the beautiful girl to barter her charms for bread strong drink strews the land with old rags and bleaching bones let temperance and moderation be the guides of allfor what are the results of intemperance and habitual drunkenness behold them in all the poor and low neighbourhoods of london and if you ask reader by what signs you are to recognise them we will tell youby the leaden eyesthe tottering stepsthe shaking

apoplexypalsydelirium tremensenlarged liverossified heartimpaired digestionyellow jaundicecancerous stomachand dropsyall these attend upon strong drink and the hideous catalogue of evils includes also broken limbsfearful accidents and gushing woundsas well as many of those hereditary maladies which are handed down from father unto son in an earlier chapter we ridiculed the phrase of merry england oh is it merry to see so much miseryso much crimeso much oppressionso much sorrowso much absence of sympathy if all this be joyous then of a surety is england the merriest country and london the merriest city on the face of the earth if a man can find music in the cries that issue from our crowded prisons and the wails that flow from our barbarous workhouses then may he dance long and heartily to that melodyfor it never ceases if poverty can excite felicitous sensations within him heaven knows he need never be sad if crime can bring smiles to his lips his countenance need never wear a melancholy aspect and if he can slake his thirst in the heartwrung tears of human agony he need never step out of his way to look for a fountain or a spring in this light england is indeed merry for the observer of human nature as he walks through the crowded streets of london is jostled and hemmed in by all the gaunt and hideous forms that bear the denominations and wear the characteristics of crimepovertydiseasesorrowand despair old death knocked at the door of no castle street and was instantly admitted by a tall pale and rather handsome girl who exclaimed ah my fine fellowi thought you would come is it you muttonface said bones with a grim smile meand no one else answered the girl but walk in old death accepted the invitation and followed muttonface sal into a room where about two dozen persons male and female were crowded round a large fire one was a young man of the name of quin and who obtained a handsome income by means of imposture he was accustomed to appear in the streets as a wretchedlooking deplorable old man bent double with age and infirmity supporting himself on a stick and crawling along in a painful manner at the slowest possible rate he used to swallow a dose of some strong acid every morning to make himself look ghastly pale and he succeeded so well in counterfeiting an aspect of the most lamentable nature that he seldom returned to castle street at night with less than ten shillings in his pocket he had now thrown off his disguise and was whiling away the time after a good supper with a quart of egghot next to him sate a young woman stout florid and rather goodlooking she was in her stays and petticoat having very quietly taken off her gown to mend a rent and she experienced not the slightest shame at thus exposing all the upper part of her person to the mixed society present neither did they appear to think there was any thing at all remarkable in her conduct how indeed could it be otherwisesince she would presently undress herself entirely in that very roomand before all her companions who would do the samemale and femalewhen the hour arrived to repair to the beds ranged along the wall this girl was known as jane cummins and was the mistress of the impostor quin farther on was a fellow who was sitting upright enough in his chair then but who appeared daily in the streets as a bent cripple he was accustomed to go about imitating a cuckoo by which avocation he made a good living he invariably got drunk every night next to this impostor was a little deformity who was tied round the body to his chair he had no legs and was dragged about the streets of a day in a kind of cart drawn by two beautiful dogs and having a banner unfurled behind him the woman in charge of no paid him the greatest attentionput him to bed at nighthelped him to rise in the morningcarried him out to his vehiclestrapped him inand saw him safe off on his excursion about the metropolis he usually returned at four to his dinner and did not go out afterwards his earnings were on the average ten shillings aday a woman of about thirty dressed in widows weeds and far advanced in the family way sate next to the little deformity she had never been married but was possessed of five children who were now playing in one corner of the room she was accustomed to take her stand in some public thoroughfare with her children drawn up in a row and this game she had carried on at the time of which we are writing for four yearsrather a long period of widowhood she disliked fine weather because the hearts of the charitable are more easily touched by the spectacle of a destitute family standing in the midst of a pouring rain or on the snow and she reckoned that in bad weather she could earn eight or nine shillings aday every saturday night she took her station in some poor neighbourhoodsuch as church street bethnal green leather lane lambeth marsh high street st giless or clare market and on those occasions she often obtained as much as fifteen shillings but then as she very justly observed sunday was a day of rest and so it was indeed to herfor she was in the habit of getting so awfully drunk every saturday night after her return home to castle street that she was compelled to lie in bed all the next day until three or four oclock when she rose to a good dinner she always kept herself and children remarkably neat and cleannot from any principle but as a matter of calculation charitable people thought she was a good mother and a deserving though distressed woman and alms poured in upon her when questioned by any individual who relieved her she would reply that her husband was a bricklayer who had fallen off a ladder and killed himself six weeks ago or that he was an honest hardworking man whose career was suddenly cut short by his being run over by a gentlemans carriage or some such tale next to her sate a young woman who was wont to take her stand in the evening after dusk close by the entrance to somerset house in the summer she would hold a few flowers in her hand in the winter laces and bobbins and her invariable cry was oh pray dear siror dear lady as the case might bepray do assist me i have only this moment come out of the hospital and have nowhere to sleep by these means she realized her five shillings in three or four hours and hastened back to castle street to spend them with a worthless fellowher paramour another individual whom we must mention was an elderly man who in his youth had been apprenticed to a chemist he obtained his living by displaying a fearfully ulcerated arm having himself originally produced the sores by means of corrosive acids and by the juices of various plantssuch as the ranunculus acris and sceleratus the spongelaurel euphorbium arum maculatum c he regularly revived and aggravated the ulcers every time they began to heal and his arm was really shocking to contemplate he would take his stand before a window and raising his shirtsleeve display the ulcers so that the ladies or gentlemen at the casement sent him out a sixpence or a shilling as much for the purpose of getting rid of so loathsome a spectacle as through motives of charity it was this mans boast that three hours in a fashionable street or square would produce him seven or eight shillings another impostor present on this occasion was a man of about forty who was a perfect adept in disguising his person and who feigned a different malady for every change in his attire and outward appearance at one time he was suffering from ophthalmia produced by the application of irritantssuch as snuff pepper tobacco blue vitriol salt alum c at another he would actually produce blindness for a time by the application of belladonna henbane or spongelaurel and then he was led about by a little boy again he would appear as a miserable creature afflicted with a horrible jaundicethe yellow colour being produced by a dye he was also perfect in the counterfeit of spasmodic complaints paralysis and convulsions his earnings were usually considerable but on one occasion when things were very bad he obtained admission into a hospital as an epileptic patient and so well did he assume the dreadful attacks at particular intervals that he remained in the institution for several weeks lying on one of the beds in a filthy state of intoxication was a miserable object who was accustomed to go about the streets on his hands and knees holding iron grapnels his spine was bent upwardsrounded like that of a cat in a passion and his legs were moreover deformed his supine position was no counterfeit he could not walk on his feet like other human beings thus far he certainly was an object of compassion but in his character he was a worthless fellowabusive insolent drunken and addicted to thieving sitting on another bed and so far gone in liquor that he could scarcely hold the pipe he was smoking sate a man about forty years of age named barlow he had been a clergyman and was now a beggingletter impostor he possessed an excellent address and was most plausible in his speech as he was fluent with his pen but the moment he obtained any money he was never sober until it was spent he had travelled all over englandknew every noblemans or gentlemans country seatand had carried on an excellent business by means of his beggingletters a labouring man his wife and daughter were amongst this precious company the girl was about fifteen and tolerably goodlooking the family had been three days in that lodginghouse and she already laughed at the obscene jest and applauded the licentious song two or three hawkersa couple of juvenile thievesand some young girls confirmed prostitutes made up the amount of the precious company into whose presence muttonface sal had conducted old death those who were acquainted with him saluted him respectfully for he was a great mana very great manamongst persons of a particular class who is that horrible old wretch asked the labourers daughter in a whisper to jane cummins the richest fence in london returned the other in the same low tone of voice and whats a fence miss a fence you fool is a buyer of stolen goods as the beaks call it that old covey is rolling in richesshabby and mean as you see him he has been at it they tell me upwards of thirty years and has never got hisself lumbered yet but the best of it is no one knows where his stores are no one even knows where he lives he has certain houses of call but the cunningest bow street officer cant find out his

now thankee now come with me to the window and ill tell you what a happy kind of life i leadand how you may do the same if you like but even as she uttered these words jane cummins heaved a sighalthough she strove hard to subdue it the girl walked aside with her and they continued their conversation in whispers at the window im afraid our tildall get no good here said the labourer in a low tone to his wife as he glanced uneasily towards his daughter nonsense you fool returned the woman you cant get no workand we must starve if we dont do something our gal can keep us if she willand she must too sooner or later it will come to that with herand as well now as ever the poor labourer sighed he would have remained honest and kept his wife and daughter so if he could but want and houseless wanderings in the cold street stared him in the faceand he resigned himself to the bitter destiny that was thus forced upon him and his family in the mean time old death had taken a seat near the fire and was deep in a whispered conversation with muttonface sal wheres josh pedler he asked hell be in shortly was the answer hes only gone out to fetch something for his supper and so tim the snammer is lumbered said old death yes hes in clerkenwell but youll get him off when he goes up again afore the beak on saturdaywont you old chapnow wont you i dont knowi dont know he isnt one of my men he never would give me a turn his name doesnt appear against a number on my list but he will give you all his business in future if youll get him off this timejust this time said the girl coaxingly we shall see what josh has to tell mei never promise in a hurry returned old death besides its not the rule to assist a man that goes to others to do his business tim gets his notes changed at old isaacsor at milberrysor at mrs davissor at raynersor and as old death enumerated his competitors telling them off on his fingers slowly one after the other his jealousy arose to such a pitch that the workings of his countenance became absolutely frightful now whats the use of going on like this said sal i tell you that tim shant have no more to do with them people if youll only get him off this time none of them can do it as sure as you and if you only tell me it shall be done whyits as good as done at this moment the door opened and a tall rather goodlooking but rakish and shabbilydressed man of about fiveandtwenty made his appearance heres josh cried the girl the thief and old death exchanged greetings and the latter proposed to adjourn to a publichouse in the neighbourhood to talk over the business thither the two men accompanied by muttonface sal accordingly repaired and bones suffered himself to be persuaded to receive the three fivepound notes and the sovereign mentioned in the flash letter as the price of his endeavours to procure the discharge of tim the snammer the old man then took his departure and josh pedler returned with sal to the lodginghouse footnote a policeserjeant from whom we have obtained much valuable information relative to the poverty mendicity immorality and crime in london one day informed us that he knew of two sisters both single women who were confined at about the same time and who took it by turns to go out with the children they passed the babies off as twins and made upon an average seven shillings a day by this imposture the money was spent in riotous living and debauchery in the evening along with their flash men who existed in complete idleness living however far better than many a poor tradesman one evening the policeserjeant above alluded to had occasion to visit the room which the sisters occupied at one of thompsons houses in castle street a robbery having been committed in the dwelling and he found the two young women and their paramours at supper on the table were a baked shoulder of mutton and potatoes two quarts of porter and a bottle of gin one of the sisters is at the present moment a prostitute in fleet street footnote all the characters just depicted are real ones some of them are still about town footnote a notorious fence living in liquorpond street footnote a

matilda the countrygirl in the meantime jane cummins had been using all her eloquence for the purpose of inducing matilda briggs the poor labourers daughter to become as bad as herself you dont know what a pleasant life we lead she repeated when she had drawn the girl aside to the window quinmy manearns lots of moneyand we know how to spend it tonight wed a roast loin of pork and applesauce for supper at a slapup eatinghouse then wed some rumandwater and then we came home here look how quins enjoying himself with that egghot isnt he a capital fellow to be able to get so much moneyand all so easy too and dont you think im happy to have nothing to do but to help him spend it again the young woman struggled fruitlessly to keep down a sigh forin realityshe loathed she abhorred the life which she was leading and what do you suppose will become of you and your father and mother she continued whyif it wasnt for that goodnatured fellow josh pedler youd have all been turned out last night into the streets and when the woman came in just now to collect the threepences didnt he take and pay for you and the old people and didnt he give you all the grub you had today why do you speak so much about him asked the countrygirl oh i dont knowonly because he seems to have taken a fancy to you returned jane cummins and i tell you what it isyou may become his jomen if you like his what said matilda blushingfor she half understood the meaning of the word whyhis wife over the left if you choose was the answer but what a fool you are youre not so innocent as you pretend to be cometell mehave you ever had a lover never replied the girl then its high time you should the truth is josh told me to sound you she added in a mysterious manner and if you only say the word well have a wedding here tonight josh has got plenty of money at this moment he found a purse the day before yesterday where inquired the countrygirl in a gentlemans pocket at the theatre returned jane coolly and he talks of setting up a mint a mint what with asked matilda with queens metal to be sure responded the other and i think hes a very thriving young fellow youd be as happy as a princess along with himand wouldnt he come out strong tonight with the lush if you was to say yes but my fathermy mother murmured the girl hesitatingly oh leave them to me said jane cummins go and sit down againill manage the old womanand she can manage the old man herself matilda returned to her seat and quin who could pretty well guess what his mistress had been about handed the countrygirl the quartpot of eggflip she declined to partake of it but he pressed her hardand she drank a few drops oh thats nothinka mere taste cried quin take another sip come and she did as she was desired lord bless the girlshes quite afraid of it said quin but you must and shall have a good draught resistance was vain quin held the pewterpot to her lips and forced her to imbibe a considerable quantity he then passed the measure to her mother who did not require any entreaty to drink and the labourer himself was not one likely to refuse good liquor when it was offered to him quin thus got upon very pleasant terms with the poor family and making briggs sit next to him he began to chatter away in a familiar style not forgetting to hand round the quartpot at short intervals meantime jane cummins had drawn mrs briggs aside and made certain representations to herthe result of which was that matilda should that very night become the mistress of josh pedler the arrangement was however to be kept quiet until josh should return for fear that he might have altered his mind since he spoke to jane on the subject in the morning at length pedler came back accompanied by muttonface sal and as he entered the room he exclaimed well pals its all right old death has took it in handand so tim is as good as out ive ordered round a gallon of ginpunch to make merry in consequence this announcement was received with loud cheers come you here josh cried jane cummins i want to say a word to you wellwhat is it demanded the thief oh nothing bad she replied with a significant look at her paramour quin who laughed heartilyas if an excellent piece of fun were in preparation jane then whispered a few words in josh pedlers ears the man did not however wait to hear all she had to say but bursting away from her caught matilda briggs in his arms and giving her three or four hearty smacks with his lips shouted a wedding pals a wedding a wedding repeated those who were only now let into the meaning of all the mysterious whispering that had been going onfirst between jane and matildathen between jane and mrs briggsafterwards between mrs briggs and her husbandand lastly between jane and josh pedlera wedding they cried hooray yesa wedding in right good earnest exclaimed josh but wheres that drunken old file barlow hes fallen asleep on his bed observed muttonface sal then rouse himand be damned to him cried pedler sal approached the bed and speedily awoke the parson who was at first mighty wroth at what he considered to be a very great liberty but when he was informed that his services were required to perform a matrimonial ceremonythat he was to have five shillings for the joband that a gallon of ginpunch was expected immediately he uttered a tremendous oath by way of expressing his joy and leapt up with as much alacrity as the fumes of liquor which still influenced his brain would permit him to display a circle was then formed in the midst of which josh pedler matilda briggs and the beggingletterimpostor parson took their station one of the hawkers produced a common brass ring which he handed to barlow over whose person quin threw a sheet by way of surplice while another individual gave him an obscene book the greatest excitement now prevailed amongst the rogues and loose women present and even matilda herself entered into the spirit of the proceedingfor she was excited with the liquor which quin had forced upon her her poor father alone experienced a qualm of consciencebut he dared not utter a word calculated to betray his scruples or manifest his regretsfor his wife of whom he stood in dread cordially approved of the arrangement the drunken parson now commenced the ceremony and assuming as well as he could the seriousness of former days he recited the following slang chant i parish prig and bouncing ben do here within this paddingken josh pedlerif thou wilt agree cop that young shaler unto thee to her a fancy bloak be thou tip mauleysshes thy jomen now barlow made the bride and bridegroom join hands and then continued thus when thou art out upon the cross may she be faithful to thy doss if things go rough and traps are nigh may she upon the nose be fly the company then repeated in chorus the last line after which display of their vocal powers the ceremony was continued by the parson in the following words if you should pinch a lobor plan a sneezer or a randlesman or work the bulls and couters rum or go the jump and speel the drum or turn shopbouncer at a pinch should you do this and get the clinch may she while thou art lumbered be still true and faithful josh to thee the parson paused for few moments and concluded with this distich be witness all to what is said and with this fawney ye are wed barlow handed josh the ring which the thief placed on the girls finger and then gave her a hearty kiss the spectators immediately set up a shout of acclamation and at that instant the ginpunch made its appearance a scene of debaucherynoisequarrellingand ribaldry now followed the parson was voted into the chair which was constituted by the foot of one of the beds and the punch went rapidly round in pewterpots the bowl was soon emptied whereupon josh pedler sent to the publichouse and ordered another the little deformity without legs sang a filthy song even the man with the curved spine and who went about on grapnels forgot his wonted illhumour and insolence and joined in the mirth the woman who had charge of the house was summoned and for a consideration of seven shillings and sixpence she agreed to provide a separate room for the accommodation of the happy couple this amount was duly paid and the woman was made drunk into the bargain for her trouble at length some one proposed a dance to which the parson objected and moved another bowl of punch as an amendment jane cummins however put an end to the argument by undressing herself and performing sundry saltatory evolutions in a complete state of nudityan example which was very speedily followed by muttonface sal whose grief for the loss of her paramour tim the snammer was temporarily drowned in punch even the woman in widows weeds was about to adopt the same course but she was too tipsy to accomplish her purpose and on rising from her chair fell on one of the beds and into a profound sleep at the same time the noise confusion and disgusting licentiousness of the scene increased to an extraordinary degree but josh pedler led matilda awayor rather carried her for the unfortunate girl was now in a complete state of intoxication revolting as the contemplation of such a scene as that just described must be to the rightlyconstituted mind it was nevertheless requisite to introduce it into such a work as the present its details prove how necessary it is to establish in the great metropolis cheap and wellconducted lodginghouses for the use of poor but honest families this cannot be done by private speculators because an efficient management could only be secured by legislative enactment the government then should direct its attention to this very important subject a poor man is compelled to quit his native town or village in the provinces and comes to london to seek for work he is accompanied by his wife and daughter penury compels him to fix upon the cheapest lodging he can find and a cheap lodginghouse cannot be a respectable one its landlord and landlady have neither the time nor the meanseven if they possess the inclinationto discriminate between the various applicants for admissionon the contrary they are well aware that the worst characters are most likely to prove their best customers their only consideration is to make their establishment answer and so long as their lodgers pay for the accommodation they seek no questions can be asked to such a den therefore is the poor man forced to take his wife and his daughter the obscene language which falls upon this young girls earsthe fact of being compelled to lay aside her garments in the presence of several males who unconcernedly undress themselves before herthe debauchery of the daythe licentiousness of the nightto all these elements of ruin is she immediately exposed a veil drops suddenly as it were from before her eyes and she finds herself hemmed in by moral corruptionsurrounded by temptationexcited by new desiresand encouraged to go astray by her companions how can she leave that sink of impurity otherwise than impure how can she quit that abode of infamy otherwise than infamous many a highborn lady has succumbed to the seducer under circumstances less venialunder influences admitting a far less amount of extenuation were the government with the consent of the legislature to establish lodginghouses for poor but honest persons an immense benefit would be conferred upon that class and the fearful progress of immorality would receive a check at least in one point the respectability of such institutions might be ensured by placing trustworthy married couples at their head and applying a system of rules which would enforce regular hours exclude ardent spirits and only permit a moderate quantity of beer to be brought in for the use of each individual and likewise empower magistrates to punish those who might be brought before them charged with breaking the regulations or otherwise subverting the wholesome discipline enjoined thieves prostitutes and bad characters would not attempt to obtain admission to establishments if this descriptionno more than a person enjoying a competency would endeavour to become the inmate of a workhouse scenes of debauchery and unbounded license alone suit abandoned males and femalesand thus every guarantee would exist for the respectable management of those institutions which would save the honest poor from the low lodginghouses of london footnote the following is a glossary which will enable the reader to comprehend the flash terms used in the

of thieves vagrants and prostitutes he lets his beautiful hampstead villas to genteel and fashionable families we have already shown that thompson was and perhaps is still a lodginghouse proprietor in a considerable way of business a person named southgate is also eminent in the same line he possesses houses which make up altogether beds these houses are as follownos and charles street long acre seven houses on saffron hill five in mitre court st john street clerkenwell no new court cow cross smithfield and two in turnmill street clerkenwell these last are exclusively occupied by italian boys and their masters a man named elliott has also lodginghouses in charles street namely nos and in shorts gardens a person called lucky dick has nos and an officer whom mr mills examined deposed thusto return to lodginghouses there are cheap ones in all towns most of them have two sorts of kitchens the labourers and hawkers live in a better room and pay fourpence a night for their bed halfpenny for coals halfpenny for the use of plates and hot water and a halfpenny for the cooking apparatus regular beggars the low sort of cadger fellows live in the other kitchen and pay a halfpenny for coals and have nothing found them the beggars go on very bad at night in the lodginghouses they can make s a day in the country by begging let alone what they make by thieving they never think of work unless they can contrive to carry something in hopes of an opportunity to slip off with it and it is in such dens as these that honest poverty must seek shelter and a bed illustration chapter xxvi the ladysmaid in the meantime mr frank curtis had met the buxom charlotte according to appointment in conduit street the youthful ladysmaid who had not numbered quite nineteen years but who concealed a warm temperament and a disposition ripe for wanton mischief beneath a staid and serious demeanour when in the presence of her mistress or of those in whose eyes it was prudent to be looked upon as a very prudent and steady young womanthe youthful ladysmaid we say walked quietly along the street and pretended not to notice mr curtis who was leaning against a lamppost smoking a cigar but the light of the lamp fell upon her pretty countenance and he having immediately recognised her stretched out his hand and caught her by the shawl saying well missdo you mean to pretend you didnt see me lor you there now exclaimed charlotte affecting to be quite surprised at this encounter just as if you thought i shouldnt come cried frank laughing but take my arm my dear and though this very arm has often supported duchessesand marchionessesand even on one occasion the young and beautiful queen of the redskin indiansyet i dont know that it was ever more agreeably pressed than by your pretty little fingers how fine you do talk said charlotte by no means displeased with the compliment but where are you going oh ill show you my dear returned frank as he led her along and now tell mehas anything happened in respect to you know what yesa great deal answered charlotte but here i am walking with a gentleman whose very name i dont even know isnt it odd very my dear i will however soon satisfy you on that head my name is mr curtis to the worldbut frank to you and some day or another i hope to be baron dumplington but what was it that you had to tell me something about miss mordaunt replied the girl who firmly believed the dumplington story and entertained a proportionate amount of respect towards the young gentleman who was heir to so honourable and distinguished a title comeout with it my dear exclaimed frank business first and love afterwardsas my dear lamented friend the prince of cochinchina used to say when we were intimate together in paris before he hung himself for love in his garters did he though cried the ladysmaid how shocking shocking enough my dear but pray tell me what you have to say about miss mordaunt why sir resumed charlotte this evening when i was dressing her for dinner she began to sound me about how i liked my place in lady hatfields service and whether i should be glad to better myself so keeping in mind what you had told me to do i seemed to fall in to all she asked me and gave her to understand that i shouldnt object to better myself then she began to simper and smile and at last let out plump that she was going to run away with a gentlemanbut she didnt say whotomorrow night that gentleman my dear is an uncle of mine said curtis ill be bound then its the same sir christopher blunt the very same my dear but go on you speak almost as well as i did when i was in parliamentor as my uncle the earl of dumplington do i though well continued charlotte and so miss mordaunt told me how she couldnt think of travelling alone with the gentleman and that she must have a ladysmaid and you agreed to go with her cried frank i did answered charlotte and we settled and arranged every thing quite comfortable did she tell you where she is to meet my uncle tomorrow night inquired frank no but she told me to mind and be ready to leave in the evening at about seven oclock returned charlotte wellfortunately i do know where they are to meetand thats close by the turnpike at islington green said frank shes to go up in a hackneycoach and be there punctual at eight oclock and the old chap is to have the postchaise and four in readiness doesnt he already fancy himself tearing along the great north road as if the devil was after him and so nice too did he arrange his plans with his julia that theres to be a supper prepared for them at st albansand off again egad hes settled it pleasant enough but ill be even with him what do you intend to do asked charlotte curtis did not immediately reply but after a few moments consideration he abruptly exclaimed can you trust any female friend of yours in this business welli dont knowunless it is my own sister alice which is a very nice girl and will do any thing i tell her was the reply the very thing ejaculated frank is she out at service noshes at home with mother answered charlotte and will she just consent to take a short ride in a postchaise and four along with you if i give her a fivepound note demanded frank to be sure she will returned charlotte who with the quickness of female perception began to comprehend mr curtiss design then ill tell you how we must contrive it said frank its of the greatest consequence to me my dear to prevent this marriage and if i can only expose my stupid old uncle i shall fairly laugh him out of it now dont you think you could manage to pass yourself off as his julia and get your sister to play the part of yourself as far as st albans and i would be there with three or four friends of mineall jolly dogsready to receive sir christopher and you girls you might cover your face well with a thick veil and as he will be sure to hurry you into the postchaise the moment you get down from the hackneycoach just beyond the turnpike on the green you neednt speak a word then you can pretend to be so overcome with fear and anxiety oh leave all that to me exclaimed charlotte who relished the joke amazingly but what shall i do about my place at lady hatfields deuce take your place my dear cried frank ill secure beautiful lodgings for you in some nice quiet retired street at the west end and you shall be as happy as the days long well have such fun togetherand ill take you to plays and all kinds of amusements lord bless you i think no more of a cool thousand or two than i should of blowing out a chaps brains if he was to insult you oh dear me dont talk so horrid exclaimed charlotte laughing and you really will do all you sayif i help you in this business yesand much more returned frank and now the only thing to manage is to prevent miss mordaunt keeping the appointment by herself oh i have it he exclaimed after a minutes reflection i can imitate my uncles handwriting to a t he writes just as if he had a skewer instead of a penand so do i for that matter so ill just tip miss julia a note tomorrow afternoon about four as if it came from sir christopher and ill tell her in it that the elopement must be postponed until the next night egad this is a stroke of policy that beats hollow any thing my cousin the duke of dumplington ever did i thought he was your uncle sir remarked charlotte i meant my uncle love replied frank but its all the same the marquis of dumplington is my relationand thats enough and now my sweet creature that we have settled all this businesssuppose we adjourn to a nice quiet place that i know but i must see my sister tonight and tell her all that there is to be done interrupted charlotte the fact is that the pretty ladysmaid had kept the appointment given her by frank curtis with the full intention of abandoning her person to him for she was alike wanton in her passions and mercenary in her disposition and the five guineas which he had given her in the morning had stimulated her with the desire of making farther inroads upon his purse nayshe had even hoped that he would fulfil the sort of promise he had given her at their previous interview and in plain terms establish her as his mistress in a comfortable manner but the intrigue just concocted for the purpose of defeating the matrimonial design of miss mordaunt and sir christopher blunt had engendered new ideas in the breast of the ladysmaid and she resolved that her intimacy with mr curtis should progress no farther for the present the young man who at this moment cared much more for the success of his scheme against his uncle than for the attractions of miss charlotte styles willingly allowed her to repair at once to the abode of her mother for the purpose of tutoring alice how to play the part which that younger sister was to enact in the great drama planned by mr curtis charlotte accordingly separated from frank with a promise to write to him if any thing should go wrong but with an understanding on the other hand that her silence was to be construed by him into a proof that all was progressing favourably to his views chapter xxvii london on a rainy eveninga scene in a postchaise london has a strange appearance on those eveningsso peculiar to our climatewhen a cold drizzling mistlike rain is falling the lustre of the gaslights in the shops is seen dimly as if through a gauze and the lamps in the streets have an air as though they struggled to preserve themselves from total extinction clogs and pattens create a confused rattling on the pavement and to a birdseye view such crowded thoroughfares as cheapside fleet street the strand and holborn must appear to have their trottoirs arched with umbrellas then aristocracy seems to urge the horses of its carriage more quickly on as it whisks to the club the parliament or the dinnerpartythe member of the middle class buttons his taglioni or his greatcoat over his chestthe individual of a humbler sphere tries to make his scanty tweed cover as much of his person as it willand poverty wraps its rags around its shaking limbs apparently forgetful that in drawing them over one place they leave another bare in the entrances of courts and covered alleys and in deep doorways the daughters of pleasure oh the frightful misnomer collect and huddle together in their flaunting attire the pattering of the rain rendering their poor thin shoes as pulpy as brown paper and splashing over their stockingsand thus aiding ardent spirits and nights of dissipation to plant the seeds of consumption more deeply in their constitutions the drivers of cabs and omnibuses thrust their heads as far into their hatsor else push their hats as far down on their headsas possible and shrugging up their shoulders sit with rounded backs and faces bent downward on their vehicleswhile the conductors or omnibuscads in their oilskin coats seem to find consolation for the unpleasantness of the weather in the fact that they can speedily fill their vehicles without the usual exercise of the lungs or gymnastic movements of the arm and on a rainy evening such as we are attempting to describe what businesswhat bustle prevail in front of the angel inn at islington omnibus after omnibus comes up from every direction discharging and receiving their animated freight with wonderful rapidity the rednosed man at the bookingoffice seems to have something better to do than merely lounge at the threshold with his right shoulder leaning against the doorpost off which it has worn the paint in one particular spot for inquiries now multiply thickly upon him indeed we are afraid that that last share of a quartern and two outs which he took with the elephant and castle six oclock cad has somewhat obfuscated his ideas for he thrusts an elderly lady with a bandbox into a chelsea although she particularly requested to be placed in a bank omnibus and he has sent that tall lady with her three children and a baby over to kennington in spite of her thrice repeated anxiety to repair to sloane square what a paddling and stamping of feet and pattering of clogs and collision of umbrellas there are in every directionup the new road and down the city roadalong st john street and goswell street roadand also up towards the green the most addlepated writer may find some food for his pen if he only take his stand at the angel doorwith a cigar in his mouth too if he likeon a rainy evening does he wish to see how a party of pleasure may be spoiled by a change in the weather let him study that little procession of a family who have passed the day at copenhagen house and are now returning home wetcolduncomfortableand sulky the husband dragging the chaise in which two children are squallinga lubberly boy of eight or nine pushing behindand the wife with a baby on one arm and holding up her gown with the left hand paddling miserably through the rain and venting her illhumour on her husband by declaring that it was all his faultshe knew how it would beshe had begged and prayed of him to come home an hour beforebut he would stay to have that other glass of ginandwater if our moralist whom we station at the door of the angel be an admirer of pretty feet and ankles he may now gratify his taste in that respect for of a surety those who have good ones raise their dresses above the swell of the leg ah ladiesit is really too bad of youwe almost suspect that you care little for the rain since it enables you to display those attractions the policeman with his oilskin cape emerges from the publichouse close by drawing the back of his hand across his lips just for all the world as if he had been taking something short to keep the cold outand very likely he has toofor we are sure that the most rigid disciplinarian of an inspector or serjeant would not quarrel with him for so doing on such an unpleasant evening the applestall woman puts up an umbrella and maintains her seat on the low basket turned bottom upwards for she dares not absent herself from her post for fear of the hungry urchins that are prowling about within the doorway of the angel a knot of young gentlemen in peacoats and with sticks in their hands are smoking cigars they are not waiting for the omnibuses but are merely collected there because the bustle of the scene amuses them and they like to look at the gals listen a moment to their conversationthey are talking about some favourite actress at an adjacent theatreand to hear their astute observations one would think that they must at least be the dramaticcritics of the newspapers assembled there or else perhaps their discourse turns on politics and then one would be apt to imagine that they were undersecretaries of state in disguise so profound are their remarks they call the minister of the day by his surname without any titular adjunct and one of them no doubt wiser than the rest shakes his head solemnly and very kindly prophesies the said ministers approaching downfall then the conversation flies off at a tangent to some less important subject and they most probably proceed to comment upon the excellent lark they had the other night at suchandsuch a place presently one of them proposes a go of whiskey each and they accordingly adjourn to the public room of the angel where what with the goes of whiskey and the going of their tongues they create so much noise that the old gentleman at the next table flings down the last sundays paper in despair before he has read through the third murder well reader it was on such a rainy evening as this that two grand events in our history were to take placewe mean the affair of sir christopher blunt on the one hand and the project of old death to kidnap charley watts on the other it is our intention however to proceed with the former little business in this chapter at a quarter to eight oclock a postchaise and four passed through the turnpike at islington and drew up in the lower road alongside the enclosure of the green the righthand window was then lowered and a head enveloped in a fur travellingcap with lappets over the ears and tying under the chin was protruded forth this headwhich belonged to sir christopher bluntlooked anxiously up and down the thoroughfare and was then withdrawn again but the worthy knights patience was not tested to any great extent for in a few minutes after his arrival at the appointed spot and before the clock had struck eight a hackneycoach rattled up to the place where the chaise was waiting sir christopher threw open the door of the chaise kicked down the steps and leaped out with the agility of a small elephant and in a few moments he very gallantly handed two females well muffled up in cloaks boas and veils from the hackneycoach dearest julia he murmured to the taller of the two as he assisted her to ascend into the postchaise an expressive squeeze of the hand was the reply to this affectionate apostrophe on the part of the knight the shorter female whom sir christopher concluded to be his fair ones attendantinasmuch as miss mordaunt had informed him by note in the morning that she had secured a faithful maid to accompany herwas also handed into the postchaise the knight followedand the vehicle hurried away like wildfire sir christopher and the female whom he believed to be miss mordaunt sate on the back seat and the other young lady occupied the seat facing them for some time there was a dead silence inside the chaise but at the expiration of about ten minutes sir christopher began to fidget like a gentleman at a public dinner who though unaccustomed to public speaking nevertheless experiences a nervous anxiety to address the audience my dear juliaahem began the knight i hope youyou dont feel cold dear the female thus addressed threw her arms round sir christophers neck and clasped him so fondly that what with the tightness of the embrace and the contact of the fur in which she was enveloped he might have been pardoned had he fancied for a moment that he was being hugged by a bear oh dearest juliahow happy i am exclaimed sir christopher nearly suffocated by this display of fondness and you juliaare you happy my love quitetoo happy murmured his companion and yetmethinks your voice sounds strange julia said the knight whatwhat is the matter with you only this sir christopherthat i am not miss mordaunt not miss mordaunt ejaculated the knight preparing to throw down the window and order the postillions to stop nonot miss mordaunt was the answer but one who loves you as wellor betterand is i flatter myself six times as goodlooking then who are you in the name of heaven cried the knight so completely bewildered that he knew not how to act charlottefor it was shethrew back her veil and by the light of the shops which they were just passing in the outskirts sir christopher recognised lady hatfields dependant whom he had seen on two or three occasions when he had called on miss mordaunt in piccadilly and who is your companion he demanded hastily my sister aliceat your service replied charlotte but listen to me for one moment sir christopher wellfor one moment then said the knight so strangely perplexed and annoyed that he could take no decisive step miss mordaunt never loved you sir christopher continued the wily charlotte never loved me then why did she tell me so only to laugh at you it was all planned between her and your nephew mr frank curtis the devil ejaculated the knight go on they determined to make themselves merry at your expense and yourself ridiculous at the same time by heaven i will be revenged cried the hero of this pleasant adventure slapping his thigh emphatically with his open palm they accordingly hired me and my sister to personate miss mordaunt and a ladysmaid proceeded charlotte and we were to carry on the deceit till we got to st albans where mr frank curtis and a party of his friends are already waiting to receive you the villain shouted sir christopher completely deceived by this plausible tale but i always admired you sir continued charlotte and i was resolved not to be made a party to carry out the trick to the end i should have written to youor called to explain it but i feared you might not believe meand so i thought it best to let matters go as far as they have gone now just to convince you that what i say is perfectly true oh i believe it allit is too cleartoo apparent exclaimed the knight that scoundrel frankill discard himill stop his allowanceill never speak to him again to get a party of friends to meet us at st albanseh just where id sent word to have a good supper in readiness miss mordaunt told him all that sir observed charlotte who had kept one of her arms round the knights neck and had gradually approached her countenance so closely to his that her breath now fanned his cheek yesi understand it all cried sir christopher i have been grossly deceivedvilely treatedbasely served but i am not the man to put up with it at the same time miss he added in a softening tone you are a very good girl to have saved me from cutting so ridiculous a figure at st albans i have only done my duty sir murmured charlotte with a profound sigh andof course by accidenther cheek touched that of the knight a good girla very good girl repeated sir christopher as good as you are prettyfor you are prettyand ive often remarked it the arm thrown around sir christophers neck pressed him gently and i really do not know how to reward you sufficiently my dear girl he added new ideas entering his mind again the arm pressed him tenderly sir christopher could resist the exciting contiguity no longer and he fairly kissed the cheek that was so close to his lips charlotte sighed again but did not withdraw her face really this is very ridiculous exclaimed the knight here we are galloping along like lightningand without any particular object that i know of upon my word i have a great minda very great mind to revenge myself on both miss mordaunt and master frank at one and the same time in what way sir christopher asked charlotte in a languidly murmuring tone by marrying you my dear was the emphatic response oh sir christopheris it possiblesuch happiness sighed charlotte again embracing him in the most tender manner it is so possible my dear answered the knight that if you consent to have me the horses heads need not be turned back again towards london how can i refuse you dear sir christopher exclaimed charlottei who always thought what a finelookinghandsomekindgenteelfashionable man you was from the first time i ever saw you im sure i always heard sister speak in the highest terms of you sir said alice now taking up her cue well then my dearwhat is to hinder us from being happy cried sir christopher with these words he pulled down the window ordered the postillions to stop and gave them directions to change their route in such a manner as to avoid st albans the vehicle then whisked along with renewed speed and while sir christopher felt wonderfully elated at the idea of punishing his nephew and avenging himself on miss mordaunt by showing her that she was not the only female in the world to whom he was compelled to address himselfcharlotte on the other hand rejoiced at the success of a scheme which had been suggested by the part she was originally engaged to play in this pleasant drama and which as the reader will now perceive was the motive that prevented her from extending her intimacy with mr frank curtis on the previous evening chapter xxviii tom rains lodgings in locks fields nearly opposite to the house where tom rain lived in brandon street locks fields there was a boozingken well known to old death and shortly after nine oclock on the same evening which marked the events related in the preceding chapter that cunning fence accompanied by toby bunce and the lad jacob were introduced by the landlord into a front room on the firstfloor of the said flash establishment jacob was ordered to station himself at the window and watch for tom rain to take his departure on the expedition devised for him by old death while bones himself and his acolyte toby seated themselves opposite a cheerful fire to discuss hot ginandwater until the hour should arrive for putting into execution the scheme that had brought them thither although the rain was falling with a mistlike density and no gascompany had been enterprising enough to lay down pipes in such a neighbourhood as locks fieldsso that there were neither stars nor lamps to light the streetstill the eagleeyes of jacob could distinguish sufficient of the scene without to quiet any fear lest the movements of tom rain should escape him old death moreover stimulated his energies by means of a sip of hot grog and the lad remained as motionless at the window and as earnestly intent on his object as a cat watching near the hole into which a mouse has escaped well said old death as he sipped his liquor complacently i suppose we shall have no difficulty in managing this little job byandby jacob watched all day long in great ormond street until we joined him to come over here and the jewess never stirred out oncedid she jacob nonot once was the answer but you knew that she was at home yes because i saw her at the window for a moment every now and then replied the lad speaking without averting his eyes from the street good exclaimed old death it is not at all likely that she has come over to toms lodgings this evening or that she will comespecially after the long sermon she wrote bones checked himself for he was not in the habit of being communicative with toby bunce and toby on his side never sought to pry into the motives or designs of the old fence by whom he was made so complete a tool who is there in the house besides mr rainford and the boy asked toby after a pause only the old widow woman that keeps it responded mr benjamin bones there cried jacob suddenly the door opensand mr rainford comes out hes gone all right said old death i suppose hes going for his horse wherever he keeps it i could see by the light in the passage when the door was opened that he had his white coat on and his great ridingwhip in his hand remarked jacob it was a woman that held the candlebecause i could just catch a glimpse of her shadow and thats all you dont think it was the jewess asked bones i couldnt say because the shadow wasnt plain enough returned jacob but its hardly probable that she could have got over here before us even if she was coming to mr rainfords lodgings tonight well said jacob observed old death youre getting a knowing ladyou are and now you shall have a glass of grog to yourself what a whole glass ejaculated toby bunce in astonishment at this unwonted liberality on the part of old death yesa whole glassa sixpenny glass responded bones and having summoned the landlord he gave the requisite order the liquor was brought for jacobs express behoof and old death drew forth the money to pay for it but as he did so a paper with writing upon it fell upon the floor unperceived by any one save jacob the lad instantly drew a chair near the fire and as he seated himself placed his foot upon the paper which being somewhat dingy in hue he took to be a banknote the landlord withdrew and the conversation was resumed between old death and toby bunce i hope betsy will have something nice for supper when we get back again remarked the latter shes sure to do that replied old death you ought to be very fond of your wife tobyfor shes very fond of you dye think she is mr bones exclaimed bunce im sure of it doesnt she take great care of you rather too much was the reply which came from the bottom of tobys heart then perceiving that he had uttered something which seemed to imply that he had dared to form an opinion for himself he hastened to add not but what its very kind of her to keep the moneyand my watch tooand every thing else in her own care because i know im an old fool noyoure not a fool toby interrupted bones but you want looking after ah it was a blessed day for you when i recommended you to marry that virtuouswellconductedpatternwoman as one may say who is now your wife i had no interest but your goodand hers im well aware of that mr bones cried toby and youve been an excellent friend to us im sure betsy respects you as if you was her toby was about to say father but he remembered that old death did not like to be reminded of his age and so he substituted brother wellwell said bones ive no doubt of what you tell me and so long as youre happy together thats every thing toby smothered a sigh with a deep draught of ginandwaterold death poked the fire and jacob availed himself of the opportunity to stoop down and pick up the paper which he dexterously conveyed to his pocket unperceived by either of his companions but a sudden disappointment seized upon himfor he could feel that it was too stiff for a banknote and was moreover folded like a letter the time passed away and at length old death after consulting his watch declared it to be close upon eleven oclock there were no lights visible in the house opposite and it was therefore determined to commence operations without farther delay before we leave here said old death remember what you are to do jacob and you toby will put on your masks rush in shut the door and make the old widow secure then you jacob will come out and fetch me it wont do for the woman to see me at all because im so tall that if she described me to tom rain when he comes back he would know who it was directly but as theres nothing particular about either of you he cant make you out from description well take care mr bunce how the thing is managed said toby the trio then quitted the publichouse and while toby and jacob crossed to the other side of the street old death walked a little way on the coast was quite clear and a profound silence reigned throughout the neighbourhood toby bunce and the lad stopped at the door of the widows house slipped on their black masks and knocked in a few moments the door was opened by the widow herself quick as lightning the candle was knocked from her hand and the scream that halfburst from her lips was arrested by a large plaster which toby instantaneously clapped upon her mouth the poor woman fainted through excess of terror and was borne into the nearest room where jacob hastened to strike a light having succeeded thus far toby remained in charge of the landlady while jacob hastened to fetch old death in a few moments the lad returned with that individual and the frontdoor was again carefully closed the widow continued in a swoon and toby did not give himself any trouble to recover her do you remain here said old death addressing himself to his myrmidon bunce and if the woman revives and attempts to struggle or any nonsense of that kind give her a knock on the head just to quiet herbut no more all right returned toby rejoiced to find that he had only a female to deal with old death then took the light and followed by jacob cautiously ascended the stairs they entered the frontroom on the firstfloor it was a parlour very neatly furnished but no one was there the boy must be in the back chamber murmured old death and thither they proceeded having opened the door as noiselessly as possible they advanced slowly into the room but scarcely had the candle shed its light upon the bed when they beheld the boythe object of their enterprisecradled on the bare and beautifully modelled arm of a female also wrapped in slumber and whose coalblack hair spread itself over the white pillow and partially concealed her glowing bust the jewess whispered jacob in a rapid concentrated tone old death instantly shaded the light with his hand and retreated from the room followed by the lad but at that moment a loud knock at the frontdoor was heard and simultaneously a piercing shriek burst from the apartment below where toby bunce had been left in charge of the landlady old death muttered a terrible curse extinguished the light and hastened down stairs as noiselessly as possiblejacob following with equal caution the back way murmured old death but first go and help toby who is in some trouble or another with the landlady jacob darted into the frontroom and as it was quite dark he stumbled over a chair the struggle between toby and the landlady who had succeeded in getting off the plaster was now renewed and releasing her throat from the suffocating grasp which her assailant had upon it she screamed for help a second time the knocking at the frontdoor was redoubled and in a few moments a light gleamed from the head of the stairs perdition murmured old death it is the jewess then rushing into the front room he exclaimed come off this moment and he was about to beat a retreat by the back way when the housedoor was forced in with a vigorous push what the devil is doing here cried the wellknown voice of tom rain as he banged the door behind him and drew the bolt who was screaming what oh tomis that you exclaimed a melodious though excited voice on the stairs there are thievesmurderers in the house and the halfnaked lady with her coalblack hair floating around her shoulders and over her bosom suddenly appeared at the turning of the narrow staircase holding a candle the light illumed the small passage below and showed tom rain standing with his back against the frontdoor and with a pistol in each hand a third scream burst from the parlour rainford rushed in and encountering toby and jacob dragged themor rather hurled them as if they were two children in his grasp into the passage there the light revealed to him their countenancesfor their masks had been torn away in the struggle with the landlady and rainford was for a few moments so astounded at the recognition of old deaths agents or confederates that he was unable to utter a word the villainsthe murderersthe assassins cried the landlady rushing forward with her hair all in disorder her garments torn to rags and the blood streaming from her nose shall i go and fetch a constable mr rainford no i thankee returned tom leave me to manage these scoundrels here my love he continued addressing himself to the jewess who had remained halfway up the stairs give me that light and do you retire to your room i must speak to these rascals in private my good woman he added turning once more to the landlady have the kindness to go up stairs and keep my wife company and fear nothingnow that i am here the two women hastened to obey these injunctions and rainford provided with the candle made an imperative sign for toby bunce and jacob to precede him into the room from which he had dragged them a few minutes previously answer me directly said tom in a sternresolute manner as he closed the door behind him and deliberately drew forth the pistols which he had thrust into the pockets of his white greatcoat when he first entered the parlour to rescue the landladyanswer me directlyeither one of you i care not whichwhat brought you here jacob knows best mr rainford replied bunce eyeing the pistols askance noi dont said the lad in a sulky tone you are game to your employer i have no doubt jacob ejaculated rainford and now toby bunce answer for yourselfor by god ill shoot you through the head in short what brought you here at this moment there was a low knock at the roomdoor against which tom rain was leaning whos there demanded the highwayman me replied the sepulchral hollow voice of old death ah the plot thickens said tom and opening the door he gave admittance to mr benjamin bones its all a mistake tomits the wrong house exclaimed old death you dont know how annoyed i amyou dont indeed welli confess i do not said the highwayman coolly and it will take you a long time to persuade me that you are speaking the truth if it was the wrong house why didnt these people of yours tell me so when i first questioned them because i saw you would not believe me cried jacob hastily and i was so flurried by them barkers added toby pointing to the pistols im not such a fool as you take me to be observed tom rain without being able to fathom your intentions i can smell treachery as easy as i could gunpowder how did you find out that i lived here you must have had me dogged and watched old death and perhaps the very job you sent me after tonight was a mere subterfuge to get me out of the way fortunately i did not wait for the yellow chaise because i picked up something better the moment i reached blackheath and i thought i had done quite enough for one evenings workso i returned without delay lucky it was that i did so but am i to have an explanation of this affairor do you mean us to break with each other for good and all what can i saywhat can i do to prove to you that this is all a mistake cried old death sadly perplexed between the fear of complete detection and the dread of losing the valuable services of the highwayman i will tell you answered tom after a few moments consideration let these two followers of yours go their waysand you and me will have a little discourse in private a sudden misgivinga horrible suspicion flashed to the mind of old death could rainford mean to murder him why do you hesitate demanded the highwayman penetrating his thoughts do you suppose for an instant that i intend you any harm why you miserable old wretch he added with a proud contempt which rendered him strikingly handsome for the moment i would sooner blow out my own brains than defile my hands by laying them violently on such a piece of withered carrion as you areunless you give me ample cause old deaths lips quivered with rage but subduing his emotions as well as he was able he made a sign for toby bunce and jacob to depart this hint was obeyed and in a few moments bones was alone in the room with the highwayman what is it you require of me asked the old man in a tremulous voicefor there was something in rainfords tone and gesture which alarmed him i will explain myself to you said tom when we first knew each other you boasted that all your transactions were conducted with so much caution that none with whom you had dealings even knew where you lived was it not so very likelyvery likely returned old death but what of that simply that as it suited you to keep your place of abode secret from me so did i wish that my residence should remain unknown to you answered rainford now mark me mr bonesor whatever the devil your name may beyou shall have no advantage over me hitherto our compact has been fairly kept but at length i find you practising falsely towards me you need not interrupt me with vows and protestationsbecause i shall not believe you but i tell you what you will doand this night too what groaned old death you will place us on even groundyou will give me the same advantage that you have gained over me in a word you will take me straight to the place where you live and you will show me your stores where you keep all the property you receive or purchase from those who are in league with you ii have no stores said old death and as for my lodgingii have no settled place i sleep sometimes in one cribsometimes in another all lies ejaculated tom in a determined tone you have enormous dealings with all the housebreakers and thieves in london you have said as much to meand you have boasted that they are ignorant of your residence now then you have a residenceand i swear that before i am six hours older i will know so much about you that you shall never dare to practise any treachery towards me what treachery could i practise against you tom asked old death in a conciliatory tone i will tell you replied rainford you boast that for thirty years you have monopolised the business of fence to all the people worth dealing with in london and during that time you have never got into a scrape but how could you have enjoyed so wonderful a safetyso uninterrupted a security unless you now and then sacrificedyes sacrificedan accomplice or two i ejaculated old death starting in spite of himself yesyou rejoined rainford fixing his eyes sternly and searchingly on the ancient villains hideous countenance do you think that i am unacquainted with your real character do you suppose that i was at a loss to understand you even the very first moment we ever met that flippancy of mannerthat offhandednessthat reckless indifference which characterise me are a species of mask from behind which i can penetrate into the deepest recesses of the hearts of others i know you as well as you know yourselfor nearly so at all events i know enough to render me cautious and wary and by the living god you shall never have an opportunity of selling me to save yourself tommy dear tom exclaimed old death now actually frightened by the others manner and astonished at his words you cannot think of such a thing seriously so seriously do i think of it replied rainford that i will drag you into the pit if i am destined to fall so now without another word prepare to reveal to me all the mysteries in which you have for thirty years enveloped yourself and if i refuse said old death doggedly rainford deliberately cocked his pistol you have inveigled me into a snareyou have sent away those who might protect meand now you seek an excuse to murder me exclaimed old death his voice sounding like ringing metal did i not say ere now that i would not harm you unless you gave me just cause demanded rainford and think you that your refusal to comply with my present wish does not constitute such just cause you have discovered my lodging which it does not suit me to leave on that accountyou may also have found out that i am not alone here i know that a certain jewess is your mistress said old death with a savage leerfor all the vindictive passions of his nature were aroused by the conduct of the individual who dared to coerce himhim who had never been coerced before a certain jewess repeated rainford surveying old death with a singular expression of countenance yesesther de medina added bones esther de medina is as pure and innocent as the babe that is unborn cried the highwayman with impassioned emphasis then she must be your wife said old death liar thundered tom rain rushing forward and seizing the ancient villain by the throat then as if ashamed of the sudden transport of rage into which he had suffered himself to be betrayed he withdrew his hand and said in a more quiet but still determined manner mention not the name of esther de medina with disrespector i warn you that my vengeanceyes my vengeancewill be terrible and now prepare to lead me to your place of abodefor i am wearied of this long parley he again drew forth one of his pistols which he had consigned to his pocket when he rushed on the old man in the way just described youll repent this mr rainford said old death endeavouring to impress the highwayman with vague and undefined alarms illustration you see how evil your nature is since you can threaten me thus cried tom but i care little for your menaces i have but two alternatives to choose betweenone is to blow your brains out at oncethe other is to get you as much into my power as you have got me into yours either way will answer my purpose so now make up your mind which it shall be the people in locks fields wouldnt take much notice if they heard a pistol fired and theres a pretty deep ditch at the bottom of the yard behind the house old death shuddered for there was something awfully determined in the highwaymans manner welland if i take you to a certain place he said how do i know that you will not split upon me trust to me as i shall then trust to you ejaculated rainford shall we not continue to be necessary to each other and on my part i shall at least experience more confidence since i shall know that you cannot ruin me without bringing destruction on yourself be it as you say growled old death and fixing his greasy cap upon his head he prepared to depart one momentwhile i say a word up stairs said rainford and hastily quitting the room he locked the door behind him scarcely a minute elapsed ere he returnedto the great relief of the old man who had begun to entertain serious misgivings at being made a prisoner there are marks of dirty boots upon the carpet in the bedroom above said tom confronting bones and fixing upon him a searching look what were you doing there i was not there began old death quailing beneath that glance damnable liar cried rainford i have half a mindbut no he added checking himself time will show what your purpose was in invading this house and i shall know how to punish any treachery on your part and now mark me you will lead the wayand i shall follow you avoid great thoroughfares had we not better take a coach asked old death nowe will walk be it to the other end of london replied the highwayman resolutely i shall follow close behind youbeware how you attempt to address yourself to a soul whom you may meetbeware also how you trifle with me but stayi will have a guarantee for your good faith give me your pocketbook my pocketbook ejaculated old death with something approaching a shudder yesyour pocketbook replied rain i know that it contains banknotes and memoranda of value or utility to you and i will retain it in this house until we return from the expedition on which we are about to set forth comequick i have no time for idle delays my pocketbook repeated old death with increasing dismay do i not speak plain enough demanded the highwayman if i cannot make myself intelligible by words i may by deeds so permit me to help myself to the article i require it will not be the first time i shall have rifled a pocket he added with a merry laugh do you know that you are treating me in a manner that i never experienced before said old death his hideous countenance convulsed with rage i can very well believe what you state returned tom rain coolly hitherto you have had to deal with men whom you got completely into your powerwhose lives hung on a thread which you could snap without endangering yourselfwho were mere puppets in your hands and did not dare say their names were their own oh i am well aware how you have played the tyrantthe griping avaricious grinding miserthe cruel relentless despot but nownow mr bones you have another sort of person to deal witha man who will be even with you anywhere and everywhereand who will never let you gain an advantage over him without acquiring one in return who are you demanded old death in strange bewilderment that talk to me thus whythomas rainford to be sure cried the highwayman laughingyet with a certain chuckling irony that sounded ominously on the old fences ears and i need not tell you he continued after a few moments pause that i am rather a desperate character who would as soon shoot you in the open streetaye or in the midst of a crowd tooif you attempted any treachery towards me as i would ease a gentleman of his purse upon the lonely road but we are wasting time give me your pocketbook old deaths courage had gradually oozed away during this strange colloquy and he now mechanically obeyed the command so imperiously addressed to him but suddenly recollecting himself as he was about to hand the pocketbook to the highwayman he said there is one letter herejust one letterwhich i should like to keep about my own person welltake that one letter returned tom and beware how you endeavour to secrete any thing else old deaths hand trembled as he unfastened the clasp of the greasy old pocketbook and when he had opened it he sighed deeply as his eyes alighted first on a roll of banknotes then he turned the papers overone after another and clouds gathered thickly and more thickly upon his countenance this is strangevery strange he muttered as he fumbled about with the letters and memoranda what is strange demanded rainford that i cannot find the letter i want returned old death with increasing agitation surely i cannot have lost it and yeti remember nowi was referring to it this afternoonandoh yesi recollecti put it into my pocket but the search in his pockets was vain the letter was nowhere to be found cometheres enough of delay and suchlike nonsense exclaimed the highwayman snatching the pocketbook from his hand again rainford quitted the room locking the door behind him and in a couple of minutes he returned saying your pocketbook is safe where no one will meddle with it till we come back it is now past eleven let us set off comeyou go first old death led the way and tom rain followed the latter conveying some pleasant intimation as he closed the frontdoor behind him about an ounce of lead in the others back if he showed the slightest sign of treachery chapter xxix the mysteries of old deaths establishment from the back of the sessions house on clerkenwell green towards smithfield market runs a thoroughfare the upper portion of which is known by the name of turnmill street and the lower part as cowcross street numerous ragshops and marinestores here meet the eyeestablishments where the thief in a small way may obtain a ready sale for the proceeds of his roguery it is really curious to stand for a few moments and observe the miscellaneous assortment of articles crammed together in the dingy windows of these placesas if they were receptacles for all the rags that misery could spare and all the rubbish which domestic neatness throws into the street some of the old clothesshops in the thoroughfare which we are describing are strikingly characteristic of the neighbourhood for you cannot gaze a minute upon the silk handkerchiefs the bonnets the shirts the gowns the coats the trousers and the waistcoats and other articles hanging outside the windows or suspended to nails stuck into the walls without being able to form a pretty accurate computation of the proportion which has been stolen and that which has been obtained by legitimate purchase the women lounging at the doors in turnmill and cowcross streets are of dissipated dirty and loathsome appearance nor have the men any advantage over them in these respects take a duchess from the saloons of fashiona duchess in her satin or velvet with her feathers and her diamonds her refined manners her elegant demeanour her polished discourse and her civilising influenceand place her by the side of one of those degraded women in turnmill streeta woman with hoarse voice revolting manners incrusted with dirt clothed in the meanest apparel if not in absolute rags and interlarding her conversation with oaths and obscenitiesplace those two specimens of the female sex togetherand how astounding is the contrast but the duchess has no more claim to praise for the polishthe fascinationsthe exquisite refinement which characterise her than the poor woman of turnmill street deserves to be blamed for the degradation and repulsiveness in which she is steeped to the very crown of her head had the two been changed at their birth she who is now the duchess would have become the dissipated loathsome ragged wretch of turnmill street and the babe who has grown to be this ragged wretch would have sprung up into the splendid lady with the ducal coronet on her brow the rich and the highborn do not reflect upon this factthey fancy that their very aristocracy is innate as it is hereditary and that the poor are naturally degraded vicious and immoral oh the terrible errorthe fearful mistake for after all many a proud peer is in reality the son of his reputed fathers groom or footman and many a dazzling beauty owes her being to her mothers illicit amours with a butler or a page the young prince of wales if he live will doubtless become one of the most polished gentlemen in the universebut had he been stolen at his birth and brought up by poor people he would even now be running barefooted in the streetsgroping in the gutters for halfpencegnawing cabbagestalks and turnipparingsthieving pudding from cooksshops and bacon from cheesemongers windowseasing old gentlemen of their handkerchiefsand familiar with all the horrible vocabulary of the slang language no credit then to the aristocracyno blame to the poor neither can help being what they are the influences of the sphere of refinement must have a tendency to refine the miseries of the poor must produce degradation immorality and recklessness ah my lord dukehow ineffable is your contempt for yon poor trembling wretch who now stands in the dock at the old bailey before his judge your grace never did a dishonourable actionyour grace has never committed even a crime so genteel as forgery but has your grace ever known what starvation is has your grace wandered for hours like a madman through the streets of a city teeming with all the luxuries of the earth while a wife and children were weeping for bread in a cheerless garret up some filthy court noyour grace has never been placed in such a position or believe me you would probably have purloined a loaf of bread or filched a handkerchief or a purseeven as did that poor trembling wretch in the dock whose guilt has filled your grace with so much disgust and you too my lady duchesshow closely your grace wraps that elegant warm shawl around your form lest its mere hem should happen to touch the garments of that poor unfortunate girl who is passing just at the moment when your grace is stepping from the operadoor into the splendid equipage which is to whirl your grace to your palacehome oh i well understand the loathingthe disgust which the menaced contact with that wretched creature excites in the bosom of your grace butah does she deserve no pityno sympathy as well as such sovereign contemptsuch boundless aversion the entire sex is not outraged by her falland consider my lady duchesshad you been a poor mans daughter and so hemmed in by miseries of all kinds from your very birth until the age of womanhood that emancipation from such incessant privations were a very paradise even though purchased by a crimethinkest thou my lady that thy virtue would have been stronger than that of the poor wretch who seems to insult you by even breathing the same air that surrounds your aristocracy merciful heavens how unjust the upper classes are to the lower the great lord and the haughty lady blame where they should pityturn away with loathing where they should commiserateproclaim as innate wickedness that social aspect which is the inevitable result of poverty and oppressiondenounce as inveterately depraved those unhappy beings who never were taught nor had a chance to be good the infamy of the upper class towards the lower in this country is immense a landowner gives his labourer eight shillings aweek and says go and live comfortablybe neat and cleanattend divine worship on the sabbatheducate your childrenlet them read good bookskeep them tidy in their appearanceand avoid debt then when this landowner finds the family naked and starvingthe man frequenting the publichouse in despair instead of the church in holy gratitudethe wife a slattern and a gindrinkerthe children incipient prostitutes and thieveswhen he sees all this he raises his hands exclaiming oh the inveterate innate wickedness of the working classes the aristocracy and the landowners of this country are as a whole the most cruel and heartless set of legalised robbers that ever preyed upon the vitals of suffering millionsthey are now what the french aristocrats and landlords were previously to the revolution of and solemnlysolemnly do we declare our belief that the despotictyrannicalremorseless oligarchy which usurps the right of domination is hurrying the united kingdom to a similar catastrophe but to continue our narrative the mistlike rain was still falling and midnight had struck some time when old death closely followed by tom rain merged from cowcross street and stopped at the entrance to a narrow court in turnmill street casting a glance around to assure himself that rainford was at his heels old death plunged into the court and tom fancying that the ancient fence meant to elude him sprang after him and caught him by the skirt of his grey coat no noise whispered bones here we are thus speaking he opened a sidedoor in the court with a key which he took from his pocket and hurrying tom rain with him closed the door carefully again behind them the place into which the highwayman was introduced was as dark as pitch and not choosing to be led into an ambuscade rainford said one moment my worthy friend if you have no means of obtaining a light i will very soon get those means from some publichouse while he was yet speaking old death procured a light from a tinderbox and a candle which stood ready on a low shelf near the door soon diffused sufficient lustre around to enable the highwayman to observe what kind of place he had been introduced into it was a small dingylooking room without a vestige of furniture in it and having the entrance to a narrow staircase on one side and a second door facing that by which he and old death had entered on the other when a thief arrived at this place with any stolen property he pulled a wire the handle of which hung against the wall in the court a bell rang withinthe outer door opened by unseen means and the thief closed it behind him on entering the little room he then tapped at the inner or second door which we have noticed and which had a hatch in it that immediately drew up no one appearedbut the thief threw in his bundle or parcel the hatch then closed in a few momentsor according to the time required for the inspection of the goodsthe hatch was raised again but merely high enough to admit the passage of a small piece of paper whereon was marked the highest price that would be given for the articles offered for sale if the paper were immediately returned by the thief the money was thrust forth the door in the court opened again by invisible means the thief departed and the door was closed behind him if however he did not return the paper it was considered that he would not accept the amount proffered and the bundle was restored to him through the hatch thus you perceive said old death whom rainford compelled to reveal the mysterious use of the hatch in the inner door no one is seen by those who come here to dispose of their property and who manages this business for you demanded the highwayman for it is clear that you cannot be herethereand every where at one and the same time i have a faithful and trustworthy man who has been in my service for manymany years answered old death but the people who have dealings at this place must know that it is your establishment said rainford quite the contrary exclaimed bones with a grim smile this fencingcrib is called tidmarshsand none of the flash men in london know that i have the least connexion with it it takes its name from my managing man when i have business to do that i must transact in person i meet my friends at publichouses and pattercribsand my very intimate ones such as you at bunces but come up stairs old death led the way to an indifferently furnished room where a man as well stricken in years and as repulsively ugly as himself though apparently not near so tall was in bed its only me tidmarsh said old death only you growled the man sitting up in bed and staring suspiciously at rainford me and a frienda very particular friend tiddy added bones indeed its mr rainford oh thats different said tidmarsh in a more conciliatory tone your fame sir has reached me even in this crib take some rum sir and he pointed to a bottle and glasses standing on a table welli dont mind if i dojust to keep out the damp and drink your health mr tidmarsh cried rainford in his usual merry offhand strain and suiting the action to his words he took a small dram old death followed his example and mr tidmarsh suffered himself to be prevailed upon to imbibe a like quantum now go to sleep tiddy said bones in a patronising manner we shant disturb you any more mr tidmarsh gave a species of grunt by way of assent to the recommendation offered and threw himself back upon his pillow old death conducted rainford into the adjoining rooms on the same storey and then to the upper chambers but they were all quite empty their walls were black with dirtthe ceilings seemed as if they had originally been painted of a sombre huethe windowpanes were so grimed that it was evident they could admit but a feeble light even in the broad daythe floors sent up clouds of dust as the feet trod upon themand dense masses of cobwebs actually rounded off all the corners there was moreover an earthy infected smell in those rooms which would have made a weak stomach heave with nausea tom rain was quite surprised to find all the chambers empty he had expected to be introduced into warehouses teeming with the produce of threeparts of all the roguery committed in the great metropolis but not even so much as an old rag met his eyes indeed the rooms appeared as if they had not been tenanted or even scarcely entered for manymany years this may be your receptionhouse he said in a jocular manner but it certainly does not contain your stores all the goods are sent away as soon as they are received replied old death and where are they sent to demanded rain to the small dealersand some to the continent answered bones eyeing him askance well and good observed the highwayman coolly but you have not a hundred errandboys to distribute the bundles and parcels about neither are there vessels sailing for holland and france every hour in the day whatwhat do you mean tom asked old death i mean that you are trying to deceive me exclaimed the highwayman sternly but look you we are alone in this housefor i consider your old man down stairs as nobody and by god if you attempt any of your nonsense with me ill fell you with the buttend of this pistol what would you have me do said old death trembling at the determined manner in which his companion spoke i would have you show me where you keep your stores was the resolute answer and nowdelay notor it will be the worse for you old death still hesitated for a moment but seeing that rainford stamped his foot impatiently and raised his pistol in a menacing manner he disposed himself to do with a good grace what he could not avoid raising the candle high up so as to light the way thoroughly he retraced his steps down the narrow precipitous and broken staircase tom rain following close behind having reached the little room on the groundfloor and which we have already described as the place where stolen property was purchased old death opened the door containing the hatch and led rainford into a small back chamber having the air of an office its furniture consisted of a desk a high stool and one of those large oldfashioned eightday clocks which used to be seen in the kitchens of genteel houses and the wallnut cases of which were as big as coffins on the desk were writing materials and a huge ledger especially dirty as if it had been well thumbed by hands not too intimately acquainted with soap this is tidmarshs crib i suppose said rainford inquiringly old death nodded an affirmative the highwayman opened the book in which the entries of each days transactions were regularly made we shall quote a specimen of these accounts prefacing the extract with the necessary explanation that the numbers prefixed to some of the memoranda were those which tallied with the names of the thieves burglars or prostitutes entered in old deaths books as was stated on a previous occasion no two belchers a creamfancy a randlesman and a blue billy three wedgefeeders a yack and a dee s a

like a highfly redgefawney s d lunan to smash a single finnip s d quite a secret policebook this observed tom rain after he had gained an insight into its contents old death smiled grimly but do you mean to say continued rainford that these persons who are noted by means of numbersfor i can understand the meaning of all thatdo not know that this is your crib not they replied bones i tell you that they call it tidmarshs and i may add that not one out of one hundred who come here even know old tidmarsh by sight and how does he recognise these fellows who are denoted by the numbers asked tom rain old death pointed to a small hole not larger than a pea in the woodwork which separated the two rooms and this hole was covered with a little moveable piece of wood on the inner sidethat is in the office where tidmarsh was accustomed to sit things begin to grow a little plainer said rainford and now my worthy old fence to the storerooms and to your own special residence this command was significantly backed by the motion of rainfords right hand towards the pocket where he had deposited the pistol with which he had ere now menaced his companion mr benjamin bones swallowed a profound sighfor it went to his heart to think that he was compelled to yield to the coercion of one whom he had marked out for a slave but who had become a master but as he took up the candle from the desk whereon he had placed it to enable the highwayman to examine his memorandumbook a gleam of horrible satisfaction shot athwart his countenanceas if some idea of a consolatory nature had suddenly struck him tom rain whistled a tune with an air of the most perfect indifference but that abrupt change in old deaths featuresthat scintillation of delight momentary as its expression was had not escaped the notice of the highwayman the ancient fence now approached the clock which was ticking in a gloomy monotonous manner and as he laid his hand upon the key which opened the door of the case he turned sharply towards rainford saying you persist in going farther tonight yessuch is my determination answered tom old death opened the clock and touched some secret spring inside this was immediately followed by the noise of wheels accompanied by a peculiar sound as of a windlass turning rapidly and in a few moments rainford perceived that the entire clock itself was moving slowly along the wall revealing by degrees an aperture in the floor in about a minute the working of the machinery ceasedthe clockcase was once more stationaryand in the place where it first stood was an opening cut in the boards large enough to admit the passage of even a moderately stout man shall i go first asked old death with a sardonic smile which seemed to indicate his opinion that rainford would not venture to follow him but if such were really his idea he was disappointed for the highwayman said in the coolest manner possible by all means old chap and make haste about itfor the night is passing away and as yet i have seen scarcely anything old death made no answer but began to descend an iron ladder to which the aperture led and as he gradually went down the steps he held up the candle in one hand and with the other supported himself by means of a rope hung for the purpose tom rain unhesitatingly followed him and when he reached the bottom of the ladder he found himself in a long narrow vaulted passage apparently stretching far underground but to the end of which it was impossible for the eye to penetrate so feeble and flickering was the light afforded by the candle wait an instant while i close the entrance said old death it is a precaution i never neglect quite right observed tom coolly and while he affected to be leisurely whistling a tune he was in reality keeping a most careful watch upon his companions movements old death pulled a thick wire which hung down from the top of the vault and the mechanism of the clock was again set in motion until the clockcase itself had resumed its usual station over the entrance to the vaulted subterranean footnote the ensuing glossary will explain these otherwise enigmatical entries belcherclose striped handkerchief cream fancyany

lunancommon woman single finnipfivepound note chapter xxx the storerooms the reader has already seen and heard enough to be fully aware that thomas rainford was a man of undaunted courage nor did he now tremble when he found himself immured as it were in that subterranean along with a character so full of cunning and malignity as old death although completely ignorant of the dark and gloomy locality to which he had been brought and well aware that his companion was quite capable of the foulest treachery the highwayman followed the old fence with so firm a step and whistled away in a manner indicative of such utter recklessness of danger that his guide was himself astonished at so much daring but rainford was keenly observant of all the movements of his companion and resolutely as he walked he was nevertheless careful in following as precisely as possible in the steps of old death so that he might not be entrapped by any pitfall in that gloomy place on his part old death proceeded at a somewhat rapid pace shading the light with his hand so as to protect it from the strong current of air which rushed through the passage this passage or long subterranean vault was about ten feet wide and six high it was walled and arched with rough stone and paved with huge flags the masonry at the sides and overhead was green with the damp and even by the fitful light of the candle rainford could perceive that this strange place must have been in existence for manymany years here and there he observed little niches in the wall and in one there was the remnant of an image of the saviour on the cross it instantly flashed to the mind of the highwayman that this sinisterlooking subterranean had once been connected with some monastic establishment and his imagination suggested that he was probably treading on the very place where the victims of ancient popish tyranny had been confined and left to perish through famine old death and tom rain had proceeded about sixty yards as well as the latter could guess along the vaulted passage when the former suddenly stopped and the highwayman perceived that their farther progress was barred by a huge door studded with iron knobs you are now about to enter my sanctuaryas i may call it said old death turning abruptly round on rainford and again i ask you what guarantee i have that you will not betray me the same security which i have that you will not prove treacherous to me answered tom old death hesitated for a few moments as if he were about to make another observation but yielding to a second thought which most probably showed him the inutility of farther remonstrance he proceeded to unbar the massive door it opened inwards and led to a spiral flight of stone steps up which the two men mounted rainford having previously secured the door which had huge bolts on each side having ascended some forty steps old death who went first placed the candle in a niche and pushed up a trapdoor which immediately admitted a strong current of air but the precaution observed in respect to the light prevented it from being extinguished i ought to have brought a lantern with me by rights murmured old death but come along you go on first said rainford and ill take care of the candle nogive it to me replied bones hastily and he extended his hand to grasp it but rainford hit him a hard blow on the wrist with the buttend of his pistol and then seized the candle what did you do that for demanded old death savagely because i suspect you of treachery returned the highwayman in a severe tone but rememberi am well armedand at the least appearance of evil intent on your part i fire you are wrong tommy dear fellow said old death coaxingly as he still lingered at the top of the steps welli may be and i shall be glad to find that i am exclaimed tom and now lead on old death ascended the few remaining steps and rainford followed with his pistol in one hand and the candle in the other they were now in a small room furnished as a bedchamber and when old death had let down the trapdoor again he unrolled and spread a small carpet over it this is your residence said rainford inquiringly the old man nodded a grim assent and your storerooms are in this housefor i can perfectly well understand that we have come into another houseand by the direction of the subterranean i should say it must be in red lion street you know london well said old death i do replied rainford although you lived so long in the country added bones right again old fellow exclaimed tom and now for a farther insight into the mysteries of your abode with these words the highwayman approached a door on one side of the room but old death hastily advancing towards another door said this way tomthis way there is nothing in that quarterworth seeing but the ancient fence seemed agitated and this was not lost upon his companion well as you choose observed the latter resuming his careless offhand manner lead on bones had already opened the door and he now conducted the highwayman into a spacious apartment surrounded by shelves whereon were ranged an assortment of articles of the most miscellaneous description clothes and chinawarecandlesticks plated and silver all carefully wrapped up in paperpiles of silk pockethandkerchiefs and heaps of linen garmentscarpetbags and portmanteausevery species of haberdasherysilk dresses and cotton gownsvelvet pelisses and shawls of all gradations of valuemuffs tippets and boasladies shoes and gentlemens bootslookingglasses and candelabralamps and picturesteaurns and costly vasesmeerschaumpipes and dressingcasesimmense quantities of cutlerypiles of printing papersaddles and bridlesin short an infinite variety of articles to detail which would occupy whole pages your magazine is crowded old fellow said rainford who even while surveying the curious place in which he found himself did not the less keep a strict watch upon his companion are you satisfied now demanded old death not quite answered rainford you must have another room where you keep your jewellery and all those kinds of things what kind of things asked bones sharply oh things that require to be packed away with caution to be sure replied tom rain for an instant the old man cast upon him a glance of searching inquiry as if to penetrate into the most secret profundities of his soul but the highwayman affected to be very intent in his contemplation of a picture and the countenance of the fence grew more composed well said rainford after a few moments pause theres no use in delaying the matter i must and will make myself acquainted with every nook of this place old death moved towards a door facing the one by which they entered the apartment and rainford was conducted into a smaller room but fitted up with shelves like the first on those shelves were several boxes of various dimensions and numerous jewelcases wrapped up in paper watches and plate i suppose said rainford pointing to the boxes something in that way tom replied old death would you like to see any of them no thankee was the answer i am not particularly curious in that respect then as he appeared to glance casually round the room his eyes dwelt for an instant upon an iron safe let into the wall wellhave you seen enough asked old death its getting very late it must be early you mean replied the highwayman with a smile but still there is time for the business that i have in hand he added his manner suddenly changing to seriousness old death glanced towards him uneasily indeed for some time the fence had been suspecting that rainford had an ulterior object in view independent of the mere wish to become acquainted with his abode and vague alarms now filled his mind what could the highwayman mean was he other than he seemed did he intend to betray him all these ideas rushed rapidly through the imagination of the horrible old man and though he had formed a plan whereby to avenge himself on the only individual who had ever yet dared to coerce him he trembled lest he should be unable to put it into execution he knew that rainford was a man of dauntless bravery and believed him to be a desperate one and now he found himself completely in this formidable persons power not that old death lacked courage himself and he certainly was not deficient in treachery but he wanted the strengththe physical strength to maintain a deadly struggle with the highwayman if it should come to that thus was it that for the first time perhaps the hardened miscreant trembled for his life to throw open the window and call for assistance in case of danger was to invite the entrance of persons who would discover all the mysteries of his abode and death were an alternative scarcely more frightful yesthere is time enough for the business that i have on hand repeated rainford his countenance assuming so sternso determined an expression that old death trembled with a colder shudder than before what do you meanwhat is thatthat stammered old death sit downthereon that seat thundered the highwayman pointing imperiously to a chair sit down i sayor by heaven this pistol welli willi will tom said bones perceiving the deadly weapon levelled pointblank at his heart and he sank into the chair accordingly but do tell meif i have offended youif hold your tongue ejaculated rainford in so authoritative a manner that the ancient villains powers of utterance were suddenly paralysed and now mark me continued the highwayman i have a certain task to perform which nothing save a superior physical strength on your part can prevent but in the first place it is necessary that i should bind youthat i should render you incapable of molesting me old death was unable to reply but he stared with vacant terror on the individual whose proceedings were alike so mysterious and so alarming rainford took a coil of rope from a bale of goods that stood upon the table and with extraordinary rapidity proceeded to fasten old deaths arms and legs to the chair uttering terrible menaces the whole time that this operation lasted while the appalling state of the aged fences mind was indicated only by low moans and convulsive movements of uneasiness having made fast the end of the rope to the iron bars of the fireplace in such a manner that old death could not shift the chair beyond the length of the tether thus formed rainford leant himself against the table and proceeded to address his prisoner chapter xxxi another deed of infamy brought to light the scene was now a striking one in that small chamberthe shutters of which were securely closedby the light of a dimlyburning candle two men of criminal avocations but of entirely discrepant characters were seated opposite to each otherone fastened pinioned to a large armchairthe other placed in a determined attitude against the heavy oaken table fear and vague alarms rendered the always repulsive countenance of old death now truly hideous while excitement and a certain air of bold triumph invested the features of the highwayman with an expression which made him appear perfectly though sternly handsome the gleaming eyes of old death flickered in sparkles beneath his shaggy overhanging browsfor fierce ferocious malignity mingled with the terrors that oppressed himwhile rainford surveyed him with combined abhorrence and contempt thirty years and ten months have elapsed said the highwayman sternly since one benjamin bones sold his halfsister octavia to a nobleman who purchased the prize of her virtue for gold for a few moments a dead silence ensued after these words had fallen from the lips of rainford but when that interval was past a wilda savagea hyenalike howl expressive of mingled rage and astonishment burst from the lips of old death silence miscreant exclaimed the highwayman in a tone and with a manner of terrible earnestness ah i have doubtless surprised you by this announcementthis denunciation of a secret that you little deemed to be known to me my god who are youhow came you to learn that secret demanded the old fence writhing in the agony of suspense and wild excitement i will tell you who i am presently was the answer and you will also see wherefore i have compelled you to conduct me hither this night then you had another motive besides the mere wish to become acquainted with my abode said old death perceiving that he had been overreached in this respectas indeed he had for the last halfhour suspected fool ejaculated rainford contemptuously of what use was it to me to know where you lived or to visit your secret repositories of plunder unless i had some essentially important motive the fact of your having discovered my abode gave me in truth but little uneasinessfor i could have moved elsewhere in a few hours that fact however furnished me with an apparent excuse to force you to conduct me to your den for i knew that were i to acquaint you with my real object in coming here you would have risked every thing to prevent it again i say who are you demanded old death a kind of superstitious awe now taking possession of him listen to me said rainford nearly thirtyone years have elapsed since you sold your halfsister octavia manners for the gold which laid the foundation of the immense fortune you have amassed yesthis atrocious deed was perpetrated and one of englands proudest peers was the purchaser of that young creatures virtuefor she was but sixteen old man when her ruin was effected through your vile agency she was sold to the embrace of a man old enough to be her fatheraye even her grandfatherand the affection which she entertained for a deserving youth in her own sphere of life was blightedcrushed she died of a broken heartleaving behind her a male child whom you swore to protect old death seemed to recoil from this averment as from a hideous spectre suddenly starting up before him for in spite of his confirmed wickedness the present topic had awakened painful reminiscences and compunctious feelings within him yes continued rainford fixing his eyes reproachfully upon the old fence she forgave you on her deathbedforgave you the wrong that you did herforgave you because you promised to make amends for your conduct towards her by your behaviour to the babe whom she left to your charge and who can say that i did not fulfil my promise demanded old death trembling in suspense at what might be the nature of the reply which rainford would give who can say that you did not fulfil your promise repeated the highwayman in a slowdeliberatebitter tone while his eyes appeared to send daggers to the heart of the old man bound helplessly in the chair there is damning evidence against you in that respect wherehow ejaculated old death you shall soon learn replied rainford the nobleman who had purchased your halfsister provided liberally for the support of her childtheir childand gave a large sum to be used for the offspring of that sad connexion but you ii did my dutytowards the child stammered old death tillit died liar thundered rainford advancing in an appallingly menacing manner towards the helpless captive wretch you sold the child to a tribe of gipsies mercy mercy groaned old death do not kill me tomdo not hurt me i am in your powerspare me rainford had raised his pistol as if to dash the buttend against the forehead of the old man but mastering his passion he consigned the weapon to his pocketfor he was afraid to trust his hand with it while his excitement was so terrible mercy indeed exclaimed rainford in a tone of bitter hatred not unmingled with contempt what mercy did you show towards that hapless child when octavia manners was on her deathbed that nobleman to whom you sold her virtue visited herimplored her forgivenessand placed in your hands a thousand guineas to ensure a provision for the boy illustration my god ejaculated old death a terrible suspicion now flashing like lightning to his mind how can you know all thiseven ifyou yourself yesi am the son of that nobleman and your halfsister octavia cried rainford placing himself in front of old death on whom he gazed with eyes flashing fire from beneath sternly contracted brows spare mespare me murmured the wretched man hanging down his headfor the glances of his injured nephew seemed to scorch and sear his very hearts core look uplook up thundered the highwayman and meet the gaze of him whom when a child you sold to gipsiessold that you might grasp all the gold which was supplied to you for my benefit yesyou sold me to strangerseven making a profit of me by the very way in which you rid yourself of my presence in your dwelling had it not been for your treacheryyour vile avarice in this respect i might have grown up to be an honest man but nono added rainford bitterlyand a tear trembled on his eyelashhad you kept me with you i should have been worseaye a myriad myriad times worse than i even now am at the imperious command of the highwayman old death had raised his head and rainford then beheld a countenance so fearfully distorted with varied emotions that he felt he was already partially avenged in having been able to produce such a powerful effect on that agedthat inveterate sinner what do you mean to do to me tom asked the hideous old fence now more than ever trembling for his life not to harm your person replied the highwayman scornfully especially he added in a tone of bitter sarcasm as you and i can boast of kinship but i am wearied of the life i am leadingand my aim is to settle in some foreign clime where the evil reputation of my deeds in this may not follow me there are times when i abhor myselfhappy reckless and indifferent as i usually seemfor my career has been marked with many a deed at which i blushall robber plunderer that i am and this discourse which has turned upon the foul crime perpetrated against the honour and happiness of my motheroh it has reminded me of one act in my life that presses sorelygod knows how heavily upon my conscience rainford walked thrice up and down the room apparently oblivious of the presence of old death who had never before seen him exhibit so much painful emotion but regrets are uselesssave as they prepare our minds for a better course of life exclaimed rainford abruptly starting from his reverie then again confronting old death he said and now comes the moment of punishment for all your misdeeds towards me the fence groaned audibly fear not for your life continued the highwayman i am no murderermy hands were never stained with bloodneither shall they be now but in regaining that which is my ownand with interestaye compound interest tooi shall teach a heartless grasping wretch a lesson that may render him more cautious in future how he sacrifices every human tie at the shrine of avarice for even amongst such as yousuch as isuch as the veriest wretches whose villany has helped to fill these storesthe claims of kinshipthe bonds of relationship have a recognition and a name many and many a man who is noted for his misdeedsor who has even shed the blood of a fellowcreaturewould respect the vow which he pledged to rear his dead sisters child but youyou ruthlessly thrust away the helpless infantyou cast off the offspring of that connexion which your own fearful thirst for gold had brought about now then shall i punish you through the medium of that passion which prompted you to sell my mother to the nobleman and myself to the gipsy with these words rainford advanced close up to his prisoner and said in a short commanding manner the key of that safewhere is it the key repeated old death his countenance becoming ghastly white yesthe key cried the highwayman and he thrust his hands into the pockets of his captives grey coat nono you shall not have my gold howled the fence agitating convulsively on his chair keep quiet thundered rain or i shall do you a mischief yet keep quiet i sayah here is the key and now roll about and rave and foam as you willi care not villain what are you doing exclaimed old death his eyes glaring with ferocious hatewith infernal spitewith bloodthirsty malignityglaring indeed like those of a famished tiger caught in the snare of the hunter and beholding a stately deer at a little distance what are you doing you are going to rob meto plunder meafter all i have done for youall the good things i have put in your way but i will be revenged yeti will send you to the scaffoldi will wreak a terrific vengeance on your head keep off i saytouch not that safe damnation light upon youperdition seize you oh tomdear tomdont rob medont youll drive me to despairi shall die of griefand you will be my murderer tomdo listen to me ah he opens the safethe wretchthe villain thus did old death menace and praycoax and moan by turns but at last his voice swelled into a howl of fiendlike rage which rose like the wailing of a damned soul upon the silence of that early morninghour but rainford seemed indifferent alike to his earnest beseechings and his paroxysms of fury that last ferocious outburst of rage had completely exhausted the old man and gasping as if under the influence of strangulation he fell back in the seat to which he was fastened by the strong cords but his convulsive motionshis hollow flashing eyeshis parched lipsand the quivering of his hands denoted how acutelyhow keenly he felt the work of depredation that was in progress for rainford had opened the safe and was now busily engaged in examining the various drawers and also sundry pocketbooks which he found therein the former contained hoards of gold coins and the latter were filled with banknotes making an aggregate of immense value the highwayman secured about his person a sum of five thousand pounds murmuring to himself this is sufficient to enable me to become an honest man i will not leave the old villain penniless he then searched the safe for any private papers that might be deposited there and in a drawer which he had wellnigh overlooked he found a small leather case containing a roll of letters tied round with a piece of riband so faded that it was impossible to determine what its colour might have originally been a single glance at these documents awakened such emotions of mingled pleasure and pain within his breast that he determined to possess himself of them and replacing them in the leather case he secured them about his person with even more care than he had bestowed on the banknotes having thus rifled the safe of as much as he chose to take away he closed the iron door locked it and placing the key on the table said to old death i am now about to take my departure from this house is there any one living here besides yourself the fence only stared at him in a fierce and sombre manner for the brain of the old man had become a chaos of wild and terrible thoughts at the contemplation of the daring robbery which was thus practised on himthe patron of robbers indeed the incidents of this eventful night were sufficient to level the powers of a mind stronger even than that of old deathfor those incidents had followed each other in such rapid whirlwindlike succession and were all so hostile to his interests that he felt as if he were the victim of a hideous nightmare composed of all the most frightful images that the terrors of a guilty conscience can possibly conjure up during the long dark nights of winter the failure of his expedition to locks fieldsthe exposure of his treachery to tom rainthe discomfiture he had undergone in the presence of toby bunce and the lad jacobthe coercion exercised to force him to discover the secrets of his receivinghouse and the mysteries of his storerooms and dwellinghousethe discovery of his deeply injured nephew in the highwayman and the revival of the history of his villany in reference to one long since deadand lastly the robbery of his money and papersall these events occurring with such consecutive rapidity that they appeared to form but one single dreadful blow were sufficient to paralyse the energies of the old villain is there any one living in this house besides yourself repeated rainford it is for your own good that i ask for i shall leave you bound in this chairbut if you are really alone here i will hasten to drop your friend tidmarsh a hint that he may come presently and release you by which arrangement i shall get as long a start of you as i require there is no one here but myself at length replied old death aroused from his torpor by the words thus addressed to him then good bye said tom and taking up the candle he quitted the room heedless of the prisoners intercession to be released from his captivity on gaining the bedchamber situate above the spiral staircase leading to the subterranean passage the highwayman remembered two circumstances which made him pause ere he raised the trapdoor in the first place he recalled to mind the anxiety of old death to prevent him from securing the candle at the moment when they were about to emerge from the secret avenue and it struck rainford that the old man had intended to have extinguished the light as if by accidentbut whether for motives of treachery or merely to avoid the discovery of something that the fence wished to be concealed tom was at a loss to conjecture secondly rainford remembered that old death had manifested considerable uneasiness when he had approached the first of the two doors opening from that bedchamber and he now thought it probable that the fence had been desirous of extinguishing the light in order to prevent rainford from observing that there were two doors in that room at all events said tom to himself let us see where this other door leads to it was unlockedas he had expected to find it because had it been otherwise old death would not have manifested so much anxiety when he had approached it on their entrance into the bedchamber proceeding with cautionso as not to incur the risk of having his light extinguished and equally to avoid any sudden surprise in case the house might really have other occupants besides old deathrainford entered a spacious room which seemed to be fitted up as a chemical laboratory on a large oaken table were galvanic batteries and an infinite variety of electrical apparatus as well as the articles on which experiments are usually made with the subtle fluidsuch as pieces of glass amber sulphur wax silk cotton loaf sugar phials containing a variety of oils metallic oxides several common stones metallic ores the metals and semimetals c leyden jars batteries electrophori electrometers discharging rods c were also crowded together on the table in a large earthen pan under the table were the flayed carcasses of several rabbits frogs and such vermin as rats and mice all of which appeared to have been only very recently stripped of their skinsfor they emitted no putrid smell and the blood was still oozing from them on a shelf were plaster of paris casts of upwards of fifty heads of men and monkeys on the base of some of the heads there were inscriptions in black letters stating the originals from which the casts were made and with a rapid glance the highwayman read the principal ones which were these arthur thistlewood executed for high treason david hoggart executed for murder george barrington the notorious pickpocketdied henry fauntleroy executed for forgery nov john thurtell executed for murder william probert executed for horsestealing there were casts from the heads of several other celebrated criminals but we need enumerate no more intrepiddauntlessbold as tom rain was he nevertheless experienced a cold shuddering as he surveyed the objects ranged upon that long shelf for this thought forced itself upon himi wonder whether a cast of my head will ever be there in order to chase these gloomy reflections from his mind rainford turned away from the contemplation of the shelf and its sinister contents a cupboarddoor stood partially open in one corner of the room and he hastened to inspect the recess but what pen can depict his horrorwhat language can describe his astonishment when upon a shelf within that cupboard he beheld four human heads staring out at him with eyes wide open but perfectly motionless and on the pupils of which the rays of the candle flashed with extraordinary brilliancy for an instant the highwayman felt afraidin what description of place was he what meant that ghastly spectacle but conquering his terrors of which indeed in another moment he was ashamed he approached nearer and the idea struck him that he beheld admirable models in wax still the flesh was so closely resembling that of the deadthe appearance of the countenances and of the crown of the heads which were all closely shaven was so natural that he extended his hand and touched the cheek of one of those appalling objects great god it was indeed human fleshicy cold and producing a sensation which the touch of naught beside can produce in spite of himself rainford cast a shuddering glance around him then once more ashamed of his weakness he resumed his inspection of the heads they were evidently prepared for preservation for an odour of strong spices emanated from them and the eyes fitted into the sockets were of glass hence the strange brilliancy produced by the reflection of the candle the highwayman was still absorbed in the contemplation of these frightful objects when a door at the farther end of the room slowly opened and a man enveloped in a loose dressinggown and holding a lamp in his hand appeared on the threshold but the instant he beheld rainford he uttered an ejaculation of surprise and alarmhastily retreatedand barred and bolted the door behind him he had however been long enough in the room for rainford to obtain a full view of his countenance and it was with profound astonishment that the highwayman had recognised dr lascelles what he thought that respectable physician in league with old death and he stood for some moments gazing vacantly at the door by which the doctor had entered and also so abruptly disappeared again then it suddenly struck him that the physician might discover the state of bondage in which benjamin bones had been left and not only would the immediate release of the old fence follow but an active pursuit be probably instituted by both individuals after himself he accordingly determined to beat a retreat as speedily as possible not that he was afraid of encountering old death and the doctor but he knew not what principles of danger the establishment possessed and which might be turned against himself he had seen quite enough of the house in turnmill street and of that where he now was in red lion street to be well aware that they were no ordinary places of abode and he was also sufficiently well acquainted with the character of old death to feel conscious that no mercy was to be expected at his hands should he fall completely into his power it is therefore no disparagement to the heroism of the highwayman to state that he was now anxious to effect his exit from the strange place wherein he found himself and it naturally struck him that there must be a more speedy and convenient avenue of egress than the subterranean he readily comprehended that the underground passage was used as a medium of transferring goods from the house in turnmill street to the storerooms of the establishment in red lion street and that it might also serve at a pinch of need as an avenue of escape for old death from his own bedroom but that the subterranean was the only means of ingress and egress in respect to the house in red lion street tom could not for an instant suppose as a dwelling without a door or with a door that was never opened would soon become an object of suspicion in the neighbourhood judging by the direction of the subterranean passage the highwayman was enabled to conclude that the room in which he now found himself was at the back of the house and that the one where he had left old death was in the front as was also that into which dr lascelles had retreated and he was moreover convinced that these apartments were all on a first or upper storey but decidedly not on the groundfloor now as the laboratory old deaths bedchamber and the larger storeroom formed the suite at the back of the house and there was no flight of stairs connecting them with the groundfloor it was clear to rainford that the means of communication with that groundfloor must be from the front part of the house and into the rooms looking on the street he did not choose to penetrate because he might there encounter the doctor and old death he therefore came to the conclusion that he must escape by the back part of the house or else dare the subterranean all these calculations which have occupied us some time to record were made and summed up in a few moments by tom rain nor did he now hesitate what course to adopt placing the candle upon the table he hastened to throw up a window but to his annoyance he found it securely barredand his hand assured him that the bars could not be removed by mere physical strength he had not time nor implements to attempt to force a way through this difficulty and the only alternative appeared to be the subterranean resuming possession of the candle he returned into old deaths bedroomdrew away the carpetraised the trapdoorand commenced the descent of the spiral staircase closing the trap after him and bolting it inside but scarcely had he proceeded ten steps downwards when his foot suddenly slipped and in the attempt which he made to recover himself the light went out at the same instant he heard heavy steps treading upon the trapdoor overhead and then the hum of voicesbut whose he could not distinguishin the room which he had just left now tom rain look alive old fellow he murmured in selfencouraging apostrophe and with a resolute step he hastened rapidly down the spiral staircase amidst a darkness so intense that it was all but felt chapter xxxii rainford in the subterranean tom rain reached the bottom of the stairs in perfect safety and as he had carefully noted the geography of the subterranean when he traversed it an hour previously with old death he experienced but little difficulty in threading his path along it even amidst the black darkness through which he literally seemed to be pushing his way in a few minutes his progress was stopped by a wall which his extended arms encountered and he now knew that he had reached the extremity communicating with the house in turnmill street having succeeded in grasping the wire which passing through the top of the vault was connected with the mechanism of the clock overhead he pulled it vigorously but the machinery moved not then for the first time during this eventful night the highwayman became appalled at the dangers on which he had entered again he tugged at the wire it snapped short close by the roof and the long piece thus broken off fell at his feet damnation cried rainford and he stamped impatiently on the cold damp stones suddenly it struck him that there might be one wire to move the clock over the opening at the head of the iron ladder and another wire to move it away from that opening he accordingly began to feel with his hands for this second wire the existence of which was suggested by his imagination but at the end of a minute he was compelled to admit to himself that it did indeed exist only in imagination no such second wire was to be found he then hastily ascended the ladder and endeavoured to hurl the clock from off the opening which it covered but the huge machine was as solidly fixed there as if it had formed a portion of the vaulted roof itself escape seemed to grow every moment more hopeless and now came the appalling thought that old death and the doctor would soon have had sufficient time to repair from the house in red lion street to that in turnmill street and thus secure against him the avenue covered by the clockeven if it were not sufficiently secure already what was he to do again and again he tried to force away the heavy clock but there it stood immoveableand when he paused to reflect its steady monotonous ticking fell ominously upon his ears at length it struck him that he would retrace his way to the other extremityforce up the trapdoor leading to old deaths bedchamberand with a pistol in each hand dare every thing but what if that trapdoor were secured on the other side nohe remembered to have observed that there was not a bolt nor a bar to break the level of its upper surface as it fitted in flush with the floor encouraged by the scintillation of hope that thus gleamed in upon him rainford hurried back to the other end of the subterraneanascended the spiral staircasegrasped his pistolsand listened attentively all was still in the room abovenot the murmur of a voicenor the creaking of a footstep he then slowly and carefully drew back the bolt of the trapdoor and tried to raise it but it moved not he applied additional force under the impression that some heavy piece of furniture might have been dragged over the trap but still it was as motionless as the thick solid substantial flooring in which it was set rainford returned the pistols to his pockets so that nothing might impede the application of all his strength to the task on which his liberty depended but nothe door moved not the highwayman bit his under lip almost till the blood started forthfor he felt that his calmness was abandoning him then how bitterly did he repent the course which he had adopted after his interruption in the laboratory by the appearance of doctor lascelles instead of trusting himself to that hideous subterranean he should have essayed an escape by means of the front rooms of the house regrets were however uselesshe must actand not waste time in selfreproach yes he must actif he would not die in that dreadful place where the vindictiveness of old death would be sure to leave him to actoh how easy to think of actingbut how was he to put his thought into execution a stone pavement beneathstone walls on either sidea stone ceiling overheadat one end an avenue closed by a huge clockat the other a trapdoor evidently secured on the outsidethese were the obstaclesthese were the barriers against which he had to contend and what were the implements within his power his two handsa claspknifeand a pair of pistols quick as lightning the idea flashed across him that the iron ladder at the other extremity of the subterranean was moveable and that it would serve him as a batteringram rejoiced at this thought he once more retraced his way along the vaulted passage and eagerly grasped the ladder his conjecture was right it merely hooked on to two iron rings fixed into the masonry just below the aperture covered by the clock and heavy though it was yet rainford now bore it as easily as if it were of woodfor renewed hope had rendered him strong and bold as a lion it was however somewhat difficult to drag the iron ladder up the spiral staircase but in a few minutes this portion of the task was accomplished and rainford now prepared to assault the secret entrance to old deaths dwelling placing himself in such a position that he might deal a vigorous blow upwards with his ponderous engine and then be able to seize his pistols the instant they might be required he went to work with a stout arm and a still stouter heart oncetwicethriceand up swung the ladderthat single blow was sufficientand the trapdoor burst from its setting quick as thought rainford seized his pistols and thrusting up the trap ascended the last few steps of the spiral staircase throwing back the carpet which had been replaced over the trapdoor he found to his infinite surprise that there was no resistance to his egress from that subterranean where at one time it seemed probable that he was destined to find a tomb and gazing rapidly around the room he neither perceived old death nor the doctornor indeed a single living soul recovering all his wonted calmness he proceeded to examine the trapdoor for the purpose of ascertaining how it had been secured against him and on a close inspection he observed a springbolt let into the side of the trapdoor in such a way that when the trap was closed it neither appeared above nor below it this bolt was either held back within the wood or made to fly into a hole made to receive it in the beam against which the trapdoor closed by means of two screws that could easily be pressed inwards but the force of rainfords batteringram had unsettled this artfullycontrived piece of mechanism it was clear that some one had secured the trapdoor because even if the springbolt had flown into its socket by accident still the carpet could not have spread out of its own accord moreover when rainford had retreated to the subterranean he had heard footsteps and voices in old deaths room it therefore struck him that those who had so secured the trapdoor had departed to protect the avenue of escape in turnmill street in the confidence that the said trapdoor was too strong to be forced nevertheless it was necessary to guard against the possibility of an ambuscade and tom held his pistols in a manner calculated to render them instantaneously available he determined to proceed by way of the laboratory but on trying the door he found it locked without an instants hesitation he forced it open with one vigorously applied blow of his foot but here again he encountered no resistance passing through the laboratory he tried the door by which he had seen dr lascelles appear and disappear again so abruptly and this time he was spared the necessity of violent exertionfor the door was not locked he now entered a passage leading to a flight of stairs down which he hastened and reached a kind of hall from whence the streetdoor opened but he did not immediately issue forth he experienced an invincible curiosity to ascertain if old death had in reality been released from the state of bondage in which he had left him and forgetting the terrible dangers whence he had escaped with so much difficulty he reascended the staircase the appearance of this part of the house was dirty and neglected indeed it afforded no evidence that the tenement was inhabited at all but conveyed quite the contrary impression the fanlight above the frontdoor was boarded over and thus the hall itself was nearly dark the only light it enjoyed being admitted through the illclosed joints of the boarding just mentioned the paper was falling away from the walls of the staircase and dust and dirt had accumulated wherever the hand touched or the eye could penetrate on regaining the landing on the firstfloor tom rain tried a door opposite to that by which he had issued from the laboratory but it was locked he forced it open and found himself as he suspected he should in the very room where he had left old death for that apartment had two doors and to his ineffable surprise old death was still therestill sitting in the chair to which he had been fastened with a strong cordand that cord had not been removed the head of the fence was bent forward and hungor rather drooped upon his breast the highwayman was alarmed and hastened towards him but the moment he caught a glimpse of his features he started back horrorstrickenand stupefied as it were by the hideous spectacle that presented itself to his view for the old mans countenance was fearfully distorted and nearly blackthe eyes protruded from their sockets and seemed staring on vacancyand the under jaw had fallen holy god he is dead ejaculated rainford at length and ii have killed him at that instant the door leading from the inner apartment was slowly and cautiously opened and the highwayman yielding to a natural impulse turned and fled abruptly by the one communicating with the passage and which he had forced open a few moments previously this movement on his part was so sudden and so quickly executed that he did not perceive the person who was entering the room but whether that person observed him or not he was unaware descending the stairs three or four at a time the highwayman quitted the house by the front door and did not breathe freely until he had closed it behind him and found himself at length in the open street dauntlessdaring as he was the idea that he had caused though unintentionally the death of the old fence prostrated for a time the powers of a naturally vigorous mind and horror threw all his thoughts into chaotic confusion he did not even pause a moment to examine as well as the darkness of the hour would have permitted him the outward appearance of the house which he had just left but hurried away as quickly as he could go from the vicinity of a place where he had seen and undergone so much in such an incredibly short space of time for it was about one oclock when he and old death had entered the house in turnmill street and saint pauls proclaimed the hour of three as rainford crossed smithfield market chapter xxxiii mrs martha slingsby the reader who is acquainted with the west end of the great metropolis of the british empire cannot have failed to notice the air of gloomy grandeur which characterises the aristocratic mansions of old burlington street the dingy brickfrontsthe massive doors all of a sombre colourthe windows darkened by heavy hangingsand the dead silence which seems to prevail within produce upon the passerby a strange and almost melancholy effect there is nothing bustlingnothing cheerful in that street on the brightest day of summer its aspect is coldmournfulprisonlike it seems to be the last refuge of the aristocracy of the old schoolthat aristocracy which still clings to all its ancient prejudices its haughty notions its exclusive pridean aristocracy which finds its influence each day narrowing into a smaller compass in proportion as that of the masses expands around it and god grant that every thing in the shape of hereditary aristocracy may shortly expire altogethercrushed by the weight of new interests and modern civilisation in one of those gloomylooking houses of old burlington street dwelt mrs slingsbya lady of about fortytwo but who enhancing by art a natural conservation of beauty truly miraculous in a female of her age seemed at least five or six years younger her hair was very dark and as she wore the sweetest french caps that parisian fashion could suggest she was invested with that air which bewilders the common observer between its admirable coquettishness and its matronly sedateness her complexion was clear and delicate and a careful but regular use of cosmetics concealed those incipient wrinkles which appeared at the corners of the eyelids her teeth were perfect white and even and her figure though upon a large scale was maintained in fine symmetry by the skill of her dressmaker she had naturally a splendid bust and as she usually wore very high dresses she was the better enabled to maintain its appearance of youthful firmness in spite of the prominent expansion it had experienced as the lady herself increased in years mrs martha slingsby was the aunt of mr clarence villiers the lover of adelais torrens when very young she was sacrificed by her parents to a gentleman double her age and who had acquired a fortune while he lost his health in india shortly after this union circumstances compelled mr slingsby to return to calcutta and his youthful wife accompanied him there they remained about eight years at the expiration of which period mr slingsby died of a broken heart his immense wealth having been suddenly and entirely swept away by the failure of a great mercantile and banking establishment in the angloindian capital mrs slingsby however found a friend in the person of sir henry courtenaya baronet who had long held a high office in the council of india and who was about to return to england having relinquished the cares of employment in the public service he was upwards of fifty at that perioda widowerbut having a family of young children the moment that the misfortunes of mrs slingsby were reported to him by a mutual friend sir henry proposed to her that she should enter his family to supply as far as possible the attentions of the mother whom the children had lost this offer was gratefully accepted and mrs slingsby who had no offspring of her own returned to england with the baronet for some years after her arrival in london she remained in the family of sir henry courtenaywhere she appeared to be treated as a near relation and not as a dependant but when the boys and girls were old enough to be placed at school she removed to the house in old burlington street in which we now find her rumour declared that she was enabled to take so handsome an establishment in consequence of the sudden and unexpected recovery of a portion of that fortune which was supposed to have been irretrievably swallowed up in the failure of the bank at calcutta and the loss of which had broken her husbands heart at all events she paid her way regularlyand was famed for her numerous charities calumny had never assailed her for she was so regular in her religious dutiesso retired in her mode of lifeso ready to assist the deserving poorso constant in her donations to all humane and philanthropic institutionsand so zealous a patroness of missionary and bible societies that her neighbours looked upon her as a very pattern of christian virtue between herself and the courtenay family the most sincere attachment appeared to exist whenever the young gentlemen and the young ladies returned home for the holidays they invariably passed a week with her whom they almost looked upon as a mother and sir henry himself in speaking of her to his friends seemed to take a delight in eulogising the manner in which she had performed her duty towards his children the consequence was that his relations and acquaintances echoed these praises elsewhere and mrs martha slingsby was quoted at the west end as the perfect model of a good and excellent woman thus at the age of fortytwo mrs slingsby had escaped that ordeal through which so many beautiful widows are doomed to pass we mean the whisperings of calumny not a breath had ever sullied her famenot a hint had ever been dropped to her disparagement scandal seemed to avoid her threshold as an evil spirit is supposed to recoil from the vicinity of the temple of worship we must observe that sir henry courtenay was now close upon sixtythreethirteen years having elapsed since mrs slingsby had entered his family in india he was nevertheless a fine man on whose brow time seemed to sit lightly considering how great a portion of his mortal career was already run it is true that he wore false teeth and false hair but art had rendered those substitutes so natural in appearance that few suspected they were really false elegant in his mannersendowed with a mind which had treasured up the richest stores of intellectual wealthfascinating in his conversationand evincing in his attire the taste of a polished gentleman sir henry courtenay was one of the brightest stars of the fashionable worlda favourite at courtand welcome in every gay circle it was about three oclock in the afternoon of that day which followed the events related in the few preceding chapters that mrs martha slingsby was seated in her elegantly furnished drawingroom revising the list of her usual christmas donations to the humane philanthropic and religious societies adelais and rosamond torrens were seated one on each side of her and aiding their kind friend in her pious task rosamond held in her hand a memorandumbook from which she read the names of the various associations alluded tomrs slingsby had a cashbox open before herand adelais made entries according to this ladys dictation in another memorandumbook the two beautiful girls appeared to be the daughters of the elegant and handsome woman who sate between them and there was so much sweetness in the countenances of all threeso much animation and so much modestythat a painter would have been rejoiced to depict the group as charity dictating to benevolence and mercy proceed dear rosamond said mrs slingsby when adelais had finished a note in her memorandumbook the orphan childrens freeschool association madam read the young maiden thus addressed and last year you gave ten guineas this christmas i shall subscribe fifteen my loves observed mrs slingsby in a mild and silvery tone of voice there is no duty so sweetso holy as to contribute to the religious instruction of those poor creatures who are deprived of their natural protectors besides the committee have manifested the most praiseworthy readiness to attend to any suggestions which i may deem it right to offer for instance it was the custom until lately to have three multiplicationtable lessons to only one biblereading and this you must admit my loves was very indiscreeti will not use a harsher term but in consequence of my recommendation the dear children have now three biblereadings to one multiplicationtable lesson have you written down fifteen guineas my dear she inquired turning towards adelais a reply was given in the affirmative and mrs slingsby wrapped the amount up in an elegant sheet of rosecoloured paper and having noted in pencil the contents of the little packet added it to several others which were ranged before her on the table rosamond then read the next item the poor authors assistance fund and last year you gave five guineas madam and this year i shall only send two my loves said mrs slingsby authors and journalists are ruining the country both politically and morally as fast as they can they are writing for the people and against the aristocracy and this my loves is a crying abomination heaven forgive me for speaking in such harsh termsso inconsistent with pious meekness and christian forbearance but it would disturb the patience of a saint to behold the attacks made by these men upon our blessed constitutionour holy church and its most necessary union with the statethe prerogatives of our monarchthe rights of the upper classesthe privileges of wealthand all those institutions which were perfected by the wisdom of our ancestors do you understand me my loves oh quite madam answered adelais who already began to look upon liberalminded authors and journalists as a set of incarnate fiends banded against every thing worth preserving in society besides my dear girls added mrs slingsby the poor authors assistance fund does not publish a report of its proceedings nor a list of those who subscribe to it and under all circumstances i think that i should be acting more consistently with my duties as a christian and as an englishwoman devoted to the blessed institutions of her happy country to decline any donation whatever to a society encouraging infidels and republicans so you may draw a pen through the name rosamond love therenow my conscience is at rest which is the next item the distressed milliners friends society madam was the answer that is another association from which i must withdraw my patronage observed mrs slingsby her countenance losing its serene placidity in an air of severity you are too young and too pureminded to understand my motives dear girls but when i tell you that most of these distressed milliners are very naughty women you will perceive the justice of my conduct and then they endeavour to make their penury an excuse for their turpitude oh how wickedhow sinful is human nature my loves erase that name also dear rosamond and now what is the next the southsea island biblecirculating society madam and last year you gave twenty guineas that is indeed a blessed institution exclaimed mrs slingsby turning her eyes piously upward and it is to this societys rooms that we are going in the evening to hear that estimable man mr joshua sheepshanks give an account of the mission from which he has just returned i shall increase my donation by five guineas in this instance adelais accordingly wrote down thirtyfive guineas which sum was duly wrapped up in rosecoloured paper and added to the other packets rosamond then read the next item in her memorandumbook the naked savages general clothing association and last year pardon me dearest girl said mrs slingsby i cannot support that society any longer there is in its title a word most offensive to the ears of decency and i do not know how i could have ever been prevailed upon to lend it the countenance of my name and the aid of my purse besides i do not think the object of the institution is useful for in india one sees the natives of the lower orders in the country districts going about in a state bordering on nudity and one gets so accustomed to it that it produces no disagreeable effect whatever the name of the association is decidedly indelicate but there is nothing repulsive in the fact of savages going about in a state of nudity you may strike out the item rosamond love i have done so madam the next is the rosamond was interrupted by a loud knock at the frontdoor which resounded through the house in a few moments sir henry courtenay was announced chapter xxxiv the pious lady the baronet entered the room with a smiling countenance and a graceful salutation pray be seated ladies he exclaimed addressing himself to adelais and rosamond who had risen from their chairs my dear mrs slingsby i need not inquire concerning your healthfor you look quite charming this morning you know sir henry that i am not pleased by flattery said the lady in a reproachful tone a thousand pardons my dear madam returned the baronet but you must remember that we have now been acquainted for some yearsthat our friendship is not only of yesterdays dateand that if i venture on a little freedom with you it is as a brother might address himself to a sister for whom he has the highest esteem yes ladies he added turning towards adelais and rosamond this excellent womanthis almost angel as i may denominate herwas a mother to my children and that is a circumstance which i can never forget you attach more importance than is necessary sir henry to the mere performance of a duty observed mrs slingsby in a calm and modest manner adelais and rosamond exchanged glances which seemed to say admirable woman we already love her as much as if she were our maternal parent but i am afraid that i am interrupting an occupation of more value than my idle chitchat can possibly prove to be exclaimed sir henry who surveyed rosamond with an illconcealed admiration some useful or pious labour was engaging you young ladies no doubtfor in the society of mrs slingsby not a moment is likely to be passed without producing a benefit to at least some section of the great human family the anniversary of that holy day on which the saviour of mankind suffered on the cross is approaching sir henry observed mrs slingsby in a tone and manner suiting the solemnity of her remark and you know that i am in the habit of forwarding my mite at this season of the year to those humane religious or philanthropic institutions which deserve support i never forget any of those pious duties which you have taken upon yourself my dear madam said the baronet and indeed the object of my present visit isbut the act of charity of which i am desirous to make you the instrument he added glancing towards the young ladies involves details of so painful a nature that i understand you sir henry interrupted mrs slingsby and this consideration for the feelings of those who are not accustomed to look upon the dark side of the worlds picture is worthy of your generous disposition adelais my loverosamond dearestpray retire for a short period illustration this request was conveyed in a manner so affectionate and with such witching softness that the maidens to whom it was addressed could not help embracing their kind friend ere they left the room the moment the door had closed behind them sir henry drew his chair close to that of mrs slingsby and placing his arm round her waist imprinted a kiss of burning desire upon her lips martha you are really surprisingly beautiful today he whispered in her ear do you think so henry she murmured her eyes lighting up with the excitement of that contiguity and yet i have fancied that your behaviour has been somewhat cold towards me of late do not entertain such a suspicion my dearest creature exclaimed the baronet plunging his hand into the bosom of this pious ladys dress had either of us a right to complain i think it would be myself for oh do not reproach me henry she murmured abandoning herself to his lustful toyings but ever since the difficulty i experienced in producing that last miscarriage i have been so frightened lest nonsense martha do not alarm yourself without a cause interrupted the baronet even if it did come to that the matter could be easily arranged a few weeks retirement into the country on some charitable missionha ha true said the frail fair one but the chances of detectionoh i shudder when i think of it consider how admirably we have hitherto managed and how completely the world is deceived in regard to us added the baronet laughing there is nothing like a religious demeanour to throw dust in peoples eyes were a syllable of scandal breathed against you you have the patrons of all those humbugging societies to defend you but what are you going to do with yourself this evening can you not devote a few hours to me i wish i could henry returned the lady but it is impossible a dreadful bore named sheepshanks is going to entertain the devout with his nonsense and it would seem so oddso very odd if i were not present it is now upwards of three weeks since we slept together said the baronet in a tone of reproach yesbut you know that i cannot pretend too often to pass the entire night by the sickbed of some poor woman returned mrs slingsby and now dearest henry i have a favour to ask of you name it said the baronet in a low murmurfor his passions were furiously excited by his voluptuous toyings with his mistress you must write me a check for a thousand pounds replied the lady winding her arms round his neck and then literally glueing her lips to his oh you are becoming very extravagant martha said the baronet but i suppose i must yield you are a dear generous fellow murmured the lady as she suffered herself to be led to the sofa a quarter of an hour afterwards mrs slingsby rang the bell and a sleek comfortablelooking footman answered the summons the lady was then sitting in her usual quiet placid manner in a chair near the table and the baronet was placed at a respectful distance from her bring up luncheon james said mrs slingsby sir henry you will take a glass of champagne i know you are somewhat partial to it but a decanter of water for me james yes madamand the domestic withdrew in a short time he returned bearing a tray which he placed on the table and then retired again having paid their respects to the cold viands placed before them the lady and gentleman did honour to the champagne both drinking out of the same glass the servant having only brought up one of the description suited to that particular wine when the collation was ended mrs slingsby drank a tumbler of water to take away the smell of the champagne from her mouth but she did not appear to relish the limpid beverage quite so well as the rich juice of epernay the baronet then wrote the lady a cheque on his banker for a thousand pounds and having made a certain little appointment with her for a particular evening in the ensuing week and at a place of rendezvous as convenient as it was safe he took his departure immediately after sir henry had left the abode of mrs slingsby that ladys housekeeper sought the presence of her mistress and was forthwith admitted to the private interview which she desired what is it magdalen inquired mrs slingsby when the housekeeper stood in her presence im sorry maam to have any thing unpleasant for such ears as yours was the answer but i am convinced that sculliongirl is in the familyway magdalen ejaculated the pious lady horrified at the mere idea oh do not utter any thing so uncharitable i am sure of it maam i repeat persisted the housekeeper in fact ive had my suspicions about it for a longlong time and now im certain magdalen said mrs slingsby in a tone of profound solemnity this is a dreadful occurrence to take place in a house which i may safely assert has never yet been tainted with the breath of scandalat least so long as i have occupied it are you sure that your conjecture is right i would take my salvation oath that it is maam responded the housekeeper that expression on your part is incorrect magdalen observed mrs slingsby in a tone of mild reproach but i of course believe all you tell me relative to that miserabledegraded girl let her be sent from the house this minute magdalenthis very minute pay her any wages that may be due to her and inform her that her box shall be sent after her to her parents with a note acquainting them of the reason for her abrupt discharge she has no parents maamshe is an orphan but she has friends no doubt said mrs slingsby inquiringly no maam i took her from the workhouse on the recommendation of ladya friend of yours maamwho visits them kind of places on a sunday distributing hymnbooks disagreeable as the duty is it must nevertheless be performed magdalen and that duty so incumbent upon us is to turn the lost girl into the street pay her the wages she has nothing to receive maam i advanced her money to buy herself decent clothes then let her go away without any moneysince she has none to receive interrupted mrs slingsby to give her a single shilling were to encourage her in that shameless career of profligacy whereon she has already so far entered your orders shall be obeyed maam replied magdalen and she withdrew to execute themfor she had a spite against the poor scullerygirl who had been intriguing with one of this overparticular housekeepers own lovers shortly after this little occurrence which we have just related mr clarence villiers made his appearance in old burlington street he found his aunt alone in the drawingroom and the moment he had paid his respects to her he inquired for his muchbeloved adelais and her sister they are safe and well clarence answered mrs slingsby but before i summon them it will be necessary that we should have a little conversation relative to the proper and prudent course now to be adopted sit down clarence and grant me your attention the young man obeyed and prepared to listen with all the patience he could call to his aid for much as he respected and really loved his auntwhom he looked upon as a pattern of moral excellence and virtuehe nevertheless experienced the anxiety of a lover to find himself in the presence of adelais i shall not detain you long clarence resumed mrs slingsby and it is for your good that i am about to speak in the first place i feel it due to myself to explain to you that in receiving those young ladies into my house the other eveningand at so late an houri was influenced solely by that affection which i entertain towards you and by my conviction of your thorough integrity of purpose the mere fact of my bringing those almost friendless girls to seek an asylum with you dear aunt said clarence must prove to you how careful i was of their reputation and it was to assist your upright views that i received them without a moments hesitation added mrs slingsby you know that if i had the means you should long ago have been put in possession of a sufficient fortune to have enabled you to compete with mr francis curtis in bidding with the mercenary mr torrens for his daughter butalthough my income is sufficient for my wants and thank heaven for a few little purposes of charity my dear aunt interrupted villiers wherefore renew an explanation so unnecessary because i would not have you suppose clarence that i would for an instant sanction any underhand proceedings in respect to your union with miss torrens had it been possible to have ensured that aim by means of her fathers consent but continued mrs slingsby i conceive that there are so many extenuating features in the case that i cannot regret having granted an asylum to that dear girl and her sister and in thus securing them alike from the perils of london and from the pursuit of their father your kindness towards them will render their hearts as grateful as mine is exclaimed the young man warmly during the few days that my house has become their home continued mrs slingsby they have endeared themselves to me by their affectionate dispositionstheir tranquil habitstheir readiness to pleaseand a thousand amiable qualities and thereforefor their own sakes as well as yoursi am ready to do all in my power to serve them but should mr torrens happen to discover their abode conceive the scandal that would be createdthe observations that would be excited my dear aunt i would not for worlds compromise you in any way ejaculated clarence but still do not fear that i am anxious to rid myself of their charming company added mrs slingsby i am only desirous that you yourself should adopt due caution so as to avoid being followed hither by any one who might be employed by mr torrens to watch you no imprudence on my part shall mar the success of my plans returned clarence the banns have been published at st georges once alreadyand next sunday will be the second time it is scarcely probable that mr torrens will become aware of this circumstance and he certainly would not without any previous hint conjecture that the preliminaries for our union had been adopted in so fashionable a church as that in hanover square added clarence with a smile let two more sundays pass without the abode of my adelais being discovered and she will then become indissolubly mine have you seen any more of your kind friend who so generously took your part the other evening inquired mrs slingsby after a pause captain sparks exclaimed clarence not since i met him as i before informed you at a tavern in the strand avoid taverns my dear nephew interrupted mrs slingsby a cloud overspreading her countenance forby all i have ever heard or read concerning themthey are fearful sinks of iniquity oh not the respectable taverns aunt replied villiers i had purchased a very handsome pair of pistols to present to the captain as a token of my esteem and then i recollected that i was totally unacquainted with his address i flew to the great armyagents at charing cross but there was no such name as captain sparks in the list welli thought he might be in the navy and off i went to the admiralty but no captain sparks i therefore considered it fortunate when i accidentally met him in a tavern which i entered to procure some refreshment he positively refused to accept the pistolsdeclaring that he had done nothing more than i should have done for him under similar circumstances but i thought there was something singular in the merry laugh which burst from his lips when i proffered the case containing the pistols however he is an excellenthearted fellowand i shall always hold myself his debtor we walked together on that occasion as far as my own lodgings in bridge street and he entertained me with a perfect fund of anecdote all the time indeed i am as much pleased with him as i feel myself under an obligation to him gratitude is a rare virtue in this world remarked mrs slingsby who seldom lost an opportunity of letting drop a moral maxim and now she continued with a smile having taxed your patience to such an extent i must give you the wellmerited reward my kind and generous friend sir henry courtenay has advanced me a certain sum of money one half of which i require for charitable purposes of my own but the other i place at your disposal to enable you to hire and furnish a suitable dwelling to receive your bride take this cheque and tomorrow you can bring me my moiety oh my dear aunt have you borrowed of your friends to assist me exclaimed clarence overwhelmed by so much apparent generosity not entirely to assist you my dear nephew was the calm reply but partly as you perceive for myself howeversay no more about the trifle which i present to you and reward me by making a good use of it clarence embraced his relative adelais and rosamond were then summoned and the lovers were soon happy in each others society we must now afford the reader some explanation relative to mrs slingsbys behaviour towards her nephew and in so doing we shall throw additional light upon the character of this lady she was of a craftycalculating disposition and seldom performed any act however trivial without a selfish motive the fact was that she had a very difficult part to play devoured with raging desires she was compelled to adopt a calm modest and reserved exterior and to conceal her debauchery beneath the cloak of religion sir henry courtenay was necessary to her in more ways than one necessary as a loverand necessary as a treasurer for she was totally dependent upon him in a pecuniary sense the report relative to the recovery of a portion of her late husbands fortune was a mere fabrication to account for her comfortable mode of life still she considered her position to be so dangerous that she was compelled to fortify it by all possible means she really loved her nephewfor it often occurs that women of her description are capable of a strong attachment of this naturebut even had she entertained no regard for him at all she would have pretended to do sobecause he was necessary to her he was a means by which she could constantly trumpet forth her charitable deeds while she herself appeared unconscious that they ever transpired taking good care that he should know all she did in the cause of religion or humanity she led him to believe in a great many things which she did not do and the consequence was that clarence was never wearied of repeating wherever he went those praises which he conscientiously considered to be his aunts due now when a near relation corroborates the statements made by friends those statements receive a weight which places them beyond the pale of disbelief thus the world read mrs slingsbys character as clarence himself read it and reported it and with such an amount of testimony in her favour she could defy scandal even the most maliciouslyinclined dared not venture a shake of the head nor a shrug of the shoulder for surely her own nephew must know whether she were as good as she was represented relations seldom praise each other behind their backs and when a dashing young fellow like clarence was so enthusiastic in praise of his aunt it was that he was thoroughly convinced of the sterling merit of her character such would have been the arguments opposed to any detractive observations that scandal might dare to let drop concerning mrs slingsby the lady finding her nephew so necessary to her interests naturally sought not only to maintain the most complete deception relative to herself in his mind but also to attach him towards her by substantial acts of kindness thus she had readily consented to receive adelais and rosamond into her house to oblige clarence and she now with the same interested motive made him a handsome pecuniary present she let him know that she had been compelled to borrow the money in advance of her imaginary income to enhance the value of the gift and also that the natural impression should arise in his mindexcellent aunt she embarrasses herself to benefit me the reader now fully understands how complete a mistress of duplicityhypocrisyand deceit was the widow of old burlington street beneath that calm and placid demeanourunder that veil of sanctityraged the most ardent lusts and agitated the most selfish feelings she was a livingwalkingbreathing lie her existence was one immense falsehood and yet so well did she maintain the semblance of even the sternest virtue that her real character was known only to two personssir henry courtenay and another whom it is not at present necessary to name chapter xxxv mr sheepshanks in a large room on a firstfloor in st martins lane some three or four hundred persons male and female were assembled at one end of the apartment was a raised platform in the middle of which stood a capacious armchair behind a desk and on the said platform several sleek oily comfortablelooking gentlemen all dressed in black and wearing white cravats with no shirtcollars were grouped together in conversation the body of the room was occupied by chairs for the accommodation of those who had frontseat tickets and forms for those who possessed backseat tickets it is a remarkable fact that the votaries of the established church invariably create social distinctions in the very places instituted to propagate or maintain their creed thus every church belonging to the establishment has its pews for the rich and its pauperseats and in the assemblyrooms of the religious associations the same distinction is drawn between aristocracy and democracy and these lines of demarcation are traced by men practisingor rather pretending to practisea religion which proclaims that all are equal in the eyes of god oh the vile hypocrisy of these canting psalmsingers the room to which we have introduced our readers was well lighted with waxcandles and had two cheerful fires blazing away in the grates the atmosphere was warmthere were no unpleasant draughtsand the floor was covered with a thick druggetfor your religious people are mightily fond of comfort and comfort was certainly studied at the offices of the south sea islands biblecirculating society in the second row of the frontseat ticket department sate mrs slingsby and the misses torrens the two latter had their veils carefully drawn over their faces for mrs slingsby had insisted upon their accompanying her to this pious and soulrefreshing entertainment as they had not previously stirred out of doors from the moment they had taken up their abode with her at a quarterpast six oclock two ushers bearing white wands passed up the room preceding a short stout brandyfaced gentleman who tried to look as demure and humble as he could but who could not however subdue that consciousness of importance which seems to say ah now i am causing a sensation and a sensation too he produced sure enough for the gentlemen began clapping their hands and stamping on the floor while the ladies waved their handkerchiefs as if he were some victorious general who had just defeated a french army of a hundred thousand men upon reaching the platform the brandyfaced gentleman shook hands with the sleek and oily individuals before alluded to and the sensation became more exciting on the part of the spectators as if it were a very clever thing indeed to shake hands in public then the brandyfaced man stepped a few paces back and pretended to enter into very earnest conversation with some leading member of the committee while another member moved in a drawling singsong tone that their respected president mr jonathan pugwash do take the chair this proposal was received with renewed applause and the brandyfaced gentleman for he it was who delighted in the euphonious name of pugwash started as if quite astonished that such an honour should have been destined for him he then proceeded to establish himself in the large armchair before mentioned and in a voice which sounded as if he were talking inside a barrel called upon their respected friend the reverend malachi sawkins to open the meeting with prayer mr sawkinsa very demurelooking man indeedproceeded to drawl out a long extempore prayer in the course of which he led his audience to infer that heaven favoured that particular society more than all others and when he had concluded the chairman rose to explain the object of the extraordinary assembly that evening although the said object was already well known to every individual presentaye and to every soul who passing up or down st martins lane might choose to stop and peruse the enormous bills placarded at the entrance mr jonathan pugwash commenced by expressing his thanks for the high honour done him by selecting him to preside over that meetingan honour the more distinguished inasmuch as it had been perfectly unexpected on his part this was completely false it having been settled in committee three days previously that he was to preside on this occasion but your zealots do not mind a white lie at times he was well aware of his own unworthiness cries of no no yeshe was an unworthy vesselbut he hoped the lord would sustain him in the onerous duty thrust upon him amen in a hollow sepulchral tone from the rev malachi sawkins he thanked the ladies and gentlemenor he should rather say his christian sisters and brethren present for the kindthe handsomethe feeling manner in which they had contradicted his expressed belief of his own unworthiness cheers and go it pugwash from a drunken gentleman in a remote corner of the room he need scarcely inform the highly respectable and influential meeting then and there assembled that the object of such assembly on that occasion was to hear certain accounts of the progress of the good cause from the lips of a revered brother cheers who had just returned renewed cheers from a long more cheeringarduous prolonged cheeringand most perilous vociferous cheeringmission to the islands of the south seas tremendous cheering mingled with bravo from the drunken gentleman in the remote corner he need scarcely say that he alluded to their dearveneratedrespectedhighlyprizedgiftedtalentedpersevering friend mr sheepshanks cheers with these few observations he would introduce mr sheepshanks to the meeting prolonged cheering the chairman sate down in an awful state of perspiration but in another moment he rose again for a little door at the back of the platform had just been opened by one of the ushersand behold joshua sheepshanks appeared before the enraptured spectators it would be impossible to describe the enthusiasm which now prevailed in the room the cheering was tremendousthe waving of the ladies handkerchiefs created a perfect gale of chill airand the drunken gentleman in the corner shouted so vociferously that one old lady who sate near him would certainly have fainted as she subsequently observed if another old lady next to her had not happened by the merest accident in the whole world to have a small flask of cognac in her muff and most charitably to place the said flask at her disposal mr sheepshanks was a tall thin sallowfaced man with black hair combed sleekly over his forehead and sharp piercing grey eyes which seldom settled anywherebut when they did it happened singularly enough that they were sure to fix themselves on the prettiest faces in the room order being restored mr sheepshanks rose to address the audience having expressed his gratitude for the truly christian reception he had received he entered upon the subject so dear to all who had the good cause at heart he stated that in the year the committee of the society had determined to send a missionary to some of the south sea islands to pave the way for the effectual carrying out of the objects of the association a sum of five hundred pounds was voted for the purpose and he mr sheepshanks had offered himself as a willing sacrifice to the good cause although as he perfectly well knew at the risk of being roasted and eaten by the savages amongst whom he was to venture understanding that a french ship was to sail for the south seas from cherbourg on an exploring expedition he had repaired to that port and had taken a passage in the vessel alluded to in due time and after experiencing tremendous weather the ship touched at the cape of good hope and thence proceeded towards the southern islands it was on the th of march continued mr sheepshanks that we anchored off the beautiful island of squizzleokoo and i fell on my knees on the deck to return thanks to that providence which had at length brought me within sight of the scene of my labours a refreshing influence came over me and my heart leapt like a porpoise on the wide waters at the cheering thought that i was about to render myself useful amongst the benighted savages so near at hand a boat was lowered and the captain the third mate the purser and myself were rowed ashore i was provided with my bible the captain and the mate took with them quantities of lookingglasses buttons and toys and the ungodly purser armed himself with a bottle of rum an awful groan burst from the rev mr sawkins whereat mr pugwash who had fallen asleep woke up yesdear christian friends exclaimed mr sheepshanks a bottle of rum and no fool he cried the drunken gentleman in the corner order order vociferated mr pugwash rubbing his eyes at this crisis a gentleman of foreign appearance welldressed and adorned with a pair of very fierce moustachios advanced from the body of the room towards the platform but at every three steps he took he paused for a few moments to examine mr sheepshanks with strict scrutiny by the aid of an eyeglass at first he seemed uncertain relative to some idea which had entered his head but the nearer he approached the platform and the more closely he examined mr sheepshanks the fainter became his doubts and the stronger his suspicions at lastjust as the missionary was about to resume the history of his adventures in respect to the island of squizzleokoothe foreign stranger leaped upon the platform confronted the pious gentleman and said in an ironical tone how you do monsieur shipshang me vare much delight to see you dis vonce again mr sheepshanks seemed confounded at the sudden apparition of the foreign gentleman but speedily recovering his selfpossession he said really sir you have the advantage of me but if you will step into the private officebehind therefor a short time i oh yesyou really have de advantage on me monsieur shipshang interrupted the foreigner but you no get it again do you see how do madame shipshang and de little shipshang as was born at my house this gentleman sir said the reverend mr sawkins addressing the foreigner in a tone of awful solemnity and pointing towards mr sheepshanks is not married and has no children his life is devoted to celibacy and good works good works ejaculated the frenchman den vot for he come and swindle me oh groaned the reverend mr sawkins holding up his hands in horror at the supposed baseness of the imputation against the most savoury vessel of the whole society oh reverberated in a long echoing groan throughout the room for as the reader may suppose this strange scene had excited a powerful sensation amongst all present ah it all vare well exclaimed the frenchman indignant at the awful groaning with which his words were received but let dis fellow shipshang look me in de face and call in a constable roared mr pugwash the chairman give the frenchman fair play cried several voices dat is all me do ask of de british public said the frenchman but while he turned to address those words to the audience mr sheepshanks disappeared with remarkable abruptness by the private door at the back of the platform wheres our reverend brother demanded mr pugwash looking anxiously around i am afraid he must be taken ill returned mr sawkins i will go and see and this reverend gentleman followed the pious missionary the frenchman then proceeded to acquaint the audience that he kept an hotel at cherbourg where mr sheepshanks arrived at the beginning of the year that the reverend gentleman continued to reside with him for upwards of ten months spending money as profusely as if he possessed the purse of fortunatus that at the expiration of that period mr sheepshanks departed but returned at the end of a month accompanied by a lady whom he represented to be his wife and who presented him with a pledge of her affection some eleven months afterwards that mr sheepshanks and the lady with the child continued to honour the hotel with their presence until the middle of the year when they suddenly evaporated leaving behind them a heavy bill unpaid and a portmanteau full of stones and straw that business had brought the frenchman to london and curiosity had induced him to enter that assembly upon reading the placard wherein the euphonious name of sheepshanks prominently figured at the door this narrative produced as may be supposed an extraordinary sensation amongst the saints gathered together on this occasion and no wonder was it then all a fabrication relative to mr sheepshanks visit to the south sea islands had he never proceeded farther than cherbourg were the funds of the society lavished in riotous living and on a mistress was it the better to carry out the deception that he had pretended to sail in a french ship instead of an english one was he in a word an unmitigated impostor and were all the members of the society his dupes these opinions seemed to be confirmed when the reverend mr sawkins came back with the astounding intelligence that mr sheepshanks was nowhere to be found in any part of the societys offices mrs slingsby was overwhelmed with grief and her two fair companions with astonishment and as they rode home in a hackneycoach the pious widow never ceased from dilating on the tremendous injury which the good cause would receive from the exposure of the flagrant turpitude of mr sheepshanks chapter xxxvi the baronet and his mistress on the following dayat about twelve oclock and somewhat to the surprise of mrs slingsby who did not expect to see him so soon againsir henry courtenay paid the lady a visit she happened to be alone when he was announced and there was a constraintamounting almost to an embarrassmentin his manner which she immediately perceived and which alarmed her has any thing happened henry she inquired anxiously as he took a seat at some distance from her nothing marthanothing answered the baronet but i wish to have some very particular conversation with you i am all attention she said her suspense increasing now do not be frightened exclaimed sir henry nothing has happened to annoy either you or me but what i am about to propose to you is rather of an embarrassing natureand then pray be quick and let me know what brings you hither this morning said the lady somewhat impatiently have patience cried the baronet the fact is i have taken a fancy in a certain quarterand though i have striven hard to wrestle against it it is every hour growing more powerful than my opposition what do you mean what can you mean asked the widow completely bewildered why do you receive into your house two young ladies of a beauty so ravishing henry is it possible exclaimed mrs slingsby a light suddenly breaking in upon her mind it is very possible that i should feel an unconquerablean invincible passion for rosamond torrens added the baronet growing bolder now that the ice was fairly broken and you tell me this to my face murmured the widow in a hollow tone while her countenance became purple with a rage which she dared not suffer to explode it is expressly to you that i am compelled to make the avowal was the deliberate reply since it is at your hands that i expect assistance at my hands almost shrieked the widow beware how you alarm the house said the baronet you will do much better to listen to me attentively proceed gasped mrs slingsby you are well aware that there are certain natures which cannot master their inclinations however strenuously they may endeavour to do so resumed sir henry courtenay drawing his chair closer to that on which his mistress was seated you yourself are of such a dispositionand i am not less so it would have been impossible for you to remain chaste your passions are of that ardour which must be gratifiedor they would consume you wherefore this strange expatiation upon my failings inquired the widow bitterly simply to prove an extenuation for myself was the response i have seen rosamond but three times and have not spoken a dozen words to her and yet i am maddened with desiredevoured with cravings which the possession of her can alone assuage i again assure you that i have essayed to conquer these feelings for my sakefor hersbut principally for yoursand all in vain i do not love you the lessi shall not neglect you on her account and as a woman of the world he added fixing his eyes in a penetrating manner upon her countenance as if to read the impression his words made on her mindas a woman of the world i repeat you cannot imagine that it is possible for me always to remain faithful to you at least you are candid with me observed the widow her tone expressing bitter irony that is the great merit of my present avowal said the baronet calmly but how foolish you are to manifest so much annoyance you are well aware that i cannot subdue my feelings nor control my passions more than yourself and it will be better for you to assist me assist you in debauching that young girlthe sister of her whom my nephew is to marry ejaculated mrs slingsby listen martha exclaimed sir henry i have formed this sudden capriceor whimor whatever you may choose to term it and i will spare no money and no trouble to accomplish my purpose a man with twenty thousand ayear can afford a trifle to gratify his wishes in this or any other respect but the idea is perfectly insane cried the widow even if i were to consent to aid you in your purpose the result must inevitably involve a fearful exposure not at all replied the baronet the means are easy and can be rendered perfectly secure i gave you a thousand pounds yesterdaythe largest sum you have ever yet had from me at one time and i will present you with a cheque for two thousand more the day that rosamond becomes mine you would not marry her exclaimed mrs slingsby in a tone of unconcealed alarm yesrather than not possess her replied the baronet oh this is truly absurd said the widow what so powerful an attachment towards a young girl whom you have only seen three times strange as it may appear it is nevertheless a fact cried sir henry but there is a wide difference between the feelings i entertain towards you and her you are necessary to me to a certain extentbecause you are an agreeable companion as well as a desirable woman she is a mere childbut a very beautiful one and moreover the sudden fancy i have taken for her is so strong that i cannot resist it you see that my resolution is fixed with or without your aid i prosecute my purpose if you are really so determined i am said the baronet then i must assist you in this dangerousdifficult proceeding added mrs slingsby somewhat consoled by the idea of the two thousand pounds that were to find their way into her purse as the price of her services but when i reflect on the matter i behold a thousand perils from which i recoil were an exposure to take place the entire fabric ofof hypocrisy suggested the baronet you and i need not mince words together wellhypocrisy continued the lady would be thrown downand i should stand revealed to the world in the most dreadful colours then the real nature of our connexion would be instantly perceived but all these terrible evils are to be avoided by prudence interrupted the baronet i am not more anxious for exposure than yourself nor should i wish to compromise you our amour has existed for yearsand the world suspects it not even in the most distant mannerwe will contrive to retain the veil over it until the end then how do you wish me to proceed inquired the widow with a cold shudder as she thought of the perils attending the undertaking by operating on the mindby modelling the imagination of that young girl to suit my purpose answered sir henry with a woman of the world like you this is an easy task insinuate certain notions into her bosominflame herexcite her this is more difficult than you imagine interrupted mrs slingsby because she and her sister are constantly together devise a means to employ adelais in one room for two or three hours at a time while you have rosamond with you in another said sir henry if you enter on the task with a good will you will find it easy enough but in ten days adelais will become the wife of clarence and the sisters accompanied by him will repair to torrens cottage to throw themselves at the feet of the incensed father rosamond will then quit my house altogether ten days are sufficient to imbue her now innocent mind with such new sensationssuch voluptuous thoughtssuch eager desires that her surrender will be easy and certain persisted the atrocious villain who thus calmly reasoned on the means of undermining so much virtue i do not think so observed mrs slingsby if i proceed too rapidly i shall alarm her instead of inflaming her imagination besides you judge the world by what you yourself are and by what you know of me but frail and guilty as i am henry she added in an impressive tone believe me when i declare my conviction that more virtue is to be found in woman than you would be inclined to suspect sir henry laughed heartily at this observation then rising from his seat he took up his hat saying at all events dearest martha act so that i may present you with the cheque as soon as possible he kissed her and departed from the house chuckling at the success of his endeavour to make his mistress the instrument of his diabolical design against the purethe beautifulthe unsuspecting rosamond chapter xxxvii tom rain and jacob it was saturday evening and rainford was proceeding up grays inn lane wrapped in his white great coat and with a woollen comforter reaching up almost to his nose when he suddenly felt some one pull him by the sleeve he turned round and by the light of a lamp beheld the lad jacob well you young rascal exclaimed tombut with an anger more affected than real for he was not a man to cherish vindictive feelings towards an enemy so utterly unworthy his resentment as that pale weak and sickly boy i wonder you have the face to accost me after joining in that abominable scheme to intrude upon the privacy of my dwelling three or four nights ago i hope you will forgive me mr rainford said the lad for you must know added he emphatically it wasnt altogether my fault i was bound to obey the man who gave me food but do you know sir what has become of him oh mr rainfordi am well aware that he did deserve punishment at your hands butpray forgive mei hope you hope that i did not kill him said the highwayman in a deep hollowtoned voice whydo you suppose that i am a likely person to commit murderintentionally oh nono replied the boy and yet and yet what asked rainford and yet it is so strange that he should never have been seen at any of his usual haunts added jacob come along with me said rainford abruptly we cannot stand talking in the streetand i want to have some conversation with you but do you know any place close at handany publichouse i meanwhere we could have a private room for an hour or so yes sir replied jacob after a moments reflection this way he turned abruptly down into a narrow dark dirty thoroughfare called baldwins gardens and conducted the highwayman into a low publichouse where upon inquiry they were immediately accommodated with a private room on the second floor rainford ordered the fire to be lighted and a bottle of wine to be brought up and when these instructions were complied with he renewed the conversation with jacob and so nothing has been heard of old death he said in as tranquil a manner as he could assume nothing replied jacob a man named josh pedler called at bunces this morning early and wanted to see mr bones on account of a thief known as tim the snammer who was to go up before the magistrate today and it appears that mr bones had promised to get him off pedler was in a dreadful way when he heard that we hadnt seen any thing of the old man for two or three days and he swore that it was all a hoax and that bones wanted to stick to the money that had been paid him and shirk the job then comes a girl about an hour afterwards and she said she was tim the snammers wifemuttonfaced sal they call herand a deuce of a rumpus she made also do you know a person called tidmarsh demanded rainford after a few moments reflectionfor he was anxious to learn if the boy were acquainted with the establishments in turnmill and red lion streets i know him by name very welland thats all replied jacob he is a fence and lives somewhere in clerkenwell but pray tell me mr rainford if you know what has become of the old man i can tell you nothing about him my boy said the highwayman surely he was not so very kind to you he kind oh nofar from that cried jacob in a tone of evident sincerity but i was so dependant on him thatunless i turn thief againas i once was he stopped short and burst into tears my poor lad said tom rain affected by this ebullition of grief on the part of the wretched boy if you are afraid of wanting bread you may banish those alarmsat least for the present and he threw a handful of sovereigns upon the table are these for me cried jacob scarcely able to believe his eyes yesevery one of them answered the highwayman but on this conditionthat you tell me how old death discovered my late abode in locks fields and what was his object in entering it along with you and that sneaking fellow toby bunce i will tell you alleverything i know mr rainford exclaimed jacob but he added slowly you will find that i do not deserve this kindness at your hands i can scarcely blame you for obeying the person on whom you were dependant said the highwayman comegather up the money and make haste with your information as jacob secured the gold about his person his dark eyes were lighted up and his cheeks were flushed with a glow of animation i can tell you much more than you suppose mr rainford he resumed in a few moments and if i begin at the proper place what i have to say will go farther back than the affair the other night in locks fields then begin with the beginning jacob said tom lighting a cigar theredrink another glass of wine and now fire away but mind and tell me nothing save the truth for i shall soon see if you are deceiving me i wont deceive you mr rainford cried the boy and will soon convince you that i am in earnest besides it is my interest to make a friend of youeven if it wasnt my inclination and now to begin you remember the morning you was had up at bow street wellold death had told me to watch you when you came out of tullocksto dog you aboutto find out where you lived and any thing else i could glean concerning you what was that for demanded tom he did not tell me then answered jacob but i have ascertained sinceand you will be able to guess by and bye well i did follow you that morningi saw you nabbed by dykes the runnerand i went up to bunces to tell old death what had happened then he cut off to watkins and bertinshaw who came and bailed you i was ordered to watch about the policecourt and see where you went to and i followed you to pall mallthen i dogged you back againand when the jewesss case was over i lost sight of you somehow or another illustration and you duly made your report to old death said tom inquiringly of course replied jacob two or three days afterwards i was set to watch you again when you left bunces one afternoon and i followed you down to an eatinghouse in the strand you stayed there about two hours and at length you came out with a tall handsome young gentleman ah i recollect cried the highwayman it was clarence villiers but go on my boy i only mention all these little things to convince you that i am telling the exact truth said jacob wellfrom the strand i followed you and the gentleman as far as bridge street blackfriars where you parted i dogged you mr rainford over to the elephant and castle tavern where you met a lady and the little boy yescharley watts ejaculated the highwayman gradually becoming more interested in jacob smiths narrative because each successive step thereof afforded fresh evidence of its truth you joined the lady and the little boy continued jacob and when you all stopped for a short time at the window of a jewellers shop the lady lifted up her veiland i knew her again ah cried tom with a sudden start yes siri recognised miss esther de medinabut are you angry sir have i said anything to offend you nono jacob returned the highwayman the cloud which had gathered upon his countenance suddenly disappearing go on my boy then i saw you take the lady and the little boy into the shop and you bought a pair of earrings which you gave to the lady and as you came out again i heard you say to her this present is a kind of recompense for the diamonds which i made you give upor something to the same meaning yesi remember that i did make use of those or similar words cried rainford but how the deuce did it happen that i never once caught a glimpse of you oh siri acted with so much caution replied the lad and then you did not suspect that you was watched true said tom thoughtfully and of course you reported all this to old death i followed you on to locks fields and then returned to seven dials where i told mr bones and mrs bunce all i had seen and heard and what did they say tell me every thing jacob exclaimed the highwayman they seemed very much surprised to think that you and miss esther were intimate together jacob suddenly pausedfor again did a dark cloud overspread tom rains countenance go on jacob he said observing that the lad was alarmed i am subject to a sudden painbut it is nothing at all go on i say you were telling me that old death and that disgusting woman mrs bunce were very much astonished at a certain circumstance welland what did they say they asked me whether either you sir or the lady took any little thingwhen the jewellers back was turned replied jacob timidly but i assured them that you did not a scornful smile curled the highwaymans lips and then he puffed away violently at his cigarapparently wrapped in deep reflection shall i tell you any more sir asked jacob when a few minutes of profound silence had elapsed yes my boy go on cried tom turning towards him again the very next night resumed jacob mr bones and me were walking down southampton row russell square you knowwhen i observed miss esther de medina in a shop where there was a postoffice ejaculated the highwayman hastily just so sir and she was reading a letter continued jacob then me and old death followed her down to another postofficeit was in holbornwhere she posted a letter which she had with her i crept close up to her and saw the address on it just before she dropped it into the box and what was that address demanded rainford t r no brandon street locks fields was the answer and you of course told that to old death yesand he desired me to follow the lady to see where she lived which i did and traced her to great ormond street then i went back to bunces and acquainted mr bones with this fact also he was very much pleased and soon afterwards you came in he then told you about going to shooters hill to stop a tradesman and his wife but i afterwards found out that it was only a gag to get you out of the way next night ah i thought as much cried rainford and now i suppose we come to the visit which mr bones toby bunce and yourself paid to my lodgings exactly so said jacob early the next morning i was ordered by old death to post myself all day long in great ormond street and see that miss esther didnt go out i kept watch and saw her several times at the window just for a moment so i knew she was at home in the evening old death and mr bunce came and fetched me and we went over to a publichouse opposite your lodgings in brandon street on the way i learnt what they meant to do for it was to carry off the boy poor little charley watts ejaculated rainford totally unprepared for this announcement but what harm had he done to them or what could they want with him i dont exactly know sir replied jacob indeed i dont think toby bunce knew himself but i cant help thinking that it was somehow or another connected with a certain letter which old death let fall and which i picked up and kept it bears the signature of sarah watts the poor woman who died at bunces house cried the highwayman where is that letter here sir answered jacob and with these words he produced the document from his pocket and handed it to tom rain the highwayman hastened to peruse it with the greatest interest and attention but he was evidently disappointed when he perceived that it afforded no clue to the person to whom it was originally intended to be sent i shall keep this letter jacob he said after some minutes of profound reflection do so mr rainford returned the lad and now you see that i am acting sincerely with you quite remarked the highwayman in an absent manner for he suddenly remembered the circumstance of old death declaring that he had lost a particular letter on the memorable night which was marked with so many strange occurrences yes jacob he continued after a long pause you are right it must have been in connexion with this letter that the old man wanted to carry off the boy perhaps he had discovered some clue to unravel the mystery of charleys birth and meant to turn the secret to his own advantage but if so he must have had some better trace than this letter which certainly says a great deal and yet leaves the one grand pointwho charleys mother really isin complete darkness however added tom who had been musing aloud rather than addressing his remarks to jacob time will perhaps clear up all you see sir continued jacob i was set to watch in great ormond street to find out whether miss esther went over to you to me ejaculated rainford as if taken by surprise butgo on my boygo on and as i knew that she was at home when old death and toby bunce came to join me there pursued the lad we of course thought it was all right you may therefore judge how old death and me were surprised when we went up into the bedroom at your lodgings enough of that jacob cried rainford starting uneasily and now tell me why old death seemed so anxious all along to find out every thing he could about me lord sir cant you guess exclaimed the boy he knew that you could be useful to him and he wanted to get you completely into his power by knowing all that concerned you he i understand jacob again interrupted the highwayman and it is just as i suspected you are a good lad for telling me all thisand i will not leave you to wantin case he added hastily your old master should not happen to turn up again but i do not think i shall stay many days in london jacob however i will see you again shortlyand we will have a talk together about what is best to be done for you one word by the byedo you know how this letter which you gave me happened to fall into old deaths hands not all sirunless mrs bunce found it about the poor woman who died the other night at her house that is what i suspect observed rainford indeed it must have been so the deceitful womanafter my paying her so handsomely to keep back the document but it has found its way to my pocket at last in spite of her and old death and now jacob tell me about yourself how long have you been in the service of mr benjamin bones i wish you had time sir said the boy to listen to my story it would be a relief to me to tell itfor i already feel towards you as i never felt to any one before indeed i was sorry to be employed against you in any way but i couldnt help myself i remember the evening that i watched you over to locks fieldsi was so movedi hardly can describe howat seeing that little boy charley with you for i thought how good you were towards him and what an excellent heart you must haveand when i got back to bunces i couldnt pluck up courage to tell old death any thing about you for fear he might mean you some injury however added jacob wiping his eyes he did get it all out of me at last never mind my lad interrupted rainford moved by jacobs contrition all you have told me this evening has fully atoned for the mischief you previously did me besides as i before said you were forced to obey your master and now he added after referring to his handsome gold repeater i dont mind if i sit another hour with you here and while i smoke my cigar you shall tell me the history of your life i will sir exclaimed the boy eagerly but i warn you beforehand it is a long onethat is if i tell it as i should like to do tell it in your own way my boy cried rainford and never mind the length the highwayman settled himself in a comfortable manner in his chair and jacob proceeded to relate the history of his life chapter xxxviii the history of jacob smith my earliest recollections are associated with the occupation of playing all day long in the streets in company with other infants this was in upper whitecross street st lukes where i and those other children lived with a woman who pretended to keep a boardingschool at which she received children to live with her altogether for one shilling and eightpence aweek each but she used to turn us all out early in the morning with a piece of hard mouldy bread to nibble for our breakfast and fetch us home again when it grew dusk in the evening she would then give us each another piece of bread for supper and we went to bed but what a bed a few old sacks thrown over a heap of straw in a little room about six feet long by four and a half in width served upwards of a dozen children as a sleepingroom there we used to cry ourselves to rest famished with insufficiency of foodand awake again in the morning to undergo fresh privations i said there were about twelve of us under the care of this mother maggsas she was called they chiefly belonged to very poor parents who were engaged all day long at work and were therefore glad to get rid of their children who would otherwise only be an encumbrance to them some few were however the illegitimate offspring of poor servantgirls in place but nearly all had parents who came to see them from time to time and perhaps gave them a few pence i was not however so fortunate as the rest for no one ever came to see meat least that i was aware ofuntil i was about nine years old and i heard that the twentypence aweek allowed for my board and lodging was left regularly for mother maggs at the neighbouring chandlers shop every saturday morning mother maggs seemed to think that i had really no friendsfor though she bullied us all pretty well she bullied me ten thousand times more than the rest the habit of turning a dozen little children some of whom were only just able to walk into the street in the way i have described was not likely to be always unattended with disagreeable consequences sometimes a child was run over and either severely wounded or killed in the latter case no coroners inquest ever sate on the body the exposure of mother maggss neglect towards us would have drawn the attention of the parochial authorities towards her but when a death happened in that way the old woman used to put the body into a sack and carry it some distance into the country where she would sink it in a pond or ditch often however the corpse of a dead child has been allowed to remain in our room till it was quite putrid mother maggs not having time or inclination to remove it before and on those occasions we who were alive in that room were so frightened to be with the dead body in the dark that we shrieked and screamed till the noise reached the old womans ears in the publichouse next door and so savage was she at being disturbed in her gin and her gossip that she has half murdered us by way of making us hold our tongues sometimes a child was lost and if the parents on being informed of it expressed regret or anger mother maggs would take some trouble to find it again if not she did not put herself out of the way respecting the matter in addition to her boardinghouse for children she let out lodgings to persons of either sex and as she was not particular so long as she got paid her house was nothing more or less than a common brothel she was always saying she had no time to do any thing which ought to be done and if being all day in the publichouse was a necessary duty she certainly had no time for other purposes though not often tipsy she was never actually soberbut in a constant state of muzziness liquor did not improve her temper on the contrary it made her irritablesometimes ferocious and i have seen her fight with other women until her face was covered with long seams made by the fingernails and pouring with blood you cannot suppose that all these things which i have just told you or that i am going to tell you directly in connexion with mother maggss establishment were noticed or understood by me when i was quite a child there but you must remember that i stayed at that den until i was nine and in the course of those years all i saw made a deep impression on my mind and what was then dark and unintelligible to me has since been made clear and plain by experience and by reflection on those scenes and circumstances you will wonder how my wretched companions and myself managed to live since we only had a piece of bread each night and morning we kept body and soul together in a variety of ways chiefly feeding like swine upon all the offal and remnants of vegetables cooked or raw that we found in the street there was a dustbin in the court where mother maggss house was in whitecross street and every day just upon one oclock we used to crowd round it waiting till the neighbours came to empty their potatopeelings or the refuse of their meals into that general receptacle then we would greedily appropriate to our use the scraps which not even the very poorest of the poor chose to eat the potatopeelings most poor families skin their potatoes after they are boiled were quite a dainty to us the heads and bones of fish and suchlike refuse were also welcome to our empty stomachs then we were accustomed to go prowling about the street to snatch a slice of raw bacon or a bit of cheese from the board in front of a buttershop or steal a turnip or a carrot from an old womans stall or else lay unlawful hands upon the horses flesh in the catsmeat shops this last article of food was much fancied by us it was comparatively easy to steal and when we did get such a prize as a large lump of carrion with a stick thrust through it we felt as happy for the time being as if we had found a treasure then we used to conceal ourselves in some dark court and take a bite roundeach in his turnuntil it was all gone i am afraid i disgust you with these details but you desired me to tell my story in my own wayand i want you to understand the dreadful mode of life which thousands of poor children lead in the wealthiest city in the world i am sure when i have thought of it all since and when i see little boys and girls paddling in that neglected manner about the streets my blood runs cold at the idea that while some human beings are riding in their carriages and living in palaces others are prowling in the low neighbourhoods happy if they can steal a lump of putrid carrion you may next ask what we did for clothesit being very clear that mother maggs could not supply us with wearing apparel out of twentypence aweek wellthe fact is we scarcely had any clothes on at all as for a cap or shoes and stockings i declare solemnly i never wore any one of those articles from the earliest period of my recollection until i was nine years old a little ragged frock and that was all yes that was allsummer or winter but where did even the ragged frock come from i really hardly know i am at a loss to say exactly how we did get even that one garment each sometimes a child would be taken away by its parents who might perhaps bring it some decent clothing then the castoff rags in this case would fall to the lot of the most ragged of those who were left behind now and then a slopseller in the neighbourhood would give one of us some old frock which was useless to himself and occasionally we would steal one when we could you may ask me why we did not steal shoes also so we did if an opportunity served but then we could do without shoes and the eldest of the lot of us was on those occasions commissioned to sell the plunder at a ragshop to afford means to buy a little better food than usually fell in our way these occurrences were however rareso rare that they constituted perfect holidays in the hideous monotony of our famished livesfor the shopkeepers in poor neighbourhoods are constantly on the alert to watch the movements of the juvenile prowlers the ages of the children under the care of mother maggs averaged from three to ten and the eldest of course bullied the youngest while mrs maggs bullied us all misery did not make us little ones friendly together on the contrary we fought quarrelled and illtreated each other as much as we could i must relate to you one anecdotealthough i now shudder when i think of it and have often since shed tears of repentance there was one boy named tib tucker about eight years old who used to behave in a more merciless manner towards me than the rest did he would take away my bread from me whenever he caught me eating it apart and alone and he laid to me many thefts on mother maggss cupboard which he himself committed these false reports got me many and many a good beating from the enraged hag and in a word this boys tyranny became so insufferable that i was resolved to adopt some desperate measure to put an end to it i was then but little more than six years old a fiendish instinct of revenge however urged me to act i secreted a pin about my rags and one day when tib tucker was trying to take away the morsel of mouldy bread which mother maggs had just given me i suddenly thrust the pin into his right eye he screamed in dreadful agony and brought down mother maggs into the court i had not run awayterror or rather horror at what i had done nailed me to the spot the bullys tale was soon told i expected to be half murdered by the dreadful woman but to my surprise she suddenly took my partdeclared that i had shown a proper spiritand consoled tib tucker with the assurance that if he would only permit me to operate on the other eye in the same manner he would prove a perfect fortune to his parents theres nothing like a blind child to draw alms she said but one eyes no goodyou should be blind of bothi remember her words as well as if they had only been uttered yesterday and the more so as they seemed to be propheticas i shall explain presently the terrible vengeance which i had taken upon my persecutor who lost his eye in consequence not only awed him in future but made me feared by all the rest and my existence grew somewhat less wretchedat least in reference to the treatment i experienced from my companions mother maggs also seemed to change towards mewhether through fear or admiration at what she termed my spirit i cannot say i was less bullied by herbut not a whit better fed about six weeks after the incident which i have related the parents of tib tucker returned to london from the country where they had been harvesting they passed the evening with mother maggs and great quantities of gin were sent for from the publichouse this i afterwards learnt from my companions for as to myself i kept out of the way through fear of being punished by the boys parents for the vengeance which i had wreaked upon him when it was quite dark i returned to the house and stole up to the miserable garret where my companions were already huddled together on the straw and old sacks tib tucker was amongst them for i heard him talking about a promise his parents had made to take him with them into the country where they were going again in a few days one of the eldest girlsfor i forgot to say mother maggss juvenile boarders were of both sexesasked him what his parents had said about the accident he replied that they had laughed at it and had declared that they would turn it to some good account scarcely had he thus spoken when the door opened and mother maggs appeared with a candle in her hand ordering tib tucker to get up and follow her she added that his father and mother had a little treat in store for him and had meant him all along to sit up to supper tib was overjoyed at these news and made haste to accompany mother maggs to a lower room where she had left his parents and we in our miserable dark garret envied the boy who had a good supper in view i rememberoh well do i remember how i cried that night to think that no friends ever came to see me and that indeed i was ignorant whether my parents were alive or not i had often asked mother maggs whether she knew my father and mother but i invariably received a cuff by way of replyand therefore at length grew tired of putting the question there were however times when my wretchedforlornabandoned condition almost broke my heart for young as i was i knew that there were boys and girls in the world much better off than myself while tib tucker was absent the other children began to discourse amongst themselves saying how lucky he was to come in for a good supper and then they set to work to guess what the meal was likely to consist of but all on a sudden a dreadful shriek echoed through the house and startled us in our miserable garret there we laycrouching and huddling nearer to each other holding our breath not daring to utter a word and filled with vague alarms as if some dreadful danger hung over us at length sleep came to my relief when i awoke in the morning and ran down into the court the first object that met my view was the wretched boy tib tucker being led away by his parentsfor he was now blind of both eyes i was so frightened that i ran into the street where i wandered about all dayforgetting even the pangs of hunger i had suddenly conceived such a dreadful terror of mother maggs that i had not dared to present myself at her roomdoor to obtain my usual morsel of bread along with the rest it was a very rainy day and yet i remember that i roved and roved about the whole neighbourhood at one time crying bitterlyat another stupified though still moving about like a sleepwalker when the evening came on i was so tired and hungry that i was forced to retrace my way to the horrible den which i only discovered again with the greatest difficulty mother maggs did not take any notice of my absence from the morning distribution of bread but gave me my evening ration along with the rest and once more did i return to the straw and filth of the close garret months and years passedand i reached the age of nine the last few months opened my eyes to more wickedness than i had as yet known or dreamt of i just now told you that mrs maggss juvenile boarders consisted of boys and girls and i believe you understood that we all huddled together in the same garret it was a regular pigsty in which we wallowed like swine and like that of brutes also was the conduct of the eldest boys and girls if the other rooms in the house were used as a brothel by grownup persons no stew could be more atrocious than our garret the girls were more precocious than the boys and the latter were corrupted by the former mere children of nine and ten practised the vices of their elders but my god let me draw a veil over this dreadful scene oh siri have seen muchgone through much but the mere thought of the horrible licentiousnessthe beastlinessthe monstrous depravity that took place there even now makes my blood run cold in my veins and can you wonder that such should be the case not one of all us children had ever been taught what virtue was and all that we knew of crime was that it was something which a constable took you up for we had not the least notion of the saviournone of us had ever heard that the son of god died for the sins of the world i had once seen a bible because i stole one from a bookstall and the eldest girl who went to sell it gathered from what was said by the person who bought it that it was a bible but even if i had previously known that the book was called a bible i should not the less have stolen it because i could not read and no one had ever told me at that time what the bible really was we had all heard of the name of god and used it pretty often toofor oaths were familiar to us even when we could only lisp them but we knew not who god was and had no one to tell useven if we had wished to learn you may think it strange that there should be children of even ten years old in london who are completely ignorant of every thing concerning religion but i can assure you that i have met with youths and girls of fifteen or sixteen who were equally in the dark in that respect i was nine years old when mother maggs one day fetched me out of the street where i was playing in the gutter with my companions and took me into her own room where i saw mr bones for the first timei mean the first time as far as my recollection is concerned he looked at me a long time and then turning to the old woman said i dont think you have taken the very best care of himyes i have she answered he has had his bellyfull every day of his life breadandbutter for breakfast and supper potatoes for dinner on week days with maybe a bit of pudding or so now and then and always a good dinner on a sunday havent you jacob dearand as she asked me this question she gave a terrific frown unseen by old death and the meaning of which i well understood so i muttered a yes and she seemed satisfiedbut i am going to take him away all the same mrs maggs said mr bones because he is of an age now to be useful to mei hope you will recommend me where you can cried mother maggs i do all i can to make the poor little dears happy and if jacob is so shabby just the very day you drop down upon us like its only because his new frock is in the suds and as for shoes and stockings it makes boys hardy to go without themi do not remember that old death made any answer to these observations because the portion of the dialogue which i have just detailed produced so deep an impression on my mindyoung as i wasthat had it been continued i should most probably have recollected the rest but this i cannot forgetthat when old death told me to follow him and mother maggs took me in her arms to embrace me at parting i screamed with affrightfor the spectacle of the blind boy instantly recurred to my memory old death took me to a shop in whitecross street and bought me a complete suit of clothesshabby and mean it is true but royal robes compared to the rags i now threw off and how great was my astonishmenthow wild was my delight when i was actually supplied with a pair of stockings and shoes never beforenever since have i known such perfect joy as i felt at that minute sight restored to the blind could not be more welcome than were those articles not that i required themfor my feet were inured to nakedness and to walk even on the pointed flintsbut i experienced an indescribable sensation of mingled pride and satisfaction which made me supremely happy my joy was however somewhat rudely interrupted by a hard blow on the head which old death bestowed upon me because i dared to laugh in the fulness of my poor heart and then i burst into tears he cursed me for a snivelling fool and ordered me to put on the cap which he had also bought me and make haste to accompany him the cap was another article of clothing till then quite strange to me and once more my tears were succeeded by smiles at length the purchases were complete and i followed old death from the shop but i walked as if i was tipsy the cap seemed to be quite a weight on my head and the shoes threatened every moment to trip me up i have never worn skatesbut i can fancy how a person must feel when he puts them on for the first time and i imagine that my awkwardness in stockings and shoes was something of the same kind near the point where upper whitecross street joins old street road i beheld my late companions huddled together at the mouth of a passage belonging to a pawnbrokers shop they did not know me till i called some of them by name and then they could not believe their eyes i must have seemed a kind of prince to them they instantly overwhelmed me with questionsbut old death looked back and called me in a cross tone and i hurried away i declare solemnly that the tears started from my eyes as i thus separated from the companions of all my infant misery and though i knew not whether my own fate was about to be improved still my heart was smitten with the idea that i was leaving them behind to their wretchednesstheir ragstheir starvationand their ftid den at mother maggss house never until that instant had i experienced the least sympathy in their behalf but thenat that momenti felt as if i could have remained with them and loved them mr bones conducted me to some publichousei cant recollect where it was but i think it must have been in brick lane st lukesand there he ordered bread and cheese and ale what a glorious dinner did i make that day never had i tasted any thing so delicious before the cheese was so nicethe bread so white and newand the aleit was good beyond all description at least so the food and drink then appeared to me and what was better still was that i was allowed to eat as much as i chose when we had ended our meal old death began to talk very seriously to mefor we were alone in the room together he gave me to understand that he had found me when quite a baby lying on the steps of a workhousethat he had taken me to some good kind woman whom he knew and who had treated me wellthat afterwards he had been obliged to place me when i was three years old with mother maggsand that i therefore owed every thing to him i naturally believed at the time that i was under the deepest obligations to him and then he proceeded to inform me that i might be useful to him in certain ways and that if i did all he told me and was a good boy he would never desert me i of course listened with as much respect as it was in my power or nature to show and though i did not quite understand all he said to me i was nevertheless impressed with the conviction that he had a right to do what he chose with me and that i was bound to obey him we remained some time at the publichouseindeed if i remember right until it was dusk because old death had a great deal to say to me and as i was so very young and so miserably ignorant it was not an easy matter for him to make me understand his meaning but there can be no doubt that he laboured to convince me of the right which certain privileged persons had to prey upon others who were not so privilegedor in plainer terms that whenever i could obtain a handkerchief a purse or any thing else worth taking and in such a manner that there was no chance of my being detected i was perfectly justified in availing myself of the opportunity my morals had not been so carefully attended to as to excite any repulsive feelings at this species of reasoning on the contrary having from my infancy practised the art of pilfering pudding from cooksshops bits of bacon from cheesemongers windows carrots and turnips from old womens stalls and lumps of tripe or carrion from the boards of catsmeat establishments i was well prepared to go a step farther there can be no doubt that old death was all along aware of the real nature of mother maggss house and of the manner in which she reared the children entrusted to her a man of his experience could not help knowing all this and it was not probable that he was deceived by the lying statements she made to him relative to the manner in which i had been treatedalthough he took as far as i recollect no notice of her words in fact he had intentionally placed me in a position to learn everything that was badto fulfil an apprenticeship of petty vice that i might enter on a career of crime whereof the profits were to be his own taking me now in a somewhat kind manner by the hand he led me down to st pauls churchyard although having hitherto lived within a mile of that place i had never been there before it is true that from the garret windows of mother maggss dwelling i had sometimes seen the huge dark dome surmounted by the cross which shone like gold on a bright sunny day but i had never thought of asking what it wasnor had i any notion that it was so near often too in the silence of the night when cold and hunger kept me awake in that hideous den had the deep but glorious sound of the mighty bell booming through the air and proclaiming the hour fallen on my ears but still i had never thought of inquiring which clock it was that struck so loud and was so tediously long in striking thus when i entered saint pauls churchyard for the first time in company with old death i was struck with amazement to find myself at the foot as it were of that tremendous giant of architecture just at that moment too the mighty bell began to strike six and i startedfor young as i was that wellknown sound though never heard so near before reawakened a thousand conflicting thoughts within me all the misery and wretchedness i had endured at mother maggss house rushed to my mind and again i shed tears as i reflected on the poor children whom i had left behind me there oh mr rainfordif any kind and benevolent person had taken me then under his protection and care and taught me to do good and practise virtue as old death was teaching me to do evil and practise vice i feelyes i feel that i should not have been unworthy such humane attention but let me not interrupt the thread of my narrative more than i can help mr bones kept me by the hand and walked slowlyvery slowly through the churchyard pointing out to me the beautiful shops and telling me that if i was a good boy and only did what he told me i should soon be rich enough to be able to walk into those shops and treat myself to jewellery or fine clothes or anything else i might fancy this assurance gave me the most heartfelt joy and i already began to determine in my mind what i should buy when the happy period of such affluence might arrive all on a sudden my gay reverie was interrupted by old death who dragging me hastily to the entrance of a passage leading into paternoster row pointed to an elderly gentleman standing at a shopwindow at the corner where this passage joined st pauls churchyard do you see his handkerchief peeping out of his coatpocket demanded old death hastilyyes i repliedthen go and get it and i will give you sixpence if you bring it to me without the old fellow perceiving that you have taken itsixpence it was an inexhaustible treasure such as i had often heard of seldom seen and never touched without a moments hesitation i proceeded to execute the task it was wintertime and though the evening was dark yet the shopwindows were brilliantly lighted this was against mebut on the other hand the place was crowded with people passing both ways and this circumstance was in my favour old death stood watching me at the entrance of the passageno doubt ready to glide away in case of me being detected but my skill in cribbing victuals and other little articles in upper whitecross street had been so well practised that it only required to apply the same art to another and rather more difficult branch of thieving to be completely successful and this success far exceeded old deaths expectations for when i returned to him in the passage i was enabled to place in his hands not only the old gentlemans pockethandkerchief but also his gold snuffbox you may suppose that mr bones was wellpleased with me and he testified his approval of my conduct by placing a shilling in my hand i could scarcely believe that i was indeed the possessor of such a sum and i immediately made up my mind to ease as many old gentlemen as possible of their handkerchiefs and snuffboxes as long as a deed so simple was so generously rewarded old death now conducted me to drury lane and showing me a publichouse said jacob though a young boy you are a very good and clever boy and i think i can trust you if you assure me that you will do just as i tell you i will give you a treati gave him the assurance he requiredwell then walk boldly into that publichouse run up stairs just as if you had been there a hundred times before and go straight into the large concertroom that you will come to you will have to pay a penny for going in then sit down at a table call for bread and cheese and a glass of aleof the nice ale that you like so much you know and enjoy yourself you will find several other young lads there who will no doubt speak to you and you may talk to them as much as you like i shall come into the room presently but dont come near me and dont tell any one there that you know me i have my reasons and if you do all i tell you you shall often have a treat to a concert and such like places when you see me going away you can follow me at a little distance now do you understandi assured him that i did and i then walked into the publichouse as bold as if i had been a grownup person and a constant customer i had money in my pocket and for the first time in my life felt that confidence which the possession of coin produces the concertroom was speedily reached my shilling was changed to pay the entrance fee and i entered the place of amusement it wasor had i not better say it is a very large room for it was at the mogul in drury lane to which i had now introduced myself the place was crowded and the music and singing were going on i was quite delighted and seating myself at a table near some other boys all older than i was then i told the waiter to bring me bread and cheese and a glass of ale better say a pint old feller observed one of the boys to me and ill help you to drink iti threw down the elevenpence saying bring bread and cheese and ale for all thisi remember that the waiter looked at me for a moment in a strange way before he gathered up the money but he said nothing and hurried off in a few minutes he returned with a pot of ale bread and cheese and several glasses i was already on friendly terms with the boys at the same table and we now got quite intimate over the ale they soon let me know that they were all prigs and i answered yes to every question they put to me about my own pursuits presently i saw old death walk slowly up the room but i pretended to be looking quite another way the conversation which i had on this occasion with the boys at the pennyconcert completed what was no doubt old deaths design in sending me there namely to render me as familiar as possible with that class of lads at whose hands i was to receive my initiation into the career of roguery to which i was destined the ale excited me to such a degree that i was even then ready to obey any one who would suggest a deed by which money could be obtained for i saw that money was the key to all kinds of enjoyment presently old death walked slowly out of the room and two or three minutes afterwards i followed him having told my new companions that i should be sure to meet them again there next night in the street i joined old death who asked me how i liked all i had seen you can guess what my answer was well said he it is for you to get a handkerchief and a snuffbox or any thing of that kind every day and then you shall have money to go to concerts and to buy nice ale and to enjoy yourself along with those pleasant boys that you met therei was delighted with this prospect and i thought old death the kindest gentleman in the world in spite of the box on the ears he had given me at the slopsellers shop in the morning but all this time remember i did not know either his real or his nickname nor did i trouble myself about such matters he now conducted me to castle street long acre and putting sixpence into my hand pointed to a particular house go and knock at that door he said and ask for a bed you will have to pay twopence for it the fourpence left is to buy your breakfast in the morning which the woman of the house will give you for that money if the people you meet there ask you any questions say as little as possible and dont speak a word about me if you do i shall be sure to know it and i will never see you again be a good boy and at nine oclock tomorrow morning meet me at the corner of this streeti promised to mind all he told me and he hurried away while i gained admittance into one of those filthy lodginghouses that swarm in castle street at this place where i procured the half of a bed my companion being a young girl of thirteen who had already been a prostitute eighteen months i received further lessons in the school of vice in the morning i obtained a cup of coffee and a couple of rounds of thick breadandbutter for my fourpence having disposed of which i hastened to my appointment with old death he was waiting for me at the corner of the street and asked me a great many questions about the people i had seen at the lodginghouse i satisfied him as far as i could but through some lingering feeling of shame i did not tell him that a prostitute had been my bedfellow he desired me to follow him at a considerable distance but to mind and not lose sight of him he then led me for a long walk all about the westend of londonproceeding slowly so that i might have an opportunity of looking at the shops and obtaining some knowledge of the position of the different streets in a word that i might be able to find my way about by myself another time at about one oclock we went into a publichouse where we had something to eat and drink and rested for two or three hours then we set out on our wanderings again and at about seven oclock in the evening we came to a halt in st giless where old death gave me money to enter a pennytheatre i had not practised my hand at stealing any thing all day long because he had not instructed me to do so neither from that moment did he ever put my abilities in that way to the test in his presence so i suppose that the little affair in st pauls churchyard was merely an experiment made to enable him to judge whether i had any talent in the art of conveyancing or not in fact he had tried me to ascertain whether i could be made useful and finding that i could his object was now to introduce me to scenes and places where my morals might become confirmed in iniquity or where there was a sphere for the exercise of my abilities illustration i need not therefore dwell on this part of my story for in a few days the use which old death calculated to make of me was fully explained i was to thieve where i could and when i could and every evening i was to meet my employer at some place that he would appoint and hand him over the articles so stolen when he was to give me enough money for the following days expenses i was moreover charged to enlist in the same service as many boys as i could and now for the first time i learnt that my hitherto unknown protector was named mr benjamin bones and my companions soon informed me that he was a famous fence usually bearing the denomination of old death i must not forget to state that my employer counselled me never to allude to him in any manner unless it was in the way of enlistment as just now mentioned he said it will perhaps happen jacob that a constable or a bow street runner may catch hold of you sometimes but do not breathe a word about me and i will always get you out of the scrape if on the other hand you confess that you are employed by me or that you are in my service it will do you no good and i should cast you off for ever indeed i should leave you to rot in prison whereas hold your tongue whatever may happen and you will find me your best friend i promised to obey him and now behold me at the tender age of nine the companion of the worst juvenile pickpockets and a pickpocket myself no link had we to bind us to society the world was our harvestfield in which we considered that we had a right to glean and whenever a member of our fraternity got into trouble we clubbed together to maintain him well in prison if he was condemned to punishment he and ourselves looked upon it as a piece of bad luckand that was all i found that my companions were as reckless and improvident as could beever fulfilling the old adage light come light go they used to play at pitch and toss or skittles the stakes varying according to their means at the moment from a halfpenny to a sovereign i was not often enabled to join in these sports because old death kept me rather short and he had obtained such an astonishing influence over me that i dared not attempt to deceive him sometimes i thought of appropriating a portion of a days work to my own private use but his image haunted me like a ghostand i could not do it he constantly told me that he had the means of ascertaining every robbery that was committed and who perpetrated it and that if i attempted to play him any tricks i should be sure to be found out i believed himfor he occasionally gave me proofs of the most extraordinary knowledge of all that was passing he would say for instance your friend suchaone filched a snuffbox and a pocketbook yesterday in regent street he gave his employer the book and pawned the box on his own account now mark me old death would add that boy will get into trouble soon and no one will help him out of it againand this prophecy would come true i was therefore alarmed at the mere idea of deceiving old deathor rather attempting to deceive him and though my companions often jeered me and urged me to set up on my own account i lacked the moral courage to break with mr benjamin bones i was very expert in the art of pickpocketing and seldom had to disappoint old death when i met him in the evening if i did he gave me my money all the same i suppose i was too useful to him to be lost and perhaps he knew that i always did my best he allowed me three shillings and sixpence for each days expenses and this money was usually laid out in the way i will now explain breakfastpint of coffee d loaf of bread d s d butter d dinnerbeef d potatoes d bread d beer d teahalfpint tea d toast d supperleg of beef d bread d potatoes d beer d gin and water s bed d leaving me d a day for any casual expense this allowance of s d may perhaps seem rather liberal but it was seldom that my earnings during the day were not of sufficient value to produce old death at least fifteen or twenty shillingsand often a great deal more there are various grades or classes of juvenile thieves the most aristocratic amongst them are those who have been admitted into the fraternity of swellmoabites or who have taken a hand in housebreaking the next class on the descending scale is the pickpocket who dives only for purses watches pocketbooks or snuffboxes but who would scorn to touch a handkerchief the third section consists of those who dive for any thing they can get and whose chief game does consist of handkerchiefs the fourth division comprises shopsneaks and areasneaks the former enter a shop slily or crawl in on their hands and knees to rob the tills the latter get down areasteps and enter kitchens whence they walk off with any thing they can lay their hands on this same section also includes the shopbouncer who boldly enters a shop and while affecting to bargain for goods purloins some article easily abstracted the fifth division is made up of thieves who prowl about shopdoors or who break the glass in shopwindows to abstract the goods or who rob mercers by introducing a bent wire through the holes of the shutterbolts and draw out lace silk or ribands the sixth and last division or grade consists of the very lowest description of thievessuch as puddingsnammers who loiter about cooksshops and when customers are issuing forth with plates of meat and pudding or pudding alone as is often the case pounce on the eatables and run away with them before the persons robbed have even time to recover from their astonishment these miserable thieves sell all they cannot eat to other boys and thus manage to get a few halfpence to pay for a lodging i mention all these circumstances to you sir because i do not believe that you can have ever found yourself in a position to have seen what i am now relating on one occasion a certain robbery in which i was concerned made some noise and the bow street runners got a pretty accurate description of me this i learnt from old death who advised me to go up into the holy landwhich i need scarcely tell you is st gilessand remain quiet there for a few days until the thing was pretty well blown over i followed this advice which was very welcome to me because mr bones gave me plenty of money to make myself comfortable and i was not expected to do any work for at least a week i happened to take up my quarters at a lodginghouse in lawrence lane and found it chiefly used by the very lowest irish never did i see such a set as they were filth misery and drunkenness were familiar enough to me heaven knowsbut there i saw such filth so much misery and yet such constant and such horrible drunkenness that i was perfectly shockedand it required something strong to shock me mr rainford the house was a brothel and the daughters of the man who kept it were their own fathers best customers the most dreadful debauchery prevailed there old women used to bring young boys and old men young girlsmere childrento that beastly stew i have seen a dozen men and women all dancing together stark naked in the largest room in that house and some of them brothers and sisters on another occasion i saw an irish wake in the same place the corpse which was that of a prostitute was laid upon the floor with candles placed round it and the friends and relatives of the deceased woman all got so awfully drunk that they commenced a dreadful battle tumbling about in all directions over the dead body i stayed at this lodginghouse in st giless about a week and never went out except of an evening for about an hour when i looked in at milberrysthe flash publichouse in lawrence lane were you ever there sir no wellit is worth your while just to give a look in any time you are passing the public room is fitted up with fine tables and highback partitions fronting the door is a large black board whereon the following inscription may be read my pipe i cant afford to give if by my trade i wish to live my liquors proof my measures just excuse me sir i cannot trust to prevent mistakes all liquors to be paid for on delivery as soon as the little affair which had driven me up into st giless was blown over i returned to my old haunts and fell in again with my old companions i was now ten years old and was considered so cunning and clever that old death began to employ me in other ways besides thieving if he required to know any thing concerning a particular party he would set me to dog and watch him or to make inquiries about him sometimes i was sent to the flash publichouses frequented by gentlemens servants who were accustomed to arrange with the cracksmen for burglaries in their masters housesor put up cracks as they are called these publichouses are principally at the west endthe most famous are in duke street manchester square and portland street there i got into conversation with the servants or merely acted the part of a listener and all the information i could glean was of course conveyed to mr bones who no doubt knew how to turn it to his greatest advantage i was also a visitor to every flashhouse in london at different times and on various errands for old death the more his business increased the more necessary did i become to him and at that period he was not so near and stingy as he since became whenever i succeeded in any difficult undertaking he would reward me with something like liberality and i dont know whether i actually liked himbut it is certain that he exercised an immense power over my mind i was in my turn much looked up to by my companions they considered me old deaths lieutenant and moreover i was so skilful as a pickpocket that no one could excel and few equal me i had all the qualifications necessary for the arta light tread a delicate sense of touch and firm nerves for i was then strong and healthy now i am sicklywastedand have within me the seeds of an incurable malady i used at that time to wear shoes of a very light makeas indeed do nearly all professional pickpockets it is very easy for one who is any thing of an acute observer to recognise juvenile pickpockets in the street their countenances wear an affected determination of purpose and they always seem to be walking forward as if bent on some urgent object of business they never stop in the street save to work if they wish to confer with their pals or if they meet a friend they dive into some low publichouse or court or alley a knowing pickpocket never loiters about in the street because that is the very first thing that draws suspicions glances towards lads i have readand how i came to be able to read i shall presently tell youin the newspapers that many people have a notion that pickpockets use instruments in easing gentlemen or ladies of their purses or other articles of value but the only instrument i ever knew a pickpocket to use or used myself is a good pair of small scissors which will either rip a pocket up or cut it off in a twinkling i do believe that london thieves are the very worst in the whole world their profligacy commences so early and there is every thing to harden them imprisonment raises them into heroes amongst their companions only fancy a boy of twelve or thirteen perhapsor even youngerplaced behind huge massive bars which ten elephants could not pull down he of course thinks that he must be a very clever fellow or at least a very important one that the law is compelled to adopt such wonderful precautions to restrain him he believes that society must entertain a marvellous dread of his abilities that boy too is the superior in the eyes of the whole fraternity of thieves whose punishment is the heaviest a lad who has been tried at the old bailey thinks much more of himself than one who has only passed through the ordeal of the sessions the very pomp of justicethe idea that all those judges and barristers in their gowns and wigs should be assembled for the sake of a boythat the old bailey street should be crowded with policementhat newspaper reporters should be anxious to take notesthat spectators should pay shillings to obtain sittings in the courtin a word the whole ceremony and circumstance of the criminal tribunals actually tend to imbue juvenile thieves with a feeling of selfimportance now might not this very feeling be acted upon to a good and beneficial purposeto the advancement of industry and honest emulation i think so but society never seems to adopt really useful measures to reformit contents itself with punishing you may be surprised to hear such reflections come from my lips but who is better able to judge than one who has passed through the entire ordeal here jacob paused and then inquired if he were wearying tom rain with his narrative so far from your doing so my good fellow replied the highwayman that although i have several things to attend to i mean to stop and hear you to the end come drink a glass of wine there now you will be the better able to proceed i will light another cigarfor i fancy that i can attend more earnestly while smoking rainford once more settled himself in a comfortable posture and the lad pursued his narrative in the following manner footnote although our aim is to render the history of jacob smith a regular and connected narrative of the initiation of a neglected child in the ways of vice and the career of crime there are necessarily many phases in the history of juvenile iniquity which cannot be introduced into the text as it would be impossible that the boy who is telling his story could have gone through all the scenes alluded to we must therefore farther illustrate our aim by means of a few notes derived from authentic sources and this course we are the more inclined to pursue inasmuch as we hope that the episode formed by the history of jacob smith may have the effect of directing public attention more seriously than ever to the awful nature and extent of juvenile depravity in this metropolis mr miles in his report to the house of lords on poverty mendicity and crime places on record the following observations the women and the girls in these districts live with their men as long as they can agree together or until one or the other be imprisoned or transported the very children are prostitutes living with their fancy lads and it is difficult to say which are the most degraded the men or the women the girls or the boys it is thus that i suppose crime is more engendered in low neighbourhoods where the poorest and the most idle congregate and i now beg to continue my remarks upon the second head namely the neglect of parents the various pursuits of these parents call them from home during the greater portion of the day and their children are left to play and idle in the streets associating with other lads of more experience than themselves until seeing and hearing how easy it is to steal they commence their career of crime unchecked on the one hand and applauded on the other there are some parents who turn their children out every morning to provide for themselves not caring by what means they procure a subsistence so that the expense of feeding them does not abstract from their means of procuring gin or beer other parents require their children to bring home a specified sum every night to obtain which they must beg or thieve others hire out their children to beggars for d a day a cripple is considered worth d and many women hire children in arms about the same age to pass them off in the public thoroughfares as twins groups of these young neglected vagabonds herd together and theft becomes their study even if a child was well disposed it is not probable that he could escape the contagion of such bad example there is a community of children who live and are separated from persons more advanced in years moreover there is so rapid and so certain a communication among them all over the metropolis that if they discover any of their slang or flash words to be known out of their circle they will substitute another which in the course of a day or two will be adopted by the fraternity there are lodginghouses exclusively for their accommodation publichouses which are chiefly supported by their custom and the landlords of both sorts of establishments are ever ready to purchase any plunder they may bring with this neglect of parents on the one hand and the faculties to crime on the other hand can it be expected that these children can resist temptation the wonder would be if a boy was honest my conclusion therefore is that the neglect of parents in these low neighbourhoods renders them nurseries of crime the number of boys in london who live by plunder is veryvery considerable and thus society is maintaining them at a great expense either in the shape of prison expenses or by the value of the property they steal especially when it is considered that the receivers never give one quarter the value and there is not a boy thief who on the average does not expend s per diem footnote in the first series of the mysteries of london vol ii ch cxcii there is a detailed account of an association denominated the forty thieves soon after the weekly number containing that chapter appeared we were inundated with letters chiefly expressing unqualified disbelief of the astonishing particulars recorded in respect to the forty thieves we answered all those which contained the real names and addresses of the writers assuring them that the details related were strictly true and that we actually possessed a printed copy of the regulations by which the forty thieves were governed still most of our correspondents were sceptical it was therefore with a feeling almost bordering on satisfaction that we saw in the morning chronicle a few weeks ago a report of a policecase in which the prisoner who figured before the magistrate was described as belonging to an association denominated the forty thieves and whose headquarters were in the mint southwark we take this opportunity of assuring our readers that of what they find recorded in the mysteries of london farfar more is based on fact than they might at first suspect footnote mr miles in his report from which we have previously quoted says in considering the subject of juvenile delinquency it is requisite to take into account the various causes which compel them to be vicious and though we must condemn still we must regret that no efficient means have been adopted to prevent this lamentable evil young thieves have often confessed to me that their first attempts at stealing commenced at apple stalls and that having acquired confidence by a few successful adventures they have gradually progressed in crime allured by others and in their turn alluring they find companions to cheer them and instruct them girls to share their booty and applaud them and every facility to sell their daily booty there is moreover a kind of lottery adventure in each days life and as these excitements are attainable at so easy a rate is it strange that these children are fascinated with and abandon themselves to crime imprisonment to a young urchin who steals and has no other means of subsistence is no punishment for it is indifferent to him where he exists so long as he has food and raiment it is in prison that boys form acquaintances more mischievous than themselves many lads have owned to me that they had learned more in a gaol than out of one i once asked a lad if there was any school where boys were taught to pick pockets upon which he significantly observed no occasion for one sir the best school for that sort of thing is here alluding to the prison in which i saw him footnote we cannot allow the readers to attribute to our imagination a fact so disgusting as this we received the information from a policeofficer who was an eyewitness of such a scene and from whom as stated in a previous note in this series we have gleaned many remarkable facts relative to the lowest orders footnote mr miless report says london thieves have no sense of moral degradation they are corrupt to the core they are strangers to virtue and character even by name for many of them are the children of thieves or of exceedingly dissolute people consequently they can have no contrition they are in a state of predatory existence without any knowledge of social duty they may lament detection because it is an inconvenience but they will not repent their crime in gaol they will ponder on the past curse their evil stars and look forward with anxiety to the moment of their release but their minds and habits are not constituted for repentance mr chesterton of the house of correction informed me that he considers reformation among juvenile offenders to be utterly hopeless he observed that boys brought up in a low neighbourhood have no chance of being honest because on leaving a gaol they return to their old haunts and follow the example of their parents or associates lieutenant tracy of the westminster bridewell has pointed out to me lads who live constantly in gaols captain kincaid of the city bridewell informed me that onehalf of the number under his lock on the day that i inspected the prison june the th had been more than once committed many of them several times especially the boys mr teague of the giltspurstreet compter is of opinion that young thieves are mostly incorrigiblethat nothing will reform them an opinion which he says he has formed from the experience of many years mr capper of the home office stated in his evidence that out of juvenile convicts on board the hulk euryalus the eldest of whom was not had been committed more than once and an experienced burglar told me that young thieves cannot and will not reform the only thing sir he remarked that may save them is transportation as it removes them from evil companions the young thief is a nucleus of mischief a young pickpocket named stuart aged informed me that his parents daily sent him into the streets to look about that is to plunder whatever he could lay his hands upon that his principal associates were three young thieves with whom he worked or robbed that when he was years old he stood at a horses head while his companion stole a great coat from the gig that he got sixpence for his share of the plunder that he had committed many robberies because he was made to do it and that he lived entirely by plunder mr chesterton states in his evidence before the select committee of the house of commons in answer to query some of the parents lead their children into evil courses it is no uncommon thing when we are listening to the conversation between the prisoners and their parents to hear a conversation that shows at once the boys situation but the old thieves are in the habit of bringing in with them young inexperienced lads whenever the elder thieves are recommitted they are frequently recommitted with another he also observes that the elder thieves are continually corrupting young lads and bringing them into prison i am informed that captain brenton considers the total number of juvenile offenders within the bills of mortality to be dr lushington i believe computed the number still higher and from the evidence above quoted it is evident that each elder offender is daily spreading the mischief far and wide there is a youthful population in the metropolis devoted to crime trained to it from infancy adhering to it from education and circumstances whose connections prevent the possibility of reformation and whom no punishment can deter a race sui generis different from the rest of society not only in thoughts habits and manners but even in appearance possessing moreover a language exclusively their own there are lodginghouses kept by old thieves where juvenile offenders herd together and their constant intercourse tends to complete corruption it is in these hotbeds of vice that they revel in the fruits of their plunder and though extremely young they live with girls indulging in every kind of debauchery chapter xxxix continuation of the history of jacob smith i now come to an important event in my lifein fact that portion of it which will account for this sickly condition of health in which you see me old death one evening took me with him to supper at a place where he had never introduced me before this was bunces in earl street seven dials mrs bunce immediately seemed to take a great fancy to memade me sit next to herand in spite of her meanness helped me to the best of every thing on table it was a very good supper for old death who provided it had declared that he meant to launch out for once but i suppose it was only to put me into such a good humour that i was the more likely to fall into the scheme which he had in view this was not however the reason of mrs bunces kindness because since then she has often treated me in a manner that has made me forget many a sorrow it is true that these likings only take her by fits and startsand she has not unfrequently used me cruelly enough i can scarcely make that woman out as far as i am concerned and there are moments when i think a great deal of any kind words she has ever uttered to me or any kind treatment she has ever shown me but i am wandering from the subject which i had entered upon you remember that i was telling you about the supper at bunces house well after the things were cleared away and the grog was going round pretty fasti used to drink then as much as a man although little more than ten years oldold death began to talk a great deal about the money that might be made by a clever lad like me being able to get admittance into the houses of rich people he went on to say that i should begin to think of doing business that would leave me more time to amuse myself and be also less dangerous than going about the streets picking pockets i assured him that i was heartily sick and tired of the life i was leading and that i wished i was old enough to be a housebreaker for said i a cracksman does have some time which he can call his own if he does only one job a week he is satisfied but i am obliged to gad about all day to get the means of living on the next besides said i i am of course running a thousand times more risks by doing so many jobs each day than i should if i only did one or two a weekeverybody must have his apprenticeship returned old death and you have now served yours i agree with you that it is high time for you to be doing something better and i have a plan ready chalked out for youmrs bunce mixed me another glass of grog i produced my short pipe and blew a cloud while old death explained his scheme at first i did not much relish it but he backed it with so many arguments that i agreed to try it and sure enough at six oclock one morninga few days afterwardsa boy black as a devil with sootbag over his shoulder and brush and scraper in his hand was making the round of bloomsbury square bawling sweep as lustily as he could that boy was myself presently a garretwindow opened and a female voice called me to stop i obeyed in a few minutes down came the cook to the front door and i was desired to walk in and operate on the kitchenchimney the cook was a fat middleaged goodnatured body and asked me a great many questions about myselfhow long i had been a sweephow it happened that i became onewhether i had any father or motherand a host of such queries to all of which i replied in the most sorrowful manner possible i assured her that i had been a sweep from infancythat i had swept a chimney when i was only five years oldthat i had no parentsthat my master beat me cruellyand that i had had nothing to eat since the morning before the good creature shed tears at my narrative and when i had swept the chimneywhich i did in a manner that scarcely bore out the assertion of my long experienceshe gave me a quantity of broken victuals in addition to the money earned i then took my departure having very quietly deposited halfadozen silver forks and spoons in my sootbag while her back was turned this business i carried on successfully enough for some months till at last old death told me that he had seen several paragraphs in the papers warning people against thefts committed by sweeps i therefore gave up the employment and once more took refuge in st giless but my health was seriously injured by the occupation i had just renounced and from that time i have always been ailing and sickly although i had seldom turned sweep more than twice a week and an hour after each robbery that i thus committed was as clean again as if i had never been near a chimney in my lifeyet the seeds of disease were planted in me and i feel the effects hereherein my chest the life that i led when i gave up the chimneysweep business did not certainly tend to improve my health i hired a room in st giless and took a girl into keepingi being then eleven and she thirteen of all profligate creatures peggy wilkins was the worst the moment she awoke in the morning she must have her halfquartern of gin and then she would go on drinking at short intervals all day long if i attempted to stop the supplies she would fly into the most dreadful passions break every thing she could lay her hands on or else throw the domestic articles at my head when tipsy she would loll half naked out of the window and chaff the people passing in the street in the evening she went to the penny concerts or penny theatres and generally came home so gloriously drunk that the entire house much less our little room would scarcely hold her you may wonder why i continued to live with her but the fact is i liked her in spite of her outrageous conduct and as i was sometimes very dull and low her noisy rackety disposition positively helped to put me into good spirits she knew nothing of my connexion with old death but she was aware that i was laying hid in st giless in consequence of having robbed houses disguised as a sweep and she used to laugh heartily when i told her several amusing anecdotes relative to that portion of my career one nightafter having lived about a month in idleness in the holy landi was compelled by the falling short of supplies to call at bunces in seven dials for the purpose of seeing old death after waiting there a short time he came in and i immediately noticed that his face was more serious than usuala certain sign that he had something new on hand i did not however venture to ask any questions for i still stood in the greatest awe of him and knew that his disposition was irritable and easy to be provoked at length he said to mrs bunce give that lad a good strong glass of grog hes shivering with coldi was not but i took the grog because i never refused spirits at that time when old death thought i was primed enough to embrace any new plan with eagerness he said jacob i have something for you to do that i am convinced will yield a good harvesti instantly became all attentiontheres a widow lady he continued living at the west end in a swell street and by all i can learn she is very well off she is also very charitable and belongs to a number of whats called religious societies and i am sure you could get into her house as easy as possible the chimneysweep business has wellnigh blown over if not quite and its high time to begin a new dodgehe then explained his plan and i agreed to adopt it when i got back to my lodging in st giless i found peggy sitting in company with a young fellow of about fifteen drinking raw spirits she had not expected me home so early and was for a moment quite taken aback but soon recovering herself she put a good face on the matter and introduced the young chap as her brother saying that she had not seen him for many years before that evening when she had met him by accident i pretended to believe her but the moment he was gone i gave her a good beating and overwhelmed her with reproaches she showed less spirit than i had expected and did not attempt to return the blows neither did she treat me with sulkiness or illhumour on the following evening at about nine oclock i very quietly laid myself down on the doorsteps of a house in old burlington street i was in such rags and tatters as to be almost naked and having pricked my feet with a pointed bit of wood in several places they were almost covered with blood as if chapped with the cold and cut by the sharp stones this was in the depth of winter and my appearance was most miserable presently a carriage drove up to the house and a fine tall elderly gentleman got out i was crouched up close by the threshold of the door and i purposely let him tread on one of my naked feet then i began to sob as if with pain and he now observed me for the first time he muttered an oath but at that instant the frontdoor opened and his manner changed directly he spoke kindly to me and put halfacrown into my hand a lady was crossing the hall while the door stood open and this gentleman was still speaking to me and she immediately turned to ascertain what was the matter heres a poor wretched creature said the gentleman who was so huddled up against the door that i did not observe him and i am afraid i trod on his leg somewhat heavilythe lady instantly spoke in the most compassionate terms and desired that i might be brought into the house the manservant raised me for i affected to be unable to walk and the lady said poor boy he is paralysed with the coldwhen i was moved into the hall and placed in a chair the state of my feet was observed and this increased the compassion i had already excited she ordered the servant to take me into the kitchen and give me a good supper while i warmed myself by the fire all these commands were immediately executed shoes and stockings were also supplied me and in the course of an hour the lady herself came down to speak to me she asked me who i was i told her a long and piteous tale already prepared for the occasionhow i had been apprenticed to a tradesman at liverpool and had undergone the most dreadful treatment because i refused to work on the lords day and insisted on my right to go to church how the cruelty of my master had increased to such an extent that i was obliged to run away how i had wandered about the country for the last two months subsisting on charity but often halfstarved how i had that morning found my way to london and had been obliged to sell my shoes for a penny to buy a roll which was all i had eaten during thirtysix hours but that i had an aunt who was housekeeper to a certain bishop and that i knew she would do all she could for me the lady seemed to eye me suspiciously until i spoke of the aunt and the bishop and then her countenance instantly changed in my favour well my poor lad she said you shall remain here tonight and the first thing tomorrow morning one of my servants shall take a message from you to your aunti of course expressed my gratitude for this kindness but the lady assured me that she required no thanks as heaven rewarded her for what she did towards her suffering fellowcreatures i really thought that there was something very much like what i and my usual associates were accustomed to call gammon in all this and then i actually reproached myself for the idea and began to repent of imposing on so much virtue and goodness when i was well warmed with the cheerful fire and plentiful supper the housekeeper of this lady conducted me to a little room on the top storey and having wished me a good night retired locking the door behind her but this did not give me much uneasiness for beneath my rags i had concealed the necessary means to counteract such a precaution accordingly about an hour after i had heard the servants withdraw to their bedrooms which were on the same floor as the one where i was placedand when i thought the house was all quieti took off the lock of the door by means of a little turnscrew and crept carefully down stairs just at that minute the clock struck eleven my intention was to visit the drawingroom first but when i reached the door i perceived there were lights within i listened and heard the gentleman and lady talking together oh ho thought i i shall have time to inspect the ladys bedroom first and perhaps secure her jewelsso naturally conceiving that this chamber must be the one immediately over the drawingroom i retraced my way up stairs and entered the front apartment on the second floor a rushlight was burning in the room but no one was there i lost no time in commencing my search in all the cupboards but i found nothing except clothes there was however a mahogany press which was fast locked i drew forth a small skeleton key and was about to use it when i was alarmed by footsteps in the passage in another moment i was safely concealed under the bed some one almost immediately afterwards entered the room and only closed the door without shutting it i dared not move even to peep from beneath the drapery that hung round the bed to the floor but i could tell by the rustling of silk and the unlacing of stays that the person in the room was undressing herselfand i felt satisfied it was the lady of the house i was now seriously alarmed she was evidently going to bed and my only chance of escaping from the chamber was when she should be asleep but might i not disturb her my situation was very unpleasantand a prison seemed to open before my eyes in about a quarter of an hour the lady stepped into bed how i longed to catch the first sound that should convince me she was asleep but she was not dreaming of closing her eyes yet awhile for scarcely had she laid herself down when the door was gently openedthen carefully closed againand another person evidently without shoes or boots on came into the room they said a few words to each other and to my astonishment i found that the gentleman who had arrived in his carriage which of course had been sent away was going to pass an hour in company with the charitable lady well thought i this is the way in which heaven rewards her for all she does towards her suffering fellowcreatures the gentleman undressed himself and got into bed nearly two hours instead of an hour passed awayvery pleasantly it seemed for the lady and gentleman and very much to my amusement i was now no longer under any alarm on account of myselffor i had learnt a secret which placed the lady in my power well the gentleman got up at last and dressed himself and the lady went down stairs with him to bolt the streetdoor after him their movements were so cautious that i could plainly perceive the servants must have fancied that the gentleman had gone away long before and that this care was taken to avoid disturbing them with any noise likely to excite suspicion the moment the lady had left the room with her lover i thought of beating a retreat but should i go emptyhanded no and yet i had not time to force open the mahogany press which i believed must contain her jewels before she would come back as she had gone down in her nightclothes i therefore resolved to stay where i was and accomplish my purpose when she was asleep because if matters did come to the worst and she should awake she dared not expose me so i laid quiet and she came back in a few minutes shivering with the coldfor i could hear her teeth actually chatter half an hour afterwards she was fast asleepas i could tell by her deep and regular breathing the rushlight still burnt in the room and i crept carefully from beneath the bed yesshe was sleeping and though not a young woman she appeared very beautiful but i had not a minute to lose my skeleton key was again at workthe bolt of the lock flew backand the door of the press moved on its hinges move yesand creak too most awfully so that the lady started up in bed and uttered a faint scream i instantly rushed up to her saying in a low but determined tone madam not a wordor i betray you and your loverby the feeble light of the candle i saw that she became as red as crimsonyes madam i continued your tricks are known to me and i have been all the while concealed under this bedyou she exclaimed why surely you are the poor boy that i received into the house this eveningto be sure i am maam was my answer and being troubled with a habit of sleepwalking i found my way to this roombut what were you doing at the bureaumerely examining it in my sleep maamthis is ridiculous she said impatiently i understand what you are but i will treat you well on condition that you do not mention to a soul what you have been a witness of this nighti have no interest in gossiping maamand were you to do so i can deny all you may state added the lady who was dreadfully excited and nervous as you may suppose but if you follow my directions i will reward you welli readily gave a promise to that effect she then took a reticule from a chair by the side of the bed and drawing out her purse emptied its contents into my hands at a rapid glance i saw there could not be less than fifteen or sixteen sovereigns besides a little silver she then took from her bag a banknote for twenty pounds which she also gave me i secured the money about my person and she asked me whether i was satisfied i said perfectlythen stand aside for a few moments and i will show you how to acti stepped behind the curtain while she rose and put on a dressinggown having done which she took the rushlight in her hand and desired me to follow her as noiseless as possible we went down into the kitchen where she told me to take all the cold victuals there were in the larder and she gave me a napkin to wrap them up in there happened to be a silver spoon in one of the dishesleft there most probably by accident this she also desired me to take and you may be sure i did not refuse these arrangements being made she led me to the front door and having reminded me of my promise not to talk about a certain affair let me out of the house i have no doubt that there was a great deal said next morning in old burlington street about the ungrateful lad who was taken in as an object of charity and who decamped in the middle of the night with the contents of the larder and a silver spoon into the bargain but you have not mentioned the name of this lady jacob interrupted tom rain i did not think it was worth while siras she used me very well still i have a very particular reason for wishing to be informed on that head said the highwayman oh if thats the case i shall not hesitate replied jacob the name of that lady was mrs slingsby i thought so from the very first moment you began to speak of her cried tom and the name of the gentlemandid you learn that yes sir answered the lad i heard the servants talking about him when i was in the kitchen his name waslet me seeoh yesi remembersir henry courtenay thank you jacob exclaimed tom then in a low musing tone he said poor clarence you are woefully deceived in your saint of an aunt shall i continue my story mr rainford asked jacob it will not last much longer now by all means go on my boy i would sit here till daylight sooner than miss the end thus encouraged jacob continued in the following manner footnote every juvenile delinquent is as anxious to rise in his profession as the military or naval officer or the member of any other hierarchy but with the votaries of crime the apex of promotion isthe gibbet mr miles says i have questioned many boys of shrewd understanding concerning their opinions and the opinions of their associates as to their ultimate fate for all thieves are fatalists they look upon their inevitable doom to be either sooner or later transportation or the drop it is difficult to imagine a state of more gloomy wretchedness and more despairingly horrible than the selfconviction of condign punishment without one gleam of hope to clear the melancholy perspective punishments and whippings are therefore useless for the mind is prepared to endure more and every imprisonment is only looked upon as another step in the ladder of their sad destiny the lad is hopeless consequently reckless in his conducthardened to the present and irreclaimable as to the future it is not by prison discipline that reformation can be effected the temptations the facilities and the love of idleness are too alluring crowds of young thieves will wait round a prisongate to hail a companion on the morning of his liberation and to carry him off to treat him and regale him for the day i have asked boys under sentence of transportation if they thought they could reform if returned again upon society and the general reply has been no their reasons for that conclusion i give in their own wordsif we were to be free tomorrow we must go to our old haunts and our old companions for where else can we go if we try to be honest we cannot for our pals associates would torment us to return in short we should only have to come back here at last but we are now going to another country where we hope to be honest men i have moreover questioned many lads as to what method they would adopt to prevent other boys from falling into crime and their remarks have been stop playing in the streets for a pocket is soon picked and there are many who show others how to do itand the next thing is to stop those cursed receivers for if a receiver knows a boy to have dealt with him that is to have sold him property he will make him go out to thieve he will never let him rest and even should we get into employment he will teaze us till he makes us rob the master or will tell of us to the police these remarks prove the boys to be good judges of their own cases so like a skilful physician they know where to apply the remedy and as i feel convinced that many of these urchins possess every requisite to be good and useful members of society so am i certain that their reformation in a majority of cases is as practicable under proper means as their ultimate ruin is now certain under the present system footnote mr brandon in his preface to mr miless report makes the following observations which are too important to need any apology for their quotation if a religious fanatic brings a bill into the house for the better observance of the sabbath whose comforts are to be abridged why the poor mans and those of the middling classes for it is the stagecoaches and omnibuses that are to be prohibited from making their appearance while the streets may be thronged with carriages and though the labourer is not permitted to purchase his necessary food on that sacred day unable to have accomplished it before from not having received his wages till too late the preceding night yet the fishmonger may keep the turbot cool that is to grace his lordships sunday table and send it home on the very day just in time to be prepared for dinner penny theatres too are decried and suppressed while the larger ones are permittedthe reason assigned being that the company who frequent the former render the step necessary but the delinquency does not arise from cheap exhibitionsit is from the inefficiency of the law to restrain the audience for in the plays themselves there is no improper language used holland a notorious thief in his examination said he had heard bad language at those places before the curtain drew up but never any thing indecent on the stage this is a damning proof where the fault lies if the laws were such as to restrain vice and those properly administered it would effectually prevent the improper conduct of the loose individuals and preclude the necessity of reducing the pleasures of the poor pockets are picked every night at the royal theatres and scenes of the worst description carried on in the lobbies yet it never entered into the cranium of the wiseacres that if the theatres were shut up these abominations would be effectually eradicated it is highly gratifying to witness the order and pleasure with which cheap diversions are conducted on the continent even so close to us as boulogne and calais where may be seen the lowest classes enjoying themselves in dancing and visiting the various public gardens the entrance to which is a fee equivalent to our penny another proof of the difference with which our laws are administered according to the parties affected is manifest in the proceedings against the various houses for play in the metropolis the clubs of the aristocracy and the little goes little hells c of the poor chapter xl conclusion of the history of jacob smith on my return to earl street seven dials which was at about three oclock in the morning i found old death and mrs bunce sitting up for me toby having gone to bed i related the adventures which i had met with but said not a word about the intrigue of the lady and the baronet for i could not help thinking that the kind treatment i had in the first instance received from mrs slingsby deserved the reward of secresy on that head old death very kindly permitted me to retain five pounds out of the money which i myself had obtained and i hurried back to my lodging in st giless peggy was in bed and fast asleep and i lay down by her side without awaking her when i again opened my eyes the sun was shining in the brightness of a frosty air even through the dingy panes of my window and i started up peggy had already risen and i supposed she had gone out to get things for breakfast but something like a suspicion arose in my mindand i felt uneasy i searched the pockets of the ragged pair of trousers i had purposely worn on the previous night and the five sovereigns were gone now i was really alarmed peggy had certainly decamped a farther search showed me that she had even carried off the few little articles of decent wearing apparel that i had leaving me only the miserable rags in which i had appeared at mrs slingsbys house yespeggy had run away with all i possessed that was worth the taking and now the question naturally rose in my mindwill she betray me i thought her conduct was so suspicious that i determined not to give her a chance if i could help it particularly as i remembered the manner in which she took the beating i gave her and which now made me think that she had resolved on being revenged so i dressed myself in my tatters as quick as i could and got away from the house but at the end of the street i met a certain mr dykesthe bow street runner whom you happen to know mr rainfordand though i endeavoured to dive into a narrow court he pounced upon me in a twinkling in less than an hour i stood in the felons dock at the policecourt bow street charged with a robbery committed by me in bloomsbury square in the disguise of a sweep i was remanded for a week and sent in the meantime to clerkenwell prison there i was placed in no reception yard where mrs bunce who pretended to be my aunt in order to get admittance to me visited me in the afternoon she told me that mr bones could not possibly come to see me but that he would do all he could for me if i remained staunch and did not mention his name in any waynot even to my fellowprisoners we are afraid that you will be committed for trial said mrs bunce but all shall be done that can be done to buy off the witnesses if that wont succeed such evidence of former good character shall be given that your sentence will be a light one and in the meantime you shall have as much money as you want to live gloriously in prison mr bones has sent you up a sovereign for the present and i will bring you a good suit of clothes tomorrow so that you may go up swell before the beak next time be staunch jacob and mr bones will never desert you but if you only mention his name to a soul in an improper way hell leave you to your fate and youll be transportedmrs bunce impressed all this on my mind but i assured her it was unnecessary as i knew that i should not better my own plight in any very considerable degree by nosing against bones whereas he might be useful to me if i behaved well in the matter she went away satisfied and i spent the rest of the day in jollification with my fellowprisoners amongst whom my money raised me to the rank of a hero that night i slept in the receiving ward and next morning i was taken to the bathingroom a new suit of clothes having been already sent in to me by mrs bunce but i found that i was to bathe in the same water which had already served to wash the filthy bodies of several trampers who had also been sent to prison the day before on a charge of robbery and i knew that when they entered they were covered with vermin i therefore gave the turnkey halfacrown to allow me to dispense with the bath put on my new clothes and was turned into the felons yard there i found persons who had committed all degrees of crime huddled together as if there was no difference in the charges against them a boy who had stolen a pound of potatoes value one pennymyself who had stolen plate in a dwellinghousea gentleman who had wounded another in a duel and could not get bail but who was a very superior persona burglara coinerand a man charged with murder were all in one room together it did not strike me thenbut it has often struck me sincehow wrong it was to put that boy who had stolen potatoes along with a burglar a coiner and a practised thief as i washow unjust it was to put the gentleman with any of usand how shocking it was to put a murderer along with prisoners whose hands were not at least stained with blood and what were the consequences the boy who had merely stolen the potatoes because his mother was ill and starving and who had never done any thing wrong before was entirely corrupted by the coiner and made up his mind to turn prig the moment he got outthe gentleman was worked up to such a pitch of excitement by being in such society that he was removed to the infirmary and died of brain fever as i afterwards heardthe burglar helped the murderer to escape and got safely away with him illustration our amusements in gaol were chiefly gambling and drinking money procured as much liquor as we could consume and with such i was well supplied cards and dice were not allowed it is true but we used to play with bits of wood cut and marked like dominoes or by chalking the table into a draughtboard or by tossing halfpence then there was such fighting quarrelling and bad language that nothing could equal the place in the upper or sleeping ward things were much worse the prisoners robbed each other the very first night the duellistgentleman was there he lost his purse containing several sovereigns and when he threatened to complain he was quietly informed by the burglar and the murderer that if he did he would be hung up to the bars of the window with his own handkerchief the very next night and his end would be attributed to suicide at the end of the week i was had up to bow street once more and the evidence was so conclusive against me that i was committed to newgate for trial this i had expected and cared but little for as mrs bunce at each visit which she paid me at clerkenwell prison assured me that mr bones would do all he could for me and he kept his wordbut more i suppose for his own sake than mine what a dreadful place i found newgate to be hardened as i wasacquainted with all degrees of debaucheryand familiar with vice i declare solemnly that i shrank from the scenes i there witnessed fighting quarrelling gambling thieving drinking obscene talking bullying and corrupting each otherall those took place to a great degree in the clerkenwell prison but in newgate they were carried out to an extent dreadful to think of and associated with other crimes impossible to mention i now seemed to awake for the first time from a long dream of wickedness and to become aware of the frightful precipice on which i stood my eyes were suddenly openedand i shuddered a man was hanged at the debtors door while i was in newgate and i saw him pass from the condemned cell to the kitchen which is just within the debtors door i experienced a sudden revulsion of feeling and took a solemn oath within my own breast that i would never thieve again but as i knew nothing of religion and could not read or write i was not likely to reform very rapidly nor very completely i still laughed and joked with my fellowprisoners and appeared to enter into most of their fun though i really began to loathe them but when the chaplain visited us and the other boys jeered and mocked him i stood by and dwelt on every word of gentle remonstrance that fell from his lips next sunday i paid great attention to his sermon while pretending to be asleep for if i had been caught actually lending a patient ear to his discourse my fellowprisoners would have led me no peace afterwards i understood but littlevery little of that sermon still i gleaned some notion of the existence of a saviour a belief in whom was the steppingstone to virtue i also heard the happiness of heaven explained for the first time but i must confess that i was greatly puzzled when the chaplain declared that the man who was hanged for a dreadful murder on the preceding monday had gone to that place of joy because he had repented in his last momentsfor i thought to myself well then a human being is quite safe in leading as terrible a life as he chooses as long as he repents at the end and again i was bewildered when i heard the clergyman say these words which made so great an impression on me that i have never forgotten them and never shallas i stood with that penitent man on the drop last monday morning i envied him his fate because i knew that his soul was about to ascend to heaven the day of my trial came and i was placed in the dock before the common serjeant of london the clerk of the court asked me how will you be triedby god and your countryi knew not what reply to make and was actually on the point of saying that i would rather not be tried at all this time since it seemed to be left to my own choice and that i would faithfully promise never to thieve againwhen the turnkey who had charge of me whispered in my ear you damned young fool why dont you speak say by god and my country damn youi did as i was directed and the trial commenced the charge against me was fully proved and a verdict of guilty was recorded the commonserjeant asked if i had ever been convicted before the keeper of newgate who was present said i had not the counsel who had been retained for me by old death then requested to be allowed to call witnesses to character this was permitted and three or four tradesmen who i well knew were old deaths friends got up one after the other and swore that i had been in their service each one of course giving different periods of time and that i was an honest hardworking and industrious lad until i fell into bad company and got into trouble dykes the runner was then questioned about me and he said that i was not known as a thiefalthough he knew the contrary perfectly well but old death had kept his word and had not spared his gold my offence was however a grave onerobbing in a dwellinghouse and there were two or three other indictments of the same kind against me though the prosecutors did not come forward old death had made it right with them too i was accordingly condemned to seven years transportation with a hint that this sentence would be commuted to two years imprisonment at the hulks i was but little more than eleven when my career of crime was thus interrupted and i was glad that it was so interruptedfor i resolved that it should not be renewed when i regained my liberty this was scarcely a resolution produced by moral considerations but by fear and it therefore required strengthening whether it was or not i shall soon inform you a few days after the sessions terminated i was removed with several other boys to the euryalus convicthulk at woolwich this vessel has three decks the upper is appropriated to lads convicted the first time the second to the next grade of juvenile criminals and the third or lowest to the worst kind of offenders i was assigned to the upper deck where there were about sixty of us on being received on board we were first sent to the washhouse where we were bathed and well cleansed and we then received the suit of dark grey that denotes the felon our employment was to make clothes for the entire establishment that is shirts jackets waistcoats and trousers the person who taught us was a convictboy who had been a tailor the cuttersout belonged to the second deck and visited our department as often as their services were required we were divided into sections each having at its head a boy selected as the chief on account of his good conduct when in prison i will describe the routine of the daytaking the period when the summer regulations are in force at five oclock in the morning all hands were called the ports were opened the hammocks were lowered and lashed up and we washed ourselves for chapel at halfpast five the signal was given for prayers and we went to the chapel in sections or divisions taking our seats in profound silence the morning hymn was sung the schoolmaster read the prayers and we returned to our wards on the upper deck there we stood in ranks till six oclock when breakfast was served the steward of the ship superintended the giving out of the provisions and saw that each boy had his fair allowance of bread and gruel this being done the steward ordered each rank one after the other to approach the tables hold up the bread say grace and then sit down and eat at halfpast six we were marshalled on the quarterdeck in divisions and the officers of the hulk were then prepared to hear any complaints or receive any reports that might have to be submitted to them such complaints were noted down for after investigation some of the boys were kept above to wash the quarterdeck and the remainder were sent down to cleanse their own deck at eight oclock we were all set to work at tailoring a strict silence being preserved at nine oclock the report upon the complaints was received from the commander of the hulk and the punishments awarded were made knownsuch as a good thrashing with a cane stopping the dinner or solitary confinement on bread and water at twelve oclock the dinners were served out the steward superintending the quartermasters and guards were also present to see that one boys allowance was not taken from him by another from halfpast twelve to halfpast one we were allowed to take air and exercise on the quarterdeck but without making any noise at halfpast one we were marched down again to our work at two a section of onethird of us was sent into the chapel where we were taught reading and writing by the schoolmaster at five we left off work or schooling cleaned the wards and then washed ourselves this being done supper was served out and we went on the quarterdeck again for air and exercise till seven when we were once more marched to the chapel for evening prayers and the catechism at eight oclock we returned to our own deck where the signal was given for getting out the hammocks and slinging them up at nine profound silence was ordered and the whole ship was then as quiet as if there was not a soul on boardthis deep tranquillity being only broken by the striking of the bell and the cry of alls well every halfhour such was the life led on board the euryalus convicthulk but i was happiermuch happier there than i had ever been before the schoolmaster was an excellent man and took a delight in teaching those who were anxious to learn i was of this number and my improvement was rapid i quite won his regard and he devoted unusual pains to instruct me so that at the end of a year he obtained leave for me to give up the making of clothes and assist him as an usher this was an employment that pleased me greatly and allowed me plenty of time to read the books lent me by the worthy schoolmaster so fond was i of reading that i used to take a book with me on the quarterdeck at those times devoted to air and exercise and sitting apart from the others i would remain buried in study until it was time to go below again i examined how books were written and how i was accustomed to speak that isi compared the language of those books with my own and i was shocked to find how wretchedly ignorant i had hitherto been in respect to grammar this ignorance i strove hardoh very hard to surmount and the good schoolmaster assisted me to the utmost of his power i read and studied the bible with avidity and the more i became acquainted with it the more fixed grow my determination to avoid a relapse into the ways of crime when i should be released during the two years that i passed at the hulk mrs bunce came very often to see me passing herself off as my aunt but relations were not allowed to speak to us except in the presence of a guard and so the name of old death was never mentioned by either of us but mrs bunce used to tell me that my uncle would give me a home when my time was up and i supposed by this that she meant her husband toby i knew that old death was the person who had directed these assurances to be given me and often and often did i lay awake of a night deliberating within myself what i should do when i was set free to earn an honest livelihood and avoid the hateful necessity of returning to the service of mr benjamin bones at length the day of liberation cameand i had no plan of proceedings settled my clothes were given to me and a shilling was put into my hand by the steward the old schoolmaster was absent at the time and i was sorry that i had not an opportunity of thanking him for all his kindness and imploring his advice how to proceed it struck me that i would appeal to the commander of the hulk i did so and solicited him to counsel me how to get an honest livelihood he burst out laughing in my face exclaiming i suppose you think i am to be deceived by your humbug and that i shall put my hand into my pocket and give you halfaguinea to see your way with no such thing my lad i used to do so when i was first here but those i assisted in that way were always the first to come back againand he turned on his heel leaving me quite astounded at the reception my sincerity of behaviour had experienced but a few moments reflection showed me that i could scarcely blame him for his conduct and i quitted the ship in tears the moment i stepped from the boat that landed me in woolwich i met mrs bunce she threw her arms round my neck and called me her dear jacob in such a loving manner that one would really have believed her to be my aunt or even my mother if she had chosen to represent herself so then pointing to a publichouse at a little distance she said your good and kind friend mr bones is there and he will be so delighted to see you he has ordered a nice steak and some good ale and we mean to let you enjoy yourselfthe idea of having such a glorious repast after being kept on short commons on board the euryalus made my mouth water but then i remembered all the influence old death had been accustomed to exercise over meand i knew that if i once again entered within its range i should never have the moral courage to withdraw from it so my mind was made up and suddenly darting down a byestreet i was beyond mrs bunces view in a twinkling i heard her shrill screaming voice call after me but i heeded it notand hurried onward as if escaping from a wild beast presently i relaxed my speed and at length entered a publichouse where i called for a pint of beer two or three soldiers and as many young women were sitting at another table drinking and indulging at the same time in the most filthy discourse suddenly one of the females started up advanced towards me and after considering me for a few moments exclaimed with a terrible oath well i thought it must be my old fancy cove jacoband she offered to embrace me i however repulsed her with loathing for in the miserable tattered sickly wretch before me i had already recognised peggy wilkins she seemed ashamed of herself for a minute then recovering her impudence she said damn and blast you for a sulky snivelling hound who the devil are you that you cant treat me civilly do you think i dont know all thats happened to you why youve only this moment left the hulksand you cant deny itthe soldiers hearing this demanded if it was true and without waiting for my answer thrust me out of the place i had reached the end of the street when i recollected that i had not received the change for my shilling which i had tendered in payment of the beer i therefore went back to ask for it but the potboy who had served me swore that i never gave him a shilling at all and the landlord evidently believed that i was a vagabond endeavouring to swindle his servant so i was kicked outpenniless i was for some time before i could muster up courage to adopt any plan for my support indeed i sate down in a retired nook and cried bitterly i even regretted having left the hulk so miserable did i feel at last hunger compelled me to act and i entered a shop to inquire if a boy was wanted the man behind the counter said he did not require the assistance of a lad but that a neighbour of his would probably hire me i went to the place pointed out to me and having explained my business was asked for testimonials of good character i candidly confessed that i had just been discharged from the euryalus but that i thought the schoolmaster on board would recommend me the man flew into a dreadful passion and rushing round from behind the counter would have kicked me out of the shop if i had not run away of my own accord i am sure that i tried twenty different shops that day in woolwich at some i explained my positionat others i carefully concealed the fact of my late ignominious punishment but charactercharactercharacter where was it even for a starving lad who only asked a fair trialwho promised to work from sunrise to sunset and to be content with a morsel of bread to eat and a cellar to sleep in as a recompense for his toilseven to one who offered so much and required so little in return character was necessary night camei was famishing and in despair at length a charitable baker gave me a roll and my hunger was appeased it struck me that the tradesmen at woolwich were perhaps more cautious than people elsewhere how they engaged the services of young lads in consequence of that place being a station for the convicthulks and i therefore resolved to try my luck in another quarter i set out for greenwich which i reached at midnight and slept till morning in a shed near some houses that were being built cold famished and dispirited did i awake and with a sinking heart i commenced my rounds before noon i had called at a hundred shops publichouses or taverns without success few required the service of boys and those people who did demanded references i begged a piece of bread of a baker and then set off for london so slow did i walk and so often was i compelled to rest that it was evening before i reached the blackfriars road there again did i endeavour to procure honest employmentbut in vain i remember that when one shopkeeperan old manlistened to me with more attention than the rest i burst into tears and imploredbesoughtprayed him to receive me into his service if it was only to save me from becoming a thief i did not tell him i had already been one but he shook his head saying sorrowfully if you have already thought of turning thief your morals must be more than half corruptedhe gave me a few halfpence and i went away i balanced for some minutes between the cravings of my stomach and the fatigue of my limbsthat is whether i should spend those halfpence in food or on a bed i decided in favour of the food and having satisfied my hunger crept into a timberyard on the bank of the thames and slept there till morning i awoke at sunrise and crossed blackfriars bridge my limbs shivered with ague and my clothes were damp with the dews of night i knew not what to dowhich way to turn hope had deserted me there was i a poorwretchedhouselessfriendlessstarving being anxious to remain honest yet impelled by circumstances towards a relapse into the career of vice i prayed as i went along the streetsyes i prayed to god to save me from that dreadfulthat last resource but no succour came all day long did i rove about night arrived againand for twentyfour hours i had eaten nothing i dragged myself back to the timber yard but there was a great dog prowling aboutand i dared not enter i sought shelter elsewhere for the rain began to descend in torrents but i was wet through before i could even find the entrance of a court to screen me i never slept a wink that night i was afraid to lie down on the cold stonesthey were so chill morning came againand i was now so weak that i could hardly put one foot before another i was moreover starvingyes starving i passed a bakers shop and saw the nice hot bread smoking in the windows and i went in to implore a stale crust but i was ordered out and then the idea struck me that in a few minutes i might obtain money to buy a good breakfastnot only bread but meat and tea that was by picking a pocket the idea however assumed a horrible aspect a moment afterwardsand i recoiled from it no i would sooner plunge into the river and end my woes therethan steal again to the rivers brink i hurrieddragging myself slowly no morebut running yesabsolutely running fast to terminate my wretchedness by suicide it was near westminster bridge that i was on the point of throwing myself into the thames when my collar was suddenly grasped from behind and i was drawn back i turnedand saw old death then i uttered a scream and struggled dreadfully to get away that i might still accomplish my purpose but he held me tight saying silly boy why do you fly from life since it may yet have many pleasures for youno i cried i will never become a thief againand i will never ask you to do so he replied but come with me and let us talk over your prospectsprospects i repeated in a hysterical manner and then i followed him mechanically to an early breakfasthouse close by he ordered a plentiful meal and i ate ravenously the food and hot coffee cheered me and i began to feel grateful to bones for having supplied the means to appease the hunger that was devouring me moreover one looks with quite a different eye upon suicide after a good meal and i could not do otherwise than regard him as the saviour of my life i was therefore already prepared to listen to him with attention and when he proposed that we should repair to bunces where we could converse without fear of being overheard i willingly agreed to accompany him but during our walk to seven dials i constantly repeated within my own breast the most solemn vows not to yield to any threats or representationsmenaces or coaxingsto induce me to become a thief again when we reached the house in earl street mrs bunce received me with more kindness than i had expected to meet at her hands after the trick i had played her a few days before at woolwich but she did not treat me thus without a motive for when once she and old death got me between them they endeavoured to the utmost of their power to persuade me to resume my old avocations i was faithful to my vow and assured them that they might kill me sooner than i would again do any thing to risk imprisonment in that horrible newgate it was not the hulk i so much dreadednor yet transportation because i knew nothing of it but i shrunk from the mere idea of going through the ordeal of newgate a second time old death saw that i was not to be movedat least then and he gave up the point but said he you must do something to get a living you cant starve and we wont maintain you in idleness if you like ill take you into my service to run on errands look after people that i want to learn any thing about and make yourself useful in that way and ill give you a shilling adayi agreedfor i could not starve now of course it is as plain to you as it was even then to me that old death was playing a deep game with me i was the cleverest thief that ever served him and he had received ampleample proofs that he could trust me he knew that he was safe with me i was therefore too useful a person to lose and he thought that by throwing me again amongst my old companions and keeping me on very short allowance the disagreeable impressions of gaol would soon wear away and i should relapse into my old habits he was quite mistaken i dont pretend that any particular idea of virtue made a great change in me but i had been in newgateand there i had seen a man going out to be hanged and i thought that if i got into that dreadful gaol a second time i should become hardened and that i also should go out some day to be hanged so i resisted all temptationand lived as well as i could on the shilling a day without increasing my means by theft or villany this mode of life on my part did not suit old death a few weeks passed and when he found that i was resolved not to return to my former ways he stopped my allowance altogether i was now steeped to the very lips in wretchedness and misery but somehow or another i managed to get a crust here and there just to keep body and soul togetheralthough i oftener slept in the open air than in a bed mrs bunce showed me a little kindness now and then but quite unknown to old death and to my surprise she did not urge the necessity of my returning to the career of theft for several weeks i saw nothing of mr bones but at last he fished me out in some low place and told me i might return into his service if i liked and that he should pay me according to the use i proved myself to be to him to glean information for himrun on errandsdog and watch personsor even loiter about in policecourts to hear what cases came up before the magistratesthese were my chief duties and badly enough they were paid but i was now permitted to get my breakfast and tea regularly at the bunces and that was something as for my lodging if i got together a few pence to enable me to hire a bed or a part of a bed in one of those low houses that i have already described to you i was contentedfor i always had this consolation that i could walk about the streets without being afraid of meeting a bowstreet runner jacob pausedfor his tale was told well my boy said tom rain you have gone through much and seen enough to form a good stock of experience i commend your resolution never to put yourself within reach of the law again for thats just my determination also you have got money in your pocket now and i will do something more for you before i leave england ah mr rainford exclaimed jacob much affected how i wish that i had met with such a friend as you earlier in life and how i wish too that i could go with youwherever you are goingand be your servantyour slave wellwell jacob we will talk of that another time said tom rest assured i will not desert you call at tullocks on monday evening and you will either see me there or find a note from me jacob was overjoyed at the species of promise thus held out to him and as it was now midnight rainford intimated his intention of taking his departure from the publichouse where he had passed the evening with the poor lad when they had issued from the door the highwayman bade jacob good night and they separatedpursuing different roads in fact jacob went towards leather lane while tom rainford repaired in the direction of the lodgings which he at present occupied in grays inn lanehe having removed to that locality from his former abode in locks fields footnote the discipline of criminal prisons was particularly lax at the time of which jacob smith is supposed to be speaking footnote this dreadful state of things continued in the new prison clerkenwell up to the year footnote the report of the prison inspectors of the home district contains these observations upon the state of newgatethe association of prisoners of all ages and every shade of guilt in one indiscriminate mass is a frightful feature in the system which prevails here the first in magnitude and the most pernicious in effect in this prison we find that the young and the oldthe inexperienced and the practical offenderthe criminal who is smitten with a conviction of his guilt and the hardened villain whom scarcely any penal discipline can subdue are congregated together with an utter disregard to all moral distinctions the interest of the prisoners or the welfare of the community in such a state of things can it be a matter of wonder that the effects should be such as have been described every other evil is aggravated by this and it would be worse than idle to attempt a remedy for the rest while this demoralising intermixture of criminals of all ages and degrees of guilt is suffered to frustrate the very ends of prison discipline and to give tenfold violence to all their mischievous inclinations and passions upon which it is incessantly operating and which is the design of justice to discourage and repress apart from higher considerations sound policy demands that such a system should be instantly rectified for so long as it continues society is nursing a moral pestilence in its bosom and maintaining an institution in which are forged those weapons that are destined to be wielded with fatal dexterity against the community itself every device by which the fences of property may be overcome is here framed and divulged to ready agents every fraudulent artifice every successful trick every ingenious mode of overreaching the cautious or of plundering the unguarded is perfected here and communicated to those who had not hitherto been initiated in the mysteries of crime but the most distressing circumstance connected with this system is the cruel indifference with which it regards the condition and necessities of those on whom the extreme penalty of the law is doomed to fall prisoners actually awaiting the execution of the awful sentence of death are placed by the evil influence of companionship in the most unfavourable circumstances for selfreflection religion and humanity combine to point out the imperative necessity of providing men brought by the sentence of the law to the verge of eternity with the means of spiritual improvement and consolation but the system of prison discipline in newgate practically defeats every such merciful design no human authority has a right thus to trifle with the eternal interests of a dying criminal against this serious evil the chaplain has repeatedly and loudly protested and it is in evidence that the unhappy victims themselves have earnestly implored the officers to deliver them from a situation in which it was impossible for them to devote the few remaining hours that the law allowed them to reflection and prayer the companions in guilt of these wretched men become further hardened by the influence of this association the indulgence of thoughtless apathy unfeeling mirth or revolting ribaldry are productive of incalculable mischief to the minds of those who are subjected to their influence the prisoner who witnesses with levity or indifference the last moments of a culprit in newgate comes forth a greater villain than when he went in in him the evil principle has done its work and the very exhibition of terror which justice designed for the reclaiming of the survivors by a perversion of moral influence irremediably hardens the heart which it was intended to soften and amend if human ingenuity were tasked to devise means by which the most profligate of men might be rendered abandoned to the last degree of moral infamy nothing more effectual could be invented than the system now actually in operation within the walls of the first metropolitan prison in england footnote fact chapter xli fresh alarms rainford was within twenty yards of the house in which he dwelt when a woman jostled him somewhat violently as she endeavoured to pass him while pursuing the same direction there was no excuse for this rudeness on her part inasmuch as the pavement was wide in that particular spot and no other person was on the footway i beg your pardon sir said the female im surebut bless me she cried in a shrill unmistakeable voiceif it isnt mr rainford ah mrs bunce returned the highwayman what are you doing in this neighbourhood so late im going to pass the night with a relation of mine thats ill and which lives at the top of the lane answered mrs bunce but oh mr rainford what a shocking thing this is about poor dear mr bones what ejaculated tom with a kind of guilty start why sirhes dead poor man sobbed mrs bunce dead and buried sir deadand buried repeated the highwayman mechanically and how came you to know this his friend mr tidmarsh came and told me and toby about it this blessed morning and in the afternoon we all followed the poor old gentleman to the grave in clerkenwell churchyard his death was sudden then said tom anxious to glean how far the woman might be informed relative to the particulars of the event which she was deploring mr tidmarsh isnt given to gossiping sir replied mrs bunce and he said very little about it it was quite enough for us to know that the poor dear old gentleman is goneand without having made any will either so me and toby are thrown as you may say on the wide world without a friend to help us but mr bones was richvery richwas he not demanded tom who felt particularly uncomfortable at this confirmation of his worst fearsfor he to some extent looked upon himself as the cause of the old fences sudden death rich god bless ye ah as rich as a king exclaimed mrs bunce but no one knows where he kept his moneyunless it is that tidmarsh and where did he die asked rainford at tidmarshs own place in turnmill street clerkenwell was the answer poor old man but you must have seen him only a short time before he went off mr rainford she added as if recollecting the fact for it was on that very night when he took toby and jacob over with him to a house in locks fields and which turned out to be where you lived you know he stayed with you while jacob and toby went away poor old man hes a great lossa very great loss were you so dependent on him then asked rainford yes almost entirely as i may say was the reply and then theres poor jacob too what in the world hell do im sure i cant sayfor me and toby cant afford to keep him now that our best friends gone but good night mr rainford i must go on to my cousinsfor its very late and she may be will pop off the hooks before i get to her good night returned tom slackening his pace so as to allow the woman to proceed as far ahead of him as possible ere he entered his own dwelling which was now close at hand in a few moments the form of mrs bunce was lost in the darkness of the night rainford was now convinced that old death was indeed no morethat no prompt assistance had resuscitated him even if the vital spark were not extinct at the moment when he saw him for the last time bound to the chair at the house in red lion street yesit was clear enoughtoo clear benjamin bones was deadand tidmarsh had pounced upon all his property welllet him enjoy it thought rainford within himself i have enough for my purposes and do not wish to dispute the inheritance with himeven if i had the right or the power and yetand yet he mused with a feeling like a contraction of the heart i would give ten years of my own life so that i had not been the instrument of abridging his but its too late to repent or regret repent did i say i have nothing to repent of i did not do this deed wilfully it was not murder and as for any share that i had in the matter at all that does not seem to be suspected oh i can understand master tidmarshs proceedings it was no doubt he who entered the room just at the moment when i discovered that old death was dead of course he would say nothing about finding him tied in a chair or of me having been with him that night a word on these heads would have excited suspicionsled to inquiriescoroners inquestand all that sort of thing then some relation might have turned up claimed the property and cut tidmarsh out yesyes it is plain enoughand tidmarsh is a prudent as well as a lucky fellow but what could the laboratory in that house mean what were those pickled human heads kept in the cupboard for and why was dr lascelles familiar with that den even in the midst of his musings rainford did not hazard a conjecture to account for the mysteries just enumerated they indeed appeared unaccountable the highwayman walked some distance past the door of his lodgings to convince himself that he was not watched by mrs bunce and having assured himself on that headat least so far as he could judge in the darkness of the nighthe turned back and entered his dwelling the next day was the sabbath and rainford was sitting after breakfast reading a sunday paper in the neat parlour of his lodgings on the other side of the fire sate a youngbeautifuland darkeyed womanin all the rich flush of jewish beautythe softly sweeping outline and symmetrical undulations of her form being developed rather than concealed by the loose morning wrapper which she wore while the ray of the frosty mornings sun glanced on the glossy surface of her raven hair little charley watts nicely dressed and with his rosy countenance wearing the smiles of happy innocence was seated on a footstool near tom rain looking at a picturebook but every now and then glancing affectionately towards those whom he had already learnt to love as if they were his parents do the advertisements tell you when the next ship will sail from liverpool for new york tom inquired the lady next friday my love answered rainford we will therefore leave london on thursday four more days remarked his female companion oh how glad i shall be when we are out of sight of england and yet she added with a profound sigh i can scarcely bear the thought of partingperhaps for ever you must not give way to those mournful reflections interrupted tom in a kind tone remember that we are going to a country where my personal safety will not be endangeredwhere we shall not be obliged to shift our lodgings halfadozen times in a fortnightand where too we need not start at every knock that comes to the door we shall be as happy as the day is long and with the money which i now have at my disposal i may embark in some honest pursuit and earn myself a good name the money will be at the new york bankers before we reach america i suppose said the lady inquiringly to be sure replied tom since i paid it all into the hands of the london agent two days ago have you taken care of the receipt or acknowledgment i locked it up in the little iron box together with all your other papers was the answer and those documents that i brought home with me the other nightor rather morning all safe dear tom but really when you allude to that dreadful night you make me shudder oh how longhow long did those weary hours seem until you returned when you came up into the bedroom and told me that you were going away with that dreadful man bonesthat the time had at length comethat opportunity had at last served your purposes well my dear girli recollect all that took place interrupted tom laughing you begged me not to go with himyou said you had your misgivings but i was resolvedfor such an occasion might not have occurred again did i not tell you beforehand when we were down in the country that if i came up to london and purposely threw myself in the way of old death accident would be sure sooner or later to enable me to wrench from his grasp that gold of which he had plundered me and have not my words come true you must not reproach me now dear girl at all eventsfor the danger is over yesand the dreadful man is dead exclaimed the jewess in a tone which expressed a thanksgiving so unequivocally that a cloud for a moment gathered on rainfords brow he is deadand can molest us no more he observed in a serious tone but i could have wishedhowever he added abruptly let us avoid that subject it is not altogether an agreeable one and now to return to our intended departure for america i am somewhat at a loss how to act in respect to that letter which i obtained last night from jacob smith and which so deeply regards he paused and glanced significantly towards charley what can you do in the matter tom said his beautiful companion the letter is too ambiguous scarcely ambiguousbut deficient in certain points of information interrupted rainford which is equally mortifying added the jewess you cannot risk your safety by remaining in england to investigate the affaireven if we had not gone so far in our arrangements for departure certainly not replied tom but i was thinking that i would entrust the letter to my friend clarence villiers and who knows but that some accident may sooner or later throw him into the way of sifting the mystery to the very bottom your project is an excellent one answered the jewess but are you sure that he does not suspect suspect what i really am ejaculated the highwayman with that blithe merry laugh of his which showed his fine white teeth to such advantage not he he does not know sir christopher bluntnor the lawyer howard and his acquaintance with that consummate fool frank curtis was always slight and not likely to be improved by all that has occurred for frank must suspect that clarence had something to do with the elopement of old torrenss daughters so all things considered clarence cannot have heard of the little affair by which sir christopher lost his two thousand pounds then you will entrust mr villiers with the letter said the lady inquiringly yes i will call upon him this evening responded tom for i have a little hint to give him relative to a certain aunt of his at this moment there was a knock at the frontdoor of the house and the servant presently made her appearance to inform rainford that a young man named jacob smith wished to speak to him toms brow darkenedas the thought flashed across him that the lad had dogged him on the preceding night but instantly recovering his selfpossession he desired the jewess and charley to retire to another room while he received the visitor when jacob entered the parlour rainford looked sternly at him but said nothing i know what iswhat must be passing in your mind sir said jacob hastily but you wrong methat is if you think i found out your address by any underhand means of my own sit down my boy cried tom frankly i am sorry if i suspected you even for an instant but what has brought you here this morning and how i will explain all in a few moments mr rainford said jacob two hours agoat about eight oclocki went up to bunces just to see if they had heard any thing of old death and to my surprise i learnt that he was buried yesterday so i have already heard but go on you know i told you last night that yesterday morning two or three people called in earl street to inquire about old death as he had promised to get a thief off at the policecourt wellat that time it seems neither mrs bunce or toby knew what had become of mr bones but just afterwards as im told and when i had gone away from the house up goes old tidmarsh the fence with the news that mr bones was dead and that the funeral was going to take place in a couple of hours quick work wasnt it sir so toby bunce and his wife went to the funeral and now its certain what has really become of old death tidmarsh told them he died suddenly three or four days ago at his houseof apoplexy im sure he didnt look much like an apoplectic man the best part of all this i learnt last night soon after i left you said rainford and i only heard it when i went up to bunces this morning remarked jacob well sirwhen mrs bunce had told me this she said jacob i want you to do a particular favour for me and i will give you a sovereigni asked her what it was im pretty sure she says that mr rainford lives somewhere in grays inn lane between liquorpond street and calthorpe street on the same side of the way as those streets and you must find out where it is became i want particularly to knowso i promised her i would and i of course took good care not to say that i had seen you last night but i was determined to give you notice of mrs bunces desire to have you watched and i have been knocking at every door in the neighbourhood asking if such a gentleman as yourself lived there in describing you however i did not mention any name that was right jacob said tom because i am not known as rainford here but what the devil can that old wretch want with me has she inherited old deaths scheming disposition or does his vengeance pursue me even from the tomb these last words were totally unintelligible to jacob who knew not that the highwayman had had any share in the death of mr benjamin bones of course sir remarked the lad after a pause i shall go to mrs bunce this evening and assure her that no such person as yourself lives in this neighbourhood i hope you are not offended with me for hunting after you far from it jacob returned tom for i am sure i can trust you at the same time you must be cautious how you act so as not to let mrs bunce imagine that you are playing her false try and find out what she wants with me and meet me at tullocks tomorrow evening between seven and eight nonot at tullocks eitherbecause that woman knows i am in the habit of going there but come to me at the publichouse in baldwins buildings where we were last night remembertomorrow evening at about halfpast seven i shall not fail sir responded jacob and he then took his departure the moment he was gone rainford hastened up stairs to the bedroom whither the jewess and little charley had retired and closing the door he said my dear girl we must be off directly that horrid woman mrs bunce of whom i have spoken to you is after meand i am afraid for no good off exclaimed the lady whatto liverpool at once no but to another lodgingor to a tavern ratherfor it will be difficult to obtain apartments on a sunday i must stay in town for a day or two longeror at least till i have seen villiers comepack up your things my loveand let us be gone are you afraid of that lad who has just been demanded the jewess not a whit he is staunch to the backbonei will swear to it but he might be followedor he might commit himself somehow or another and betray me involuntarily bythebye ejaculated tom after an instants pause i tell you what we will do we will return to locks fields it is clear that mrs bunce has found out that we are not living there nowotherwise she would not have set this jacob to watch me which she has done and she would never suspect that we have gone back to our old quarters so look alive my love and pack up the things while i settle with our landlady here and send for a coach tom rains directions were speedily obeyed and by midday the jewess charley and himself were once more located in locks fields chapter xlii the paragraph in the newspaper having partaken of a good dinner and imbibed a glass or two of wine tom rain returned to the perusal of the sunday newspaper which he had brought with him to his old lodgings for the highwayman loved a newspaper dearlyespecially the police reports and old bailey trials but as his eye glanced down a column principally devoted to fashionable intelligence he was struck with mingled horror and astonishment by the ensuing announcement it is rumoured that the young and wealthy earl of ellingham will shortly lead to the hymeneal altar the beautiful and accomplished lady hatfield her ladyship is a peeress in her own right that distinction having been conferred upon her in consequence of the eminent services of her ladyships deceased father tom rain was absolutely stupefied by this paragraphso stupefied indeed that he sate gazing upon it in a species of vacant wondermentnot starting nor uttering any ejaculationso that neither the jewess nor charley watts who were both in the room noticed his emotion at length he recovered himself and read and reread the paragraph until he could have repeated it by heart the shades of evening were gathering fast over this hemisphere and he had therefore now a good excuse for going outfor that announcement in the sunday paper had produced such an effect upon him that he felt he could not rest until he had performed a dutyan imperious but most painful duty illustration having hastily arranged his toilette in the bedroom up stairs and put on a dark upper coat and a large woollen comforter he sallied forthbut not without having previously kissed both the jewess and little charley at the nearest coachstand he entered a hackvehicle and ordered the driver to take him to the residence of lady hatfield in piccadilly but ere the coach arrived quite opposite the front door of the fair patricians abode rainford alighted and dismissed the vehicle then he advanced to the housebut it was with the step of a man who would ratheroh a thousand times ratherhave fled in any other direction his hand was on the knocker and he hesitatedyes he hesitated and that hand trembled it must have been some powerful cause that could have made the gallantdauntlessalmost hairbrained tom rain manifest so much emotion but at length the summons was given and a liveryservant opened the door to rainfords inquiry whether lady hatfield were at home an affirmative answer was given say to your mistress returned the highwayman that a person wishes to speak to her upon very particular businessand do me the favour to show me to a room where i can see her ladyship alone the servant hesitated a momentfor the excited tone in which the request was made somewhat surprised him but remembering that it was not his business to question his ladys visitors he conducted rainford into a parlour where a fire was burning in the grate and having lighted the candles the domestic retired to deliver to lady hatfield the message which he had received the few minutes which elapsed ere the door of that room again opened seemed like an age to tom rain he first sate down then he rose again and stood before the fire in a state of extraordinary nervousness in fact he appeared perfectly unmanned we can conceive the feelings of appalling doubthope mingled with terrific fearand agonising suspense that must be experienced by an individual accused of a capital crime and awaiting in the dock the return of the jury in whose hands are his life and death such was the state of tom rain during the five mortal minutes that elapsed ere the door again opened at length it did openand though he had his back turned towards it yet the rustling of silk and a light airy tread convinced him that the lady of the house was now in that room he turned the light streamed full upon his countenancefor he had laid aside his hat and woollen comforter and lady hatfieldfor it was sheuttered a faint scream as her eyes met his pardon this intrusionfear me not now my lady exclaimed rainford hastily but grant me five minutes attention i implore younot for my sakefor yours georgiana had started back and had become pale as death when she recognised the highwayman but even while he was yet speaking she recovered herself sufficiently to approach the spot where he was standing then without sitting downbut leaning her arm upon the mantelpiece as if for supportshe said in a hoarse and hollow tone my god what would you with me lady hatfield returned rainford in a mournful and even solemn tone forget the pastif you canfor a few minutes forget the past repealed georgiana hysterically her whole frame convulsed with horror oh terrible man wherefore have you come hither have you not injured me enough what do you now seekmy life and as she uttered these last words the syllables seemed to hiss between her set teethand her bosom heaved and fell rapidly with spasmodic palpitation listen to me madami implore you exclaimed rainford cruelly perplexed and deeply touched by the agonising emotions which his presence occasioned i know that the sight of me must be abhorrentloathsome to you but it will be your fault if our interview is protracted beyond the few minutes which i ask you to grant me speak sirspeak quickly cried georgiana hysterically but mark me sir she added in a firmer and more resolute tone while her usually placid glances seemed to glare with deadly hatred against the highwaymanmark me she repeatedif your intention be to coerce me again to commit a crime for your sake you will not succeed but a few days have elapsed since the stain of perjuryrank abhorrent perjurywas fastened on my souland to save you oh that i could have been so weak as to yield to your insolent command to swear to that which was falseatrociously vilely false at the bar of justice and now proceed sir with the business which has brought you hither lady hatfieldi cannot i dare not explain myself while you labour under this dreadful excitement said rainford himself painfully excited calm yourself i implore youfor what i have to say most nearly concerns your interests my interests repeated georgiana in a sorrowful voice but proceedgo on siri will be calm i observed in a newspaper of this days date continued rainford that your ladyship is about to become the wife of the earl of ellingham lady hatfield gazed upon the highwayman in that vacant manner which left it doubtful whether she were the prey to feelings of surpriseterroror despair and if that rumour be true my lady added rainford after a moments pause i would have you reflect on the propriety of this matrimonial connexion my god he assumes a right to dictate to me almost shrieked georgiana as she sank back upon a sofa clasping her hands together in the excess of her mental anguish nomy ladynot to dictate said rainford i have not a shadow of a right to do that it were the height of madnessthe height of presumptionan insolence beyond all parallel on my partin fact a deed so monstrously inconsistent with even common sense that you are surprised i should have entertained the idea added georgiana with an irony and bitterness which seemed lent her by despair my god i foresaw all the terrors of this interview exclaimed rainford with feverish impatience then wherefore did you come demanded georgiana is it to expose meto persecute me who have never offended you but who have suffered so deeplydeeply madam i came to perform a painful duty interrupted the highwayman and the sooner i accomplish it the better oh you know notyou will not give me credit for the ineffable pitythe profound commiseration which i feel for youas well as the loathingthe abhorrencethe shamethe disgust in which i hold myselfbut i cannot recall the past would to god that i could then you mean me no harm exclaimed georgiana eagerly mean you harm madam repeated rainford enthusiastically merciful heavens if to mitigate one single pang of the manymany with which your breast must throb poor innocent sufferer that you area sufferer through my detestable crimeif to relieve you of any portion of the load that weighs upon your mindwere that portion no heavier than a hairif to do this my life would suffice i would lay it down madam at your feet think you that i glory in what i have done nono bad as i amcriminal as i amrobber plunderer as i am and as you know me to beyet i have feelingsaye and a conscience too and oftenoften my lady when the smile is upon my lip that conscience is gnawing my hearts corefor i think of you and all this is true as gods own justice is truetrue as that you are an innocent and a noble lady and that i am a despicable villain and tom rainthe gallant dashing almost hairbrained tom rainburst into tears georgiana gazed upon him in astonishmentin profound astonishment and she was softened towards that bold and desperate man who wept on her account but wherefore have you sought me this evening she said in a milder and more gentle tone than she had yet used during this remarkablethis solemnly interesting meeting it is not to demand your pardon madam returned rainford dashing away the tears from his manly countenance because that you can never give it is not to assert any presumed right to dictate to you in respect to your marriage because that were adding the most flagrant cruelty to the most atrocious wrong but it is to inform your ladyship that if you contract this marriage with the earl of ellingham you wed one who is who is what gasped georgiana almost suffocating rainford paused for a few moments it required these few moments to enable him to conquer emotions of so terrible a nature that they almost choked his powers of utterancethen bending down until his very lips touched georgianas ear and his hair mingled with hers he whispered a few words in a faint and scarcely audible tone but she heard them plainlyoh far too plainly and when he withdrew his face from its proximity to her head and glanced upon her countenance he saw with feelings awfully shocked that she sate mutemotionlessthe image of despair alas she spoke notshe looked neither to the right nor to the left her eyes seemed to be fixed upon the face of the highwaymanand yet she saw him notshe was gazing on vacancy this dreadful state of stupefactionthe paralysis of despairlasted for upwards of three minutesa perfect age alike to her who endured and to him who beheld it then suddenly burst from lady hatfields lips a longloudpiercing screama scream so appalling that the very house appeared to shake with the vibration of the air which was cut by that shriek as by a keenedged sword merciful god the whole place will be alarmed ejaculated the highwayman compose yourself madam but vainly did he thus address himself to the unhappy georgiana she had fallen back insensible upon the sofa the door opened abruptly but tom rain was rooted to the spot where he stood gazing on the motionless form of that wretched ladystood gazing too in horrified amazement at the effect which his whispered words had produced the scream to which lady hatfield had given vent in the paroxysm of her ineffable anguish had reached the ears not only of the domestics in the kitchen but also of the company in the drawingroomfor there were guests that evening at georgianas residence thus when the door burst open a crowd of persons poured inlord ellingham dr lascelles sir ralph walsingham three or four ladies and all the servants miss mordaunt we should observe was no longer an inmate of lady hatfields abodefor reasons that will be explained hereafter lord ellingham was the foremost of the crowd and the first object that met his eyes as he rushed into the room was his georgiana stretched senseless on the sofa he saw a man standing near but did not pause to cast a second glance upon him the state in which he found his beloved engrossed all his thoughts he raised her in his armsthe ladies produced their smellingbottlesthe female servants hastened to fetch water vinegar and anything else that struck them as useful under the circumstancesand dr lascelles who had recognised tom rain though without appearing to do so professionally superintended all the means resorted to for the purpose of restoring suspended animationwhile the highwayman still looked on with a kind of mechanical attention at length georgiana opened her eyes slowly but the moment they caught a glimpse of lord ellinghams countenance a faint cry escaped her lipsand she covered her face with her hands as if to shut out some terrible object from her view georgiana dearesttis i murmured arthur in her ear but a dreadful shudder seemed to convulse her entire frame some one has terrified heralarmed her exclaimed the earl colouring with anger and as he glanced rapidly around his eyes met those of the highwayman at that moment dr lascelles desired that lady hatfield should be supported to her own chamber and this suggestion was immediately followed by the female friends and servants the physician accompanying them chapter xliii lord ellingham and tom rainford lord ellingham and sir ralph walsingham remained behind in the apartment where rainford also still was sir said the nobleman advancing towards the highwayman you will perhaps be kind enough to explain the cause of her ladyships emotionfor the scream which reached our ears and the condition in which we found her denote something more serious than sudden indisposition this gentleman sir added the earl indicating sir ralph walsingham with a glance is lady hatfields uncle you therefore need not hesitate to address yourself to himeven should you decline to vouchsafe an explanation to me who am a total stranger to you yes my lordfor i know you well by sightwe are total strangers to each other replied rainford in a singularly mournful tone and yet but he stopped short seized his hat and was about to hasten from the room when the earl caught him somewhat rudely by the arm sayingmr rainfordfor such i believe to be your namewe cannot part with you thus a ladydear very dear to me and who indeed will shortly be my wifedear also to sir ralph walsingham who is now presentthat lady has been alarmedterrified in some manner by you and we must insist upon an explanation my lord returned tom rain in a tone of deep emotion as he gazed with peculiaralmost scrutinising attention upon the earls countenanceno other man on earth would thus have dared to stop me with impunity as for explanations he continued his voice suddenly assuming a little of its usual reckless indifference i have none to give and again he moved towards the door but lord ellingham hastened to place his back against it in a determined manner while rainford as if discouraged and daunted fell back a few paces mr rainford exclaimed the earl this matter cannot pass off thus i insist upon an explanation or i shall consider it to be my duty to detain you until lady hatfield be sufficiently recovered to declare the nature of the treatment she has experienced at your hands moreover sir added the nobleman observing that rainfords lip blanched and quivered nervously you are to a certain degree an object of suspicion in my eyes a variety of circumstances have combined to prove to me that you were implicated to some degree in the theft of diamonds which lately caused so much embarrassment at the policecourt my lord that business does not regard you replied the highwayman the diamonds were restored to their lawful owner andmore than thati even ascertained from mr gordons own lips that they were paid for before their restoration by one whobut let me depart my lord i say ejaculated tom his manner suddenly changing from nervous trepidation to the excitement of impatience you must remain here sir said arthur coldly until we ascertain whether it be lady hatfields pleasure that your detention should assume a more serious aspect allow me to pass my dear earl exclaimed sir ralph and i will hasten to ascertain how my niece is now and what her intentions are with respect to this person rainford paced the room in an agitated manner while lord ellingham afforded egress to the baronet and then resumed his position of sentinel with his back placed against the door my lord at length said the highwayman advancing close up to the earl and speaking in a low oppressed tone you will find that her ladyship has no complaint to make against me permit me to take my departure and again i tell you that of no other living soul would i solicit as a favour what i would command by force i cannot allow you to leave this roomat least until the return of sir ralph walsingham answered the earl lady hatfield must have been insulted or menaced by you in some way i take god to witness that i neither insulted nor menaced her interrupted rainford warmly if your liberty be endangered said the nobleman it is well worth a falsehood to attempt to avert the peril my god this from him muttered rainford bitterly to himself as he once more turned round to pace the room then at the expiration of a minute he said in a calmer tone well my lordi am content to wait until the decision of her ladyship is made known in respect to me and since it appears that we shall have a few moments more of each others society permit me to askyour lordship having just now alluded to a certain transaction at a policecourtpermit me to ask i say whether you really believe that miss esther de medina was innocent or guilty of the charge imputed to her this is rather a singular questioncoming from you mr rainford exclaimed the earl and before i answer it allow me to ask whether it was not you who left a certain letter at my house desiring me to repair to the policeoffice on that occasion i will not deny the fact my lord replied rainford indeed i did not particularly study concealment respecting itelse would i not have afforded your lordships servants an opportunity of describing to you the personal appearance of the individual who left that letter but if your lordship entertains even the shadow of a suspicion injurious to the character of miss de medina you are wrongyou are in erroryesas grievously in error as ever mistaken man could be besides my lord added rainford hastily you are well aware that the alibi which your lordship proved was correct and how knew you that miss de medina was with her father and myself at finchley on the very day and at the very hour when the diamonds were alleged to have been taken demanded the earl it would be useless to pretend that accident gave me the information answered tom rain but think not that she employed me as an agent or as a messenger to obtain the intervention of your lordship mr rainford said the earl haughtily i dislike the present conversation i have the highest opinion of mr de medina and should be sorry to think ill of any one connected with him but i must candidly confess that there is so much mystery respecting the character of his daughtera mystery too existing on account of yourself for which reason alone do i condescend to discuss with you any affair relating to mr de medina or his family lord ellingham interrupted rainford in a hasty and impetuous tone esther de medina is the very personification of innocence and virtue as god is my judge she was ignorant of my interference in her behalf on that day when she was accused of a deed from which her pure soul would recoil with horrorshe knew not even that i was in the court and yet you were there mr rainford exclaimed the earl for i noticed youalthough at the time i knew not who you were but miss de medina was not aware of my presence rejoined rainford emphatically for she does not know me by sight a smile of incredulity curled the noblemans lipfor the oath which mr de medina had administered to his daughter and in which her connexion with rainford was so emphatically mentioned was uppermost in his mind but he dared not allude to that circumstance although he would have been truly rejoiced to receive the conviction that esther was indeed far different from what he was at present compelled to believe her to be your lordship said ere now resumed tom rain that you noticed me in the court although at the time you knew not who i was those were your words does your lordship now know who i am i cannot boast of a very intimate acquaintance with you or your affairs mr rainford returned the nobleman with a hauteur bordering on contempt and what i do know of you is so little in your favour that you see i am detaining you here on the suspicion that your visit to lady hatfield was for no good purpose in fact the first i ever heard of you was in reference to the charge on account of which you yourself figured at bow street some short time sincea charge of which i am bound to say you were honourably acquitted lady hatfield having satisfactorily proved that you were not the person who robbed her on the highway thus far my lord said rainford you have no just ground to speak disparagingly of my character certainly not but then comes the affair of the diamonds and i do not hesitate to inform you that mr gordon related to me all the particulars of your interview with him when you called to restore the jewels and when he made you aware of the fact that miss de medina had already been to pay him the full value thereof ah mr gordon was thus communicative observed rainford yesand not sparing of his aspersions against the character of miss de medina returned the earl but i defended her mr rainfordi defended her then and wherefore should you not defend her now my lord demanded the highwayman oh were i to reveal to you by what wondrous combination of circumstancesbut no i dare not and yet my lord he added in an earnest solemn tone you are an uprighta generoushearted man and i appeal to your good feelingsi implore you not to trust to outward appearances as there is a god above esther de medina is innocent of every thingany thing that scandal or misconception may have imputed to her again you smile incredulouslyand yet mournfully my lord ah i can assure you that esther is innocentoh believe her to be innocent at this moment footsteps were heard approaching the door which lord ellingham accordingly opened and sir ralph walsingham reappeared how is georgiana now inquired the nobleman hastily my niece is illvery ill returned the baronet ill ejaculated arthur ah villainthis is your work he cried rushing towards the highwayman keep off thundered rainford you know not whom you would strike notouch him not cried sir ralph catching the earl by the arm and holding him back i have seen my niecedr lascelles is now alone with her she is more composedthough very far from welland she begs that this person may be allowed to depart without the slightest molestation her ladyship shall be obeyed sir ralph returned the nobleman mr rainford you have heard the message that has been sent relative to yourself having thus spoken arthur turned asidefor a strange misgivinga vague suspicionno not a suspicion eitherbut a feeling of dissatisfaction had stolen into his mind if rainford had alarmed or insulted lady hatfield wherefore should she allow him to go unpunished was it not more probable that he had brought her some evil tidings but how could there exist any connexion however remote or slight between that man of equivocal character and georgiana hatfield what business could possibly bring them together and produce so strangeso powerful an impression upon her all these ideas rushed to the earls mind in rapid and bewildering succession and the reader need not be astonished if we repeat that a sentiment of dissatisfactionalmost amounting to a vague suspicion but of what he knew nothad suddenly taken a firm hold of his imagination who was this rainford after all was he other than he seemed could he be in any way connected with that narrative of the black mask which the earl supposed to have partially affected his georgianas mind and which he looked upon as the cause of that apparent fickleness or caprice which had first led her to refuse his proffered hand the more he involved himself in conjecture the deeper did he plunge into a labyrinth which grew darker and more bewildering at every step when he turned round again towards the place where he had left rainford standing that individual was gone and the noblemen was alone with sir ralph walsingham you have seen georgiana said arthur advancing towards the baronet and grasping his hand with the convulsive violence of deep emotion i have my dear earl and she appears as if she had received some severe shock was the reply what in the name of god does all this mean exclaimed the nobleman with wildness in his tone i know noti cannot comprehend it answered the uncle as much bewildered as the lover but did you not question your niece did she offer no explanation did she not state the cause of her emotionthat piercing screamthat faintingthat movement of horror when she recovered demanded the earl impatiently i questioned her but perceiving that it only augmented her agitation i did not press a painful interrogatory replied sir ralph when i informed her that you had detained that man whom i heard you address by the name of rainford and whom i therefore supposed to have been the person suspected of robbing my niecewhen i informed her that you had detained him i say she was greatly excited and desired me to hasten and request you to allow him to depart immediately as she had no cause of complaint against him strangemost strange murmured the earl have patience my dear arthur said sir ralph tomorrow georgiana will be better and then she will doubtless explain tomorrowtomorrow repeated the nobleman impatiently oh what suspensewhat terrible suspense ah sir ralph you know not how wretchedly will pass the weary hours of this night if i could but see heronly for a moment would it be indiscreet dear sir ralph have pity upon me and ask lascelles to come and speak to me the baronet who was a kindhearted man instantly departed to execute this commission and in a few minutes he returned accompanied by the physician to the latter the earl repeated the same question which he had already addressed to sir ralph walsinghamwhat in the name of god does all this mean and the doctor gave almost a similar replyi know noti cannot understand it but there was less sincerity in this answer as given by lascelles than there was in the same response as uttered from the heart by the frank and honest baronetfor the physician had his suspicions relative to the mysterious connexion which now appeared to subsist between lady hatfield and the individual whose visit had caused so much painful excitement that villain rainford i am sorry even now that i suffered him to escape ejaculated the earl scarcely knowing how to act or speak rainford cried the physician why that is the name of the man who was taken up on suspicion of having robbed her ladyship near hounslow and that was thomas rainford who was here ere now returned arthur with bitter emphasis as if he hated the name rainford repeated the physician in astonishment i thought that mans name was jameson the reader will remember that such was the denomination under which the highwayman passed when residing in south moulton street what do you know him demanded the earl gazing upon the doctor with unfeigned surprise i once attended a patient at his abode was the laconic reply for lascelles remembered the solemn promise which he had made to tom rain on that occasion and where did he live inquired arthur eagerly i may wish to see that man again where he lived then he does not live now returned the physician for he moved away the very next day after i was called in and whither he went to the people of the house knew not i believe him to be a man of bad character observed arthur hastily but enough of himat least for the present doctor can i be permitted to see lady hatfield for a few minutes impossible for tonight my dear earl replied the physician her ladyship is in a state of nervous agitationfeverish excitement indeedand must not be disturbed her maids are now with her and she is about to retire to rest tomorrow my dear ellingham you shall see herthat is provided she is more composed then must i submit to this weary night of suspense exclaimed the young nobleman but tomorrow doctor i may see her you have promised that i shall see her tomorrow my visit will be somewhat early will it be indiscreet if i call at eleven call at eleven then returned the physician smiling at his friends impatience but i think i ought to administer a composing draught to you the earl and sir ralph walsingham shook hands with dr lascelles and took their departure the other guests had already gone but the physician remained behind to see his fair patient once more ere he returned home when lascelles found himself alone in the apartment which the young nobleman and the baronet had just left he fell into a train of reflection which like the earls state of mind was strangely characterised by perplexity were the doctors thoughts put into words they would assume as nearly as possible the ensuing shape well this is an evening of unpleasant adventure that jameson or rainford or whatever his name is has brought confusion and dismay into the house perplexities increase rapidly i remember all that ellingham said to me the day that he called to inform me that he was the happiest of men and that her ladyship had accepted him he declared then that he knew allthat he would never allow what must be considered a misfortune to stand in the way of his happinessand so on i also remember complimenting him on his moral courage in rising superior to a common prejudice and then we dropped the conversation because we agreed that it was a delicate subject and so it was too a devilish delicate subject and i had found out the grand secret by stealth ah the effects of that opiate were powerful and she has never suspected that i did find out the secret but ellingham scarcely seems to have his wits about him or else he must suspect the object of this rainfords visit its as clear as daylight rainford is the manand now he wants to extort money from her ladyship but ellingham cannot put two and two together as i canand the physician rubbed his hands complacently little suspecting that his sapient conjecture relative to the object of the highwaymans visit was totally wrong as the reader is awarethis rainford is an extraordinary character and i do believe that he really robbed her ladyship but that she did not dare say so in the policecourt he has the cut of a dashing fellow who would as soon rifle a pocket as drink a bumper of wine curse him for having intruded on the mysteries of my laboratory oh if ellingham only knew what i know about the beautiful esther de medinathe charming jewess what deceivers some women are to look on esther one would think she was purity itself and yet the physicians reverie was interrupted by the entrance of a female servant who came to inform him that lady hatfield had retired to her bed and that the doctor might now visit her again he accordingly repaired to her chamber and having prescribed some composing medicine took his departure without once alluding to the incidents of the evening for he was anxious that georgianas mind should remain as free from causes of excitement and agitation as possible chapter xliv mr frank curtis again in the meantime thomas rainford had quitted the abode of lady hatfield with a heavy heart for the duty which he had felt himself called upon to perform in making a particular statement to georgiana had painedacutely pained his generous soul he had not proceeded many yards from that ladys dwelling when he suddenly encountered mr frank curtis and as at that precise moment the glare of a lamp streamed full upon rainfords countenance he was immediately recognised by that impertinent young gentleman ah captain sparks ejaculated frank so we meet again do we well its very fortunate that i did not accept my friend the dukes invitation to his select dinnerparty or else i should have missed this pleasure now what is to prevent me from collaring you my fine fellow and raising a hue and cry fear mr curtisfear will prevent you returned tom rain recovering all his wonted presence of mind and taking the young mans arm he said walk a little way with me i want to have a few minutes chat with you hereput your hand on my great coat pocket thats right now you can feel a pistol insideeh well its companion is in the other pocket and you must know enough of me already to be fully aware that any treachery on your part would meet with its reward for i would shoot you in the open street if you attempted to place my liberty in danger im sure ii dont want to injure you captain sparks stammered frank trembling from head to foot as he walked along arminarm with the highwayman i always took you for a capital fellowand i should very much like to drink a bottle of wine with you what do you say shall we go into the gloucester or hatchetts neither one nor the other mr curtis interrupted rainford i thank you for your civility all the same oh its nothing captain i learnt politeness in france where to be sure i had excellenti may say peculiar advantages the king was very much attached to meand as for the ladies of the courtoh dont ask me to speak about them captain sparks indeed i will not returned tom drily i want you to let me know how your uncle gets on does he still remember that pleasant little adventureha haand the highwaymans merry laugh denoted that his spirits were reviving once more sir christopher oh the old fooldont talk to me about him ejaculated frank curtis i have done with my unclei shall cut himi can never speak to him again captain sparks he has disgraced himselfdisgraced his family which was a very ancient one i always thought sir christopher made a boast of having risen from nothing said tom ironically ah so he did but that was only a part of his system of gammoning people continued frank his family was originally the celebrated blondevilles of france about three thousand years ago they settled in scotland and their name was corrupted to blundevilthen a branch came to england about fifteen hundred years ago and in process of time they spelt their name with a tbluntevil at last the e was left out and it became bluntvil and god only knows why but three hundred and seventyseven years ago come next michaelmas the vil was dropped and the name settled down into simple blunt so you see captain that sir christopher is of a good family after all why dont you try and get a situation in the heralds college demanded rainford you would be able to find pedigrees for all the browns joness thompsons and smiths in the country comecome captain sparks exclaimed frank this observation isnt fair on your part i may have my faultsi know i have but i dont shoot with the long bow i hate that kind of thing but let us return to the subject of your uncle sir christopher said tom what has he been doing run away with a ladysmaidgone to gretna with lady hatfields female servant charlotte cried frank with great bitterness of tone the damned old foolbut ill cut himcut him deadand thats some consolation gone to gretna with lady hatfields maid exclaimed rainford maid indeed i hope hell find her so said curtis the hussey but ill be even with her yet and when did this happen inquired tom oh only a few days ago they are not come back yet i dare say sir christopher already repents his bargain but ill cut him im afraid if you cut his acquaintance hell cut off your supplies observed rainford jocosely and what does that matter ejaculated frank do you think there are no rich women in london that would be glad to have a decentlooking fellow like myself egad ive already got introduced to a widow as wealthy as if her late husband had been a nabob its true that shes blest with five pledges of the said late husbands affection but then shes got five thousand ayearand one five is a good setoff against the other captain sparks rather soeh old fellow well i think it is returned the highwayman but how did all this happen about sir christopher and the ladysmaid ill tell you answered curtis you see sir christopher was going to run away with miss mordaunt lady hatfields friend and i found it out in one of my clever ways so i resolved to baulk sir christopher and i bribed this ladysmaid charlottein fact i gave her five hundred pounds and a gold watch the husseyto go to the appointment get into the carriage personate miss julia mordaunt and keep up the farce until they got to st albans where me and a parcel of my friends were to be at the inn to receive them that was to be the joke and how did the joke turn so completely against yourself asked tom why me and my friends waitedand waitedand waited at the infernal hotel at st albans and no sir christopherno charlotte came we had a glorious supper and made a regular night of it all next day we waitedand waited again but no sir christopherno charlotte what the devil can this mean thought i to myself so i came up to london leaving my friends at the inn at st albans in pawn for the billfor somehow or another none of us had money enough about us to settle it well when i came back to town i went home that is you know to my uncles house in jermyn street and there i found a letter that had just come for me by the post it was written from some town a good way north and was from sir christopher i began to think something was wrong and sure enough there was for when i opened the letter i found that my silly old uncle had written to thank me for throwing in his way a delightful and most amiable woman who had consented to take his name and share his fortune the letter went on to say that they were then pretty far on their road to gretna and that as they should stop at st albans as they came back i might be there if i chose to have the pleasure of handing my aunt out of the carriage that was all said to irritate me you know captain sparks and most likely that vixen charlotte made sir christopher write the letter just to annoy me but ill cut them both dead and we shall see what my precious auntfor such she is by this time i supposewill say then this is really a very pleasant little adventure cried tom rain but i think you carried your joke too far mr curtis and so it has recoiled on yourself have you seen mr torrens lately not i exclaimed curtis but dont you confess captain that you carried matters a trifle too far that night never mind the two thousand pounds im glad my old hunks of an uncle has lost that but i allude to the affair of helping the gals to run away i suppose you were in league with villiers all the time what makes you think that villiers had any thing to do with the matter inquired rainford simply because i dont imagine you carried off the gals for your own sake however continued frank i care but little about the matter now i certainly liked adelais very much at the time but there are plenty of others in the world quite as handsome besides i now see through all sir christophers trickery in wanting me to marry miss torrens in such a deuce of a hurry and in giving me a separate establishment the old bird wanted to commit matrimony himself and i should have been poked off with a few paltry hundreds ayear and so you will now said tom or matters may be even worse after the trick you endeavoured to play upon your uncle not a bit of it cried frank had old blunts scheme succeeded i should have been married to a portionless gal and forced to live on whatever he chose to give me now that his project has failed i am free and unshackled and can secure myself a position by marriage i might even look as high as my friend the dukes niece but she is horribly illtempered and so i think of making an offer of my heart and handi can do the thing well if i like you know captainto mrs goldberry the widow i spoke of just now the name sounds well i confess observed tom but did your uncle neveri mean did he not instruct his lawyer to adopt any proceedings about that little affair of the two thousand pounds not he captain exclaimed frank curtis as far as my uncle is concerned you may rest quite satisfied that he will never take any notice of the business and howard wouldnt act without his instructions they had now reached charing cross and tom rain having had quite enough of mr curtiss company signified his desire that they should separate you wont pass an hour with me over a bottle of wine said the young man i really should like to have a chat with such a gallant dashing fellow as you are captain for youre quite after my own heartbarring the the highway businesseh cried tom laughing why you cannot for a minute suppose that it is my regular profession mr curtis no such a thing i merely eased you of the two thousand pounds for the joke of itjust as you played off your tricks on sir christopher you talk about easing me captain returned frank but i can assure you that youre the first man that ever got the better of me dont fancy for a moment that iim a coward captain sparks far from it my dear sir exclaimed tom i know you to be as brave as you are straightforward in your conversation so good nightand pray take care not to follow me for ive an awkward habit of turning round and knocking on the head any one that i imagine to be watching me with these words the highwayman hurried off up the strand and frank curtis entered a cigar shop muttering to himself damn the fellow i almost think he meant that for insolence egad if he did the next time i meet him but the valiant young gentleman did not precisely make up his mind what he should do in the case supposed and any resentment which he experienced speedily evaporated with the soothing influence of a cheroot meantime tom rain pursued his way along the strand and fleet street and repaired to the lodgings of mr clarence villiers in bridge street that gentleman was at home and received his visitor in a very friendly manner you are most welcome captain sparks he said and the more so if you intend to pass an hour or two with me for my aunt is so very particular that she would take the girls to church with her this evening but of course i did not offer to accompany them as i could not wear a veil over my face you know he added laughing and were i recognised by mr torrens or any of his friends attention would be immediately directed to any ladies who might happen to be in my company so i shall not visit old burlington street this evening and if you will bear me company over a bottle of wine i cannot possibly remain many minutes interrupted rainford in fact i am going to leave england very shortly leave england ejaculated clarence i am truly sorry to hear that announcementjust as we begin to get friendly together circumstances compel me to take this step answered rainford and my time for preparation is short i have called tonight upon businessfor in a word you can do me a service perhaps if you will as if there were any doubt relative to my inclination provided i have the power exclaimed clarence who was busily employed in decanting a bottle of portwine then having placed upon the table two glasses which he filled he said you know captain sparks that i am under the greatest obligation to you through your kindyour generous intervention adelais will be mine the banns were published at st georges hanover square a second time today and tomorrow week we shall be united the bridal breakfast will take place at my aunts shall we not have the pleasure of your company pray do not refuse me it is impossiblemuch as i should rejoice at being the witness of that union which no severe or mercenary father will be able to subvert said rainford in a feeling tone my affairs compel me to leave this countryat least for a time and for that reason i am anxious to place in your hands a certain document the mystery of which some accident might probably lead you to clear up rainford then produced the letter which had been found about the person of the deceased sarah watts and which he now requested villiers to peruse you observe that there is no address to indicate the name of the lady to whom that letter was written continued the highwayman when clarence had read it with attention the child to whom it refers is now in my care accident threw him in my wayand his adopted mother who was the writer of that letter is no more illustration will the child accompany you asked villiers he will but i will write to you the moment i reach americato which country i am goingand let you know my address or at all events through what channel a letter will come direct to me then should you have made any discoverywhich is however scarcely to be expectedstill as a wise precaution i have adopted this step you are right captain said villiers and i shall not forget the trust you have now confided to me should anything transpire respecting this matter i will not fail to communicate with you but will you not pass one evening with me in the society of my aunt and the two young ladies who will all be delighted to receive you mrs slingsby is a most amiable and excellent woman a little of a saintis she not exclaimed the highwayman drily she is certainly of a religious turn of mindindeed i may say enthusiastically so answered villiers but she is extremely charitableand her benevolence embraces a very wide circle i believe she is a handsome woman too observed tom rain she is possessed of personal as well as mental attractions captain sparks responded villiers seriously but when in her society you would think of her only as the piousbenevolentand compassionate woman whose heart is ever ready to sympathise with the woes of her fellow creatures to speak candidly mr villiers said rainford i am no friend to the saints it may be a prejudice on my partbut i cant help it excuse me for my franknessi beg of you to take it in good part still i always think that the stillest water runs deepest and i would not remember captain sparks interrupted villiers somewhat warmly that you are speaking of my aunt who is a most worthy and estimable woman deeply as i am indebted to youmuch as i am inclined to esteem youyet i understand you my dear mr villiers cried tom you cannot permit me to breathe even a suspicion against mrs slingsby in your presence welli know that it is most ungracious on my part still as i was more or less instrumental in inducing those too artless confiding young ladies to quit their fathers hometo abandon the paternal dwelling good heavens what do you mean ejaculated clarence now seriously alarmed i see that there is something at the bottom of all this captain sparks i implore you to explain yourself you are evidently wellintentionedyou have shown the greatest friendship for mei reciprocate the feeling most cordially fear not then to speak my dear villiers answered the highwayman how can i enter upon particulars the narration of which would be most painful for you to hear and yet i should not be acting consistently with my duty towards those young ladiesno nor towards yourself who are about to make one of them your wife hesitate not speak freely exclaimed clarence seeing that his companion paused should the breath of scandal have wafted to your ear anything prejudicial to the character of my aunt i cannot blame your motive in confiding the fact to me and i the more earnestly solicit you to be frank and candidthat is to act consistently with your nature which is all frankness and candourand reveal to me the cause of this distrustthis want of confidence relative to mrs slingsbybecause i have no doubt of being able to convince you that you have been misled and should i succeed in convincing you to the contrary asked rainford then i should say that you had indeed performed the part of a friend replied villiers emphatically although i know beforehand that such a result is impossibleyet for your complete satisfaction do i declare that should you prove my aunt to be in any way an unsuitable guardian for that dear girl adelais and her sister i shall conceive it to be my duty immediately to seek for them another homeyes another homeeven for the few days that remain to be passed ere i shall acquire a right to protect adelais as her husband and rosamond as her brother you have spoken well and wisely villiers said rainford but i do not recommend any extreme measure which might only irritate your aunt and perhaps lead to the forced restoration of the young ladies to their father before you can have obtained the right you speak of i merely wish you to be on your guard but the grounds of your suspicion captain cried clarence impatiently pardon my interruptionand pity my suspense i do both returned the highwayman and now remember that i am no mischiefmaker between relations or friends and were it not for the peculiar circumstances of this case in which two innocent young ladies are concerned i should never have thought it worth while to utter a word of any thing i know injurious to mrs slingsbys characterno not even to unmask the most disgusting hypocrisy added rainford warmly do you still allude to my aunt demanded clarence colouring with indignation i do but start noti am not seeking a quarrel with you villiersand you promised to listen patiently to no other living being should i have listened so patiently as i have already done to you said clarence but pray let us hasten to dispose of so disagreeable a topic in one way or the other i am most anxious to do so continued the highwayman do you know sir henry courtenay certainly he is my aunts best friend and her lover added rainford coolly villiers started from his seat exclaiming captain sparks you presume upon the obligation which i owe you to calumniate then good evening mr villiers interrupted the highwayman if this is the fair and impartial hearing which you promised to give meif this is the manner in which you treat one who has notcannot have an improper motive in offering you wise counsel stay my dear friendstay exclaimed clarence actually thrusting rainford back into his seat and pray forgive my impetuosity but this accusationso suddenso unexpectedso very strange and yet it is substantially true added rainford emphatically and it is proper that you should know it for my part i am not the man to blame mrs slingsby for having a lovernor yet the lover for having her as his mistress its human nature both ways but when i know that she has been entrusted by you with the guardianship of two young ladies of tender age and spotless innocence and one of whom is so very very dear to you i consider it necessary for you to be enlightened as to her true character ive no doubt that you must feel deeply this communication but it is better for you to learn that your aunt is something that she ought not to be than to find out when it is too late that your wife or her sister have been corrupted by bad example clarence paced the room in an agitated manner then at the expiration of a few minutes he turned suddenly exclaiming not for a moment captain sparks do i suspect you of any sinister object but you will pardon me for soliciting the proof of this charge which if substantiated must so completely and so painfully change my opinion of a relative whom i have until now vaunted as the pattern of virtue and propriety the mode of proving the charge may be left to yourself replied the highwayman did you ever hear the circumstance of your aunts house being robbed by a boy to whom she gave a nights lodging some four or five years ago certainly exclaimed villiers i recollect the incident well mrs slingsby herself communicated it to me the ungrateful young villain i know that boy interrupted tom rain drily and i am convinced that he told me the truth when he declared that during the nightor rather the portion of the night which he passed in mrs slingsbys house accident made him a witness to a scene which leaves no doubt as to the fact that sir henry courtenay and mrs slingsby are as intimate as man and wife together and would you receive the testimony of a thief when well corroborated added the highwayman but how happened it that you should have any connexion with this lad captain sparks demanded clarence in a cold and suspicions tone suppose that the boy has repented of his errorsthat he has merited my interest by a service which accident enabled him to render methat he related to me his entire history in which this incident is comprisedand that on questioning him closely i learnt that the occurrence took place at the residence of your aunt i am bewilderedamazedgrievedprofoundly grieved ejaculated villiers to suppose for an instant that this kind and affectionate relativewho has always been so good to me and through whose bounty i am enabled to prepare and fit up a suitable dwelling for the reception of my beloved adelaisto think that this muchrespected and longrevered woman should conceal the greatest profligacy beneath the mask of charity and religionoh it is a cruel blow again i say that the mode of proving the charge may be left to yourself observed rainford seek an opportunity to be alone with mrs slingsbymake some pointed allusion to the incidentand mark how she receives it i will call at my aunts residence tomorrow morning earlythe very first thing exclaimed villiers the whole affair is most serious and now that i can at length contemplate it with something bordering on calmness i am bound to confessbut let us quit the topic he added in a tone of deep vexation in spite of his asserted selfpossession and you bear me no illwill for the course i have pursued said rainford far from it you have acted in a most friendly mannerwhatever the result may be cried villiers grasping the highwaymans hand most cordially i have performed a very painful duty rejoined tom and now i must take my leave of youperhaps for a long long timeif not for ever farewell said clarence and may prosperity attend you in another clime farewell replied rainford and may you be happy with your adelais the highwayman then hurried from the room considerably affected by this parting from one for whom he already experienced a most sincere regard nor was villiers unmoved by this farewell scene for on his side he was particularly attached to the individual who had not only rendered him so essential a service on that memorable night which first made them acquainted with each other but whose apparent frankness of disposition and manliness of character were well calculated to engage the good opinion of the confiding warmhearted and unsuspecting clarence chapter xlv mr dykes and his myrmidons it was midnight and profound silence reigned throughout the region of locks fields but suddenly that silence was broken by the tread of several persons who emerged from a byealley in the immediate vicinity of brandon street at the corner of this street they paused to hold a hasty conference they were six in numberfive men and a woman this is the street said the woman oh this is it mrs bunceeh returned mr dykes the bow street officer rubbing his nose with the knob of his stout ashstick while his countenance on which the bright moonbeams played showed an expression of calm determination yes and thats the housethere the ninth on tother side of the way added mrs bunce wellnow we dont want you no more maam said dykes cos women is all very well in their place and darling creaturs they are too but when a grab is to be made theyre best at home abed and asleep so good night to you maam good night gentlemen all responded mrs bunce and she hurried away now bingham and you fellers said mr dykes we must mind what were up to for we shant catch a weasel asleep you bingham take one of the runners and get round to the back of the house me and tother chaps will make the entry in front but we shant stir a peg for one quarter of an hour and by that time youll be at your post all right returned mr bingham and this individual accordingly moved off followed by one of the subordinate runners in the meantime tom rainford was sleeping not dreaming of danger in the arms of the beautiful jewess charley watts was cradled in a little bed made up for him in the warmest corner of the room a light burnt in the apartment where naught was heard save the slow regular breathing of the sleepers the clear transparent olive complexion of the beautiful jewess contrasted strongly with the florid countenance of the highwayman and the commingling of the raven hair of the one with the light almost yellow locks of the other produced a strange effect as the marked discrepancy of hues was set off by the snowy whiteness of the pillow by the feeble light of the candle it appeared as if ebony and gold were blending on a white ground but hark what is that sound which breaks on the silence of the chamberand wherefore does the highwayman start from his sleep he awakesand listens the jewess also awakesand also listensone of her beautifully modelled arms thrown around the neck of him whom she loved so fondly some one is trying the backdoor whispered rainford at length and he leapt from the bed in less than a minute he had thrown on his clothes and grasping his pistols he hastened to the window but at the same instant the backdoor was forced inmore violently no doubt than bingham and his cooperator had intended and the sound was too unequivocal to permit tom rain to doubt the meaning of the disturbance returning to the bed he said in a hurried but solemn and deeply impressive tone dearest i am betrayed if i escape you shall soon hear from me if i am captured i charge youby all the love i bear for youby all the love you bear for menot to attempt to visit me in prison farewelldearest dearest girl he embraced her fondlyaffectionatelyoh most lovingly while she sobbed as if her heart would break then in a moment he tore himself awayfootstepsmany footsteps were already ascendingnay rushing upthe stairs he darted from the room sprang up a ladder which stood on the landingpushed up a trapdoorand in another moment was on the roof of the house the officers were close upon him dykes and his two men had effected an entry by the frontdoor of the house almost at the same moment that bingham and his follower had broken in at the back and the entire posse reached the landing just at the moment that the trapdoor fell down heavily into its place he has escaped by the roof cried dykes bingham my boy take a couple of chaps and watch the backs of the houses he cant get away by the frontits too high for him to leap into the street me and tother chap will after him to the tilings thus saying dykes ascended the ladder as quickly as his unwieldly form would permit the trapdoor was easily raised as it only fastened inside and the portly body of the bow street officer who possessed more courage than alacrity was forced through the small aperture the operation was slow and difficult but at last mr dykes stood on a narrow ledge which ran along the whole row of houses and from which the roof rose obliquely behind this ledge was only protected by a parapet about two feet high and the officer felt his position to be any thing but a safe one but he was not the man to shrink from danger come along you feller he cried out to his follower who speedily emerged from the opening you cut along that way and ill go this and they proceeded in different directions on the roof of the house the moon shone brightly but thomas rainford was not to be seen suddenly an exclamation of triumph burst from the yard at the back of one of the adjacent houses holloa vociferated dykes from the eminence on which he stood weve got him fast enough returned bingham a piercing shriek from a window that had been thrown open denoted the anguish of the jewess whose ears had caught these words mr dykes and his attendant subordinate now retraced their way to the trapdoor through the aperture of which they once more forced themselves and when they had regained the landing dykes said now you go and join my partner bingham cos this rainford is a desperate feller and the more there is to guard him the better the man accordingly took his departure and mr dykes knocked gently at the door of the bedroom who is there asked a voice withina voice soft and melodious but now expressive of the most intense anguish beg pardon maam said dykes but i must do my duty and if so be youll have the kindness to dress yourself i should like to examine the boxes and cupboards and such likejust for forms sake and thats all must you thus add to the grief which is already the plaintive voice was interrupted by a violent fit of sobbing with the mournful sounds of which the crying of the little boy now commingled i dont want to annoy you maam returned dykes i should hope not indeed exclaimed the landlady who having been alarmed by the disturbance had got up and dressed herself and was now ascending the stairs but what is it all about and why do you break into a respectable house in this way i dont suppose youre thievesor else i am an officer maam exclaimed dykes drawing himself up with offended dignity as the candle which the landlady carried in her hand lighted the landingplacei am an officer maamand my partners have just taken one thomas rainford a highwayman a highwayman ejaculated the widow who had never suspected the character of her lodger and who was a prudent woman that never troubled herself about other peoples business so long as her rent was regularly paid yesa highwayman added dykes but ive no time to stand palavering i blieve theres a lady in this room here and as i must overhaul the placeas the case is a serious oneyoull do well to step in and let me do the job quietly i dont want to annoy her the law isnt at loggerheads with herand so shes nothing to fear as for me im as gentle as a lamb when a ladys concerned the widow urged the afflicted girl within the room to open the door and as the latter had by this time dressed herself the request was complied with but the jewess wore a deep black veil over her head when the officer and the landlady entered the bedchamber and taking charley in her arms she seated herself in a chair near the bed whispering a few words of consolation to the little boy even amidst the terrible violence of her own grief as for charles he knew that something wrong was occurring but he was too young to comprehend the real nature of the appearances which terrified him dykes just opened a cupboard plunged his hands into a trunk and turned out the contents of a carpetbag but he did not prosecute his search any farther for he was too much experienced in the ways of robbers and rogues to suppose for a moment that he should find on the premises any portion of the money stolen from sir christopher bluntthis being the charge on which rainford was arrested the search such as it was was merely for forms sake because the magistrate was sure to inquire whether the prisoners lodgings had been carefully examined and this superficial glance at the contents of the boxes would enable mr dykes to give an affirmative answer without any very great deviation from the actual truth he accordingly quitted the room within a minute after entering it but he turned on the landing just to beg the dear young lady not to take on too much and also to assure the mistress of the house that she should be recompensed for the injury done to her abode by the violent entry effected by himself and his companions we must leave the landlady to consoleor endeavour to console the unhappy jewessand accompany mr dykes who passed out of the house by the back way and stepped over two or three low fences which separated the yards of the respective dwellings until he reached that one where tom rain was in the custody of bingham and the subordinate runners it appeared that the gallant highwayman finding how hotly he was pursued when he was escaping by means of the trapdoor and dreading lest the whole neighbourhood should be alarmed ere he could possibly get away had resolved on the dangerous expedient of sliding down from the roof to the back of the buildings by means of the perpendicular leaden waterpipe but when he was halfway down in his perilous descent he missed his hold and fell upon the stone pavement of the yard beneath he endeavoured to get up and escapebut could not his right ankle was sprained almost to dislocation and in a few minutes he was discovered and captured by the detachment under the orders of bingham he heard the piercing scream which followed the announcement of his arrest by this officer and that screamoh it went to thy generous heart tom rain but he uttered not a word he offered no resistance although he had his pistols about him he not only shrank from the idea of shedding human blood but he was also well aware that his case was now too desperate to be benefited by even desperate means for even if he slew all the officers he could not drag himself away ere the neighbours would collect and capture him and by this time the whole line of houses was awake with bustle and excitement light after light appeared at the different casements windows were thrown up and the rumour spread like wildfire that a famous highwayman had just been arrested the reader may well conceive the nature of the sensation which now prevailed all along the back of brandon streetbut in one room there was a beauteous woman convulsed with torturingmaddening anguishfor deep was her love for thee tom rain now then cried dykes as he made his appearance in the yard where the highwayman was sitting on an inverted washtub surrounded by the runners to whom he had surrendered his pistolsnow then ladslets off with him to quod how dye do mr rainford dont want to crow over a gentleman in troublebut thought i should have you some day or another then stooping down he whispered in toms ear i was obleeged to give a look in at the crib up there just now but i only stayed a moment and shant trouble the poor lady any more she had a veil over her faceand so i dont know who she is that is you see i shant know if im asked any questions by the beakbut of course im aware its the handsome jewess that did the diamond business you are mistakenyou are mistaken said rainford emphatically but if you showed her any civility i sincerely thank you lord bless you mr rainfordi wouldnt do any thing to annoy you for the world i cant help admiring a brave manand youre one the poor dear lady will be troubled no more by us and its nothing to me who she is or who she is not the law dont want her at all events one word more said tom who has done this business for me a lawyer named howard was the answer but i cant say no more then what is the charge against me asked tom a considerable load already removed from his mind sir christopher blunts little businessthats all replied dykes but come along we must be off to horsemonger mr dykes and mr bingham politely offered rainford their arms and the procession passed through the house in the yard belonging to which the capture had been made the occupants of that dwellingmen women and children all in their nightdressescrowded on the stairs to catch a glimpse of the terrible highwayman whose good looking appearance excited the sympathy of the female portion of the spectators half an hour afterwards tom rain was lodged in a cell in the criminal department of horsemonger lane gaolbut his heart was lighter than the reader might possibly supposefor he was relieved of the first and most natural fear that had assailed him namely that it was on account of benjamin boness death that he was pursued if i must be hanged he thought within himself i would rather it should be for highway robbery than aught elsebut o tamar tamar what is to become of thee and as he sate on the humble pallet in the darkness of his solitary cell he buried his face in his manacled hands in another moment a moonbeam penetrated through the barred window and in that silver ray glistened the tears which trickled between his fingers and yet it was not for himself he weptthou wast no cowardbut thou hadst a generous heart tom rain footnote we should observe that at the time of which we are writing it was by no means unusual for bow street officers to be employed in the pursuit or capture of desperate characters in surrey although this county was not strictly within their district chapter xlvi explanations at eleven oclock on the following day lord ellingham who had passed a sleepless and wretched night called at the house of lady hatfield and was immediately conducted to the drawingroom where georgiana was alone in readiness to receive him she was dressed in a morning garb and though veryvery pale looked surpassingly lovely my dear friend she said extending her hand which as he offered to press it with rapture to his lips she gently but still resolutely withdrewmy dear friendfor such henceforth must i call you georgiana he exclaimed starting back what means this coolness be seated arthurand listen to me attentively she said in a plaintive and sweetly touching tone i am not very wellmy nerves are not strong todayand you must not manifest any impatience towards me indeed i ought to have postponed this interview but i considered it to be my dutya paramount duty owing alike to yourself and to meto enter into as early an explanation as possible this preface forebodes nothing favourable to my happiness murmured the earl as he sank into a seat to which georgiana pointedbut which was not by her side arthur she continued with difficulty maintaining sufficient control over her emotions to enable her to speak calmly and collectedly you know not how much i love youhow dearly i am devoted to you for your sake and to bear the name of your wife i could consent to become a mendicanta wanderer on the face of the earthrenounce fortuneranksocietyall in fine that we women are generally deemed to hold so dearyes all this could i do for your sake so that you were my companion then conceive how hard it is for meoh how very hard my wellbeloved arthur to be compelled to say that henceforth we must know each other only as friends merciful heavens ejaculated the earl uncertain whether the imagined capriciousness of his georgiana was about to assert its tantalizing influence again or whether any thing of a more serious nature and connected with the incidents of the preceding evening was about to present an insuperable bar to his happiness yesarthur continued georgiana in an impressive tone henceforth we must be but as brother and sister to each other and as a dear fond affectionate sister will i ever be to you for your generosity would have made me your wife in spite ofbut you cannot wish me to refer to that and yet it is that one sad episode in my life which now asserts an inexorable influence over the conduct which we must both pursue it is that event which youin the noble candour in the warm liberality of your admirable disposition you praise me too highly georgiana exclaimed the earl i loved youi love you dearly and in spite of all that you now say hope is not quenched within me but my god when will this painful suspense pass when shall i behold you no longer a prey to an influence alas that influence must endure for ever murmured lady hatfield tears now trembling upon her eyelashes nono cried the earl with impassioned energy when but a few days ago we entered into explanations with each otherwhen i informed you that i was aware of the nature of that secret influence which tyrannised over youdid i not assure you that as a loving husband i would so completely study your happiness oh yes interrupted georgiana and did i not declare that you had given me a proof of affection such as man seldom gave unto woman believe mebelieve me she added earnestly i felt all that there was greatgenerousand noble in your conduct for knowing that secretthat sad that fatal secretyou banished all prejudicediscarded even those scruples which the most highminded of men so often entertain under such circumstances dearest georgiana exclaimed the earl you attach far too much importance to the secret of which you speak what man that truly loves a virtuousbeautifulaccomplishedand amiable woman would allow himself to be swayed ah every heart is not so generous as yours interrupted georgiana you recognise the complete innocence of my soul i cannot believe that you would be guilty of the wanton cruelty of inflicting these tortures upon me georgiana said the earl were it not for that strangethat almost morbid state of mind which is at times produced by the recollection of a serious fright which you experienced some years ago and from the effects of which you have not completely recovered but after all wherefore do you praise me so highlywherefore do you thank me so much for the simple fact of not allowing the knowledge of this occasional access of morbid feeling to weigh with me arthur almost shrieked georgiana losing all control over herself then you know not the secretthe dreadful secret yes have i not proved to you that i know it exclaimed the earl surprised and grieved at the strange manner of lady hatfield your uncle put me in possession of the facts and what is there in them after all it is a mere adventure which one would now tell only as a christmas taleor to amuse childrenhad it not produced so serious an influence upon your nerves and arthur arthur is this a cruel pleasantry demanded georgiana hysterically or have we misunderstood each other all along you know that i am incapable of turning to ridicule or making a jest of any thing that regards you georgiana returned the earl and as for any misunderstanding between us there is none our explanation the other day was fullcompletesatisfactory nono cried lady hatfield painfully excited i see that i am mistakenthat you have learnt a bare fact yes and since we are now conversing on the topic said the earl let us enter fully into it and then abandon it for ever i see that you attach much importance to this subjectand that when we are united there may be no necessity ever to recur if ever we are united repeated georgiana clasping her hands in anguish of heart yes my wellbeloved continued the earl and now listen to me about seven years ago you were staying alone at mauleverer lodge in hampshire oh the fatal timethe fatal place cried georgiana hysterically and though she would have given worlds to cut short the conversation she had not the powerfor her mind was agitated like the ocean in a storm you were staying alone at mauleverer lodge proceeded arthur not observing the extent of her emotion you were alone save in respect to the servants but you had no relationno friend there at the moment and one nighta man broke in a manwith a black mask murmured georgiana almost wringing her hands and bearing the denomination too of the black mask continued lord ellinghamthis man broke into the houseand andmerciful heavens spare me the recital of the rest shrieked lady hatfield covering her face with her hands good god do not thus give way to a reminiscence which though painful should no longer exercise any influence over a strong mind said the earl in a kind and soothing tone as he approached and seated himself next to georgiana consider my dearly belovedmy angelmy intended wifereflect i implore you upon the childishness of this behavior childishness repeated georgiana with a convulsive shudder pardon the expression said the earl but i would reason with youi would endeavour to persuade you that an occurrence which is past and gone and which happens frequently in other houses should not thus paralyse all the naturally fine energies of your soul what in the name of heaven can it matter now if a robber broke into a dwelling some six or seven years ago your uncle told me that for some months fears were entertained for your reason butoh my georgiana i do implore you nownow that we are once again touching on this painfulmost painful themeto exercise more command over yourself you praise meyou thank me because i am willing to espouse one whose reason was shocked long years agofor that is your secret after all georgianadearest georgianaand you perceive that i know it my god how have we misunderstood each other murmured the unhappy ladymy secrethe knows it not but the earl could not catch the sense of the words which she thus whispered to herself and with the fond hope of consoling herfor the events of the preceding evening were for the time banished from his memoryhe took her hand pressed it to his lips and began to utter syllables of tenderness and love then how terrible was his surprisehow acute the anguish which filled his soul when georgiana suddenly starting from the halfembrace in which he was already enfolding her exclaimed in a tone indicative of the most exquisite mental agony noarthurno you are not acquainted with my secretand now never never will you learn it we have misunderstood each otherand i consented the other day to become your wife while labouring under a dreadfuloh a dreadful error but heaven has interposed to prevent the consummation of your miseryand mine and now she added with the calmness of despair let us separate arthurand henceforth be unto each other but brother and sisterfor your wife i cannot become georgiana this is cruelty the most refinedthe most wanton exclaimed the earl am i again to pass through all the phases of suspenseuncertaintymysteryand doubtand will you in a few days repent of all you have said and recall this stern decision butmuch as i love youdeeply as i am attached to youi cannotcannot endure a treatment pardon meforgive me cried georgiana but you do not comprehend me my reason is not unhingedi am subject to no whimsno caprice arthur a fatal mistake on my part alone induced me the other day to consent to become your wife that error has now been cleared upour conversation of this morning has convinced me of the tremendous misunderstanding that had nearly wrecked all your happiness but even had it not there was another reason which would imperatively command us to think no more of each other in the same light as we so lately did ah you allude perchance to the incident of last evening exclaimed lord ellingham permit me then to ask the object of that rainfords visit did he insult you did he attempt to extort money from you if so nono cried georgiana in whose bosom the mere mention of the highwaymans name appeared to excite the most agonising feelings i sent down a message to that effect last night he did not insult mehe did not come to injure me but his presence excited you most painfully georgiana interrupted the earl and it has also revived in your imaginationoh i understand it all he cried suddenly interrupting himself this rainford is the black maskthe noted highwayman of hampshire lady hatfield cast upon the young nobleman a look expressive of so much mental suffering that he was deeply touchedprofoundly affected and yet he knew not how to administer consolation georgiana he at length said in as calm and collected a tone as he could assume though his heart was in reality rent by the most painful emotions there is some terrible mystery in all this i begin to believeas you yourself ere now endeavoured to persuade methat your reason is in no way affectedthat you are not subject to mere whims and caprices nothe cause of your griefyour anguishyour horror at the reminiscence of that event in hampshirean anguish and a horror cruelly revived last night by the presence of that rainford who is doubtless identical with the black maskan anguish and a horror perpetuated too until now continued arthur more emphaticallythe cause of all this is farfar more serious than i had at first imagined you say that you cannot become my wifeand that you have laboured under a misapprehension you wish us to look upon each other as brother and sister and yet you do love me well enough to become my wifedid not some terrible and fearfully mysterious obstacle stand in the way oh if you really love methen pity me and tell me this dreadful secret which weighs upon your mind unless indeed and he paused abruptly as an awful suspicion rushed into his brain georgiana only turned her head aside and sobbed convulsively unless indeed continued the earl after a few moments silence it would bring a blush to your cheek to enlighten me and i cannotcannot ask you to humiliate yourself in my presence arthur i dare not become your wife exclaimed georgiana suddenly falling upon her knees before him and if you demand the reasonas after all that has passed between us you have a righti will confess georgiana no more cried the earl hastening to raise her not for worlds would i bring a blush to your cheek then in a differentmore seriousand very mournful tone he added henceforth we will be to each other as sister and brother with these words he touched her hand lightly with his lips and was about to hurry from the room when animated by a sudden thought georgiana held him back saying in a hollow thick tone of voice whatever suspicion you now entertainyou do not believe that iwas guilty she added as if the very words were choking her no much injured woman cried the young nobleman warmly a light has broken in upon my mindand i understand it all yesfor a pure soul dwells in a tainted body murmured lady hatfield and if i have said this muchand you can well believe how painful to my feelings the mere necessity of making such an assertion must bebut in making it i am influenced only by the hopethe earnest hope of removing from your mindthe mind of one whom i so much respectso highly esteem say no more my dearest sister interrupted the earl emphatically for as a sister do i now look upon youand as a brother he added sternly will i avenge you for that was i ere now hurrying away so abruptly avenge me repeated georgiana looking wildly on the young noblemans countenance which wore a calm but determined expression yes georgiana replied the earl wrongs so deep as yours demand a deadly vengeance and who so fit to become the instrument of that vengeance than he whom those wrongs which you have sustained so cruelly redound upon but for that incarnate fiend rainford would you not alreadyyes already have been my loved and loving wife am i not then also wronged by him have i not something to avenge he demanded bitterly and to consummate this vengeance georgiana iyour brother henceforthwill forget my proud titlecast aside the remembrance of my elevated rankand dressed in mean attire i will visit the noisome densthe foul courtsthe low neighbourhoods of london until i discover that miscreant rainford then will istill forgetting the proud title and the elevated rankdare him to meet me in a duel from which at least but one shall depart alive and wherein both may haply fall i will not yield him up to the hangman georgiana continued the earl fearfully excited because in his last moments he might confess his crimes and include amongst them the foul wrong he has inflicted on thee my sister but i will descend to make myself his equali will place myself on a level with that blackhearted ruffian hold hold screamed georgiana suddenly recovering the powers of utterance which had been paralyzed by this tremendous explosion of generous indignation on the part of that proudlyborn noble who proclaimed himself her champion hold hold arthuryou know not whom you calumniatewhom you would provoke to the duel of death yestoo well i know the miscreant cried the earl furiously nonoyou know him not screamed georgiana wildly this is childishsilly said the earl impatiently was it not rainford who yesyes but this rainford is a fiend with a heart so black hold hold again i say ejaculated lady hatfield clasping her hands in despair that thomas rainford whom you would make the victim of your vengeance is is what demanded the earl hastily isis who in the name of heaven your brother was the hysterical reply chapter xlvii farther explanations my brother repeated the earl of ellingham with a wild glance and a sudden start indicative of the most painful surprise my brother georgianaoh noimpossible tis true that my fatherbut nothat child died i can give you no particularsoffer you no evidence in this most strange and mysterious matter said lady hatfield endeavouring to subdue the excitement produced in her muchagitated mind by the preceding scene all that i know isall that he told me was that secret which i have now revealed to you thus arthur you perceive thatindependent of the other reason which would prevent me from becoming yours and you from receiving me as your wife but wherefore did you not mention this at firstat the commencement of our conversation this morning demanded the nobleman utterly bewildered by the revelation that had been made to him and scarcely knowing whether to regard it as a substantial fact or a miserable fiction because rainford himself appeared to tell it to me as a profound secret observed georgiana not that he desired me to consider it as such but his mannerand then the nature of the revelation itself which could not be gratifying to your feelingsoh i scarcely know what i am saying arthurbut i would have spared your feelings had you not compelled me to make that revelation to prevent the madthe insane designs of vengeance which you had formed i understand you georgiana interrupted the earl and deeplyoh deeply do i feel your generous consideration on that point but there is one question that i wish to ask youa question speak arthur this is the day of mutual outpourings of confidence said lady hatfield and rememberwe are henceforth to stand in the light of brother and sister to each other the question i would ask is relative to the robbery that was perpetrated on you and miss mordaunt a short time back near hounslow continued the earl was that highwayman he washe was exclaimed georgiana once more painfully excited but do not look coldly on me arthurdo not despise me for that dreadful crime of perjury which i committed to save him he wrote me an imperious note commanding me to stop all proceedings instituted in reference to that matter what did such a note imply it was a menacea dreadful menacea threat to expose me if i did not obey his mandate consider arthuroh consider how i was placedmy reputation at stakemy fame in the hands of one whobut can you wonder that i preferred the dread alternative of perjury to the danger of disgrace and infamy which seemed to impend over my head alas i cannot blame you poor suffering woman ejaculated the earl in a tone of deep commiseration we never know how we should act until we find ourselves placed in circumstances of difficulty and embarrassment and thenthen even the most rigid integrity often yields but let us sit down quietly georgiana for a short halfhourcompose ourselves if we cancollect our scattered thoughtsand converse together as sister and brother for i will now communicate to you the little i know concerning the birth of thomas rainfordif he indeed be the offspring of that amour illustration arthur ceased and passed his hand over his brow as if to calm the warfare of thoughts and conjectures which agitated his brain georgiana seated herself on the sofa and the earl at length took a chair near her he then continued in the following manner my father the late earl was married twice his first matrimonial connexion was formed when he was thirty and this union was unproductive of issue lady ellingham as i have heard was a woman devotedly attached to the dissipation of a fashionable life she seemed to exist only to shine in the gay assemblies of the west end and as she had no children and her husband was immersed in politics she possessed no ties to bind her to her own fireside she played deeplyfor play was very fashionable then amongst ladies and is even now to a considerable extent her extravagances were great and she made rapid inroads upon my fathers fortune by the time he was forty he found himself involved in debts and moreover rumour began to be so busy with the name of his wife imputing to her the most shameless infidelity that he determined to separate from her i should not allude to this circumstancei would not for a moment revive statements prejudicial to the memory of a woman who has long ago gone to render an account of her deeds to her makerwere it not that respect for the name of my lamented father renders me anxious to discover any extenuation which offers itself for his subsequent conduct well a separation was resolved upon a certain income was settled upon lady ellingham the estate was put to nurse as the lawphrase has it and my father who was a proud man retired to a small property which he possessed in ireland ostensibly for the purpose of giving up the cares of public life but in reality to conceal the necessity of retrenching his expenditure ten years passed away and when my father was upwards of fifty he returned to london his estates having in the meantime been relieved of all their incumbrances lady ellingham was still living but the smallness of her income and the impaired condition of her health forced her to dwell in the strictest retirement she had moreover become a devotee and manifested no desire to return into the dazzling scenes of fashionable life i am now speaking of about thirtyone years ago when i was not born it was at that period that my father encountered a young and very beautiful girl named octavia manners she was the halfsister of a marinestore dealer who bore the disagreeable appellation of benjamin bones by all i have heard octavia must have been a charming creature and her manners acquirements and conversation were far superior to her humble condition in life i cannot give you any details respecting the way in which my father became acquainted with her suffice it to say that he grew deeply attached to her and his visits were encouraged by her brother but alas from all that i have heard i have groundsoh too strong grounds to believe that those visits were most unwelcome to octavia for she was beloved by a young man in her own sphere of life and whom she loved in return and it is now that i would palliateas far as possiblethe conduct of my sire while i am bound to admit that his proceedings in respect to that unhappy girl were most unworthy the noble and the man my heart aches too as i utter these words but i am telling you a history the truth of which must not be disguised nor in any way misrepresented but some allowancesome little excuse may be found for a man who was separated from a wife whom he had not seen for many years and to whom there were positively no moral ties although the legal ones still existed to bind his fidelity he was devotedly attached to a young and beautiful girl who unfortunately could not return his love and who did not even seem flattered by his visits as so many maidens in her sphere would have been noshe shrank from his addresses and implored him not to persecute her but he persisted in his visits and the first sad result was that the young man to whom octavias faith was plighted would not believe that she discouraged the attentions of the nobleman who condescended to appear at that humble dwelling i cannot of course inform you although we may both imagine how the young man reproached octavia and how she defended herself but it is certain that he suddenly quitted the neighbourhood leaving behind him a note declaring that he should never see the unhappy girl again alas that i should now be compelled to recite the tale of my fathers guiltmy fathers crime his love for octavia knew no boundshe was determined to risk allevery thing spare your feelings arthurdear arthur exclaimed lady hatfield for i can fully appreciate the grief which this revival of such a subject must cause you octavia then was purchasedpurchased with goldmy fathers gold georgianaand the deed ofdare i call it aught save infamywas consummated said the earl in a low and subdued tone as if he were overcome by the enormity of his sires guiltthat guilt which with a venial filial affection he had vainly endeavoured to palliate yestwas done he continued sadly and the vile halfbrother sold the honour of that young and already too deeply afflicted girl too deeply afflicted i say because she had lost him on whom the affections of her youthful heart were set the very day after her disgraceher ruin she fled from her brothers house and for several months no trace was discovered of her it was feared she had committed suicide and my father was almost distracted at that precise period his wife died having ended as a devotee that life of which so much of the early portion was passed in dissipation and illicit amours she had not been laid many weeks in the family vault when my father by some means unknown to meperhaps by accidentdiscovered that octavia was living and that she was in the way to become a mother he hastened to the miserable garret which she occupied and found her in the most abject state of povertyendeavouring to earn a subsistence with her needle a girl of the gipsy tribe and whose name was miranda was the friend and companion of poor octavia how they grew acquaintedhow they came to live together i am not aware but miranda was much attached to poor octavia and was nearly her own age indeed octavia was not seventeen even at that time and this miranda of whom i speak was about fifteen much mystery envelopes this portion of the sad tale it is however certain that my father visited octavia for several daysthat he passed hours with herthat she even appeared to be reconciled to his presenceand that they went out together and remained absent for hours on two or three occasions again she disappearedsuddenlyabruptlywithout having intimated her intention to my father and without even having confided her design to her friend miranda for miranda remained behind at the lodging and when my father called and found octavia not he was seized with a paroxysm of the deepest grief another year passed away and behold poverty and distress drove the unfortunate octavia to seek an asylum at the house of her halfbrother she would not doubtless have gone near that fatal dwelling where her ruin was accomplished had it not been for the child which she held in her arms that childa boywas the fruit of her connexion with my fatheror rather of the dreadful deed which gave her when under the influence of an opiate into his arms but she was dyingyes she was dying when she knocked at her brothers door and on her deathbed she implored that my father might be sent for he flew to her he knelt by her sidehe took the child in his arms and embraced both the dying mother and the innocent babe by a strangea wondrous coincidence miranda entered the house at that moment she had come to make inquiries concerning octaviaand found her dying the poor mother forgave those who had wronged herforgave her halfbrotherblessed my fatheryes blessed himand recommended her infant to his carethat infant being also his own then my father requested to be left alone with her but scarcely had the villain bones and the faithful miranda quitted the room when they were recalled by a dreadful cry which burst from my fathers lipsand they hurried back to find that octavia was no more arthur paused to wipe away the tears which were trickling down his cheeks nor were georgianas eyes unmoistened by the sweet dews of sympathy when my father had sufficiently recovered himself to attend to more worldly matters continued the young earl he gave directions for the funeral of his victim and to miranda did he entrust the child then he placed in the hands of benjamin bones in the presence of miranda a thousand guineas to be placed out at interest in order to provide the means of supporting the infant and his nurse i should also inform you that a small roll of papers carefully wrapped up in a piece of thick brown paper was found upon the person of octavia shortly after her death and these were taken possession of by benjamin bones my father having previously quitted the house of the nature of those documents i know nothing but i have been informed that when the halfbrother read them he was greatly excited and secured them under lock and key a year elapsed during which my father called several times to see the little boy who throve well in mirandas care but at the expiration of that period his visits ceased altogetherfor he was about to marry again twentynine years ago the honourable miss stamford became his second wife and twentysix years ago i was born but before the date of my birthand within six months after the marriage of my father appeared in the newspapersbones discharged miranda on some pretence and she returned to her tribe some few months afterwards she fell in with another tribe and to her profound surprise she discovered the child thomas in the possession of a woman named egyptia of the childs identity miranda had no doubt because it had a peculiar mark near the shoulder of the right arm she and her sistergipsy then compared notes and egyptia told her that she had received the child from a man named benjamin bonesa marinestore dealer in greville street hatton garden that bones had given her twenty guineas to take the child that the money was all gone and that she already repented of the bargain miranda who was attached to the child offered to take it and her proposal was accepted for seven years did the faithful miranda rear that boy as if he were her own but at last she fell dangerously illwas long deliriousand when she awoke to consciousness again she learnt from her companions that the boy had died of the same epidemic malady beneath which she herself had nearly succumbed again the earl paused for a few moments and when he again broke silence it was to conclude his narrative my father as you are aware georgiana died when i was only a year old and i was brought up by my mother at the age of nineteen i went to oxford and it was in the neighbourhood of that city i one day fell in with a party of gipsies they offered to tell my fortune and i consented for the amusement of the farce the young female who undertook the task commenced by giving me my real name for i had doubtless been pointed out to her in the city as the gipsies had been there and in the vicinity for several days but the moment my name was mentioned another gipsywoman who had probably seen forty summers uttered an ejaculation of surpriselooked hard at meand then inquired abruptly whether i was the son of the late earl of ellingham i answered in the affirmative and she let drop some observations which excited my curiosity i took her aside thrust a guinea into her hand and demanded of her the meaning of her words she returned me the money and after much persuasion narrated to me the whole history of octavia mannersthat is to say as much of it as i have now told to you you now understand georgiana how it is possible that this thomas rainford may be my halfbrother but if he be the account of his death received by miranda from her companions must have been falsefor i need hardly tell you that the elderly gipsy who unfolded to me the details of my fathers fatal conduct towards poor octavia was none other than miranda herself shortly afterwards my mother died but i never revealed to her the story of her late husbands guilt and octavias wrongs scarcely was this strange narrative concluded when the door of the apartment opened and sir ralph walsingham entered the room well he exclaimed mr rainford who honoured this house with a visit last night and frightened you georgiana so sadly has got himself into a pleasant scrape at last indeed exclaimed lord ellingham hastily what he is arrested on a charge of highway robberya robbery in fact committed on no less a person than our acquaintance sir christopher blunt returned the baronet arrested ejaculated the earl exchanging a rapid glance with georgiana as much as to enjoin her not to allow the subject of their previous conversation to transpire in the presence of sir ralph walsingham yesarrested last nightlodged in horsemonger lane gaol as a character too desperate to put into the usual lockupand examined before the magistrates at the office in the borough this morning continued sir ralph i happened to be in the neighbourhood an hour ago and heard all about it but he is remanded for a week at the solicitation of mr howard the attorney for the prosecution sir christopher not being in london well poor fellow i am really sorry for himfor he seems to be a dashing daring gallant blade by all accounts pardon me however my dear georgiana he added seeing that his niece was deadly pale i ought not to have spoken a word in favour of a man who terrified you so but lord ellingham interrupted sir ralph by taking his leave of him and georgiana and as the nobleman took the latter by the hand he said in a hasty whisper i will go and see him at once he then left the house entered a hackneycoach at the nearest stand and ordered the driver to take him to horsemonger lane gaol footnote for the mode adopted by gipsies to glean information relative to persons in the various neighbourhoods they visit see the history of skilligalee in the first series of the mysteries of london chapter xlviii lord ellingham and tom rain the interview between lady hatfield and the earl of ellingham had lasted a considerable time and it was close upon three oclock in the afternoon when his lordship reached horsemonger lane gaol he communicated to the governor his desire to see thomas rainford and although visitors were usually compelled to speak to prisoners through an iron grating yet the rank of the nobleman and the fact of his being in the commission of the peace for another county middlesex procured him immediate access to the highwaymans cell rainford was sitting in a pensive attitude at a table on which his dinner remained untouched we have before saidand we now repeatthat he cared but little for the peril of his own predicament there were however ties which bound him to the existence that was now in jeopardy and to the freedom that was lost he started from his seat with unfeigned surprise when the earl of ellingham entered the cell you are astonished to see me here mr rainford said the nobleman in a mild and mournful tone it is a visit my lord was the answer that i certainly did not expect and yetif the statement you made to lady hatfield be truei am but performing a duty ah then she has told you that exclaimed the prisoner she has told me that you claim a neara very near relationship to me rejoined the nobleman his voice trembling with emotionfor the reader has seen enough of him to be aware that he possessed a generous heart yesmy lord replied rainford the same father was the author of our beingalthough our mothers were different is this trueis it really true demanded the earl hastily as true as there is an almighty god who now beholds the great peer and the prisoned highwayman face to face replied rainford solemnly and divesting himself of his coat he bared his right arm and exhibited a particular mark i cannot doubt iti cannot disbelieve you exclaimed the nobleman tears starting from his eyes and then the great peer and the prisoned highwayman were folded in each others arms but my god exclaimed arthur when the excitement of this fraternal recognition had somewhat passed away in what a condition do i find you my poor brother grieve not for me arthur said rainford my fate will soon be decided now and whatever it may be i shall be prepared to meet it as becomes a brave man talk not thus thomas cried the nobleman pressing his hand warmly i have money to buy off your prosecutorsinterest to use in your behalf if i say to you yes use both arthur replied the highwayman it is only because there is one who loves me well and for whose sake i could wish to live i understand youyou allude to miss esther de medina said the earl but there is another for whose sake you must hope to live and enjoy freedom again and that is the brother who now stands before you and who for our fathers sake will nevernever desert you my dear arthur your kindness unmans me said rainford and yetif you knew allyou would perhaps think that i am not altogether unworthy of your sympathy but sit down and let me show you that though of lost and ruined reputation i am not without some feeling the earl took one of the two chairs that there were in the cell and rainford seated himself near his halfbrother on the other that you are acquainted with a considerable portion of my history i know resumed the highwayman for some seven or eight years ago you encountered a gipsywoman near oxford who revealed to you the faithful miranda indeed told me all she knew interrupted the earl but at that period she believed you to have been long dead yesand it was only a short time ago that i met her in hampshire answered rainford and accident led us to converse together a word or two which i dropped without anticipating the result induced her to make certain inquiries then she requested me in a hurried and excited manner to bare my right armand it was only on the occasion of which i am speaking and which occurred a few months since that i learnt the real narrative of my birth it appears that when miranda had fallen so dangerously ill and had become delirious the gipsies considered me to be a burthen to them as i was not born of their race and one of them took me to winchester in the neighbourhood of which city the tents were pitched at the time and there he purposely abandoned me what subsequently became of me i have not time now to relate my history has been most eventful and could not be compressed into a short narrative but should the laws of my country demand that my misdeeds be expiated on the scaffold i will leave that history written out in all its remarkable details for your contemplation talk not thus thomasoh talk not thus cried arthur i will save you yeteven if i throw myself at the feet of my sovereign and proclaim that you are my brother god grant that you may prove successful for the sake of one who loves me well said rainford solemnly but let me pursue the thread of that much of my story which i have now to relate to you it appears that when miranda did recover from her serious illness the gipsies did not like to tell her the truth relative to myself and they therefore invented the tale of my death to account for my disappearance thus was it that until a few months ago she remained in ignorance of the deceit that had been practised upon her and the same day which revealed to her the fact that i was still alive made me acquainted with the history of my birth miranda also told me that benjamin bones was still in existence and was reputed to be a rich man she had recently been in london and curiosity had prompted her to make inquiries concerning him all that she had gleaned she communicated to me it then struck me that i would come to londonthat i would throw myself in the way of that man who had plundered me of my inheritanceand that i would watch for some favourable opportunity to wring from him the amount with interest and compound interest that was fairly mine i learnt from miranda that certain papers had been found about the person of my poor mother after she was dead and that the perusal of them had excited the interest of this bones it therefore struck me that i might recover those documents as well as the money of which i had been plundered if the documents should prove in any way interesting or valuable i thought so much the better if not no harm would be done in obtaining possession of them i came to london and accident enabled me through the intervention of a mutual acquaintance named tullock to meet with benjamin bones i offered him my services in a particular wayand he accepted them to be candid he was to plan deeds of villanyand i was to execute them his terms were so ridiculously exorbitant that i should have laughed at them had i not a particular object to serve in connecting myself with him and the opportunity which i sought presented itself sooner than i had anticipated in a word i had succeeded in all i had undertaken i was enabled to help myself to as much as i chose of his hoarded treasuresand i discovered the papers that i have alluded to and were they of any interest asked the earl of such interest and of such value arthur returned tom rain that perhaps there is no other man in england who would have failed to avail himself of the brilliant prospects that they opened to my view but i was not to be dazzled by themnot to be led away by the temptation no i knew that my character was gonethat my reputation was tarnishedthat my misdeeds were numerous and greatand i felt also for you arthuras well as for the haughty name of ellingham what do you mean my dear brother cried the noble struck by the impressive tone in which rainford uttered these words i mean answered the debased highwayman to the great peer that within the last few days there has been within my reach a jewel which i might have had and might still have for the mere trouble of extending my hand to reach it a jewel such as men toil all their lives to gain this jewel is a proud title and a princely fortune thomasmy brother ejaculated the earl a strange and exciting suspicion flashing through his brain yesa proud title and a princely fortune arthur repeated rainford but i desire neither yetsolemnly and seriously do i declare that amongst those papers which i discovered in the den of benjamin bones there was one which would make me rich at the expense of anotherennoble me to the prejudice of one whom the proud title better becomesand that individual who would thus suffer is yourself for octavia manners was the countess of ellinghamand ithe debased highwayman am thine elder brother legitimately born oh what do i hear exclaimed arthur and how much generosity does your conduct display but think not dearest brother that i grieve at the announcement which you have just made nofar from that to know that my father did justice to your poor motherto be able to entertain the conviction that the author of our being was less guilty than i imaginedis a source of satisfaction so pureso sincereso heartfelt that i would gladly purchase it even with the loss of title and of fortune it is you who are generous arthur said rainfordfor so we shall continue to call him at all events for the present but that coronet which sits so gracefully on your noble brow and that fortune which enables you to do so much good shall never be lost to you nonever arthur titles i care not forgreat wealth i do not craveand even if i yearned for the one or aspired to the other of what avail would be that idleineffectual ambition here am i in a vile dungeonaccused of a serious offencemy life endangered and even if your interest should save me must i not for ever become an exile from the land of my birth yes for whether you deter the prosecutors from farther proceedings in my caseor should they push the matter to the extreme verge and my life be saved only at your intercessioncan i remain in england if released from custody how can i hope to gain an honest name in this climeif condemned to death and then reprieved will not this leniency on the part of the crown be conceded on the condition of banishment for the remainder of my days thus arthur even did i desire to possess the proud name of ellinghamdid i aspire to that coronet which adorns thy browi could not be mad enough to yield to the temptation but i repeati care not for ranki need not much wealth and thus neither my position nor my inclination will for an instant permit me to disturb you in the enjoyment of the family honours and the hereditary estates alas how muchhow deeply do i regret that we had not met before to embrace as brothers exclaimed the earl though crimes are imputed to you thomasyet do you possess a heart endowed with the loftiestthe most generous feelings ah well do i now understand wherefore you were agitated last night at lady hatfields houseand why you told me that from no other man in england would you ask as a favour that right of egress from the mansion which you could command by force and i who was once on the point of striking you but wherefore did you not then reveal to me what you have told me now the secret of my birth you should never have learnt from my lips answered rainford noi would not have allowed you to know that you possessed a relative for whom you would have to blush but i was compelled to make that revelation to lady hatfieldbecause ah let us not talk of her brother said lord ellingham mournfully i would not for worlds reproach youand yet you know not how profoundly i have loved that womanhow tenderly i love her still but my hopes therelet us change the topic i say he added hastily interrupting himself and now tell me if there be any thing i can do in order to soften the grief which must be experienced by that one to whom you alluded ere nowany message that i can take to her yes you must see her said rainford after a moments reflection and you must tell her that she is to give up to you all those papers which relate to the marriage of our father and my mother and to my birth she is acquainted with every thing that concerns me and my affairs it was my original intention to keep those papersnot to serve any purposenever to use thembut to gratify one of those unaccountable whims which sometimes influence the most strongminded amongst us i thought that perhaps when in a foreign landfor it was my intention to have quitted this country in a few daysi might sometimes feel a pleasure in contemplating documents so closely connected with my parentage and my birth perhaps too i might have been swayed by some little sentiment of pride in being able to say to myself a title and a princely fortune are within my grasp and i will not take them because i feel myself so utterly unworthy of the first and because i require not the otherbut now let my fate be whatever it may it is prudent that those papers should be destroyed she who has them in her keeping loves meadores me but she has one foibleone weakness which has already produced serious embarrassment she is fond of gay apparelof costly jewelsof those trinkets and that outward show which dazzle the minds of so many women and this passion on her part is stronger than herself in a word then i would rather that the papers should not remain in her handsi would sooner that they should be burnt at once than become the source of a temptation which circumstances might perhaps some day render irresistible to her if you really wish to ease my mind of any portion of that weight of anxiety which now hangs upon it you will at once visit her and when you tell her all that has passed between you and me ere now she will give you up those documents which i enjoin you to commit to the flames when you have perused them i will do your bidding thomas in all respects save one returned lord ellingham and that is with regard to the destruction of the papers noif you are generous to a degree i must at least be just and i will keep those documents for yousafely religiously keep themto be at your disposal at any time however remote should altered circumstances induce you to claim them then you imagine said rainford with something of bitterness in his tone that should the future smile upon me i might be tempted to pluck the coronet from your brow to place it on mine own you wrong meyes you wrong me arthur heaven knows that i would not willinglywantonly do so cried the nobleman enthusiastically but justice wellbe it as you say interrupted rainford with a view to terminate the discussion on this topic obtain the papersthey will be safer with you than with her much as she is devoted to me and now must i reveal to you another secreta secret of a strange and romantic nature connected with her whom you are about to visit with esther said the earl hastily ah ever harping upon that name exclaimed rainford did i not assure you last night that esther is as pure and innocent as woman can be and that she does not even know me by sight see then if i have deceived youbut i will not keep you in suspense at this moment the turnkey entered with an intimation that it was impossible to allow the interview to be protracted any longer on the present occasion as the hour for locking up had already passed some time tomorrow then you will come again said rainford in a low whisper to his brother and now go to no brandon street locks fieldsit is not very far from hereand inquire for mrs rainford the earl pressed his hand in assurance of obeying the directions thus given and as the turnkey appeared impatient the young nobleman hurried away from his brothers cell but the mystery relative to esther de medinawhatever it might bewas not so soon to be cleared up as the earl of ellingham expected upon leaving the prison he observed an illlooking fellow lounging about at the gate and on whose forbidding countenance the light of the lamp streamed fully when the wicket was opened to afford the nobleman egressfor our readers will remember that all the incidents yet related in this narrative occurred in the winter time when it is dark at four oclock but it was now nearly six oclock and the atmosphere was heavy with mist the earl walked rapidly away from the prisongate but when he had proceeded about thirty yards he inquired of a passerby the way to locks fields the man was a stranger in the neighbourhood and could not tell him please sir ill show you the way exclaimed another individual stepping officiously forward lord ellingham immediately recognised by the light that glimmered from a window in horsemonger lane the illlooking fellow whom he had noticed at the door of the prison and for an instant he hesitated to accept his services but at the next moment he felt ashamed of this vague alarm and directed the man to lead on the fellow turned abruptly round saying you are going out of your way sir we must get down to the fields by the back of the prison and he led the way the earl following him down horsemonger lane towards harper street but as they passed along the prisonwall arthur observed two or three men loitering about at short intervals from each other and it struck him that his guide coughed in a peculiar fashion as he passed them a misgiving which he vainly endeavoured to resist was now excited in the earls mind but still he would not turn back nor question his guide suddenly he was seized from behind and pulled violently backward while a strong hand fastened itself as it were over his mouth he struggled desperately but his guide turned on him and he was now in the grasp of four powerful men whose united strength it was impossible to resist still he endeavoured to release himself and once he managed to get the hand away from his mouth an advantage of which he instantly availed himself to cry out for help but in another instant he was stunned by the blow of a pistol on the head when he awoke he was in total darkness and lying on a hard bed he instinctively stretched out his arms his right hand encountered a rough and damp stone wall he rose and groped cautiously about himbut it required not many moments to convince him of the terrible though mysterious truththat he was the inmate of a narrow dungeon but where was he thus imprisoned who were the authors of this outrage and for what purpose was he made a captive these three queries defied all conjecture and the young nobleman was left to the darkness of his dungeon and the gloom of his meditations chapter xlix a painful interview we must now go back a few hoursonly to the morning of this eventful dayin order to describe the interview which mr clarence villiers had with his respectable aunt mrs slingsby at her residence in old burlington street he called at her abode as early as nine oclockfor he had passed a sleepless night in consequence of the communication made to him by the individual whom he as yet knew only as captain sparks and of whose arrest on the preceding night he was as yet ignorant mrs slingsby adelais and rosamond were seated at breakfast in a comfortable little parlour when clarence was announced at first his appearance at so unusual an hour and when he was supposed to be on his way to his office in somerset house excited some alarm lest he had bad news to communicate and the sisters already trembled for fear their father had discovered their abode but he speedily reassured them by declaring that he intended to give himself a holiday that morning and had therefore come to join them at the breakfasttable you are welcome clarence said mrs slingsby while adelais appeared so pleased at this unexpected visit that the enhanced carnation tinge of her cheeks and the joy that flashed in her fine eyes rendered her transcendently beautiful but rosamond seemed pensive and even melancholyalthough she endeavoured to smile and appear gay i had a visit from captain sparks last evening observed clarence he is going to america and he called to take leave of me as well as to entrust me with some little commission which i of course undertook and we heard a most wholesome and beneficial discourse from the reverend mr sawkins observed mrs slingsby was mr sheepshanks present inquired villiers without looking at his aunt and apparently intent only on carving the ham my dear clarence said mrs slingsby in a serious reproachful tone your question is light and inconsiderate you doubtless intended it as a jest but the object to which it refers is one painfully calculated to wound those who have the good cause at heart mr sheepshanks has conducted himself in a manner that has produced the most lively grief as well as the greatest astonishment in what may be strictly termed the religious world sir henry courtenay was shocked when i narrated the incident to him oh sir henry was shocked was he exclaimed clarence well for my part i should have conceived that a man of fashion would have cared very little for all the sheepshanks and sawkins in the universe clarence said mrs slingsby what is the matter with you this morning there seems to be an unusual flippancy in your observations not at all my dear aunt only i conceive that a man who is fond of gaietywho goes to partiesmixes with the lite of the west end and so on can have but little time to devote to the interests of cannibalclothing associations my dear nephew you astonish me exclaimed mrs slingsby is it to affix a vulgar nickname to an admirable institution that you call it a cannibalclothing association i once thought you had some degree of respect for the philanthropic and religious establishments which are the boast and ornament of your native land but my dear aunt pardon me if i have offended you said clarencebut in a cool and indifferent tone i really forgot at the moment the name of the institution to which that arrant hypocrite and scoundrel sheepshanks belonged use not such harsh words clarence enjoined mrs slingsby who knew not what to think of her nephews unusual manner and discourse mr sheepshanks has lost himself in the estimation of all persons of rightly constituted minds but the christian spirit of forgiveness commands us to be lenient in our comments on the actions even of the wicked that may be said clarence but as i read the account in the newspapers it certainly looked so black against this sheepshanks that had he been sent to newgate he would have had no more than his due now my opinion is thisrobbery is always a heinous crime but he who robs his fellowcreatures under the cloak of religion is an atrocious sinner indeed hypocrisy my dear aunt is a detestable vice and you as a woman of sound sense and discerning judgment must admit the truth of my observation but we were talking of sir henry courtenay you must not utter a word against him said adelais in the most artless manner possible for rosamond has conceived so high an opinion of him because dear mrs slingsby has represented his virtueshis mental qualificationshis admirable character to me in terms which make me as enthusiastic as herself in extolling so good and amiable a man exclaimed rosamond speaking with an ardour which was the more striking because the natural purity of her soul prevented her from seeing the necessity of checking it mrs slingsby coloured and glanced uneasily towards her nephew who did not however appear to notice that the conversation had taken a turn which was disagreeable to her in fact the suspicions originally excited in his mind by the communications of the preceding evening were now materially strengthened and the more he contemplated the character of his aunt the more transparent became the film that had so long blinded him as to its real nature and so you are a great admirer of sir henry courtenay rosamond he said endeavouring to maintain as calm and placid an exterior as possible rosamond is fully aware that virtue deserves respect wherever it exists returned mrs slingsby hastily and sir henry courtenay is the pattern of all virtue dear madamis he not exclaimed rosamond he is a very good man my dear as i have frequently assured you said the pious widow but let us change a conversation which does not appear agreeable to clarence i would not for the world manifest so much selfishness observed villiers coolly as to quit a topic which gives so much gratification to rosamond at the same timeas the future husband of adelais and therefore soon to be your brotherinlaw dear rosamondi must warn you against conceiving extravagant notions of the integrity and immaculate virtue of any man who belongs to what is called the fashionable world but dear mrs slingsby has assured me clarence ejaculated rosamond warmly that sir henry courtenay is an exception to the general rulethat he is the very pattern of every thing generous and goodand that no one could err in following his advice whatever it might be oh i can assure you rosamond stopped short for mrs slingsby seeing that her nephews countenance was becoming purple with indignation as the artless girl thus gave vent to the enthusiasm excited in her soul by the most insidious representationsmrs slingsby we say had touched her with her foot beneath the tablea movement naturally construed by rosamond into a hint to cut short her observations you can retire dear girls said mrs slingsby i wish to have a little conversation with clarence do not keep us away long dear madam exclaimed adelais in a playful manner as she rose to quit the room with her sister clarence and mrs slingsby were now alone together and the position of each was a most painful one the aunt saw that something was wrong and her guilty conscience excited a thousand vague fears within her bosom while the nephew felt convinced that the relative whom he had hitherto loved and respected was worthy only of his abhorrence and contempt there was a long pause in the conversation after the sisters had left the room but at length the silence so irksome to both nephew and aunt was broken by the latter clarencesomething appears to have vexedto have annoyed you this morning she observed in a tremulous tone do you know he said turning abruptly round towards her and fixing a searching glance upon her countenance that you act most unwiselymost indiscreetlynay most incorrectly to expatiate so much upon the virtues of sir henry courtenay when i first entered the room this morning i found rosamond pensive and thoughtful and she said not a word until that mans name was mentioned when she became as it were enthusiastic in his defence although no actual attack was made by me upon his character what is the meaning of this strange conduct clarenceif in my respect for sir henry courtenayi have been too warm in my praises of his characterif aunt there is no supposition in the case interrupted villiers almost sternly you have been too warmand heaven only knows with what object god forbid that i should impute the worst motives to your conduct in this respect but a dreadful suspicion has been excited in my mind a suspicion murmured mrs slingsby faintly while the glance which she threw upon her nephew was full of uneasiness yesa suspicion he repeated and most painfuloh most painful is it to me to be compelled to address you in this manner but the case is too serious to allow me to remain silent in one word have you not made an impression on the mind of that artless girl which may endanger her peacehave you not been encouraging in her breast an admiration for a man old enough to be her grandfatheran admiration which is not natural and which is calculated to inspire her with feelings towards a sexagenarian dandy clarence exclaimed the pious lady in a hysterical manner how dare you address me in this dictatorial tone would you seek to invest my conduct in bestowing wellmerited praise on a good man with an aspect so black your indignation is well feigned cried villiers his lips quivering with rage but the day of deception has passedhypocrisy shall no longer impose upon me if i accuse you unjustly i will grovel as an abject wretch at your feet to manifest my contrition before i thus debase myself however you must prove to me that you are indeed the noblemindedthe openheartedthe immaculate woman i have so long loved and revered tell me then the realthe true history of that night when a boy was received into this house through charitya few years ago mrs slingsby became as pale as death and sate gazing with haggard eyes upon her nephewunable to avert her glance and yet shrinking from his then you are guilty madam he said after a few moments pause and the excellentthe virtuousthe upright sir henry courtenay is your lover my god did the world ever know hypocrisy so abominableso black as this these words were uttered with extreme bitternessand mrs slingsby burst into a flood of tears while she covered her face with her hands clarence possessed a generous heart and this sight moved him my dear aunt he said i do not wish to mortify youmuch less to humiliate you in my presence in your own estimation you must necessarily be humiliated enough neither will i dwell at any length upon the painthe intense grief which i experience in finding you so different from what i have ever believed you to beuntil now he added in a mournful tone were you my sister or did you stand with reference to me in a degree of relationship that would permit me to remonstrate and advise i should perhaps both reproach and counsel you but it would ill become a nephew to address his aunt in such a manner clarence will you expose me will you ruin me demanded mrs slingsby in a hysterical tone not for worlds would i injure you ejaculated the young man but i must receive no more favours at your hands heretake back the money which you gave me a few days ago thank god i have not yet expended any of itand the arrangements i had made to furnish a house for the reception of my adelais can be countermanded she will not object to share a lodging with meuntil by my own honest exertions he added proudly i may be able to give her a suitable home and as he spoke he cast a roll of banknotes upon the table oh clarenceif i have been weakfrailculpable cried the widow you are at least severe and cruel for i have ever done all i could to serve your interests illustration were i to express my real opinion on that head answered villiers i might grieve you still more than i have already done a bandage has fallen from my eyesand i can now understand how necessary an instrument of publicity i have been for your assumed virtues but in the name of god let us argue the point no further for sincerelysincerely do i assert my unwillingness to give you additional pain pardon me however if i declare how impossible it ishow inconsistent it would beto leave those innocent girls in a dwelling which is visited by such a man as that sir henry courtenay how could you remove them elsewhere without exposing me clarence demanded his aunt in an imploring tone what explanation can you or i give them to account in a reasonable manner for the suddenness of such a step villiers paced the room in an agitated manner he knew not how to act to leave adelais and rosamond in the society of his aunt was repugnant to his high sense of honour and his correct notions of propriety and whither to remove them he knew not he had seen and heard enough at the breakfasttable to convince him that mrs slingsby had some sinister motive in creating in the mind of rosamondthat innocent artless mind which was so susceptible of any impressions which a designing woman might choose to make upon ita feeling of admiration in favour of the baronet and although he had to a considerable extent curbed the resentment and the indignation which his aunts conduct in this respect had aroused within him still to leave that young maiden any longer within an atmosphere of infection was impossible no he would sooner restore the sisters to their father and leave to circumstances the realization of his hopes in regard to adelais while he was still deliberating within himself what course to pursue and while mrs slingsby was anxiously watching him as he paced the room with agitated steps the servant entered with the mornings newspaper clarence took it from the table in a mechanical manner and glanced his eye over the first page but his thoughts were too painfully preoccupied to permit him to entertain even for an instant any idea of reading the journal noit was one of those unwitting actions which we often perform when sorely embarrassed or bewilderedan action without positive motive and without aim but how often do the most trivial deeds exercise a paramount influence over our destinies and this simple action of glancing at the newspaper proved to be an instance of the kind for at the moment when clarence was about to throw the journal back again upon the table and resume his agitated walk his eyes encountered an advertisement which instantaneously arrested his attention then with beating heart and with an expression of joy rapidly spreading itself over his countenance he read the following lines to a and ryour distressed and almost heartbroken father implores you to return to him the past shall be forgotten on his side and no obstacle shall be opposed to the happiness of a your father is lying on a sick bed and again implores that this prayer may not be made in vain god be thanked cried villiers no longer able to restrain his joy and handing the newspaper to his aunt he directed her attention to the advertisement here is an apology at once for the removal of the young ladies from this house clarence observed mrs slingsby and now that you are saved from the embarrassment in which you were plunged but a few minutes back will you promise nevernever to revealand if possible to forget you allude to your conduct towards rosamond said villiers tell me its motiveand i swear solemnly in one word then interrupted his aunt let rosamond beware of sir henry courtenay and now answer me a single questionfor i see you are impatient to be gonehow came you to discoverwhat meant your allusiontoto the boy who was received into this house i cannot stay to explain all that cried villiers but rest assured that your character stands no chance of being made the subject of scandalous talkunless indeed your future actions enough clarence exclaimed mrs slingsby i know that you must despise me but spare me any farther humiliation she then rang the bell and desired the servant to summon adelais and rosamond we need not pause to describe the joy which those fair beings experienced when clarence showed them the advertisement inviting them to return home although tears immediately afterwards started into their eyes when they read that their father was upon a bed of sickness they once more retired to their bedchamber to prepare their toilette for departure and when a hackneycoach drove round to the door they took leave of mrs slingsby with demonstrations of gratitude which struck to her heart like a remorse clarence accompanied them back to the cottage and his heart palpitated violentlyhe scarcely knew whereforewhen he assisted them to alight the front door was opened by the female servant who uttered a cry of joy on beholding the young ladies once more and with trembling steps adelais and rosamond entered the parlour followed by clarence to their surpriseand at first to their great delightthe sisters found themselves on crossing the threshold of the room in the presence of their father who was looking pale it was truebut with concentrated anger and not with illness adelais and rosamond fell on their knees before him exclaiming forgive us dear fatherforgive us how am i to receive you adelais he asked in a cold voice as miss torrensor as as miss torrens at present sir answered clarence stepping forward and speaking in a firm though respectful tone but in accordance with the promise held out in that advertisement which appears in todays journal i hope that your elder daughter will soon be mineand with your permission and blessing also where have my daughters been residing during their absence sir inquired mr torrens without appearing to notice the latter portion of villiers observations under the protection of a female relative of mine sir answered clarence with increasing misgivings at the cold demeanour of the father of his beloved thank you for the information sir said mr torrens with a smile of triumph at least you have so far disarmed my resentment that you have brought me back my daughter pure and innocent as when you enticed her away with the aid of a villanous robber a robber ejaculated clarence indignantly yes sir continued mr torrens in a sneering tone your worthy colleague captain sparks is a common highwaymana thiefproperly named thomas rainford and at this moment he is a prisoner in horsemonger lane gaol scarcely ten minutes have elapsed since i received a note from mr howard a solicitor informing me of the fact clarence was so astounded by this announcement that for a few moments he could make no reply and the young ladies who had in the meantime slowly risen from their suppliant posture and were now standing timidly by their fathers side exchanged glances of painful surprise yes resumed mr torrens in a stern and severe tone that man who aided you to effect the abduction of these disobedient girls is a common highwaymanand you could not be ignorant of that fact as i live sir ejaculated clarence at length recovering the power of speech i was ignorant of the fact and even nowbut he added correcting himself i cannot doubt your word at the same time permit me to assure you that i had never seen him until that night i require no farther explanation sir interrupted mr torrens my daughters are now once more under the paternal roofinveigled back again it is true by a stratagem on my part a stratagem repeated clarence while adelais uttered a faint shriek and sank weeping into her sisters arms yesa stratagem sir ejaculated mr torrens and now learn my decision mr villiers sooner than she shall become your wife he continued pointing towards the unhappy girl i would give her to the meanest hind who toils for his daily bread depart sirthis house is at least a place where my authority can alone prevail mr torrensi beseechi implore you began the wretched young man whose hopes were thus suddenly menaced so cruelly depart sir thundered the angry father or i shall use violenceand we will then see whether you will strike in return the parent of her whom you affect to love and he advanced towards villiers in a menacing manner i will not stay to irritate you sir said clarence feeling as if his heart were ready to burst adelaisremember one who will never cease to remember you rosamond farewell mr torrens became more and more impatient and villiers quitted the house with feelings as different from those which had animated him when he entered it as the deepest despair is different from the most joyous hope but the anguish of his heart was not greater than that which now filled the bosom of her from whom he was so unexpectedly and cruelly separated chapter l the lawyers office a few days after the events just related the following scene took place at mr howards office in golden square it was about four in the afternoon and the lawyer was seated in his private room at a table covered with papers when a clerk entered and announced that sir christopher blunt and his lady had just arrived his lady with himeh exclaimed the solicitor wellshow them in at once and accordingly in a few minutes the worthy knight with charlotteor we beg her pardon lady blunthanging upon his arm entered the office the old gentleman was all smilesbut the quick eye of mr howard immediately perceived that they were to some extent forced and feigned and that beneath his jaunty aspect there was not altogether the inward contentment much less the lightsome glee of a happy bridegroom as for lady bluntshe was attired in the richest manner and in all the colours of the rainbowlooking far too gaudy to be either genteel or fashionable my dear sir christopher i am quite charmed to see you exclaimed mr howard rising to welcome his client and the bride your ladyship yesthis is my loving and beloved lady blunt howard said the knight pompously a delightful creature i can assure youand who has vowed to devote herself to my happiness come now you great stupid said the lady finish your business here and let us see about the new carriage of all places in the world i hate a lawyers officeever since i was once summoned to a court of conscience for seventeen shillings and ninepencehalfpenny and had to call on the thief of an attorney to get him to take it by instalments of sixpence aweek so you see i cant abear the lawyers no offence sir she added turning towards mr howard but i always speak my mind and i think its best my dear creaturemy sweet love ejaculated sir christopher astounded at this outbreak of petulance on the part of his loving and beloved wife pray do not distress yourself my dear sir christopher said the lawyer we are accustomed to receive sharp rebukes from the ladies sometimes he added with as courteous a smile as he could possibly manage under the circumstances but pray be seated will your ladyship take this chairand he indicated the one nearest to the fire lady blunt quitted her husbands arm but made an imperious sign for him to bring his chair close to hers and he obeyed her with a submission which left no doubt in the lawyers mind as to the empire already asserted by the bride i am very glad you have called today sir christopher said the lawyer for he couldnt very well come before sir interrupted lady blunt because we only came back from the matrimonial trip last night mr howard bowed and was preparing to continue when the knight exclaimed my dear sir what is all this todo about the highwayman who robbed me of the two thousand pounds i thought i told you so particularly that i would rather no steps should be taken in the matter and nowthe moment i come back to town instead of having all our time to ourselves to gad about cozie together again interrupted lady blunt we are forced to come bothering here at a lawyers office the ends of justice must be met lady blunt said mr howard drily in consequence of particular information which i received i caused this thomas rainford to be apprehended and i appeal to sir christopher himselfwho has served the high office of sheriff and once stood as a candidate for the aldermanic gown of portsoken until i was obliged to cut those city people added the knight drawing himself up and why should you cut the city people demanded his wife for my part id sooner see the lord mayors show than punch and judy any day and thats saying a great dealfor no one can be more fonder of punch and judy than me my dear charlotte exclaimed the knight who now seemed to be sitting on thorns you charlotte at homelady blunt in public sir christopherif you please interrupted the bride but pray let mr howard get to the end of this business well my dear exclaimed sir christopher if it annoys you why would you come i assured you how unusual it was for ladies to accompany their husbands to the office of their solicitors oh i dare say sir christopher cried charlotte you dont think that im going to trust you out of my sight do you now im not quite such a fool as you take me for why even when we are walking along the street together i can see your wicked old eye fixed on the gals lady blunt exclaimed the knight becoming literally purple youyouyou do me an injustice so much the better i hope i am wrongfor both of our sakes returned her ladyship depend upon itbut no matter now let mr howard get on with his story with your permission madam i shall be delighted to do so said the lawyer i was observing just now that having received particular information i caused this scoundrel thomas rainford alias captain sparks to be apprehended and on monday morning sir christopher you must attend before the magistrate to give your evidence but who authorised you to proceed in this affair mr howard demanded the knight what a strange question exclaimed the lawyer evidently unwilling to give a direct answer to it only reflect for a moment my dear sir christopher a robbery is committedyou your nephew and myself are outwittedlaughed atset at defianceand when an opportunity comes in my way i very naturally adopt the best measures to punish the rogue quite proper too sir said lady blunt the idea of any one daring to laugh at sir christopher id scratch the villains eyes out if i had him here to laugh at sir christopher indeed does he look like a man who is meant to be laughed at lady blunt could not have chosen a more unfortunate opportunity to ask this question for her husband at that moment presented so ludicrous an appearance between his attempts to look pleasant and his fears lest he already seemed a henpecked old fool in the eyes of his solicitor that a man possessing less command over himself than mr howard would have laughed outright but with the utmost gravity in the world the lawyer assured her ladyship that nothing could be more preposterous than to laugh at a gentleman of sir christopher blunts rank and importance and he also declared that in arresting thomas rainford he had merely felt a proper anxiety to punish one who had dared to ridicule the knight after having robbed him lady blunt was one of those capricious women who will laugh at their husbands either as a matter of pastime or for the purpose of manifesting their own independence and predominant sway but who cannot bear the idea of any other person taking a similar liberty she therefore expressed her joy that mr howard had caused rainford to be apprehended and declared of her own accord that sir christopher should attend to give his evidence on the ensuing mondayfor she would go with him well my dear since such is your pleasure observed the knight there is no more to be said upon the subject i will go my love and i think that when the magistrate hears my evidence he will feel convinced that i know pretty well how to aid the operation of the laws and that i have not been a sheriff for nothing although sprung from a humble origin oh pray dont begin that nonsense sir christopher exclaimed the lady or i shall faint it is really quite sickening at that moment the door opened somewhat violently and mr frank curtis entered the room ah sir christopher my jolly old cockhow are you exclaimed that highly respectable young gentleman whose face was dreadfully flushed with drinking and who smelt so strong of cigars and rumpunch that his presence instantly produced the most overpowering effect mr curtis began the knight rising from his chair and drawing himself up to his full height i comeits no use to be grumpy over it uncle interrupted frank matrimony doesnt seem to agree with you very well since youre so soon put out of humour ah my dear charmy dear aunt i meanbeg your pardonquite a mistake you knowbut really you look charming this afternoon get out with you do cried lady blunt who was somewhat undecided how to treat mr curtis what doesnt matrimony agree with you either my dear and much respected aunt ejaculated frank why i once knew a lady who was in a galloping consumptiongiven up in fact and the undertaker who lived over the way had already begun to make her coffinfor he knew he should have the order for the funeral when all of a sudden a young chap fell in love with her married her and took her to the south of francewhere ive been by the byeand brought her home in six months quite recovered and in a fair way to present him with a little onea pledge of affection as its called mr curtis i am surprised at you exclaimed sir christopher in a pompous and commanding toneto talk in this way before a lady who has only recently passed through that trying ordeal ill be bound to say it wasnt so recent as you suppose old buck cried frank staggering against the lawyers table sir lady blunt has only been recentlyvery recently married as you are well aware said the knight sternly and now let me tell you sir that the detestable devices schemed by miss mordaunt and you have recoiled upon yourselves miss mordaunt and me exclaimed frank now unfeignedly surprised whyi never spoke to miss mordaunt in my life the monster half screamed lady blunt the audacious liar vociferated the knight pretty namesvery pretty said frank coolly but im rather tough thank god and so they wont kill me this time but i can assure you uncle youve got hold of the wrong end of the stick when you say that me and miss mordaunt planned any thing against you as i once observed to my friend the count of st omersmy lord says iwhat asks the marquismy lord duke i repeated in a firmer tone cease this nonsense mr curtis interrupted sir christopher blunt sternly yesand let us come along my dear said lady blunt rising and taking her husbands arm your nevvy does smell so horrid of rum and cigars and very good things too cried frank aint they howard me and a party of young fashionables have been keeping it up a bit today at my lodgingson the strength of my intended marriage with mrs goldberry the rich widow your marriage frank exclaimed sir christopher whathowwhen lord bless you my dear uncle said mr curtis swaying himself to and fro in a very extraordinary manner you dont half know what kind of a fellow i am while you was away honeymooning and nonsense nonsense indeed exclaimed lady blunt indignantly come sir christopherits no good staying here talking to mr imperance going to conduit streeteh aunt said frank with a drunken leer but bythebye you regularly choused me out of five guineas you know auntand something else too ehwhat said sir christopher turning back mr curtis do you dare to accuse lady blunt of having made a very great fool of me but a much bigger one of you old fellow added frank and snapping his fingers in his uncles face he exclaimed i dont care a penny for you sir christopher in a few days i shall marry mrs goldberryyou are very welcome to be as happy as you can with your abigail there so remember were cuts in future sir christophersince you want to come the bumptious over me the knight was about to reply but his betterhalf drew him hastily away from the lawyers office saying come along you great stupid whats the use of staying to dispute with that feller the door closed behind the happy couple and mr frank curtis throwing himself into the chair which lady blunt had just quitted burst out into a tremendous fit of laughter you have gone too far franka great deal too far said the lawyer shaking his head disapprovingly sir christopher has been a good friend to you and although he has committed an egregious error in running off with that filly still what do i care interrupted frank i proposed to mrs goldberry yesterdayand she accepted me after a good deal of simpering and blushing and so on shes got five thousand a year and lives in splendid style in baker street i made her believe that i wasnt quite a beggar myself but alls fair in love and war as my friend the late prince of st omers used to say in his cups but what about this fellow rainford and how the deuce did he come to be arrested i received information of his residence answered howard coolly and i gave him into custody accordingly its very odd continued frank but i met him last sunday night and i dont mind telling you that we went into the middle of hyde park and had an hours wrestling together to see who was the better man i threw him nineteen times running and he threw me seven then i threw him three timesand he gave in so we cried quits for old scores and i gave him my word and honour that nothing would ever be done against him in respect to the little affair of the two thousand pounds you may therefore suppose that im rather vexed the officers had already received instructions to apprehend him at the time your alleged wrestling match came off said the lawyer and your evidence will be required next monday morning and i suppose the whole affair of the robbery will come out observed curtis interrogatively decidedly so you must state the exact truthif you can added mr howard if i can damn it old fellow that observation is not quite the thingcoming from you and if any body else had uttered it egad id send him a hostile message tomorrow morningas i did to my most valued friend the marquis of boulogne when i was in paris ill just tell you how that was not now frank interrupted the lawyer because im very busy its getting on for post timeand i have not a minute to spare but mind and be punctual at the borough policeoffice on monday morning at ten wellif i must i must said curtis but after all i think its rather too badfor this sparks or rainford or whatever his name is seems a good kind of fellow after all the law must take its course frank observed the attorney in an abrupt dry manner curtis accordingly took his leave and returned to his lodgings where by dint of cold water applied outwardly and sodawater taken inwardly he endeavoured to sober himself sufficiently to pay a visit to mrs goldberry for it was literally true that there was such a ladythat she lived in splendid style in baker streetthat frank had proposed to herand that he had been acceptedbut we have deemed it necessary to give the reader these corroborative assurances on our part inasmuch as the whole tale would otherwise have appeared nothing more nor less than one of the innumerable children of mr curtiss fertile imagination chapter li lord ellingham in the dungeon four weeks had elapsed since the arrest of tom rain and the extraordinary adventure which had snatched the earl of ellingham from the great world and plunged him into a narrownoisome cell yesfour weeks had the nobleman languished in the terrible dungeonignorant of where his prisonhouse was situatedwhy his freedom was thus outragedand who were his persecutors every morning at about eight oclock a small trap in the door of his cell was opened and food was passed through to him a lamp had been given him the day after he became an inmate of the place and oil was regularly supplied for the maintenance of the light his food was good and wine accompanied itit was therefore evident that no petty spite nor mean malignity had led to his captivity indeed the man who brought him his food assured him that no harm would befall himthat his imprisonment was necessary to suit certain weighty and important interests but that it would not be protracted beyond a few weeksand that the only reason for placing him in such a dungeon was because it was requisite to guard against the possibility of an escape often and often had lord ellingham endeavoured to render his gaoler more communicative but the man was not to be coaxed into garrulity neither did he ever allow the nobleman to catch a glimpse of his features when he brought the food to the trapdoor he invariably stood on one side and spoke in a feigned tone when replying to any question to which he did vouchsafe an answer the day after his strange and mysterious arrest arthur received from this man the assurances above mentioned and a considerable weight was thereby removed from his mind his imprisonment was not to be eternal a few weeks would see the term of the necessity that had caused it but still he grievednay felt shocked to think of the state of suspense in which those who cared for him would remain during his long absence this source of affliction he mentioned to the man who attended upon him and the reply was to some extent satisfactory i will supply you with writing materials and you can address letters to your friends stating that sudden business has called you abroadto france for instance and that you may probably be absent six weeks write in this mannerthe excuse will at least allay any serious fears that may be entertained concerning you and those letters shall be sent through the post to the persons to whom they are addressed but you must deliver them unsealed into my hands that i may satisfy myself as to the real nature of their contents small as the satisfaction resulting from this proceeding could be to lord ellingham it was still far preferable to the maintenance of a rigid silence in respect to his friends he accordingly wrote a laconic letter in the sense suggested by his gaoler and addressed copies to lady hatfield thomas rainford and mr de medina the next time his gaoler visited himor rather came to the door of the dungeon the prisoner was informed that the three letters had been duly forwarded through the twopenny post the reader will scarcely require to be informed of the mental anxiety which the nobleman suffered during his incarceration this was naturally greatvery great he was also frequently plunged in the most bewildering conjectures relative to the authors the motives and the locality of his imprisonment nor less did he grieveoh deeply grieve when he thought of the surprisethe alarmand the sorrow with which lady hatfield on one side and rainford on the other must view his mysterious absence he had left the former with the intention of seeing the latter and she would naturally expect him to return if for no other reason than to give her an account of their interview and he had quitted rainford with the promise to perform a certain task and also having pledged himself to use his influence and his wealth in his behalf the idea of the feelings that must be entertained by rainford relative to his absence afflicted him more than any other that generoushearted man had told him to keep his coronet and his fortune to the prejudice of himthe elder brother legitimately born and yet that interview in horsemonger lane gaol seemed destined to be the last which they were to have together what would the poor prisoner think when the earl returned not and when a letter containing a cold and wretched excuse was put into his hands oh this was the maddeningmaddening thought and the earl shrank from it far more appalled than from the stern reality of his dungeon because rainford might be judged and alas the law might take its courseits fatal courseere he the earl could stretch out a hand to save that generoushearted halfbrother but amidst all the bitter and bewildering reflections which tormented him during his imprisonment of four weeks in that dungeon of unknown neighbourhood there was still a predominant ideaa gleam of hope which apart from the assurance that his captivity would soon have a term cheered and animated him often for whither will not the rays of hope penetrate even when hope is really gone her work is often done by despair and the latter feeling in its extreme is thus often akin to hope herself the hope then that cheered and animated the earl at times wasescape yes he yearned to quit that dungeon not so much for his own sakeoh not nearly so much as for that of his halfbrother who was involved in such peril and who needed influence and interest to save him for the earl well knew that the law in criminal cases is not so tardy as in civil matters and that to take away a mans life all its machinery is set into rapid motionalthough to settle his claims to a fortune or to give him justice against his neighbour it is heaven knows heartbreakingly slow and wearisome to send a man to the scaffold takes but a few weeks at the old baileyto decide the right of this man or that man to a particular estate or legacy occupies years and years in the court of chancery oh how thirsty do our legislators appear to drink human blood how rapidly all technicalities and causes of delay are cleared away when the capital offender stands before his judge a dayperhaps an hour is sufficient to decide the death of a human being but half a century may elapse ere the conflicting claims to an acre of land or a few thousand pounds can be settled elsewhere and strangeah and monstrous too is it that the man who loses a case in which he sues his neighbour for twenty pounds may appeal to another tribunalhave a new trial grantedand losing that also perhaps obtain a third investigation of the point at issue and thus three verdicts in that beggarly business but the man who is doomed to diewho loses his case against the criminal prosecutorcannot appeal to another tribunal no judges sit solemnly in banco for him one verdict is sufficient to take away a life away with him to the scaffold in this great commercial country twenty poundsconsisting of pieces of paper printed upon and stamped with particular figuresare of more consequence than a being of flesh and blood what though this being of flesh and blood may have othersa wife and childrendependent on him no matter give him not the chance of a new trial let one judge and one jury suffice to consign him to the hangman there can be no appealno reinvestigation for his case although it be a case of life and death but away with him to the scaffold what bloodthirsty and atrocious monsters have our lawgivers been what cruel inhuman beings are they still to perpetuate so abominableso flagrantso infamous a state of jurisprudence for how many have been hanged though innocenttheir guiltlessness transpiring when it is too late but there is no court of appeal for the man accused of a capital crime he is a dog who has got a bad nameand public opinion dooms him to be hanged days and weeks before the jury is sworn or the judge takes his seat to try him and wherefore is not this infamous state of the law which allows appeals to the case of moneyclaims but none to the case of capital accusationswherefore is not this state of the law altered because our legislators are too much occupied with their own party contentions and strifesbecause they are ever engaged in battling for the ministerial benchesthe loaves and fishes of power because it seems to them of more consequence to decide whether sir robert peel or lord john russell shall be prime ministerwhether the conservatives or the whigs shall hold the reins of power or else gentle reader the condition of greeceor spainor turkeyor even perhaps of otaheiteis a matter of far greater importance than the lives of a few miserable wretches in the condemned cells of criminal gaols but in our estimationand we have the misfortune to differ from the legislators of the countrythe life of one of those wretches is of far greater consequence than the state of tyrantridden greecethe spanish marriagesthe quarrels of the sultan and his pachasor the miserable squabbles of hypocritical english missionaries and a french governor in tahiti yesin our estimation the life of one man outweighs all such considerations and we would rather see half a session of parliament devoted to the discussion of the grand question of the punishment of death than one single day of that session given to all the foreign affairs that ever agitated in a ministers brain it was the twentyeighth day of lord ellinghams imprisonment and it was about six oclock on the evening of this day the nobleman was at work upon the masonry of his dungeonhis efforts being directed to remove the stones from the immediate vicinity of a small square aperture or sink in the corner of the cell his implements were a knife and fork and one of the screws of the framework of his bed but with these he worked arduously nor was this the first day of his labours no for twentysix days had he been toilingtoilingtoiling on to make an opening into what he believed to be the common sewereven at the risk of inundating his dungeon and thus perishing miserably but all those toils and all that risk were sustained and encountered for thee tom rain slowlyslowlyslowly had the work progressed but nowon the twentyeighth dayarthur found himself so far advanced that escape from the dungeon was at least open to him but escape into what region into those drains and sewers which run beneath the streets of london and form a maze to which the only clue is a knowledge of the point whence he who enters the labyrinth originally starts and this clue was not possessed by arthur for in what part of london his dungeon was situate he had not the least idea it could hardly be said that he was confident of this dungeon being in the metropolis at alland yet he had many reasons to believe that it was for in the first place his gaoler had mentioned the fact of his letters having been sent by the twopenny post secondly he had ascertained that his cell was situate in the very vicinity of a common sewer and sewers were not at that time formed in the villages surrounding the metropolis and thirdly he could scarcely believe that those who had arrested him in london would have run the risk of removing him out of its precinctsfor he was well aware that atrocious outrages and diabolical crimes may be perpetrated with greater chances of impunity in the metropolis than elsewhere but although he was thus tolerably well convinced that his prisonhouse was within the boundaries of london he had not the least notion of the precise locality and when he had removed sufficient of the massive masonry to form an aperture large enough to permit a fullgrown man to pass into the sewerand when he heard the muddy slimy waters gurgling languidly in the depths below he shuddered and his blood ran coldfor he thought within himself i have heard of men who venture into these places in search of treasures and who having wandered for miles and miles beneath the streets of london have issued safely forth again but they knew whence they started and thus that startingpost was a clue to guide them in the maze but i know not whether on entering that slimy shallow i should turn to the right or to the leftnor which channels to pursue in that terrible labyrinth then ashamed of his fearsreproaching himself for his hesitation he drank a deep draught of the wine that had been supplied him in the morning and holding the lamp in one hand and in the other a stout stick cut from one of the crossbeams that supported the mattress of his bed he entered the common sewer his feet sank down into the thick slime and the muddy water reached to his knees there was a nauseous odour in the dreary passage and the filthy fluid was very thick these circumstances convinced him that it was low water in the river thames and by examining the masonry forming the sides of the sewers he saw that the tide was running out he therefore resolved to follow the course of the muddy stream with the hope that he might at length reach one of the mouths by which the sewers discharge their contents into the river armed with his stick to protect himself against the rats as well as to sound his way so as to escape any hole or abrupt depth that there might chance to be in the bottom of the sewerand holding the lamp in his left hand the great peer of england pursued his appalling path in a channel seven feet wide and beneath a vaulting twelve feet high from time to time the sudden rush of a number of vermin along a ledge by the side of the channel and then the sound of their plunge into the slimy water startled him to such a degree that he almost dropped his lamp and then the conviction which flashed to his mind that if he lost his light he should be inevitably devoured by those vermin caused such a chill to pass through himas if ice were unexpectedly placed upon his heartthat his courage was oftentimes nearly subdued altogether but he thought of his halfbrother who had manifested so much generosity towards himhe thought of her whom he had promised to love as a sisterand he also remembered that were he to retrace his steps even if he could find the way back he should be returning to a dungeonof all this he thoughtand he went onon in that revolting and perilous maze yes with lamp held high up and stick groping in the filthy mudstirring up nauseating odoursonon went the daring enterprising chivalrous noblemanbreathing an infected and almost stifling airan air formed of such noxious gases that it might explode at any moment ignited by the lamp but hark what is that rumbling soundlike thunder at a vast distance arthur pausesand listens the truth in a few moments flashed to his mind he was beneath a street in which vehicles were moving oh now he felt convincedeven if he had entertained any doubts beforethat he was in london watching the progress of the slimy stream he turned first to the left up a channel that branched off from the one which he had originally enteredthen he turned to the right into anotherthe hollow rumbling sounds overhead gradually increasing in volume and power suddenly he beholds a light glancing upon the putrescent surface of the slimy stream through which he is wading kneedeep that light is halfadozen yards in front of himflickering playfully he advances sounds of footstepshuman footstepscome down from overhead he looks upand behold there is a grating in the street above and through that grating the light of the lamp streams and the sound of the footsteps comes he hears voices tooas the people passthe voices of that world from all communication with which he is for the time cut off shall he cry out for assistance no a sense of shame prevents him he would not like to be dragged forth from those filthy depths in the presence of a curiousgapingstaring crowd he prefers the uncertainty and the peril of his subterranean path in the fond hope that it may speedily lead to some safe issue the earl accordingly passed ondisturbing the water on which the light from the streetlamp playeddisturbing too the vermin on either side with the splash of the fetid fluid as he waded through it but when he had proceeded a dozen yards he looked backas if unwilling to quit the vicinity of that grating which opened into the street in another moment however he conquered his hesitation and pursued his way in a straight line without again turning off either to the right or to the left upwards of an hour had elapsed since he had quitted the dungeonand as yet he had found no issue from that labyrinth of subterranean passages grim terrors already began to assume palpable forms to his imagination when suddenly he beheld a dim twinkling light like a faint star at a great distance ahead that light seemed a beacon of hope and as he drew nearer and nearer its power increased at last he saw another twinkling light struggling as it were betwixt glimmer and gloomand then a thirdand then a fourth the air appeared to grow fresher too and the earl at length believed that an opening from the maze must be near yes he was not mistaken the lights increased in number and intensity and he was soon convinced that they shone upon the opposite bank of the thames a few minutes moreand all doubt was past the fresh breeze from the river fanned his cheekand as he reached the mouth of the sewer and hurled away his lamp he saw the mighty flood stretched out before hima bridge spanning its width at a little distance on his left hand he knew that bridgehe recognised it by the pale lustre of the moonfor the evening was clear and fine it was blackfriars bridge then from which direction had he come remembering the turnings he had taken he could fix upon the district of clerkenwell as the scene of his late imprisonment but he did not pause to reflect on a matter now so trivialtrivial because he had escaped and was once more free it was low waterand a bed of mud received him kneedeep as he leapt from the mouth of the sewer but what cared he for his uncouth and filthy appearancesince he had escaped and was once more free for four weeks his beard had not been shaved nor his toilette carefully performed and his hair too was long and matted it was therefore necessary to cleanse himself and change his attire as soon as possible hastening along the muddy margin of the rivers bed he ascended the steps of a wharf and plunged into the district of whitefriars there selecting the humblestlooking public house he could find he entered and as he had his purse about him for those who had imprisoned did not rob him he was enabled to command the necessaries and attentions which he required indeed the landlord willingly supplied a complete change of linen and a suit of his own clothes to a guest who spared not his gold and as mine host and the earl happened to be of the same height and equally slender in figure the garments of the former suited well enough the temporary need of the latter a hundred times while performing his hasty toilette was the earl on the point of summoning the landlord and making inquiries concerning tom rain but the extraordinary appearance which he himself had worn on entering the publichouse must he felt convinced have already engendered strange suspicions concerning him and prudence suggested to him the necessity of avoiding any conversation which might strengthen these suspicions and thereby lead him into some embarrassment from which the revelation of his name and rank might alone extricate him but oh how painfulhow acutely painful was the suspense which he endured while passing through the details of ablution and change of attire and although never were the duties of the toilette more necessary yet never had the earl hurried them over with such feverish excitement at length as st pauls cathedral proclaimed the hour of eight on that eventful evening arthur sallied forth from the publichouseleaving the landlord and landlady a prey to the wildest and most unsatisfactory conjectures as to what he was and how he had happened to be in the condition in which he at first presented himself at their establishment they however both agreed that it was a very good evenings work for them inasmuch as their strange guest had paid them with a liberality which would have rendered a similar visit every night of their lives a most welcome godsend in the meantime the earl of ellingham had gained fleet street with the intention of entering some tavern or hotel where a file of newspapers was kept but he was struck by the deserted appearance of the great thoroughfarefor the shops were all shut and the vehicles instead of pouring in two dense streams running different ways were few and far between it then struck him that it was sunday eveningfor though in his dungeon he had been enabled to count the lapse of each day through the date afforded by the morning visits of his gaoler yet he had not kept so accurate a calculation as to mark each day by its distinctive name illustration as he stood in fleet street uncertain how to proceed it suddenly struck him that he would purchase a newspaper the office of the weekly dispatch was facing him he entered and bought that days number such was his intense curiositynay more his acute and agonising suspenseand so awful were the misgivings which crowded upon his soulthat he lingered in the office to glance over the newspaper and my god how he startedhow his brain reeledhow crushed and overwhelmed did he feel when his eyes encountered the dreadful words at the head of a column the convict rainford he staggered against the wainscot of the office and the journal nearly dropped from his hands he endeavoured to master his emotions and refer to the fatal column for farther particulars but his brain swamhis eyes were dimhis glances could not settle themselves upon the point which he vainly endeavoured to make the focus of his attention the clerk in the office fancied that he was suddenly attacked with indisposition and made a polite inquiry to that effect but the earl without giving a direct reply put hasty and impatient questions to him and though his ideas were strangely confused he nevertheless understood the appalling announcementthat rainford had been condemned to death and that the sentence was to be carried into execution on the following morning at horsemonger lane gaol the earl threw down the paperand darted from the officerecovered from his state of stupefaction but only to become the prey to the most maddening feelings of despair an empty hackneycoach was passing at the moment he stopped it and leapt inexclaiming to the driver to horsemonger lane gaol the coachman saw that his fare was impatient to reach that place and he whipped his horses into a decent pace over blackfriars bridgedown the wide road went the vehicle then it turned to the left at the obeliskand in a short time it stopped in front of the gaol the earl sprang forth and was rushing up to the entrance of the governors house when an ominous hammering noise fell upon his ears he instinctively glanced upwardsand thereon the top of the gaolstanding out in bold relief against the moonlit sky were the black spars of the gibbet which the carpenters had already erected for the ensuing mornings work chapter lii lord ellinghams exertions not a crynot a wordnot even a moan betrayed the feelings of the earl of ellingham as this frightful spectacle met his eyes he was paralysedstunnedstupified despair was in his heartand he could not lower his glances which were fascinatedrivetted by that awful engine of death on the summit of the gaol this state of complete prostration of all the intellectual energies was suddenly interrupted by a gentle pull at his sleeve and turning abruptly round he beheld by the pale light of the moon a young lad of sickly appearance standing at his elbow do you know me what would you with me demanded the earl sharply yesmy lord i know you was the answer delivered in a mournfulmelancholy tone and i also know that goodgenerous man who the lad burst into an agony of tears and pointed wildly towards the gibbet oh you know rainford exclaimed the earl eagerly tell me my boyspeakhave you seen him lately this daythis evening replied jacob smithfor it was he and i have taken leave of himfor ever he begged me not to visit himtomorrow for ever echoed the earl in a low and hollow voice but he continued again speaking eagerly and rapidly how does he support his doom with a courage such as the world has seldom seen replied jacob and he frequently speaks of you my lord he speaks of me my boy yes my lordhe fears that some tidingssome evil reports which you have probably heard have set you against himfor he received a letter from you a day or two after his arrest my god he suspects me of coldness exclaimed the earl in an impassioned tone oh i must see himi must see him this moment and he was rushing towards the governors door when jacob again caught him by the sleeve saying it is useless my lord you cannot be admitted tonight the keeper of the prison dare not refuse me cried the earl and he hastened to the door would it not be better my lord asked jacob who had followed him to use the valuable time now remaining for the purpose of saving him true exclaimed the earl struck by the observation an interview with him at this moment would effect no good and would only unman me altogether come with me my lad you take an interest in rainfordand you shall be the first to learn the result of the application which i will now make in the proper quarter thus speaking arthur hurried back to the hackneycoach and as the door closed upon himself and jacob he said to the driver in a firm tone to the homeoffice during the ride the earl put a thousand questions to jacob smith relative to the convict from the answers he received it appeared that rainford was well convinced that neither sir christopher blunt nor mr curtis had directed mr howard to prosecute him for the robbery for which he was doomed to suffer indeed they had declared as much when giving their evidence at the policecourt and at the old bailey neither did he believe that howard had instituted the proceedings through any personal motive of spite but he entertained the conviction that some secret and mysterious springs had been set in motion to destroy him and that howard had been made the instrument of the fatal design it seemed that jacob had visited him as often as the prison regulations would permit and that he had been the bearer of frequent letters between rainford and the beautiful jewess who had removed from brandon street a few days after his arrestthis change of residence being effected by the express wishes of tom rain who was afraid lest the malignity of his unknown enemies might extend to herself jacob also casually mentioned that the very first time he had been sent to see the jewess which appeared to have been the morning after lord ellinghams laconic letter was received by rainford she enclosed a number of papers in a packet which she carefully sealed and which jacob conveyed to the prisoner when i was with him this evening added the lad he gave me that packet which he redirected to your lordship and desired me to leave it at your lordships residence tomorrowwhen all should be over but since i have thus unexpectedly met you sobs choked the youths utterance as he passed the sealed packet to the earl who received it in profound silencefor well did he divine the nature of its contents and his heart was rent with anguish as he felt all the generosity of that deed on thy part tom rain but in a few moments the spark of hope that already scintillated within him was fanned into a bright and glowing flame for he now possessed proofs to convince the secretary of state that in allowing the law to take its course an individual rightly entitled to an earldom would suffer death and arthur was well aware of the influence which such an argument would have in supporting his appeal for a commutation of the sentence thy generous act in giving up the papers which thou mightest have used to save thy life he thought within himself apostrophising his doomed halfbrother shall not be thrown away on me ingratitude to thee were impossiblethen turning to jacob he said aloud i am much mistaken my boy if these papers which you have placed in my hands will not effect the great object that we have in view oh my lord exclaimed jacob with the most sincere joyfulness of manner is there really so much hope ah if not for himat least for that poor lady who loves him so deeply has she seen him hastily inquired the earl onceonce only answered jacob and that was this afternoon i was not present at the farewell scene but i was in the neighbourhood when she came out againand i do not wish ever to witness a beautiful womans grief again my lord i have passed through muchseen muchand distress and misery in all their worst forms are known to me but as long as i live will the image of that poor creature as the wind blew aside her veil for few momentsoh i cannot bear to think of it he shall be restored to her my lad exclaimed the earl emphatically the more i ponder upon the case the more firmly do i become convinced that it is one in which the home secretary may exercise the prerogative of mercy it is not as if blood had been shed at this moment the hackneycoach stopped at the door of the home office and the earl alighted bidding jacob await his return but what language can describe the violence of that sudden revulsion of feeling which arthur experienced when on inquiry he learnt that the home secretary was neither at his official nor his private residence in london as he had set out on the preceding evening for his countryseat in the north of england with the rapidity of lightning did the earl calculate the chances of overtaking him by means of fleet horses but a few moments reflection showed him the impossibility of accomplishing that undertaking in time to make its result supposing it were successful available to the doomed victim the reprieve might be grantedbut it would arrive in london too late the earl was well aware that it was useless to seek the prime minister as that functionary would have no alternative save to reply that he could not possibly interfere in a case so essentially regarding the department of the home secretary arthurs mind was accordingly made up in a very few momentshe would repair at once to the king who as he learnt at the home office was fortunately for his purpose at buckingham palace it was now ten oclock at night there were but ten hours before himbut in that interval much might be done returning to the coach he desired to be driven to his own house and while proceeding thither he acquainted jacob with the cruel disappointment he had sustained by the absence of the secretary of state and stated his resolution to repair at once to the dwelling of the king thus the poor wretched lad became by his generous sympathy for tom rain the companion and confidant of the great noble great was the joy which prevailed amongst the earls household when he made his appearance once more at his own abode the servants had indeed heard from dr lascelles as much as the physician himself had learnt through the medium of the vague and laconic letter which the earl was permitted to write to him from his dungeon but still the protracted absence of their master had occasioned them the most lively uneasiness and they were therefore heartily glad to behold his return but he was compelled to cut short the congratulations proffered him and the orders that he issued were given with an unwonted degree of impatience let the carriage be ordered round directly let some one hasten to acquaint lady hatfield with my return and also send up to grafton street to request dr lascelles to come hither as soon as possible and to wait for menever mind how late let this lad be taken care of he added indicating jacob and see that he wants for nothing then hastening up stairs to his own chamber he locked himself in having declined the attendance of his valet he tore open the packet which jacob had given him and beheld a small leathern case this case contained a roll of letters and other documents tied round with a piece of riband so faded that it was impossible to determine what its colour might have originally been there was also accompanying this roll a brief note addressed to himself with trembling hand he opened the note and with beating heart and tearful eyes read the following words i have sent you the papers my dear brotherfor so i shall make bold to call you stillto convince you that i did not forge an idle tale when we met last whatever your motive for abandoning me in my last hours may be i entertain no ill feeling towards you on the contrary i hope that god may prosper you and give you long life to enjoy that title and fortune which in so short a time will be beyond the possibility of dispute i had promised to leave behind me a written narrative of my chequered and eventful history for your perusal butneed i explain wherefore i have not fulfilled this promise t r the earl weptoh he wept plenteously as he read those lines he thinks that i have abandoned himand he expresses the most generous wishes for my prosperity he cried aloud oh my godi must save himi must save him he waited not to examine the roll of papers his halfbrother intimated that the necessary proofs were thereand though no human eye watched the earls motions at that instant still he would not imply a doubt of rainfords word by examining the documents but he hastened to dress himself in attire suitable to his contemplated visit to the king and his toilette was completed just as the carriage drove round to the door a few minutes afterwards he was rolling rapidly along in the vehicle towards buckingham palace the papers carefully secured about his person and his heart palpitating violently with the cruel suspense of mingled hope and fear alas he was doomed to another disappointment though it was but little past eleven oclock king george the fourth had already retired to restor rather had been borne away in a senseless state from one of those beastly orgies in which the filthy voluptuary so often indulged this much was intimated to the earl by a nobleman attached to the royal person and with whom arthur was well acquainted quitting the palace in disgust combined with despair lord ellingham returned home but nowe were wrong he did not entirely despair one hope of saving rainfords lifeone faint hope remaineda hope so wildso extravagantand involving a chance with such fearful odds against it that it could only have been conceived by one who was determined to leave no means however difficult unadopted in order to attain a particular end on crossing the threshold of his door arthurs first inquiry was whether doctor lascelles had arrived the reply was an affirmative and the earl hastened to the apartment to which the physician had been shown it is not however necessary to relate the particulars of their interview inasmuch as the nature of the conversation which passed between them will be developed hereafter chapter liii the execution the fatal monday morning broke yellowheavilyand gloomily and the light stoleor rather struggled by degrees into the convicts cell shortly before seven oclock tom rain awoke and casting his eyes rapidly around they successively fell upon the turnkey who had sate up with himthe still flickering lamp upon the common deal tablethe damp stone wallsand the massive bars at the windows for an instant a cold shudder convulsed his frame as the convictionthe appalling truth burst upon him that the horrors of his dreams were not to cease with the slumber that had given them birth but with knitting brow and compressed liplike a strongminded man who endeavours to conceal the pain inflicted on him by a surgical operation of a dreadful naturehe struggled with his emotions and when the governor and clergyman entered the dungeon they found him firm and resolute though not insolent nor reckless the chaplain offered to pray with him and he consented to join in devotion there was profound sinceritybut no affectation no hypocrisy no passionate exclamationin the prayer which tom rain uttered extemporaneously as the clock chimed halfpast seven he arose from his knees saying i am now prepared to die but there was yet another half hour before him scarcely had the clock finished chiming when the door was opened and the earl of ellingham entered the cell heedless of the impression which his conduct might produce upon the prison authorities present arthur rushed forward and threw himself into rainfords arms exclaiming noi had not willfully abandoned you thomas just now i said that i was prepared to die answered the convict returning the embrace with congenial warmth and now i may even add that i shall die contented the time is too precious to waste in mere details returned arthur or i would tell you how i have been kept away from you by forceby a vile outrage but you do not now believe that i was willingly absentthat i wantonly neglected you nono exclaimed rainford i seek not an explanationi require none it is enough that you are here nowat the last hour the earl then related in a few hurried words the vain exertions he had made on the preceding evening on behalf of rainford who expressed his lively gratitude arthur next requested the governor to permit him to have a few minutes private conversation with the prisoner but this favour could not be grantedand the earl dared not persist in his demand as the chaplain hinted that the convict had bidden adieu to the affairs of this life and had but little time left for devotion thus was it that arthur and rainford had no opportunity of speaking together in privatealthough the former had something important to communicate and the latter perceived that such was the fact arthur said tom approaching close to his halfbrother and speaking in a low solemn tone is there any hope noneon this side of the scaffold returned the earl with a significant glance as he dwelt on his words and as he spoke he took the prisoners hand as if to wring it fervently but rainford felt something in the earls palm and instantly comprehended that it was an object which he was to take unnoticed by the gaol authorities then rapid as the lightning flash he perceived a double meaning in the wordson this side of the scaffold because he knew that arthur would not use those awful words the scaffoldbut would have said the tomb had he not had some special profound motive and rainford did comprehend the hintthe hope conveyed and though he thanked his halfbrother with a rapid expressive glance yet a sickly smile played upon his lipindicative of the faintness of that hope so created at the same instant heavy footsteps were heard approaching the cell and the chaplain said in a solemn tone the hour is almost come then arthur once more threw himself into the prisoners arms and whispered rapidly in his ear keep the tube in your throatand you will be saved rainford murmured an assent and the brothers embraced with a fervour which astonished those present to whom their relationship was totally unknown arthur then tore himself from the cellnot for worlds could he behold that horrible process termed the toilette he had also another motive for quitting the dungeon before the last momentthis was to meet the sheriff of the county in the passage and behold in the corridor he encountered that functionary the javelinmen and the undersheriff behind whom came the executioner and his assistant the earl accosted the sheriff with whom he was acquainted and who was naturally surprised to meet the nobleman there drawing him aside arthur said in a hasty tone i have a favoura great favour to ask of you the convict is well connected and his friends demand the body to bury it decently the earnest prayer that i have to offer you on their behalf is that you will not prolong the feelings of shame and ignominy which they will experience during the time the corpse remains suspended my lord replied the sheriff the body shall be cut down at twenty minutes past eight and delivered over to the unhappy mans friends a thousand thanks said the earl pressing the sheriffs hand he then hurried away and the procession moved on to the cell immense was the crowd gathered around the gaol to witness the execution of the celebrated highwayman who had been proved on his trial to be none other than the notorious black mask who some years previously had performed the most extraordinary deeds of daring and audacity in the county of hants yes immense was the crowdand not only did the living ocean inundate all the open spaces about the gaol and all the thoroughfares leading thitherbut it seemed to force its offshooting streams and channels up the very walls of the surrounding dwellings so densely filled with faces were the open windowseven to the housetops near the front gate of the gaol stood a black coach and a hearseand concealed between the vehicles and the prison wall were the earl of ellingham dr lascelles and three of the noblemans own menservants all muffled in black mourning cloaks and holding white handkerchiefs to their faces so as to hide their features as much as possible lord ellingham was convulsed with grief farfar more than the convict himself did the generoushearted nobleman suffer on this terrible morning he was benumbed with coldhis body felt like a dead weight which his legs could scarcely sustainhis tongue clave to the roof of his moutha suffocating sensation oppressed himand he felt as if all the most frightful misfortunes had suddenly combined to fall with crushing burden on his own head the clock of st georges in the borough began to strike eightthe clock of the prison echoed those iron notes which sent upon the wing of the air the signal for death suddenly the hum of the multitudes ceased and an awful silence prevailed the earl and the physician knew by those signs that the convict had just appeared on the roof of the gaol but from where they were stationed they could not command a view of the dreadful scene above and even if they had been differently placed lord ellingham at least would not have raised his eyes towards the fatal tree and now amidst that solemn silence a voice was heardthe solemn deeptoned monotonous voice of the chaplain saying i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god the voice ceased a sudden sensation ran through the crowd like an electric shockand the earl of ellingham groaned deeplygroaned in the bitterness of his spiritfor he knew that the drop had just fallen compose yourself my dear friend whispered the physician for now is the time to arm yourself with all your energies thanks doctora thousand thanks for reminding me of my duty said the earl but this is most tryingmost horribly trying i have lived a hundred years of agony in the last few minutes hope for the best my dear earl rejoined the physician do you think that he fully understood you he didi am convinced of it replied arthur anxious to argue himself out of all doubts as well as to convince his companion he received the silver tube and i saw him conceal it in his sleeve but alas we had no opportunity to speak alonethough i had so much to say to himso many explanations to givesuch numerous questions to askmy god if after all this plan should fail if that boy jacob will only follow my instructions to the very letter answered lascelles i do not despair of success oh he willhe will returned the young nobleman as he glanced towards the hearse he is as intelligent as he is attached to my dear brother the railings in front of the gaol kept the crowd at a considerable distance from the mourning vehicles and thus the observations which passed between the earl and the physician were not heard by any save themselves and now how languidlyhow slowly passed the interval of twenty minutes during which the sheriff had stated that the body must remain suspended to the earl it seemed as if each minute were a yearas if he were living twenty years in those twenty minutes and the crowds had broken the silence which had fallen upon them like a spelland ribald jestsobscene remarksterrible execrationsand vile practical jokes now proclaimed how efficacious is the example of public strangulation at last the prisonclock chimed the quarter past eight and more acutemore agonising grew the suspense of the earl of ellingham a thousand fears assailed him rainford might not have been able to use the silver tubeor its imagined effect might have failedor the knot of the rope might have broken his neck againthe sheriff might forget his promise and allow the convict to hang an hour according to the usual custom and even if all these fears were without foundation the physician might not be able to fulfil his expectations cruelcruel was the suspenseappalling were the apprehensions endured by the young nobleman he looked at his watch it was seventeen minutes and a half past eight two minutes and a half moreif the sheriff had not forgotten his promise but no he was even better than his wordfor scarcely had arthur returned the watch to his pocket when a sudden sensation again pervaded the multitudeand several voices cried they are going to cut him down then came a dead silence an intense heat ran like molten lead through the earls veins and at the next moment he turned deathlike cold as if plunged into an icebath if he had hitherto lived years in minuteshe now seemed to exist whole centuries in moments all the fears which had previously struck him one by one now rushed in an aggregate crowd to his soul the next two minutes were all of fury and horrorfury in his brain horror in his heart but at last the gate of the gaol opened and a gruff voice exclaimed now then the earls three menservants hastened to range themselves near the door of the hearse which one of them opened and when the gaolofficials appeared bearing the coffin these servants advanced a few paces to relieve them of their burthen and thrust it into the hearse while dr lascelles diverted the attention of the officials by distributing money amongst them this proceeding which had been prearranged by the earl and the physician with the three servants was absolutely necessary because jacob smith was concealed within the hearse the affair having proceeded successfully thus far the hearse moved away and the five persons who acted as mourners entered the black coach which also drove off for the sake of appearances it was necessary that the vehicles should move slowly along until the outskirts of the multitude were entirely passed and thenwhen blackman street was reachedthe hearse and the black coach were driven along at a rate which is adopted by funeral processions only when the obsequies are over chapter liv galvanism by the time st georges church was passed the drivers had whipped their horses into a furious gallopand onon went the mourning vehicles like the wind the sleek and pampered black horses panted and foamed but the coachmen cared notthey were well paid for what they were doing down union street rolled the chariot and the hearseinto the blackfriars roadup the wide thoroughfare to the riverover the bridgealong farringdon streetand through smithfield to clerkenwell green in an incredibly short space of time the two vehicles stopped at the door of a house in red lion street dr lascelles was the first to leap from the mourning coach and taking a key from his pocket he opened the door of the house into which quickly as active men could move or work the coffin was borne from the hearse jacob smith was helped out immediately afterwards and he followed the earl the physician and the three servants into the house while the mourning coach and the hearse still waited at the door a quarter of an hour afterwards the coffin with the lid now screwed down was borne back to the hearsethe three servants returned to the mourning coach and the funeral procession was set in motion againbut with slow and suitable solemnity in another half hour the coffin with the name of thomas rainford upon the plate was interred in st lukes churchyard and thus ended this ceremony but did that coffin really contain the cold corse of the once gallant highwayman no it had been hastily filled with stones and straw at the house in red lion street and the body the moment the coffin was borne into the house in red lion street in the manner already described jacob smith closed the door behind him and exclaimed in a triumphant tone as he produced the silver tube from his pocket it was in his throat i took it outand i rubbed his temples with hartshorn and applied it to his nostrils the whole way from the goal to this place oh he will be savedhe will be saved the lid of the coffin which had not been screwed down was removed and in the shell lay the highwaymanwith eyes closedand pale as death the earl of ellingham shuddered convulsively and uttered a groan of anguish but dr lascelles gave his instructions with so much presence of mind and yet such rapidity that the intensity of the noblemans grief was soon partially absorbed in the excitement of the scene that now followed the body was removed as hastily as possible up stairs and carried into a spacious laboratory where it was immediately stretched upon the table the three servants then retraced their way down stairs filled the coffin with stones and straw screwed the lid tight and departed with it as already stated to st lukes churchyard in the meantime the physician the earl and jacob smith remained in the laboratory and now was the profound scientific knowledge of dr lascelles about to be applied to the most wonderful act of human aimsthe resuscitation of a convict who had been hanged the poles of a powerful galvanic pile were applied to the body from which the animal heat had not altogether departed when it was taken from the coffin and the force of the electric fluid almost immediately displayed its wondrous influence an universal tremor passed over the frame of rainford and ejaculations of ineffable joy burst from the lips of lord ellingham and jacob smith dr lascelles continued to let fall upon the body a full quantum of the electric fluid and in less than a minute the right arm of the highwayman movedmoved with a kind of spasmodic quivering then in a few seconds it was suddenly raised with eagerness and impatience and the hand sought the throat with convulsive motion that hand kept grasping the throat as if to tear away something that oppressed itas if the horrible rope still encircled it then rainfords chest began to swell and work with the violence of returning respirationas if a mighty current of air were rushing back to the lungs he breathes he breathes cried ellingham and jacob smith as it were in one voice he will be saved said the physician calmly as he again applied the poles of the batteryprovided congestion of the brain does not take placefor that is to be dreaded but the nobleman and the poor lad heard not this alternative of sinister and dubious import they had no ears for anything save those blessed wordshe will be saved and they were literally wild with joy lascelles without desisting from his occupation of applying the electric fluid and apparently without noticing the excitementthe delirium of happiness and hope which had seized upon his two companions began leisurely to explain how it was necessary to adopt means to equalise the reviving circulation and though he called for hartshorn he was not heard at length he stamped his foot violently on the floor exclaiming will neither of you give me the hartshorn do you wish him to die through your neglect the earl instantly checked the exuberance of his joyous emotions and hastened to obey all the instructions which the physician gave him the hartshorn was applied to rainfords nostrils and in a few moments his lips began to quiverthen on a sudden as lascelles let fall upon him a stronger current of the electric fluid a terrific cry burst from the object of all this intensely concentrated interest but never was cry of human agony more welcome to mortal ears than now for it told those who heard it that life was in him who gave vent to it the physician felt the highwaymans pulse it beat feeblyvery feeblybut still it beat and now his limbs moved with incessant tremblingand he waved his right hand backwards and forwards his breast heaving with repeated sighs and gasps and painful moans the doctor applied a small mirror to rainfords mouth and nostrils and it was instantly covered with a cloud he now opened his eyes slowly they were much bloodshotbut the pupils indicated the reviving fires of vitality his breathing rapidly grew more regular and though he retained his eyes open yet he seemed unconscious of all that was passing around him and gazed upwards with the most deathlike indifference lord ellingham cast a glance of frightful apprehension towards the physician but the countenance of dr lascelles wore an expression of calm and complacent satisfactionand the earl was reassured twenty minutes had now passed since the galvanic operation had commenced and at last dr lascelles said emphatically he is saved the earl embraced him as if he were a father who had just manifested some extraordinary proof of paternal love or who had forgiven some deep offence on the part of a son we must put him to bed immediately said the physician with difficulty extricating himself from the noblemans embrace and fearing lest he should be compelled to undergo a similarly affectionate process at the hands of jacob smith who was equally enthusiastic in his joywe must put him to bed immediately repeated dr lascelles and fortunately for us there is a bedchamber in the house the three then carefully lifted tom rain into a small room furnished as a bedchamber and where they undressed him and deposited him in the bed and now said jacob smith we should remember that there is one who will feel as much joy as ourselves true cried the earl but where does she live i am acquainted with her abode returned the lad if your lordship will allow me yes my good boy interrupted arthur it is for you to convey these joyous tidings but perhaps she may have returned home to her fatherfor after all that has occurred and considering mr de medinas affection for his daughterbut all this while we are talking enigmatically in the presence of my excellent friend the doctor from whom there must be no secrets never mind me said lascelles laconically who perfectly well comprehended the nature of their allusions i care little for your secrets and even if it were otherwise i am too much occupied with my patient here then we will not trouble you with explanations at present interrupted the earl jacob my lad hasten to the lady of whom we speakbreak the happy tidings to her gentlyand bring her hither yes my lord answered the lad delighted at being chosen as the messenger of good tidings in such a case fortunately miss de medina moved from brandon street into the heart of the city by mr rainfords positive directions and i shall not be long before i come back with her the earl put gold into his hand but jacob returned it declaring that he was not without money and in another minute the front door of the house closed behind him chapter lv the laboratoryesther de medina when jacob had taken his departure dr lascelles returned to his laboratory mixed some liquid ingredients in a glass and returning to the bedchamber poured the medicine down rainfords throat he then felt his pulse applied his ear to his chest to listen to the pulsation of his heart and carefully examined his eyes which were far less bloodshot than when they opened first he is getting on admirably said the physician his pulsation is regular and neither too quick nor too slowbut just as i could wish it he seems inclined to sleepyeshe closes his eyes and he will awake to perfect consciousnessbut do you know my dear friend that in order to oblige you i have incurred an awful risk continued the doctor the law would not believe me were i to declare that it was in the interest of science i made these galvanic experiments and that having succeeded in recalling the man to life i was not capable of delivering him up to justice let us hope that there will be no necessity to make such an excuse at all said the earl you have rendered me an immense service doctor then i am satisfied interrupted lascelles for after all you told me last night i cannot help liking your halfbrother here he is a generoushearted fellow and one would risk much to save such a man from death you had frequently mentioned to me your galvanic experiments said the earl and last night when nearly driven to desperation by the absence of the home secretary the reminiscence of all the wonders you had at different times related to me in respect to galvanism flashed to my mindand i sent for you as a drowning man clings to a straw in the adjoining room observed the physician i have tried the influence of galvanism upon thousands of animals and on several men i have paid high prices to obtain the bodies of convicts as soon as they were cut downbut never until this day did i succeed in restoring the vital spark neither would this experiment have been successful had we not adopted all the precautions i suggested the tube in the throat to allow respirationand jacob smith in the hearse to remove the suffocating nightcap from rainfords head and the tube from his throat and then to apply the hartshorn to his nostrils and his temples step with me again into the laboratory you have not yet had time to examine its curiosities added the physician with a smile rainford sleeps he continued glancing towards the bed and we shall have a little leisure to inspect the laboratory they accordingly proceeded into the adjacent room where lascelles directed his companions attention to the various galvanic and electrical apparatus i am also a devoted disciple of gall and spurzheim observed the physician when he had expatiated upon the discoveries of galvani behold that row of plaster of paris casts of heads he continued pointing to a shelf whereon upwards of fifty of the objects mentioned were ranged they have afforded me much scope for curious speculation and profound study i observe that you have casts of the heads of several celebrated criminals amongst them said the earl arthur thistlewooddaniel hoggartgeorge barringtonhenry fauntleroyjohn thurtellwilliam probert and many others as you perceive my dear earl interrupted lascelles the prejudice is as yet so strong amongst people in respect to phrenology and craniology that it is difficult to obtain the casts of living heads i am therefore forced to make friends with the turnkeys in gaols and with the relations of criminals who are hung or who die in prison to get casts moreover the heads of men who have led remarkable lives or who have suffered for their crimes afford such interesting subjects for study and comparison illustration comparison between the head of the man and the monkey said the earl with a smile decidedly exclaimed the physician but i will not bore you with my theories and speculations on this subject you may however suppose that i am not a little enthusiastic in the matter since i have taken the trouble to have human heads prepared and articulated to facilitate my studies thus speaking he opened the door of a cupboard the earl started backfor four human countenances met his astonished and horrified gaze and four pairs of human eyes seemed to glare ominously upon him at the same time his nostrils were assailed with a strong odour of spices you need not be afraid of them ejaculated the physician laughing they will not speak to you but howwhence did you obtain i suppose you think i murdered four men for the sake of their heads cried lascelles laughing more heartily still why my dear earl you would be surprised perhaps to learn that i often pass whole nights in this laboratory making galvanic experiments or pursuing my phrenological and craniological researches but these heads were obtained from the hospitals and i myself embalmed and prepared as you now see them i was not aware that you possessed this laboratory observed the earl until you stated the fact last night nor would you ever have known it had it not been for the desire which you expressed that science should exert itself to rescue your halfbrother from the grasp of death answered the physician the truth is i have had this laboratory upwards of seventeen or eighteen years i was always devoted to science especially that on which my own profession is based and the spirit of anatomical inquiry made me anxious to obtain as many subjectsor in plain terms dead bodiesas possible i was therefore thrown into perpetual intercourse with resurrectionmen who of course are not the best of characters but i was afraid of having corpses brought to my own house in grafton street and i was also desirous to fit up for myself a laboratory in some retired neighbourhood where i could pursue my studies without the least fear of interruption on such occasions when the humour might seize me i hinted as much to one of the rascals who sold me subjects and he put me in communication with a man of the name of tidmarsh after some haggling and hesitation on the part of tidmarshand when he had consulted or pretended to consult his principalhe introduced me to this house and i hired this room at an enormous rental i did not however care about the high rate demanded of me for the use of the place because it is not only in a most retired neighbourhood but there is also a private and subterranean means of egress and ingress from another street which is useful you know for one who has to deal with resurrectionists and are you the only tenant of this house inquired the earl for i presume that the bedchamber in which poor thomas lies is not your own no some old man occasionally visits the house and now and then sleeps in that room returned the physician but i have only seen him once or twice and do not even know his name i have my own key for the frontdoor and i am acquainted with the secret of the subterranean passage but i never hold any communication with tidmarsh beyond paying him the rent when it is dueand when i happen to meet the old man i have alluded to we merely exchange a word and pass on he has his rooms in the house and i have mine and as he does not interfere with me i never trouble myself about him nor his concerns then for aught you know doctor said the earl you may occupy an apartment in the house of bad characters what do i care exclaimed lascelles i could not well have such a laboratory as this at my own residencemy servants would talk about these human heads and those plaster casts and the galvanic experiments and i should be looked upon as a sorcerer or at all events with so much suspicion and aversion as to lose all my practice and by the bye my dear earl you should be the very last added the doctor with a smile to hint at the possibility of this house being connected with bad characters for had i not a laboratory in so quiet a streeta street too where no questions are ever asked nor observations madeyour poor brother might have waited long enough for the chance of resuscitation by galvanic means true my dear doctori was unjust said the earl but you will forgive me say no more about it arthur were men of scientific research to be over particular they might as well abandon their studies at once the experiments i have made on corpses in this room could scarcely have been performed at my own residence and to tell you very candidly i believe that the old man who has the other apartments on this floor is either a miser or a roguebut i care nothing about him or his affairs and now i will mention to you one very extraordinary circumstance it must have been as near as i can guess five weeks ago that i was one night pursuing my galvanic experiments in this roomi had been operating on divers rabbits frogs and ratsand may be for anything i recollect a few catswhen i was compelled to go down stairs for a particular purpose on my return as i came back by that door he continued pointing to one at the farther end of the room and which leads to the staircase i was startlednay positively astounded at seeing a man standing near this cupboard and gazing fixedly on the human heads i confess i was alarmed at the moment because i had heard voices in the house during the halfhour previously and i remember that i rushed back and instinctively barred and bolted the door but the man turned round before i had time to close the doorand i caught a glimpse of his face that mannow who do you think he was it is impossible to guess doctor said the earl he was your halfbrother who now lies in the adjoining room added lascelles thomashere cried arthur profoundly surprised i could not possibly make a mistake because i had seen him beforeno matter how or whereand knew him immediately continued the physician well i must confess that i was uncertain how to act i did not wish him to recognise mealthough perhaps he had already done so and i could not very well leave the house and return to graftonstreet at once because i had on a dressinggown and had left my coat in this room i was halfway down the stairs leading to the hall when i heard some one opening the front door with a key knowing that it must be either the old man i have before mentioned or tidmarsh as they alone besides myself had keys of the front door i waited till the person came in and it was tidmarsh i immediately told him what i had seenah said he i suspected there was something wrong and that made me get up dress and come roundhis words astonished me and i requested an explanation but he seemed sorry that he had uttered them inadvertently and gave some evasive reply he however accompanied me up stairs we entered the laboratory and no one was there we went into the next roomthe one where rainford is now sleepingand there we found the carpet moved away from the trapdoor the trapdoor exclaimed the earl yesa trapdoor that leads to the subterranean passage which i have mentioned to you added lascelles but you must remember that all i have told you about this house is in the strictest confidence well we found the carpet moved away from the trapdoor though the trap itself was closed old tidmarsh instantly fastened the trap with a secret spring which there is to it and spread the carpet over the floor againbut does he know the means of getting out at the other end i inquired shocked at the thought of rainford being immured in the subterraneando you think he would venture down there if he were not acquainted with the secrets of the place demanded tidmarsh this struck me as being consistent with common sense and moreover i began to fancy that tidmarsh and rainford must be connected togetherpardon me my dear earl for saying so and that suspicion was encouraged in my mind by the singular and mysteriously significant observation that tidmarsh had dropped when i met him on the stairs so i felt no farther uneasiness but took my departure for grafton street tidmarsh quitted the house with me and left me at the corner of turnmill street close byas he lives there do you know said the earl of ellingham who now appeared to be occupied with an idea which had just struck himdo you know that all this conversation about subterraneans and secret passages and trapdoors has created a strange suspicion in my mind relative to what demanded the physician i briefly explained to you last night the cause of my disappearance for four long weeks continued the earl i also acquainted you with the manner of my escape now i am convinced by the direction i took in threading those dreadful sewers that i was a prisoner somewhere in clerkenwell and perhapswho knowsindeed it is highly probable that the very subterranean of which you have spoken may contain dungeon you shall soon satisfy yourself on that head interrupted the physician i confess that i have never been there more than three or four timesand then only to help old tidmarsh convey to my laboratory a subject for my galvanic or anatomical experiments and which the resurrectionists had deposited at his house in turnmill street so you may believe that i know but little of the precise features of the subterranean but we will visit it at once and if there be a dungeon or cell there such as you describe we shall discover it the physician and the earl proceeded into the bedchamber where rainford still slept lascelles felt his pulse examined his countenance attentively and turned with a smile of satisfaction to the young nobleman to whom he whispered he is beyond all danger arthur pressed the doctors hand with fervent gratitude while tears of happiness trembled upon his long lashes the physician then proceeded to raise the trapdoor and having procured a lamp from his laboratory led the way down the spiral staircase of stone but the huge door at the bottom was bolted on the other side and thus further investigation was rendered impossible on that occasion they accordingly retraced their steps to the bedroom closed the trapdoor and spread the carpet over it again the earl nevertheless made up his mind to institute farther search in those mysterious premises at some future day my dear young friend said the physician suddenly as they stood by the side of the bed watching the countenance of the sleeper i had almost forgotten that when he awakes presently it will be necessary to administer a little stimulanteither portwine or good brandy if such a thing can be got in this neighbourhood i will hasten and procure both immediately returned the earl give me the key of the frontdoor that i may let myself in without troubling you to descend to open it lascelles handed the key to the nobleman who immediately sallied forth to purchase the spirits required having procured a pintbottle of brandy at the most respectable tavern which he perceived in st john street whither he repaired for the purpose he was retracing his way when his eyes were suddenly attracted by a lovely female form crossing the street just mentioned and proceeding in the direction of northampton square but the lady was not dressed in mourning and therefore he conceived that he must be mistaken relative to the idea which had struck him and yet that symmetry of form set off rather than concealed by the ample shawl which she worethat dignified elegance of gaitthat gracefulness of carriage were wellknown characteristics of esther de medina the earl hastened after her and pronounced that name the lady turnedraised her veiland extended her hand to the nobleman yesit was estherbut how palehow profoundly mournful her countenance i am rejoiced to meet you said the earl in a rapid and excited tone for i have news to communicate which will give you joy butcome with mei implore youi know alllook upon me as a friendand in my presence you need not blush delay noti beseech youcome with me at once and drawing her arm in his he hurried her away towards red lion street my lord she said i am at a loss to understand oh you know not how nearly that which i have to communicateto give you evidence ofaffects your happiness interrupted arthur but i must not tell you all in a breathit would be too much for you to hearand i am gladoh i am rejoiced that i have thus met youfor i had dispatched a messenger to seek youand he might have broken the happy tidings too abruptly esther gazed upon his countenance in astonishment mingled with an expression of surprise and even alarm but the earl perceived not the strange impression that his words had produced as he hurried her along at a rate which in a more refined neighbourhood would have attracted disagreeable attention the house in red lion street was reached and the nobleman opened the door with extraordinary impatience for an instant esther hesitated to follow him but confident of the honourable intentions of the earl and anxious to relieve herself from the state of wonder and suspense into which his words had thrown her she entered the gloomylooking tenement he led her up the dirty decayed staircase into the laboratory where he begged her to wait for a moment he then softly opened the door communicating with the bedchamber in order to acquaint dr lascelles with her presence there and in a few hurried words explain the motives which had induced him to bring her thither for he supposed that all those circumstances which had led him to believe that the jewess was the mistress of his halfbrother were unknown to the doctor but the moment he opened the door he startedand an ejaculation of the wildest surprise burst from his lips for therestanding by the bed with hands clasped and eyes upraised in thankfulness to heavenwas the living counterpart of esther de medina arthur turned hastily round to convince himself that esther had not passed in before him but esther was indeed a few paces behind himalarmed by the exclamation which had burst from his lips the truth flashed like lightning to the earls brainesther de medina had a sisterso like herself that when apart they might well be taken for each otheryesthat must be the solution of the enigma which had bewildered him so often miss de medina he said hastily taking her hand i have been labouring under a strange mistake but you will perhaps understand how it arose when he led her into the roomshe started back exclaiming oh heavensmy oathbut in the next moment the sistersfor such indeed they wererushed into each others arms footnote mr peck b a in his interesting papers on electricity in reynoldss miscellany gives the ensuing particularsthe discovery of galvanic electricity was the result of accident madame galvani the wife of a distinguished italian philosopher being recommended by her medical adviser to partake of broth prepared from frogs several of these little animals were procured and were placed prior to their being cooked in the laboratory of her husband some of monsieur galvanis friends happened to be amusing themselves with an electrical machine which was standing in the room and by chance one of the frogs was touched with a scalpel to madame galvanis surprise she observed the limbs of the frogs exhibit a convulsive motion upon examining them closely she perceived that the muscles were affected at the very time when sparks were received from the machine when her husband returned she acquainted him with the circumstance for some time previously m galvani had entertained a belief that muscular action was affected by electricity and had been experimenting for the purpose if possible of verifying this hypothesis delighted by the discovery he lost no time in trying a variety of experiments at first he tested the effect of sparks alone on dissected frogs gradually varying the intensity of the spark in every case however even when the electric action was feeble he noticed that the muscles of the frogs gave evidence of susceptibility to its influence he next made experiments with atmospheric electricity the same result ensued as when the electric action had been elicited by artificial means in another paper of the same interesting series the following account is givenon the evening of january the th during a somewhat extraordinary display of northern lights a lady became so highly charged with electricity as to give out vivid electrical sparks at the end of each finger to the face of each of the company present this did not cease with the heavenly phenomenon but continued for several months during which time she was constantly charged and giving off electrical sparks to every conductor she approached so that she could not touch the stove nor any metallic utensils without first giving off an electrical spark with the consequent twinge the state most favourable to this phenomenon was an atmosphere of about deg fahrenheit moderate exercise and social enjoyment it disappeared in any atmosphere approaching zero and under the debilitating effects of fear when seated by the stove reading with her feet upon the fender she gave out sparks at the rate of three or four each minute and under the most favourable circumstances a spark that could be seen heard or felt passed every second she could charge others in the same way when insulated who could then give sparks to others to make it satisfactory that her dress did not produce it it was changed to cotton and woollen without altering the phenomenon the lady is about thirty of sedentary pursuits and delicate state of health we avail ourselves of the digressive facility afforded us by this note to the text to relate a true history of the resuscitation of a man who had been hangeda history which is perhaps one of the most extraordinary romances of real life upon record it is as followsambrose gwinett was hanged at deal for the murder of a man who merely disappeared and whose body was not found circumstantial evidence certainly pointed strongly to gwinett as a murderer but still it was not proved in the first instance that a murder had been really committed gwinett and another man of the name of collins arrived together at an inn in deal gwinett borrowed collinss claspknife during suppertime in the presence of the waiter on the following morning collins was missing and gwinett had been met on the stairs in the middle of the night coming up from the garden blood was found in the garden and in the midst of the blood was the claspknife open the traces of blood were continued down to the seaside and there they ceased gwinett was moreover found to have in his pocket collinss purse which the waiter had seen over night in collinss possession gwinetts defence was that he had received the purse after the waiter left the room on the preceding evening in consequence of an arrangement that he gwinett should be paymaster for them both that he had gone down stairs in the night for a certain purpose to the garden that his nose had bled dreadfully that he had used the claspknife to raise the latch of the door and had dropped it in the dark and that he had walked down to the seaside close by to wash his face and hands and stop the bleeding at the nose with the cold saltwater this tale was not believed gwinett was found guilty of murder and hanged on sandown common but a shepherd passing by the gibbet a few hours after the execution and while the victim was hanging in chains perceived signs of life in him and cut him down gwinett was recovered and the kindhearted shepherd sent him abroad in a distant colony gwinett met mr collins the very man for whose alleged murder he had been hanged an explanation immediately ensued on the night in question collins had also gone down stairs to the garden and had been carried off by a pressgang who passed along the seashore at the time he was conveyed to a boat and in that transported to the tendervessel lying in the downs the vessel sailed next morning and collins had heard nothing of the dilemma of his friend until they met as just described chapter lvi a history of the past mr de medina was the son of a spanish merchant who died leaving a considerable fortune behind him and of which this son was the sole inheritor but by the villainy of his relations and the corrupt decision of a spanish judge mr de medina found himself despoiled of the riches which were rightfully his own and at the age of twoandtwenty he quitted his native land in disgust to return to england where indeed he had been educated and the language of which country he spoke as fluently as his own it is hardly necessary to state that mr de medina was of the jewish persuasion and on his arrival in london he naturally applied to the eminent merchants of his own creed for employment it is the fashion in this country to decry the jewsto represent them as invariably sordid mercenary avaricious and gripingindeed to carry the charges laid against them to such a length as to associate with their names a spirit of usury amounting to the most flagrant and dishonourable extortion and these charges have been repeated so often and echoed seriously by so many persons deemed a respectable authority that the prejudice against the jews has become interwoven with the englishmans creed but the exceptions have been mistaken for the rule andstrange as the assertion may sound to many earswe boldly proclaim that there is not a more honest intelligent humane and hospitable class of persons on the face of the earth than the jews the fact is when an englishman is broken down in fortune and can no longer raise funds by mortgage on his estate nor by the credit of his name he flies to the moneylender now jews are essentially a financial nation and moneybroking in all its details is their special avocation the class of israelite moneylenders is therefore numerous and it is ten to one that the brokendown individual who requires a loan addresses himself to a jeweven if he take the moneylender living nearest to him or to whom he is first recommended wellhe transacts his business with this jew and as he can give no security beyond his bond or his bill and his spendthrift habits are notorious he cannot of course obtain the loan he seeks save on terms proportionate to the risk incurred by the lender yet he goes away and curses the jew as an usurer and thus another voice is raised to denounce the entire nation as avaricious and griping but does this person however reflect that had he applied to a christian moneybroker the terms would have been equally high seeing that he had no real security to offer and that his name was already tarnished talk of the usury of the jewslook at the usury practised by christians look at the rapacity of christian attorneyslook at the greediness of christian billdiscounterslook in a word at the moneymaking spirit of the christian and then call the jew the usurer par excellence it is a detestable calumnya vile prejudice as dishonourable to the english character an it is unjust towards a generoushearted race we deem it right to state that these observations are recorded as disinterestedly and as impartiallyas honestly and as conscientiously as any other comments upon prejudices or abuses which have ever appeared in the mysteries of london not a drop of jewish blood flows in our veins but we have the honour to enjoy the friendship of several estimable families of the jewish persuasion we have therefore had opportunities of judging of the israelite character and the reader must be well aware that the writer who wields his pen against a popular prejudice is more likely to be instigated by upright motives than he who labours to maintain it in following the current of general opinion one is sure to gain friends in adventurously undertaking to stem it he is equally certain to create enemies but thank god this work is addressed to an intelligent and enlightened peopleto the industrious classes of the united kingdomto those who are the true pillars of englands prosperity glory and greatness when mr de medina arrived friendless and almost penniless on the british soil he addressed himself to the heads of several eminent commercial firms in the city of londonfirms the constituents of which were of his own persuasion the jews always assist each other to the extent of their meansdo the christians answer ye cavillers against the persecuted race of israel mr de medina accordingly found occupation and so admirably did he conduct himselfso well did he promote the interests of his employers that by the time he reached the age of thirty he found himself a partner in the concern whose prosperity his talents and his industry had so much enhanced he then repaired to liverpool to establish a branchhouse of trade and of which he became the sole manager his partners dying soon afterwards he effected an arrangement with their heirs by which he abandoned all share in the london business and retained the liverpool house as his own his success was now extraordinary and his dealings were proverbially honourable and fair he went upon the principle of doing a large business with small gains and paying good wages to those who were in his employment thus though naturally of a stern and severe disposition his name was respected and his character admired at the age of thirtyfivetwenty years before the opening of our talehe married a lady of his own nationbeautiful accomplished and rich within twelve months their union was blessed with a daughter on whom the name of tamar was bestowed and at the expiration of another year a second girl was born and who was called esther but in giving birth to the latter mrs de medina lost her life and for a considerable time the bereaved husband was inconsolable the kindness of his friends and a conviction of the necessity of subduing his grief as much as possible for the sake of the motherless babes who were left to him aroused mr de medina from the torpor of profound woe and he became so passionately attached to his children that he would fondle them as if he himself were a child as they grew up a remarkable resemblance was observed between them and as esther was somewhat precocious in a physical point of view she was as tall when ten years old as her sister strangers then took them for twins although there was really twelve months difference between their ages but they actually appeared to be counterparts of each other their hair was of precisely the same intensely black and glossy shade their eyes were of the same dark hue and liquid lustretheir countenances presented each the same blending of the white and rich carnation beneath the transparent tinge of delicate olive or bistre which marked their origin their very teeth were of the same shape and shone too between pairs of lips which nature had made in the same mould and dyed with the same vermillion twinroses did the lovely sisters seemroses on the same stalk and by the time tamar was sixteen and esther fifteen the ripe beauty of the former and the somewhat precocious loveliness of the latter appeared to have attained the same glorious degree of female perfection but their minds were not equally similar tamar was vain of her personal attractions while esther was reserved and bashful the former was never so happy as when she was the centre of attraction in a ballroom while the latter preferred the serene tranquillity of home in their style of dress they were equally different from each other tamar delighted in the richest attire and loved to deck herself with costly jewels and well aware that she possessed a splendid bust she wore her gowns so low as to leave no room for conjecture relative to the charming fullness of her bosom esther on the contrary selected good but not showy materials for her dress and never appeared with a profusion of jewellery though of proportions as rich and symmetrical as her sister yet she rather sought to conceal their swelling contours than display them tamar was of warm and impassioned temperament and her breast was easily excited by fierce desires but esther was the embodiment of chaste and pure notionsher soul the abode of maiden innocence mr de medina often remonstrated with tamar upon her love of splendid attire and her anxiety to shine in the circles of gaiety but her ways were so winning that when she threw her arms around his neck and besought him not to be angry with her or to allow her to accompany some female friends to a ball or concert to which she had been invited he invariably yielded to her soft persuasion tamar was a few weeks past the age of sixteen and esther had accomplished her fifteenth year when an incident occurred which was fated to wield a material influence over the career of the elder sister one night mr de medina while returning home on horseback from a neighbouring village where he had dined with a friend was stopped and plundered of his purse and pocketbook he was by no means a man who was likely to yield without resistance to the audacious demands of a highwayman but he was unarmed at the timeand by some accident he was unattended by his groom the robber who wore a black crape over his countenance was armed to the teeth and seemed resolute as well as desperate mr de medina therefore risked not an useless contest with him but surrendered his property as above mentioned on his return home and while conversing on the incident with his daughters he suddenly recollected that the pocketbook contained a paper of great value and importance to himself but of no use to any other person he accordingly inserted advertisements in the local newspapers offering a reward for the restoration of that document and promising impunity to the robber if he would give it up but for several days these notifications remained unanswered a week elapsed and one morning an individual dressed in a semisporting style called at the house and inquired for mr de medina but mr de medina had just left home for the purpose of conducting esther to the dwelling of some friends who resided in the neighbourhood of liverpool and with whom she was to pass a few days tamar was however at home and as the servant informed her that the gentleman said his business was important she desired that he might be shown up into the drawingroom he was evidently struck by the dazzling beauty of the jewess who had thus accorded him an audience and there was something so dashingso rakishso offhand without vulgarity in his mannera something between the frankness of an openhearted man and the easy politeness of one who knows the world wellthat tamar did not treat him with that degree of cold courtesy which seems to say have the kindness to explain your business and then you may depart but she requested him to be seated and when he made a few observations which led to a connected discourse on the gaiety and doings of the liverpool folks she suffered herself to be drawn into the conversation without pausing to ask the motive of his visit thus nearly halfanhour passed away and while tamar thought to herself that she had never met a more agreeable gentleman in her lifeand certainly never one who possessed such a brilliant set of teeth or who looked so well in tops and cordsthe stranger came to a conclusion equally favourable concerning herself indeed he was quite charmed with the personal attractions and the conversation of the beautiful jewess and when he took his leave she forgot that he had not communicated his business nor even his name when her father returned home in the afternoon she mentioned to him the visit of the stranger but added that he only remained a few moments and would not explain his business to her mr de medina immediately expressed his belief that the call had some reference to his advertisement concerning the lost paper but tamar enthusiastically repelled the suspicion declaring that though he had not stayed a minute yet his manners appearance and address were of too superior a nature to be associated with a dishonourable avocation mr de medina asked if he had intimated when he should call again to which question tamar fearful that it would appear strange to give a negative reply answeredin a few days thus terminated a conversation in which tamar had been guilty of much duplicity and which was marked by the first deliberate falsehood which she ever unblushingly told her father on the following day the stranger returned and mr de medina not having expected him so soon was not at home to receive him but tamar was in the drawingroom to which he was conducted as on the previous day it was summertime and she was engaged in tying up the drooping heads of some flowers in the large balcony the stranger begged her not to desist from her occupation but on the contrary offered in his gay manner of frank politeness to assist her she could not refuse his aidshe did not wish to refuse it and they were soon engaged in a very interesting conversation he held the stalks of the flowers too while she tied the thread and her beautiful hand passed over that of the strangersnot without touching it while her breath sweeter than the perfume of the flowers themselves fanned his cheek once when he stooped a little lower under pretence of examining a particular rosebud more closely his hair mingled with hers and he could see that the rich glow of excitement flooded her countenanceher neckand even extended to the bosom of which he was enabled by her stooping posture to catch more than partial glimpses when next their eyes met there seemed to be already a tacit kind of intelligence established between theman intelligence which appeared to say she knew he had allowed his hair to mingle with hers on purpose and that she had not withdrawn her head because the contact pleased her the interesting conversation was continued and an hour had passed before either the stranger showed the slightest sign of an intention to take his leave or tamar remembered how long they had been alone together when he did at length take up his hat and his ridingwhip he also picked up a flower which tamar had accidentally broken off from its stem in the balcony and placing it in his buttonhole without making the slightest allusion to the little incident he bowed and quitted the room he had been gone at least ten minutes ere tamar again recollected that he had not mentioned his business nor told his name she had been thinking of the incident of the floweryesand also of the commingling of her raven locks with his fine manly light hair when her father returned home on this occasion she did not mention the fact of the strangers visit at all throughout the remainder of that day she wondered whether he would return on the following one and she made up her mind if he did not to suffer him to depart before she had elicited his business and his name in the evening she went out to make a few purchases at a shop in a neighbouring street and she was retracing her way when two young men walking arminarm and smoking cigarshaving withal something most offensively obtrusive in their entire appearancestopped short in front of tamar literally barred her way and began to address her in that flippant coarse style which without being absolutely obscene is nevertheless particularly insulting gentlemenif such you be said tamar in a dignified manner i request you to let me passwell wont you let us escort you home wherever it is demanded one for youre a devilish sweet girl upon my honourscarcely were these words uttered when the long lash of a ridingwhip began to belabour the backs of the two young swells in a fashion that made them almost scream with agony and tamar who instantly stepped aside recognised in the champion that had thus come to her assistance the very individual who was uppermost in her thoughts at the moment when she was stopped in the insulting manner described the two swells were for an instant so taken by surprise that they dropped each others arm and their cigars simultaneously and began to caper about in the most extraordinary manner the stranger continuing to lash them with so good a will and yet in such an easy unexcited manner that tamar could scarcely forbear from laughing heartily but when they perceived that there was only one assailant they rushed in upon the stranger and endeavoured to close with him he did not retreat a single step but hitting one of them a heavy blow on the wrist with the buttend of his whip he sent him off roaring while with his left hand he caught the other by the collar of the coat and swinging him roundapparently without any extraordinary effortlaid him on his back in the dust he then offered his arm to tamar and led her away as quietly as if nothing had happened at the same time commencing a discourse upon some totally different topic as if he would not even give her an opportunity of thanking him for the manner in which he had chastised the insulting youngsters but tamar did thank himand very warmly too for this feat was just one of the very nature calculated to improve the hold which the stranger already had upon the heart of the beautiful jewess she now looked upon him with admiration for all women love bravery in a manand his bravery was so realso naturalso totally devoid of impetuous excitement when called into action and so free from any subsequent desire to elicit flatterythat she beheld in him a character at once generous and noble she could have thrown her arms round his neck and said stranger whoever you may be i admirei love you and when he did take her hand as she leant upon his arm and when he pressed it gentlythen let it fall without uttering a word but fixed his deep blue laughing and expressive eyes upon her countenance with a steadiness that meant much though his tongue was silent a softa delicious languor came over her congenial with the moonlight hour he conducted her to within a few doors of her fathers house and then took leave of her saying i shall see you again tomorrow she entered her dwelling and retired immediately to her chamber for her heart was filled with a happiness which she knew that her countenance would betray when she met her father at supper she was more composed and she said not a word to him concerning the occurrence of the evening on the following day the stranger called again and again did he find tamar alone in the drawingroom on this occasion she extended to him her hand which he took and pressed to his lips the maiden did not withdraw it and her cheeksher neckher bosom were flushed with the thrilling glow of excitement while her eyes expressed a voluptuous languor the stranger drew her towards himtheir lips met they embraced tenderly then he declared his love for herand she murmured words in reply which convinced him that he was loved in return thus on the fourth occasion of their meeting did they pour fourth the secrets of their hearts and tamar plighted her affection to one whose name she as yet knew not their happy interview was suddenly disturbed by a loud knock at the streetdoor and tamar exclaimed my father the stranger implored her to compose herself and she had succeeded in assuming a collected and tranquil demeanour when mr de medina entered the room her lover was standing at a respectful distance from tamar with whom he appeared to be exchanging the mere courteous observations which usually pass between perfect strangers mr de medina requested him to be seated and inquired his business i have called relative to the advertisements which you inserted in the newspapers was the replyi thought as much ejaculated mr de medina then turning towards his daughter he said tamar my love you can leave usthe maiden dared not disobey the hint thus conveyed but as she passed behind her father to quit the room she darted upon her lover a look so full of meaningso expressive of ardent affection that it seemed to say be you who and what you may i shall never cease to adore you and he returned that look with a glance more rapid but equally significant of tenderness when she had left the room mr de medina continued by observing may i have the pleasure of learning your namecertainly was the offhand answer i am called thomas rainfordand your business with me sir added mr de medina in a cold tone and with suspicious manner is relative to the paper of which i was robbedprecisely so exclaimed tom rain a more suitable person than myself could not possibly have called respecting the affairhow so sir demanded mr de medina his manner growing still more suspicioussimply because it was i who robbed you was the cool answer and tom rains merry laugh rang through the roomyou ejaculated mr de medina starting from his seat then how dare you show your face hereoh very easily replied rainford without moving from his chair in the first place your advertisements promise impunity to the robber on condition that he restores the document in the second place if you contemplated any treachery it would only be the worse for you and would not injure me and thirdly it struck me that i had better come in person to give you up the paper because it might have miscarried through the post or a messenger might have lost it however here it is mr de medina and had you not advertised for it i should have restored it to you i am no rascally extortioner i never hold mens private papers as a means of drawing money from them what i do i do boldly and in true john bull fashion a jolly highwayman mr de medina is as different from a sneaking pickpocket or a low swindler as an attorney in grand practice is different from the paltry pettifogger who hangs about the doors of criminal courts or policeoffices it is not often i boast in this way mr de medina but i thought you might as well understand that a principle of honour alone and neither fear nor hope of reward has induced me to restore you that document as for fear i never knew it and as for reward i should not think of taking it were you to offer anymr de medina gazed upon rainford in astonishment as much as to say you are really a very extraordinary person but his lips uttered not what the countenance expressed the highwayman rose bowed with easy politeness to mr de medina and quitted the room as he was crossing the landing towards the stairs the door of an apartment adjoining that where he had just left mr de medina was cautiously opened and tamar thrust a note into his hand he caught a glimpse of her countenance as he received it and he saw that she had been weeping when he reached the street he tore open the note and read as followsi have overheard all but i do not love thee the less my bravemy gallant rainford this evening i shall have occasion to call at two or three shops in the same street where you rescued me from insult yesterdayneed we inform our readers that tom rain kept the appointment thus given him or need we say how the lovers subsequently met as often as tamar could leave the house without exciting suspicion yesthey met frequently and each interview only tended to strengthen the profound attachment which they had formed for each other and no wonder that tom rain loved his beautiful tamar for beautifulravishingly beautiful she indeed was to behold her countenance was passionto gaze on her admirable shape was raptureto meet the glances of her fine black eyes was fascination and oh how devotedly she loved rainford in return to her he was a hero for although she knew him to be a highwayman yet well was she aware that he never stooped to a petty meanness and that his soul was endowed with many noblemany generous qualities one daring feat which he performed a few weeks after she first became acquainted with him converted her admiration into a positive enthusiasm so that the empress josephine could not have more ardently worshipped napoleon than did tamar her tom rain thus it happenedone night the liverpool and manchester coach was stopped on its way to the former town by a single highwayman who wore a crape over his face was well mounted and equally well armed although the coach was crowded with passengers most of whom were men yet so terrible was the robber even in his very coolnessso formidable with his easy air of unconcern that all were paralysed with fear no resistance was offered him and he reaped an excellent harvest from the purses of the passengers one gentleman who happened to be the mayor of liverpool was so bewildered by terror that though only asked for his money he handed to the highwayman both purse and watch the latter was returned the robber declaring that he scorned any thing save the current coin of the realm or good banknotes from the female passengers he took nothing and perceiving by the moonlight a poor shivering girl of about fifteen seated outside at the back of the coach he asked her a few questions the brief and timid replies which she gave were ample enough to render intelligible a tale of suffering and woe and the highwayman drawing forth five guineas said here my dear you need not be afraid to accept this trifle it comes from a pocket into which none of these gentlemens gold has goneand before the poor girl could utter a word in reply the highwayman put spurs to his horse and disappeared in a few moments but this action on his part did not disarm the male passengers who had been robbed of their rage and their rancour the mayor was particularly indignant the entire town of liverpool had been insultedgrossly insulted in his worshipful person such wrath required a vent and it found an issue by means of advertising the daring robbery the mayor announced in all the local papers and by means of placards that any one who should be instrumental in bringing the highwayman before him would receive the sum of two hundred pounds as a reward but a week elapsed before these proclamations received any answer at the expiration of that time the following incident occurred one evening the mayor entertained a select party of friends at a splendid banquet the cloth had been removed some timethe ladies had retired to the drawingroomand the gentlemen about a dozen in number were passing the wine rapidly round when a servant entered to inform his master that a person wished to speak to him in the hall the servants manner was somewhat embarrassed and upon being questioned he said that the stranger seemed to wear a mask as his face was too hideous to be possibly a human one the mayor trembled and his guests caught the infection of his terror his worship hazarded an opinion that the visitor was perhaps in some way connected with the highwayman who had robbed the manchester and liverpool coach and he directed the servant to show the stranger into the study and then run and fetch a constable but scarcely were these commands issued when the door opened and in walked the object of interest and fear the mayor and his guests uttered simultaneous ejaculations of terror for never did mortal man possess so frightful a face and as it was partially shaded by a huge quantity of hair and a large slouched hat it was impossible to decide whether it were really a mask or a natural physiognomy the nose was enormous and studded with carbuncles and warts the cheeks were fiery red and the chin was of dimensions proportionate with the nasal promontory this terrible being was enveloped in a long cloak but through the holes cut for the purpose appeared his arms the hands holding each a tremendous horsepistol as big as a blunderbuss placing his back against the door the intruder said in a voice which he rendered as hollow and fierce as possible most worshipful mayor you have advertised that any one who is instrumental in bringing a certain highwayman before you shall receive the sum of two hundred pounds as a reward i am the highwayman alluded to i have brought myself before you and i appeal to the wisdom and justice of the intelligent gentlemen seated round your board whether i have not fairly earned the recompense promisedbut stammered the mayor i meant that any one who would bring the robber a prisoner before me should be entitled to the rewardi dont care what you meant returned the highwayman i only know what your advertisements and placards say you should get the corporation to vote funds to enable you to attach a grammarian to your establishment he would be more useful than the swordbearer i think added the audacious robber with a merry laugh in his natural tone but i have no leisure to bandy words with you tell out the two hundred pounds or i shall be under the disagreeable necessity of allowing one of these little instruments to empty its contents in the direction of your headand with these words he raised a pistol the mayor uttered an exclamation of terror and cast an imploring glance rapidly around but all his guests were sitting like statuesin blank dismay the mayor saw that he must not look to them for assistance and yet he was very loath to part with two hundred pounds in such an unsatisfactory mannerbut how do i know that you really are the person who robbed the coach he asked the words evidently costing him a most painful effort to enunciate thembecause i can tell you every incident that occurred on the occasion was the answerthat information you may have received from hearsay or gleaned from the papers returned the mayor gathering courage as he found the robber willing to argue the point with himi will give you another proof said the robber there was a bad guinea in the purse i took from you are you satisfied nownot quite rejoined the mayor hoping that by gaining time some chance might place the daring visitor in his powerthen i have one more proof to offer you said the robber in a corner of the purse there was a scrap of paper containing the receipt of an overseer of some parish in manchester for the quarters money due for the maintenance of your worships bastard and so i suppose you had been to that town to pay itthe mayor was aghast as this announcement burst upon him for though he had lost the receipt in question it had never struck him that he had placed it in his purse when he paid the money at manchester the guests surveyed their worshipful host in astonishment and the servant giggled behind his chairnow are you satisfied demanded the highwayman remember you brought it on yourselfthe mayor partially recovering his presence of mind affected to laugh off the matter as a capital joke on the part of the robber but he made no farther objection to pay the two hundred pounds this he was enabled to do by borrowing all the money that his guests had about them and adding it to the contents of his own pocket for the highwayman would neither take a cheque nor allow him to quit the room to procure the requisite sum from his strongbox the robber would not even leave his post at the door but compelled the mayor to rise from the table and bring the cash and notes to hima proceeding which his worship liked as little as might be seeing that it brought him into awful vicinity with the nose the chin and the pistols at length the business was settled and the highwayman withdrew locking the door behind himbut not before he had assured the company that if they attempted to open the windows and raise an alarm in the street after him he would instantly return and put them all to death this incident was in every bodys mouth next day throughout the good town of liverpool and its environs and the mayor was most heartily laughed at but tamar alone knew the name of the daring individual who had perpetrated so audacious a feat the beautiful jewess carefully concealed her amour from her sister and her father indeed esther never saw tom rain during the whole time that he remained in liverpool but one day tamar disappeared leaving a note behind her addressed to her sister whom she begged to break to their father her flight and its cause she stated that her happinessher life were wrapped up in thomas rainford and that as she was well aware her sire would never consent to her union with him even if the usages of the jewish nation sanctioned an alliance with a christian she had taken a step which she should regret only on account of the distress it might create in the minds of her father and sister esther could scarcely believe her eyes when she read the appalling contents of this note she fancied that she was in a dream then when the full conviction of the truth burst upon her and she comprehended that her sister had really fled with rainford she gave way to all the wildness of her grieffor she was deeply deeply attached to tamar but how did mr de medina bear this cruel blow he wept nothe gave vent to no passionate exclamationhe manifested no excitement but after remaining wrapt up in profound meditation for upwards of an hour while esther sate near watching him with the deepestmost acutely painful suspensea long long hour of utter silence broken only by the frequent sobs that told the maidens anguishmr de medina spoke in a calm deliberate but stern and relentless tonehenceforth esther i have but one daughterthyself let the name of tamar never more be uttered in my presence destroy every thing in the house which may tend to remind me that there once dwelt such a being herethe music whereon her name is written the drawings which she executed the very windowhangings which she embroidered destroy them all estherkeep them noti command you as you value my blessing and henceforthwhatever may occur never speak of your sister in the presence of those who are aware that you had a sister cut short any allusion that the thoughtless might make respecting her by observing emphaticallyi have no sister nowfor should such allusion be made before me my reproof and my response would be i have but one daughterand her name is esther it is my intention to wind up my affairs as speedily as possible and retire from business had not this occurred i should have toiled a few years longer to amass an immense fortune to be divided between two now the fortune which i possess will be immense enough for one and that one esther is thyself but two or three years may elapse before i shall be enabled so to condense the vast details of my undertakings into such a narrow compass that i may terminate them all prosperously during these two or three years we must remain in liverpool but our sojourn here shall not last a dayno nor an hour longer than my affairs render imperatively necessary we will then repair to london for it is in the giant metropolis alone that we may hope to conceal from the world this disgracethis infamythis blight which has fallen upon a family whose name i had fondly hoped would have gone down untainted from generation to generationeven as it had descended to me from a long line of honourable and honoured ancestors these esther are my resolves seek not to move mei am now inflexible nayimplore me not to change my determination stern though it may appear it is immutable as those median and persian laws whereof mention is made in the book of books henceforth i have but one daughter illustration and having thus announced the inexorable resolves on which his mind had settled itself during that long long hour of deep and silent meditation the jew bent down and kissed the brow of his kneeling daughter with an affection which in its tenderness contrasted strangely with the stern severity of the conduct that he had determined to pursue in respect to the lostthe guiltythe disowned tamar he then hurried from the room and estherpoor esther was left alone to shed torrents of unavailing tears and give vent to fruitless sobs and sighs but oh what pen can describe the acuteness of her afflictionthe anguish of her gentle heart when not daring altogether to disobey the will of her sire she removed from their frames the charming landscapes which tamar had painted in watercolours and placed out of sight the music copies whereon the name of tamar was penned in her own sweet fluent handwriting and blame not esther gentle readerno blame her not if disobedient as to the literal meaning of her fathers commands she retained those paintings and that musicretained them as memorials of the lost sister whom she so fondly loved but she secured them in her own chamber and alaspoor girl as she placed the pictures one by one in a drawer their best tints and their brightest colours were marred by the scalding tears that fell upon them for oh acute as the pain inflicted by the merciless knife which the surgeon wields to amputate a limb was this task to the sensitive heart of esthera task involving a deed wearing in her eyes the semblance of profanityfor little short of that appeared the removal from their wonted places of those memorials of the disowned and castoff tamar twas like crushing all the reminiscences of a sweet sisterhoodtwas like cutting away from her heart the brightest thoughts that had hitherto clung around ittearing rudely off the flowers that encircled hopes youthful brow and entombing the choice memories of a happy girlhood then when the musicbooks and the pictures were thus removed from the places where she had so long been accustomed to see them how mournful to her was the sight of the tuneful but now silent piano on which the former had been piled uphow naked appeared the walls to which the latter had hung and next she was compelled to take down the very hangings which tamar had embroidered for the drawingroom windows and there was fresh cause for tearsfresh motive for the renewal or rather for the continuation of her grief but the task was nevertheless completed and the drapery was also retained by esther as a memorial of her sister not for worlds could she have brought herself to that frame of mind which would have been necessary to enable her to achieve the destruction of all those objectsnonot even were her father to menace her with his direst curse when mr de medina again appeared in the suite of rooms which had been subject to the changes just detailed he cast a rapid glance around him and perceiving that his orders had been obeyed so far as removal went asked not a question relative to the manner in which the various objects had been disposed of but settling his looks upon esthers countenance after that hasty survey he said emphatically thank god i possess an obedienta dutifulan affectionate child in the meantime tom rain and the beautiful tamar were far away from liverpool on their road to london and when they reached the great metropolis they hired a neat lodging in a secluded neighbourhoodfor they entertained apprehensions that mr de medina might endeavour to trace his fugitive daughter tamar did not in this respect know her fathers disposition well judging by his past kindness she argued accordinglylittle imagining that he had strength of mind sufficient to adopt the fearful alternative of casting her off for ever rainford had so well stocked himself with coin during his sojourn in liverpool and its neighbourhood that there was no immediate necessity of exercising his professional skill or rather valour to supply resources and several weeks glided away happilythe happiest of his life he loved tamar most tenderly and devotedly and she not only loved him in returnbut absolutely adored him oh how she worshipped her gallant highwayman who was so braveso generousand withal so kind to her never was there a better temper than that of tom rain it was impossible for him to be put out of humour he would have scorned the idea of raising a quarrel for the mere sake of making it up again he saw no amusement in such maudlin proceedings dissensions bickerings and domestic feuds were his abhorrence he looked upon woman as the weaker vessel whom man was bound to protect he thought it beneath him to dispute with a female because with him it could be a mere warfare of words to which none but a coward would put an end by means of a blow besides he hated that strife which is waged with the tongue if a man offended him he did not wait to argue the point but quietly knocked him down that was his first and last reason when irritated but he could not adopt the same course with a woman and he therefore most rationally concluded that it was perfectly useless to quarrel with her tamar like all young and beautiful womenespecially being placed as it were in an equivocal positionwas jealous tom rain loved to visit all the strange places in which london abounds that he might make himself acquainted with the lights and shades of metropolitan life and sometimes tamar complained that he was too long absent now my dear girl he would say i give you as much of my time as possible and when i tell you that i shall be home at a certain hour i never disappoint you but do not show illhumour because i take a couple of hours to myself so now kiss me and do not teach that pretty face to frown his good temper invariably proved irresistible and in the course of time his mistress never thought of manifesting any opposite feeling indeed he was so kindso goodso attentive towards her that had it not been for the frequent intrusion of a painful reminiscence concerning her father and sister tamar would have been completely happy after remaining for some months in london rainford and his beautiful mistress set off for the northern counties where the highwayman reaped a rich harvest his midnight expeditions were frequent because his mode of living was by no means economical he delighted in good cheerdenied himself nothing that he fanciedand yet was neither a drunkard nor a glutton he was moreover generous and liberal to an extreme and emulative of the character of robin hood gave to the poor no inconsiderable portion of what he took from the rich tamar was moreover fond of handsome apparel and resplendent jewellery and rainford took a delight in gratifying all her whims and fancies thus money was lavishly expended by them but the highway was an inexhaustible treasury to which rainford never had recourse in vain the perils he incurred in these predatory expeditions were of course numerous and great but his dauntless valourhis wonderful presence of mindand the determined resolution with which he as it were met danger face to face invariably saved him from capture at first tamar was dreadfully frightened when rainford took leave of her to get a draught on his treasury cashed as he laughingly termed his nocturnal expeditions but as he invariably returned home about the hour he had promised those apprehensions wore off and she at length became comparatively easy in her mind during his absence thus did time pass away until nearly three years had elapsed since tamar first met rainford at liverpool during the whole of this period she had heard nothing of her father and sister and no allusion was ever made to them by her lover or herself when together but she did not the less devote frequent thoughts to the author of her being and the muchloved esther both of whom she longedoh ardently longed to embrace once more the reader has already learnt the motives which induced tom rain to visit the metropolis towards the close of the year the important information which during his travels about england in company with tamar he gleaned from the gipsy miranda led him to betake himself once more to london it happened that mr de medina and esther arrived in the capital almost at the same time for the merchant had not been able to wind up his affairs until that period retiring from business with a large fortune he had resolved to quit liverpoola place which constantly brought back the most painful reminiscences to his mind in spite of his stern resolve to disown his elder daughter for ever but estherhad she forgotten tamar oh nothe memory of the fond sister was immortal and she would have given whole years of her life to clasp tamar in her arms again this tender aspiration was speedily destined to be gratified one afternoon towards the close of october esther de medina was returning home to great ormond street after having been to make a few purchases in holborn when she encountered her sister tamar who was also alone at the time fortunately the street where they thus met was in a quiet neighbourhood and at that moment almost deserted otherwise the ejaculations of surprise and delight which the sisters uttered and the eagerness with which they flew into each others arms might have drawn upon them an attention by no means agreeable as it was they escaped any particular notice and hastening to the least frequented side of queen square they entered into long and serious conversation together tamar implored esther to tell her how their father had received the tidings of her flight and the younger sister was so overcome by her emotions that she allowed the entire truth to be extracted from her by the questioning and crossquestioning of the impatient tamar thus was it that the latter learnt how she had been disownedcast off for ever terrible were the efforts which it cost her to subdue a violent outburst of grief and her heart seemed as if it would break when in a low tone she addressed her sister thusesther dearest my father has no cause to apprehend that i shall proclaim myself his daughter nolet him boldly declare that he has but one childthyself i know not how long i may remain in london but this i faithfully promise you that i will appear abroad as little as possible and then only with my countenance concealed by a dark veil so long as the interests of him whom i love may compel him to dwell in this city that we shall be long here i do not believe tell our father esther that we have thus met and communicate to him those assurances that i have now given theeesther clung to her sister for support that language was distressing to the young maiden to hearand are you happy tamar she asked weeping bitterlyas happy as woman can be whose father has disowned her and who is separated from her sister replied tamar now weeping also yes dearest esther i am happy with him whom i love so well and who is so kind so fond towards methis assurance diminishes my grief murmured esther oh how glad i am that we have thus met this interview has suddenly relieved me of a tremendous weight of cruel uncertainty regarding thee but alas tamar why did you desert your happy home why did you abandon a father and a sister who loved you so tenderlyesther hast thou not yet known that love which is so different from the affection existing even between parents and their children or between those who are so closely linked in the bonds of kinship as yourself and inowell then esther i can scarcely make you comprehend how much more deserving of pity than blame i am he whom i love so well came to the housei did not seek him and my heart soonoh full soon became his could i help it it were vain and idle to say that we can control those feelings which constitute the passion of love no earthly power could have restrained the current of that attachment which hurried me along to the accomplishment of what became my destiny and when one loves as i loved and still love estherand as i am loved in returnfather sister home kindred friendsall are forgotten oh this is trueso true that you would not blame me did you know what it is to love as i loveblame you dearest sister exclaimed esther never never and she clasped tamar fervently in her arms but it was now dark and that part of the square to which they had retired for the purpose of unrestrained discourse echoed to no voices save their own when the sisters were a little more composed esther informed tamar of all that had occurred since they had last seen each otherhow their father had renounced the cares and fatigues of business and had resolved to settle altogether in london and how he was then negotiating with the earl of ellingham for the tenancy of a small but compact estate near finchley the sisters then agreed to correspond together for esther secretly hoped that her father would not deny her the pleasure of receiving letters from her sister tamar was accordingly to address her correspondence to great ormond street and esther was to direct her letters to t j south moulton street where rainford and his mistress were then passing under the name of jameson the sisters were now about to part when esther drawing a diamond ring from her finger placed it in tamars hand then taking a small pair of scissors from her reticule she cut off the end of one of her own ringlets which having folded in a piece of paper she also presented to her sister saying in her softest sweetest tonestamar the love which subsists between us no circumstances can destroyno length of absence impair we are about to separate and though with the hope of meeting again still that meeting might be deferred by accidents at present unforeseen i would that you should possess some memorial of your sisteroh is it necessary exclaimed tamar in an impassioned tone of profound sincerityif not necessary it would be at least soothing to my feelings said esther for i possess memorials of you in your drawings and your music grant me then the favour which i am about to ask youname it sister replied tamar now deeply affected in her turnit is dearest continued the amiable esther that you dispose of the ring which i have now presented to you and that with the proceeds you will have made a locket in which my hair may be set and on the inner side of which my name may be engraved this i implore you to do my sister and i know that you will not refuse methe next time we meet esther said tamar in a tone tremulous with emotion i will show you the locketthe sisters then separated with aching hearts on her return home esther frankly and candidly confessed to her father all that had occurred for some minutes mr de medina remained silent and esther observed that a tear trembled upon his lash but the hope thereby excited within her died away when her father turned abruptly round and said esther you have not acted well that you should speak to her who was once my daughter is natural but that you should arrange with her the means of correspondence was wrong i desire that the first letter which she may address to this house shall also be the lastthe jew then quitted the room leaving his daughter in tears on the very next day tamar wrote a long and most affectionate letter to her sister and esther was compelled to inform her in the reply of the harsh command issued by their father but that very severity on the part of mr de medina to some extentat least in this particular instancedestroyed that frank and openhearted confidence which esther had hitherto manifested towards him and which was inherent in her nature she could not make up her mind to break off all correspondence with her sister and yet she dared not receive any future letters at the house in great ormond street the idea of having tamars letters addressed elsewhere naturally suggested itself therefore to her imagination and she accordingly made an arrangement at the postoffice in southampton row by which the woman who kept the shop consented to receive and keep for esther any missives that might be thus addresseda b c post office southampton row to be left till called for that same evening esther wrote another letter to her sister acquainting her with this arrangement and we should observe that tamar duly communicated all these circumstances to tom rain who was delighted to find that she whom he so fondly loved had experienced so much happiness by thus meeting and corresponding with her sister the highwayman was not however a little astonished when he had learnt from tamar that mr de medina was about to become the tenant of the earl of ellingham and it was then for the first time that he communicated to his mistress the full particulars of all that the gipsy miranda had told him and which had made him acquainted with his parentageparticulars already so well known to the reader the seventh day after these events was the st of octobera date rendered memorable so far as this narrative is concerned by the affair of the diamonds it was about five oclock in the afternoon of the day named that tamar called on mr gordon the diamondmerchant in arundel street to dispose of her ring rainford would have transacted the business for her but he was occupied at the time in effecting his negotiations with old death and moreover tamar considered it to be a matter exclusively regarding herself we must confess that the idea of possessing the means of procuring a beautiful locket shared in her mind the place that ought to have been entirely occupied by the proofs she had received of her sisters devoted attachment but tamar was passionately enamoured of resplendent jewellery and when in mr gordons apartments she beheld a beautiful set of diamonds lying in an open case upon the table the temptation became irresistible it cannot be supposed that she had been very nearly three years the companion of a highwayman without having her notions of mine and thine considerably shaken and through her brain instantly flashed the thoughtwherefore should not i make myself the mistress of those charming jewels as well as tom render himself the possessor of a purse on the main road scarcely was the idea conceived when she resolved to execute it and she haggled with the diamondmerchant relative to the price which he was to pay for the ring merely to gain an opportunity to selfappropriate the diamonds that opportunity served and she departed alike with the produce of the ring and of the theft but scarcely had she reached the street when her sentiments underwent a complete revulsion and she would have given worlds to be able to recall the last ten minutes for an instant she paused hesitating whether she should not return into the presence of mr gordon and restore him the diamonds fear however prevented hera fear lest he might consider her deserving of punishment for having abstracted them at all she accordingly hurried away towards south moulton street but during her walk thither she reflected that rainford might be much annoyed with her for the deed she had committed and the more she pondered thereon the more powerful became her conviction that he would be more than annoyedin fact deeply incensed she accordingly made up her mind to conceal the circumstance from him and seek the earliest possible opportunity of sending back the diamonds by some safe means to mr gordon on her arrival in south moulton street she found a letter from esther it contained assurances of ardent affection but apologised for its brevity on the ground that it was then already one oclock in the day and that at two lord ellinghams carriage was to be at the door to convey his lordship her father and herself to view the mansion and estate near finchley she added that they were to dine at the mansion and were not to return until late in the evening tom rain was present in the room when tamar read this note and she communicated its contents to him two nights afterwards he departed on a little expedition and on this occasion lady hatfield was robbed by the highwayman near bedfont on the ensuing morning rainford was arrested and conveyed to bow street but he escaped with impunity in the manner already described but how great was his astonishment when he heard the name of esther de medina pronounced in the court and with what interestwith what respectful admiration did he survey the sister of his tamarthat sister who loved her whom the father had disowned when mr gordon was called forward and stated his name and calling rainford began to grow uneasy for he knew that tamar had sold him the ring three evenings previously but as the diamondmerchant gradually explained the details of the robbery of the diamonds the highwaymans heart sank within himfor he had no difficulty in penetrating the mystery he was still meditating upon the course that should be adopted to prove esthers innocence when it suddenly struck him that she must have been at the estate near finchley at the very moment when the theft of the diamonds occurred the reader knows the rest lord ellinghams attendance at the court was ensured by the intervention of rainford and esther was discharged her father it will be remembered appeared at the policeoffice just as the case was about to terminate and the expression which he made use of to his daughteroh estheresther i can understand it all you have brought this upon yourselfis now accounted for when esther turned an appealing glance towards her father as if to remind him of some duty which he ought to perform or to convey some silent prayer which he could well understandit was to beseech him to satisfy the diamondmerchant for the loss of his jewels and thus save tamar from any unpleasant consequences which might ensue were the theft traced to her but as we have seen he affected not to notice that rapid but profoundly significant glance during the few minutes that mr de medina remained in the court rainford was concealed as it wereor at least shrouded from observationamongst the crowd and thus he escaped the notice of the jew we should also state that it was on this occasion rainford first beheld his halfbrother the earl of ellingham whose fine blue eyes indicated a frank and generous disposition and in whose favour the highwayman was immediately prepossessed for it must be remembered that his eyes were also of a deep blue and indicated not only good humour but a certain generosity of disposition indeed it was only in respect to the eyes and the brilliant teeth that the earl and rainford possessed the slightest family resemblance to each other yesit was on this occasion that rainford first saw him whom he knew to be his halfbrother and the earl noticed him alsonoticed him amongst the crowd of spectators who thronged the courtbut he knew not then how nearly that goodlooking man with the florid complexion and light hair was related to him when rainford returned home to south moulton street he upbraided tamar for the deed which she had perpetrated and which had involved her sister in such a cruel embarrassment but he did not reproach her in harsh nor brutal terms of such conduct he was incapable he spoke severely and coldlymanifesting his displeasure in a way which touched her to the quick but provoked no recriminations she was almost wild with grief when she heard the narrative of her sister being dragged to a policeoffice upon so degrading a charge and producing the diamonds she implored rainford to hasten and send them back to their owner he intimated his intention of performing that duty in person and ere he went away tamar implored his forgiveness i have no right to assume to myself the power of pardon he answered seeing that my example has done this but oh tamarif not for my sakeif not for your sakeat least for that of your estimable sister who is so devoted to you abstain from such deeds in futurehe then embraced her and issued from the house in the meantime esther de medina had succeeded in persuading her father to advance the moneyadvance to her the means wherewith to liquidate the amount of the value at which the jewels were estimated but in giving the sum required mr de medina said sternly esther it is to you only that i concede this favourand not for the sake of her who was once my daughter and whom the infamy this day brought to light has estranged more remotely than ever from my hearthe then retired to another room as was his wont when he wished to avoid an unpleasant topic moreover he thought that his daughter had suffered enough that day to render any further reproach on his part unnecessaryindeed cruel and he knew that were the subject of conversation persisted in he should not be able to restrain his ire the reader has already seen how esther de medina called upon the diamondmerchant and paid him the sum of six hundred poundsthe amount at which he valued his jewels he offered her a receipt but she declined to take itfor she thought that as she was settling the affair from motives purely honourable and through regard towards another it would appear as if she were really interested personally in the transaction were she to reduce it to a mere matter of business not that she meditated a revelation of the fact that she had a sister so like herself that when seen apart they might well be taken for each other and that this sister was the real culpritoh noshe would not even if she had dared admit that her father had another daughter and if she lingeredas if anxious to say something moretwas merely because her feelings of natural pride prompted her to exclaim oh sir believe that i am innocent of this dreadful chargebut a second thought convinced her that such a declaration would not be credited unless supported by a feasible explanation and she abruptly quitted the housebearing the stigma in mr gordons eyes of having committed a deed of which she was utterly guiltless scarcely had esther quitted the diamondmerchants dwelling when tom rain called to restore the diamonds and great was his surprise upon learning that miss de medina herself had called and paid the six hundred pounds at which they were valued he however left the diamonds with the certainty that esther would hear of their restoration either from mr gordon himself or direct from tamar rainford then returned to south moulton street where he found tamar in a very excited state the occurrences of the day had made a profound and most painful impression upon her mind the indignity offered to her sisterthe certain indignation of her fatherthe upbraidings of rainford who had never spoken to her so severely beforeand the bitter regrets which she experienced when she contemplated her conductall these circumstances had combined to madden her thinking that rainford was absent longer than the business on which he had set out seemed to warrant she was filled with the most fearful misgivings at one moment she fancied that in disgust at her behaviour he had abandoned her for ever then she imagined that he must have been arrested as the possessor of the stolen diamonds her mind was agitated like the ocean in a storm she went out in a fit of desperation and purchased some arsenic at a chemists shop she returnedrainford had not yet arrived she sate down and tried to wrestle with her maddening thoughts but an invincible idea of suicide dominated them all she struggledoh she struggled bravely against that terrible sentiment and at length rainford came back he exerted himself to calm hersaid all he could to tranquillise her mind he declared that he forgave her from the bottom of his heart and lavished every token of tenderness upon her she endeavoured to triumph over the fearful excitement under which she was labouring but all she could do was to appear calm two or three hours passed away and rainford hoped she was recovering her equanimity but a species of delirium suddenly seized upon her she rushed to the bedroom and before rainford even knew her intention she swallowed the poison by the time he had followed her into the roomalarmed at the precipitate speed with which she had hurried thitherthe deed was accomplished and the paper which he picked up as she threw herself frantically at his feet explained to him the whole truth not a moment was to be lost entrusting tamar to the care of the servantgirl rainford rushed from the house and as a hackneycoach was fortunately passing at the moment he leapt into it desiring the driver to take him to the nearest physician of eminence the name of dr lascelles was best known to the honest jarvey and to grafton street did the vehicle accordingly proceed the physician accompanied rainford to south moulton street and tamar was saved but ere lascelles took his departure the highwayman had resolved on adopting some plan to prevent any disagreeable consequences occurring in respect to esther de medina on account of this attempted suicide on the part of tamar for rainford naturally reflected that as the physician was constantly moving in society and must necessarily have an immense circle of acquaintance it was more than probable that he might sooner or later encounter esther whom he would mistake for the sisterhis real patient hence the solemn promise which rainford exacted from lascellesthat when once his professional visits had ceased in south moulton street he would forget that he had ever beholden tamar and that should he ever meet her alone or in company he would not even appear to recognise hermuch less attempt to speak to herunless formally introduced when he would consider his acquaintance with her to be commenced only from the moment of such introduction on the ensuing morning at seven oclock rainford and tamar took their departure from south moulton street and repaired to locks fields where the highwayman had already engaged lodgings previously to the affair of the diamonds as he was anxious for many obvious reasons to dwell in a spot as secluded and retired as possible tamar then wrote a long and pathetic letter to her sister imploring her forgiveness for the indignity which she had undergone on account of one so worthless as herself and requesting her to address all future letters to her until further notice in this mannert r no brandon street locks fields on the same day that rainford and tamar thus removed to the vicinity of the elephant and castle tavern mr gordon called upon esther de medina in great ormond street esther was much embarrassed when the diamondmerchant was announced for she feared that if her father were at home he would naturally hasten to the drawingroom to learn the object of this call and a renewal of many painful reflections as well as of much unpleasant observation would follow it was therefore with a feeling of pleasure that esther found upon inquiry of the servants that mr de medina had gone out a few minutes previous to mr gordons arrival when the diamondmerchant mentioned the particulars of the visit which he had received from the lighthaired gentleman esther instantly comprehended that the individual alluded to must be rainford for though she had never seen him to her knowledge yet she had heard a few details relative to his personal appearance three years previously at liverpool mr gordon acquainted her with the restoration of the diamonds and her countenance suddenly assumed an expression of joy because she could not help recognising a certain evidence of good principle and of kind feeling towards herself in the fact of such restoration two days afterwards tamar and esther again met and the younger sister breathed the most tender expressions of forgiveness in the ear of her whom though so guilty she loved so tenderly on the following evening they met for the third time and then esther used all her powers of persuasion to induce tamar to accompany her hometo throw herself at the feet of their father and implore his forgiveness but tamar answered in a firm tone while tears nevertheless streamed down her countenanceit is impossible esther rainford loves me so devotedly that i should esteem myself the veriest wretch upon the face of the earth to desert him and on this condition alone could i hope to obtain my fathers pardon no my destiny is fixed to him i am linked until death shall separate us think not dearest esther that i love thee the less because i cannot dare not take a step that would probably unite us again at the blessed domestic hearth and beneath the sacred roof of our fathers dwelling oh god knows how sincerely how earnestly i wish that such happiness was in store for me but it is impossible estherimpossible and the sisters parted again each weeping bitterly mr de medina had noticed that esther was absent from home a long time on those two occasions and he taxed her with having seen tamar again she did not deny the charge but falling at her fathers feet she implored him to leave her that source of consolation her grief was so excessive that mr de medina who in his heart admired these evidences of sisterly affection gave no reply on that occasion a negative trembled upon his tonguebut he dared not utter it he recognised all that was generous and noble in the disposition of esther and he felt proud of her as his daughterthe only daughter whom he considered himself to possess but when in the solitude of his study he reflected maturely upon these interviews which were taking place between the sisters and which if not at once checked would naturally become more frequent his mind was impressed with an idea that tamar was utterly and irredeemably profligateabandoned in character beyond all hope and he feared lest esther should be corrupted by her conversation he therefore resolved painful as the duty was to put an end to those meetings and yet mitigate the severity of this blow by winking as it were at the continuation of their epistolary correspondencebut still with the firm intention of crushing that indulgence also at a very early period he knew that oral communication is far more dangerous than written interchange of thought the former therefore was to be suspended first he accordingly chose the anniversary of the day on which tamar fled with rainford to administer to esther a solemn oath binding her never to see her sister again and to this vow was the unhappy girl compelled to pledge herself it was the conversation which passed between the father and daughter on this occasion that lord ellingham overheardor rather detached portions of which met his ears producing such strange misgivings in his mind relative to the purity of esther de medina when the weeping esther retired to her chamber after having taken that oath it struck her that her father had not prohibited her from writing to tamar and esther was too glad to avail herself of this circumstance to unburthen her grief to her sister through the medium of that epistle which old death intercepted and perused but which he afterwards returned to the letterbox in holborn and if the reader will refer to that letter he will perceive that it was specially addressed to tamar although when first glanced at and while the impression remained unfavourable to esthers character it might have seemed to appeal to rainford himself we have now cleared up all the mysteries relating to the family of mr de medina and we doubt not our readers will be pleased to find that esther is indeed a model of purityinnocenceand sisterly affection oh despise not then the jewessfor christians might be proud to emulate her virtues and rainford was a man who readily recognised and appreciated all the excellence of her dispositionall the glorious traits of her character though he knew her not but he admiredenthusiastically admired the soul that could cling so devotedly to its love for a sister and from the first moment that the sisters met in london he vowed that esther should never again be compromised by any act or deed on the part of tamar if he were able to prevent it thus was it that on the night when mr dykes and his myrmidons invaded the house in locks fields tom rain gave such positive injunctions to tamar not to visit him in prison should he be captured for he feared lest any one acquainted with esther might meet tamar under such circumstances the inevitable result being that the one would be mistaken for the other but on the day previous to his execution he yielded to the imploringbeseeching letters which tamar sent to him by means of jacob smith and consented that she should take a last farewell of him on condition that she concealed her face as much as possible with a veil when esther read in the newspapers of rainfords arrest she felt deeplydeeply for her poor sister whom she knew to be so devotedly attached to the highwayman and oh esther herself had begun to comprehend the feeling of love for she had not beheld with indifference the handsomethe elegantand the generous hearted earl of ellinghamand all that tamar had said relative to the wondrous influence of that passion would at times recur strangely to her memory yesesther loved the good young nobleman but her soul was too pureher manners to deeply fraught with maidenly reserve to betray the slightest evidence of her attachment nor had she yet so far admitted even in the secret depths of her own mind the existence of this inclination towards him as to ponder upon it seriously or to invest it with the aspect of reality she knew that he was attached and believed him engaged to be married to lady hatfield and she sighed involuntarilyscarcely comprehending whereforewhen she thought thereon still she loved himwhile she believed in the innocence of her own heart that she merely felt interested in him as a friend nor did her imagination define the true distinction between the feeling which she actually experienced and that which she only conceived to animate herno not even when the glowing description of love which her sister had drawn on one occasion of their meeting presented itself to her mind but she could yet the more easily understand how it was possible for tamar to love rainford so devotedly as she did hence the acute anguish that esther experienced on account of her sister when she read the arrest of the highwayman mr de medina did not of course remain ignorant of the occurrence but he made not the slightest allusion to it in the presence of esther nor did he put into force his previously contemplated plan of forbidding any future epistolary correspondence between the sisters he felt deeply for tamar in spite of his stern silence respecting her and he would not deprive her under the weight of such dire afflictions of the consolation which he naturally conceived the letters of esther must prove to her he even gave esther though unasked a considerable sum of money casually observing that she might wish to purchase herself a new piano or any thing else she might fancyand the young maiden pressed her fathers hand for it struck her that he meant her to be the medium of conveying assistance in case it should be needed to tamar but tamar in reply to the letter which esther wrote proffering pecuniary aid gave her the assurance that though bowed down by the weight of affliction poverty was not amongst the sources of her deep sorrow day after day did esther fondly hope that her father would speak to her relative to the now unfriended position of her sister but mr de medina preserved a profound silence there were however moments when esther fancied that his countenance looked anxious and careworn as if a struggle were taking place in his mind still time wore on and he said nothing respecting tamarhe mentioned not her name but one night when esther could not sleep she thought that she heard a moaning sound in her fathers room which was on the opposite side of the passage communicating with her own and alarmed lest he might have been seized with sudden indisposition she stole silently from her chamber and listened at his door he was pacing the room with agitated steps and speaking aloud in a manner indicative of acute mental anguish o tamar tamarmy daughter tamar wherefore didst thou ever abandon me god of my fathers that such miserysuch disgracesuch infamy should have fallen upon my race and yetthough i have disowned theethough i have cast thee off for everthough obedient to a stern duty i have interdicted thy meetings with esther the darling of my heartnevertheless my heart yearns towards thee my tamar oh to reclaim theeto bring thee back to the paths of virtueto see thee happy and gay as thou once wastoh to do all this i would consent to become the veriest beggar who crawls upon the face of the earth there was a long pause and mr de medina continued to pace his room with steps still more agitated than hithertowhile esther stood in breathless suspense at the door not daring to make her father aware that she had overheard him and yet unable to retrace her steps to her own chamber but it may not be suddenly exclaimed the jew in an impassionedrending tone for the triumph which he had achieved over his softer feelings cost him pangs as acute as if his heartstrings were being torn asunder noit may not be i have pronounced the fatal words tamari have disowned thee and i may not recall the fiat but if that manwho led thee astrayshould be cut off by the hand of justice and the jews voice grew tremulous as in broken sentences he uttered these wordsthen thou will be alone in the worldfriendlessperhaps in wantstarvingoh my god my god and esther knew that her father was overcome with the bitterness of grief for a moment her hand was raised to knock at the door but in the next the thought struck her that she would be doing wrong to wound and even humiliate him by suffering him to know that she had become aware of the sorrow which he devoured in secret and it also flashed to her mind that beneath the cold stern and severe demeanour which he had maintained ever since the flight of tamar from the paternal roofbeneath also that unbrokenprofound silence which he had maintained towards her in respect to the misfortune that had fallen upon tamar by the arrest of rainfordbeneath all this there agitated within his breast feelings and emotions keenly sensitive but which were seldom if ever allowed to reflect themselves in the mirror of the countenance deeming therefore her fathers grief too sacred for intrusiontoo solemn to be broken in upon miss de medina stole back to her chamber and moistened a sleepless pillow with her tears nevertheless a gleam of light penetrated the dark clouds of grief which hung upon her mind for she had ascertained beyond all possibility of doubt that tamar was not entirely unloved by her fatherthat his heart was not a tomb in which her memory was interred for oh that heart yearned towards thee tamarlost fallen though thou wast and this conviction was an anodyne to the lacerated feelings of thy sister esther time passed onand still mr de medina remained silent respecting the matter to which the charming maiden daily and hourly hoped to hear him allude at length the trial took placeand the gallant highwayman was condemned to death oh had it not been for that terrible oathan oath from which her sire only could release heresther would have flown to console her sister at that season of her bitter grief but alas all she could do was to impart solace by means of letters and how cold is even the most fervent language of the pen when compared with that which the heart feels it should utter through the medium of the tongue tamar replied to those letters and esther was astonished to perceive that the afflicted woman wrote with a certain degree of calmnessbut she feared that it was indeed the calmness of despair a second time did mr de medina place in esthers hands a considerable sum of money telling her to use it as she thought fit and the beauteous maiden while her heart fluttered with hope and anxious expectation exclaimed in an appealing tone oh my dear fathergod grant that i do not misunderstand thy motives thou knowest that i have no need for all this gold and she requireth a sires pardon but not the aid of his pursei do noti dare not understand you esther returned mr de medina with difficulty assuming a cold tone but with tears starting into his eyesand then he hastily quitted the room esther saw how deeply he was moved and hope increasednot diminishedwithin her gentle breast then when she pondered on all her father had uttered aloud on that night when she had listened at his chamber doorand when she reflected on all his proceedings since the day of rainfords arrestshe fancied that she could fathom his motives and intentions should my deardear sister she thought within herself be left friendless and alone in the world by the hand of justice striking at the existence of him whom she lovesthen and only then will the door of the paternal dwelling be opened and a fathers arms be extended to receive the exile once more at length the fatal morning camethe morning on which rainford was to suffer and to which date we have now brought up our history on the preceding saturday tamar had written to esther to say that the hours of her bitterestmost crushing trials were now at hand and that if she survived the soulharrowing anguish then in store for her it would be only with the hope of yet finding herself restored sooner or later to the sweet companionship of her sister and also for the sake of the little boy whom rainfords kindness had adopted and who was so completely dependent upon her the moment all shall be over on monday morning added tamar in her letter my preparations to leave london will commence it is my intentionmy firm intention to proceed to america and there remainburying my woes in a strange land and devoting myself to the care of this boyuntil it may please god to move my fathers heart to recall me home let me receive a letter from thee then my beloved sister on monday morninga letter that may console me by the assurances of thy continued loveif consolation there be for me in this life let your muchcoveted communication reach me sweetest esther at about ten oclock on monday may god bless you dearestdearest esther accordingly on monday morning at about halfpast nine esther despatched a letter by a messenger to tamars lodgings in the city need we say that this epistle contained all the tender assurances of love and unvarying affection which the affectionate disposition of the jewish maiden could suggest or which were calculated to console where consolation was so difficult when the messenger whom she had gone out to hire had departed with the letter esther de medina felt too restlesstoo nervoustoo unsettled to return home again immediately the idea that one whom her sister loved had suffered an ignominious death that morning and that tamar was at that very moment crushed down to the earth by the weight of her afflictionsthis idea was more than esther could contend against she wandered listlessly aboutunmindful whither she was going and it was in this frame of mind that she suddenly heard her name pronounced she knew the voice which somewhat recalled her to herself for it was the voice of lord ellingham whose absence from home had been made known to her by means of the laconic letter which he had addressed to her father from his dungeon illustration the reader knows the restwith strange rapidity was she hurried away by the earl towards red lion street and in the house to which she was conducted she found her sister who had arrived there only a few minutes previously guided by jacob smith chapter lvii a father while the scenes related in the fiftyfifth chapter were taking place at the house in red lion street mr de medina was pacing in an agitated manner his private apartment at his own residence esther had rightly divined his thoughts and intentions he had indeed been debating in his own mind for some time past whether his duty as a father and as a man did not command him to forgive a daughter whom the hand of the lord had so severely stricken the jew thought of his wife long dead and murmured to himselfwere she alive still she would be kneeling at my feet imploring me to pardon the erring tamar and does she not now look down upon me from those empyrean heights where her sainted spirit is numbered with the blest nay more do i not see her image now kneeling before me oh can this be imagination yesit isit isand yet how like the reality mr de medina was so painfully excited that his fancy for a moment conjured up the semblance of his deceased wife as she had appeared in the pride of her loveliness long years before but when the evanescent illusion had passed away he again paced the room a prey to the most painful indecision and doubt he longed to recall tamar to his favour and yet he feared to compromise his character for firmness and decisionso strange and yet so sure it is that even in those moments when our best feelings are agitating within us to the purest and holiest ends a miserable sentiment of worldly vanity intervenes and if it do not altogether mar good deeds at least impairs the merit of their excellence by engendering hesitation wavering and delay mr de medinas conflictingbattling meditations were suddenly interrupted by a loud knock at the streetdoor and a servant shortly after announced to his master that the earl of ellingham was waiting in the drawingroom the jew remained in his chamber a few minutes to compose his countenance and collect his scattered ideas ere he descended to meet the nobleman when he entered the drawingroom he immediately saw by arthurs face that it was no visit of mere ceremonious courtesy which was now paid to that house my dear earl said mr de medina you have been lost to the world for some weeks and i must confess that when i received the letter which you did me the honour to address to me nearly a month ago i entertained fears lest business of an unpleasant nature called you thus abruptly away from england that letter my dear sir answered the earl was not precisely such an one as i should have written to you had i been free from restraint the nobleman then related in as few words as possible the outrage that had been perpetrated upon himthe imprisonment he had endured for four mortal weeksand the manner in which he had escaped mr de medina expressed his indignation and surprise at the treatment which the young nobleman had undergone and inquired if the motive could be accounted for i am totally at a loss to conjecture who were my enemies and the cause of their abominable proceedings answered the earl but let us waive that subject for the present my dear sir he continued as it is my duty to engage your attention with other and more important matters mr de medina pointed to a seat near the fire and then drew a chair for himself to within a short distance of that taken by the earl i am about to mention a name to you my dear mr de medina continued the nobleman which may perhapsnay will certainly sound unpleasantly upon your ears but you know me too well to imagine for an instant that i should thoughtlessly or wantonly give you pain i allude to thomas rainford the jew started and his countenance fell this thomas rainford mr de medina resumed arthur has wronged youwronged you deeply and not for a moment do i attempt to defend his conduct but how know you my lord that the wretched man who is now no more and against whose memory common humanity orders me not to nourish animosity mr de medina interrupted the earl in a low and solemn tone as he bent towards the jew thomas rainford lives lives ejaculated mr de medina in a voice loud with excitement and surprise hush speak lowin a whisperthe walls have ears said arthur impatiently in the name of heaven compose yourselfcalm your mind mr de medinafor i have much to communicate to youand that much of the first importance proceed my lord said the jew coldly i am all attention it is then true that rainford lives and yet scarce an hour has passed since men were crying the account of his execution for sale in the streetbeneath this very window observed mr de medina in an incredulous tone it is as true that he is now alive as that he underwent the ordeal of the terrible rope even as the pamphletvenders proclaimed beneath your window continued the earl in a word he has been resuscitated by the wondrous agency of galvanism good god my lordis this possible cried mr de medina or do my ears deceive me again i implore you to master your feelings said the earl for i have another circumstance almost equally strange to reveal to you thomas rainford is nearly related to me to youto your lordship exclaimed mr de medina yes the same father was the author of our beingthough different mothers bore us he is my halfbrotherand all the proofs thereof are in my possession nay moreand this i reveal to you to prove the confidence i place in youhe is my elder brother legitimately born and is the rightful earl of ellingham mr de medina gazed on the young nobleman in speechless astonishmentwith an amazement indeed so profound that it seemed as if he were suddenly paralysed by the announcement which had just met his ears the earl then rapidly sketched the outline of rainfords birth and without in any way alluding to lady hatfield stated that accident had brought them together and had led to the revelation of all those wondrous circumstances arthur did not however forget to mention the generous conduct of rainford in refusing to avail himself of papers which would have placed a coronet on his brow and vast estates at his disposal and also in consigning those papers to the possession of arthur himself mr de medina was perfectly astounded at all he heard and he listened in silent wondermentno longer interrupting the narrator with comment or question the earl proceeded to inform him how the whole scheme for the resuscitation of the doomed man had been arranged between himself and dr lascelles and how it had perfectly succeeded indeed added arthur i left my halfbrother just awakened from a profound sleep and though much enfeebled still beyond the reach of danger but spare me the necessity of describing to you the first moments of horrorboundless appalling horrorwhich he experienced when slowly opening his eyes he awoke to the recollection of all he had this morning gone through and to the wildest doubts as to where he was and what had actually become of him oh mr de medina it was a scene which the memories of those who beheld it nevernever could fail to retaineven though madness were to destroy the discriminating powers of the intellect but all that is passedgone by and my brother livesconscious too of resuscitated existence my dear earl said mr de medina at length breaking the long silence which had been maintained on his part i have read and heard many wildly wonderful narratives in my timetruths also far stranger than fictionsgenuine occurrences which outvie all the marvels of romance but nevernever do i firmly believe has mortal tongue related nor mortal ear listened to a history more amazingmore solemnly interesting than this should these facts ever transpire to the world and be seized upon by the novelist as the basis of a tale those who may read having been previously unacquainted with those facts would exclaim tis impossible oh what a work might be written under the title of the mysteries of london but pardon me for wasting your valuable time with these commentsi say pardon mebecause i perceive that you have more yet to relate i have indeed said the earl trembling for the success of the mission which had taken him to mr de medinas house and i am now compelled to touch upon a subject which cannot be otherwise than painful to you i understand you my lord interrupted the jew proceedfor i know that you would not refer to that topic without a wellintentioned motive such is indeed the case said the earl but not to use more words than are necessaryas time is preciousi shall at once inform you that i am acquainted with the sad episode in my halfbrothers life which relates totoyour elder daughter go on my lord said the jew mastering his emotions but not until this morningtill within an hour ago continued the earl was i aware that you possessed two daughters the moment that rainford was pronounced to be out of danger i despatched a faithful messenger to break the tidings to her who loves him and whom he loves so well but while this messenger was absent i had occasion to leave for a short time the house where thomas rainford now lies and accident led me to encounter miss esther pardon me when i state that a variety of circumstances which i will some day explain had for several weeks past induced me to believe that shewhom i now know to be an angel of purity and goodnesswas the being so dear to my brother and anxious to relieve her mind as i thought from the agony of grief into which the supposed fate of rainford must have plunged heranxious also that her presence should greet his eyes upon awaking from the deep sleep that followed the galvanic resuscitationi led herdragged her with me to the house i ere now spoke ofsaying heaven only knows what incoherent things to her as we sped along and to which i remember now she listened and replied with an amazement since explained but in the meantime jacob smiththe messenger whom i had sent to your elder daughterhad arrived with her and thusyou perceive how innocently on my partthe sisters were brought together by the bedside of my brother esther and tamar together ejaculated mr de medina starting from his seat in mingled anger and surprise then suddenly changing to an aspect of profound sorrow he murmured oh esther thine oaththine oath she did not violate it mr de medina said the earl emphatically as well might it be asserted that had you sworn never to enter my house and were you carried thither by force your vow would be wilfullywickedly broken nomiss de medina knew not whither she was goingknew not whom she was to seeknew not that her sister would be there if any one has erred in all this tis i and yet i mr de medina added the earl proudly am incapable of doing a bad deed there lives not the man who with truth could impute to me aught that i should be ashamed to have published before all the world and it is not to boast of untarnished rectitudeof a bright fameof an unsullied reputation that i now speakbut it is to convince youyou mr de medina a man of the worldyourself upright beyond all doubthonourable beyond all possibility of impeachmentit is to convince you that if i have incurred your displeasure i did not the act wantonlyand that i deserve forgiveness excellent young man exclaimed the jew grasping the earls hand and wringing it with even paternal warmth who shall dare to impute sinister motives to one like you nooh nowere all the scions of the aristocracy as noblehearted as yourselfendowed with such feelings as you possess they would be a blessing instead of a curse and a shame to this country i was unjust added mr de medina more slowlyunjust towards my beloved and amiable estherand unjust also in respect to you but oh my lord continued the jew while tears rolled down his cheeks it is hardit is hard to have the honour of ones name tarnished by a disobedient daughterand such is the lostthe unhappy tamar the best of us in this world are but poor erring sinful mortals in the eyes of him who is allperfect but who is likewise allmerciful said the earl in a solemn and impressive tone alas but a few minutes have passed since i proclaimed my rectitude vain boaster that i wasand lauded your integrity miserable flatterer that i was but i then spoke as men speakas we mortals are accustomed to estimate our characters for honour and probity nevertheless in the sight of heaven we are sinnerswretched sinners and our only hopes are in gods illimitable mercy then mr de medinaas you hope for salvation in another worldas you expect forgiveness at the hands of the almighty for those failings wherewith the very best of us are characterisedi implorei beseech you to pardon your daughter tamar gloriousalmost godlike was the enthusiasm with which the fine young nobleman urged his strong appealthe stronger for all the sincerity of the argument which prefaced it mr de medina gazed upon him with mingled wonder and admiration but when the earl had done speaking the jew turned aside and paced the room in a manner betraying the most painful agitation think not resumed arthur also rising from his seat that i am one of those wretched hypocrites who in their sickly cant make use of the holiest names and the most sacred arguments to win a cause in which they are interested only through selfish and worldly motives noi should scorn to reduce myself to such a leveli should hate myself were i capable of such contemptible duplicity it is not he who prays longest and loudest that is the most sincere but i appeal to you by all things sacredi the christian appeal to you the jewby those doctrines which form the basis of the creed in which we both put faithdoctrines which teach us the goodness of the almighty as manifested towards the israelitesby all he did for your forefathersthereby do i appeal to you to receive an erring daughter back to your arms and assure her of your pardon still mr de medina replied notbut continued to pace the room were your daughter estherthe amiable the excellent esther here continued lord ellingham she would not perhaps intercede so vainly as i during the rapid explanations which were ere now vouchsafed to me by the repentant tamar herselfexplanations which have shown me how ineffably beyond all human praise is the conduct of the younger towards her elder sisteri learnt more of the heart of woman than ever i knew before my ideasmy sentiments concerning woman and her mission here have always been of the loftiest kind but now i am led to recognise something angelicsomething heavenly in her disposition oh mr de medina had i such a sister as esther nevernever would i permit a tear to dim the brightness of her eye if it were in my power to wipe it awaynevernever would i allow a pang to steal into her gentle breast if deed or word of mine could avert it for i declare your younger daughter to be a very angel of excellence and moral worth and your entire nation should be proud of the name of esther de medina my lordmy dear earl faltered the father approaching the young nobleman and taking his hand if the jews should be proud of esther the christians may with good cause glory in their arthur of ellingham but if this must beif tamar should once more receive from me the name of daughterhow i understand you my dear friend interrupted the nobleman you would askyou would know what course is to be pursued in respect to my halfbrother the jew made a hasty sign for his companion to proceed i must confess that this difficulty struck me forcibly ere i came hither just now continued arthur my halfbrother is devotedly attached to your daughter and tamar is equally wrapped up in him to separate them in my opinion would be the height of cruelty for you to forgive your daughter and consent to allow her to dwell in concubinage with rainford are things i know to be incompatible but is there no course open to them listen to the plan which i suggested before i left those who are no doubt so anxiously waiting my return it is this tomorrow night if dr lascelles accord his permission i shall accompany my halfbrother to france whence he will proceed as soon as possible to the united states of america for in the hasty explanations which ere now took place between us all i learnt that he had already expedited thither a considerable sum of money his intention having been to proceed with tamar to the new world when his project was suddenly marred by his arrest while he is away and in safety i shall exert myself to obtain his full pardon for i shall privately represent to the minister all the circumstances of this most extraordinary case tomorrow night then we proceed to dover whence we shall embark for france tis for you and your daughters to follow us to paris and there the hands of tamar and thomas rainford may be united in the chapel of the british embassy i am well aware that it will be a protestant marriage onlythat in your eyes it may be insufficient so far as it regards the creed of your daughterbut it is the least of two evils for believe me tamar and my brother are so devoted to each other that they would never consent to separatenotamar would not quit him even to receive her fathers pardon thus they would continue to live in that state which is repugnant to the feelings of societya state unhallowed by the rites of the church but where two hearts are thus closely connected and are wedded to all intents and purposes by the mere fact of their binding affectionstell metell me does it matter much at which of gods altars the blessing of heaven shall be invoked you will pardon your daughteryou will receive her back into your armsyou will give her to one who loves her most tenderly and who has ever treated her as if she were his wifeand after the ceremony shall have been performed albeit a protestant one you may say proudly and unblushingly to those who learn that you have another daughter and who inquire concerning heryou may say fearlessly she is married mr de medina walked towards the window for a few moments to conceal his tears but he could not conceal them and with the holy dew trickling down his cheeks he turned again to the nobleman saying in a tremulous and broken voicemy friendmy dearest friend i yieldyou have subdued me it shall all be as you have designed it the earl pressed mr de medinas hand with fervent warmthwith the ardour of gratitude come with me at oncedelay not a moment exclaimed arthur his own eyes also dimmed with tears and he hurried mr de medina to the hackneycoach which was waiting at the door chapter lviii the resuscitated touching was the scene in the bedchamber at the house in red lion streetthat scene which the return of the earl of ellingham accompanied by mr de medina was to render more touching still but previously to their arrival the group was interesting and must be specially noticed rainford was seated in the bed propped up with the pillows for he still felt very weak though all danger had completely passed standing by his side with one hand locked in his was tamar clad in deep mourninga mourning now no longer necessary and which covered a heart beating with ineffable joy dr lascelles and esther de medina were also standing close by the bed and jacob smith was leaning over the footboard surveying rainford with eyes dimmed by tears and in a kind of wonderment as if he were scarcely able to convince himself of the miracle the living evidence of which was before him the hearts of all were too full for connected discourse for even the doctor himself was more moved by the incidents in which he had that day performed so prominent a part than ever he had felt before at length tamar turned towards her sister and said in a low tremulous tune do you think dear esther that lord ellingham will succeedcan you hope it i have every hope replied esther firmly his lordship suggested a plan by which all our fathers scruples may be overcome and by which we shall not be separated save for a few days tamar observed rainford i would not quit you even for an hour answered the elder sister emphatically were it not that i was previously assured of being speedily reunited to you rainford pressed her hand tenderly if my friend arthur does not succeed with mr de medina said dr lascelles i must go myself and see what i can do but i confess that i should despair of producing any effect were arthurs eloquence to fail hark cried jacob smith the front door opens the physician hastened to assure himself that no unwelcome step was approaching and the sisters exchanged looks indicative of the most acute suspense bravo cried the good doctor returning in a few moments and clapping his hands together but before he had time to give any explanation as to the cause of a joy so unusual in one of his calm and unexcitable disposition footsteps approached the room the eyes of rainford the sisters and jacob smith were anxiously cast towards the door lord ellingham entered firsthis countenance radiant with joy another momentand tamar bounded forward to meet her sire in whose arms she was immediately received oh my deardear father exclaimed tamar is it possible that you can forgive methat this happiness is not a dream let the past be forgotten my child said mr de medina pressing her again and again to his breast for now that she was forgiven all the longsmothered generosity and tenderness of his heart in respect to her revived with fresh vigour and you esther my wellbeloved he added come also and share your fathers joy that the day of pardon has at length arrived most affecting was the scene the physician pretended to be busily occupied in wiping his eyeglass but the tears fell fast upon itrainford and lord ellingham both wept aloud and jacob smith whimpered like a little child at last the party grew somewhat composed and mr de medina advanced towards the bed mr rainford he said extending his hand which the resuscitated highwayman grasped with grateful warmth to you also do i say let the past be forgotten from the very bottom of my heart do i forgive you and this forgiveness i the more readily accord because i learn that your conduct has been uniformly kind and tender towards my daughterbecause you are prepared to make her your wife according to the ritual of your creedand also because i have heard from your noble relativefar more noble in nature even than in namethat you have manifested so many proofs of an excellent heart and a generous disposition towards him that it is impossible not to admire your behaviour in this respect i have now said all that i intend to utter upon these subjects for if i be stern and severe in my displeasure i am equally sincere and profound in my forgiveness my dear earl whispered dr lascelles in the most solemn manner possible and in a tone audible only to himself and the young nobleman i did not think of asking you for any reward for all i have this day done to serve you and yours but i am so charmed with this jew who positively shows more good feeling than many christians whom i know that i would give any thing to possess a cast of his head do you think depend upon it my dear doctor i will not forget your wish said the earl smiling but you must admit that this is not precisely the time to ask a favour of so delicate a nature true observed lascelles and yet the interests of science hush said lord ellingham you will be overheard as soon as the party were sufficiently composed to deliberate upon the course now to be adopted considering the position of rainford a solemn conclave was held the results of the council may be thus summed updr lascelles feeling convinced that rainford was totally out of danger proposed to return without delay to the west end to visit his patients who would be otherwise astonished and vexed at his absence mr de medina was to repair home with his two daughters and while the young ladies made all the necessary arrangements for the trip to france their father undertook to proceed to dover and secure a sailingvessel to be in readiness by the time that lord ellingham and rainford should reach that port mr de medina would then return to london to fetch his daughters and the family would follow the halfbrothers as speedily as possible to paris on his side lord ellingham expressed his intention of remaining with rainford until the moment for their departure together should arrive jacob smith was to stay also in the house in red lion street and to accompany tom rain not only to france but also to america for the poor lad was devotedly attached to him and rainford felt it almost a duty to remove the youth from the scene of his former temptations and miseries dr lascelles accordingly quitted the house first having promised to see rainford again next day mr de medina and his daughters next took their departure tamar having taken a tender farewell of him whom she loved and whom according to present arrangements she was not to meet again until they arrived in paris as for esther ere she turned to quit the room she gave her hand to rainford who respectfully touched it with his lips at length the earl and jacob were left together with the resuscitated highwayman who now lost no time in narrating to them the particulars of his visit to that very house a few weeks previously for when on awaking from his deep sleep he was sufficiently recovered to collect his scattered ideasand when the first emotions attendant upon his meeting with tamar had passedhe had recognised the chamber in which he was lying but finding himself under the care and protection of dr lascelles whom he had seen it will be remembered in the house on the night of his memorable adventures beneath that roof he had so far mastered his surprise and momentary alarm as to maintain a profound silence relative to his recognition of the place but now that there was leisure to converse on matters of secondary importance and that she in whose breast he was fearful of exciting fears for his safety was no longer present he detailed at full length all the particulars with which the reader is acquainted not even omitting the impression existing in his mind that old death was no more then lord ellingham learnt how rainford had happened to visit the laboratory when he was disturbed by the entrance of lascelles and he also heard for the first time how his halfbrother had recovered his money with compound interest and had obtained all the private papers proving the history of his birth and the marriage of the late earl of ellingham with octavia manners jacob likewise for the first time learnt that the very house in which he then was contained the storerooms of old death and he now also ascertained the cause of that individuals sudden and mysterious disappearance arthur in his turn related the entire particulars of the outrage perpetrated upon himhis imprisonment in a dungeon for four long weeksthe reason of his writing the laconic letter which rainford had received in prisonhis escape by means of the sewersand his suspicion in consequence of all he had heard that morning from dr lascelles that the scene of his late incarceration was not altogether unconnected with the mysterious subterranean of that very house but conjecture was useless in respect to all these circumstances and the only point to which any positive decision could be arrived at was the absolute necessity that existed for defending the house from all intruders so long as rainford should remain in it jacob smith went out to purchase refreshments and rainford felt himself so well that he was enabled to make a hearty meal hour after hour passed and at length evening came arthur said tom rain breaking a silence during which he had partially dozed and now aroused by a sudden idea that had struck himarthur i have a strange fancya whim which i much desire you would gratify name it thomas returned the nobleman i should like to see the evening paper continued tom rain i need scarcely tell you that never again will the highways of this nor any other country be rendered dangerous by menever shall this right hand of mine perpetrate a crime my career as a desperate plunderer terminated this morningon the roof of the gaol from the instant of my resuscitation i date a new term of existencenew in a moral as well as in a physical sense but i should like to see what is said of me in my last moments for an instant the earl hesitatedbut only for an instant and jacob smith was sent to purchase the evening newspaper in due time he returned and rainford sate up in bed to read the account of his own execution i am glad of that he exclaimed as his eyes ran down the column headed with the awful wordsexecution of thomas rainford and his countenance became flushed with excitement as he read aloud in a tone that trembled not in the least degree a few of the sentences which seemed to give him pleasurehe underwent the dreadful process of pinioning with extraordinary couragehis footsteps were as firm as if anything save a scaffold were his destinationhe ascended the stairs leading to the roof of the prison with steps that faltered notthe same dauntless courage sustained him as he mounted the fatal ladder which conducted him to the dropnor did he once exhibit signs of fear no not even when the executioner descended beneath the platform to draw the bolt that was to launch him into eternitythus died a man who possessed a courage that would have rendered him distinguished had his destinies cast him in the profession of arms for heavens sake no more of this my dear brother exclaimed the earl painfully excited burn the paper arthur said tom rain handing it to the nobleman and then throwing himself back on his pillow i have seen enoughand never wish to read that narrative again but pardon me for having given you pain and think not it was any frivolous sentiment of vanity that made me desirous to peruse the account or that excited me as i read it i merely wished to convince myself that no injustice was done me arthur he added very seriously for of all things i abominate a coward and i confessit may be a weakness on my partthat i should not like my last moments to have been misrepresented but let us talk no more on this topicsince it gives you pain and now by way of changing the conversation i will tell you some of the plans i have shadowed out in my mind perhaps they may never be realizedi hope they may arthur had set fire to the newspaper by means of a lamp which was burning upon the table and having crushed out the expiring flames with his foot he drew his chair towards the bed to listen with attention to his halfbrother jacob smith leant over the footboard anxious to drink in the words which rainford was about to utter i have been thinking resumed this individual that my past life requires a great atonement through the medium of my new existence i am not however one of those men who turn saints and who hope to win the good opinion of the world and the favour of heaven by means of incessant prayer nomy ideas are quite at variance with such proceedings i believe that one good deed is worth ten thousand psalms it certainly is more beneficial to our fellowcreatures and must therefore be more acceptable to the almighty i have been thinking then how pleasant it would be for one who possesses an independence to employ his leisure time in seeking out those poor unhappy beings whom adverse circumstances or even their own faults have plunged into misery if they be cast down through misfortunes unconnected with errors it would be delightful to aid them but doubly pleasing must it be to reclaim those who have erred and to afford even the felon a chance of quitting his evil ways and acquiring an honest livelihood oh it wouldit would indeed ejaculated jacob smith all the adventures and incidents of his own chequered life rushing to his memory i have been reflecting moreovernot merely within the last few moments continued rainford but ever since i heard the narrative of one who became an illdoer in spite of himselflooking significantly for an instant towards the ladbut who struggled successfully at last against temptation cruel attempts at coercion and almost unheardof wretchednessi have been reflecting i say that society is wrong in refraining from the adoption of strenuous means to reform those whom it considers to be the most abandoned the reformist does not enter the criminal gaol he considers it to be useless but whither should he go if not there he should reason with himself that it is impossible for men willingly to cling to the unnaturalthe feverish excitement of a life of incessant crime if they had any chance of adopting pursuits unattended with constant peril setting aside the morality of the case ninetenths of those very persons who sing the loudest swear the hardest and appear the most depraved would gladly quit a course that makes their conscience see a constable in every shadow i think i can give you a parallel case which will fully illustrate my meaning it is the custom to vilify the irishto declare that they cling with a species of natural tenacity to their rags their dirt and their penuryto assert that they themselves are the foes to any civilizing principles which may be applied to them but look at irish labourers in englandlook at the irishman when in this country supplied with plenty of work earning adequate wages and removed from scenes of political excitement does he not work hard is he indolent does he adhere lovingly to rags and misery no such thing well then it is equally absurd to suppose that criminals cling with affection to crime prisons and an existence harassed by constant apprehensions remove the thief or the housebreaker from the sphere into which circumstances have cast him and from which he cannot extricate himselfgive him a chance of earning an honest livelihood and of redeeming his characterand in nine cases out of ten he may be reclaimed there are of course exceptions to all rules but i am convinced from all i have seen and heard that i am now speaking of a rule and not of the exceptions well then these considerations lead me back to the starting point which i chose and i repeat my former wordsthat were some man to devote himself to the visitation not only of the dwellings of the honest poor but also the haunts of crime and the abodes of vice the deep sinks of impurity and even the felons gaols themselves he would be able to effect an immense amount of good you may be surprised to hear such sentiments come from my lips i am delightedineffably delighted exclaimed lord ellingham speaking with the enthusiasm of unfeigned joy and i agree with every opinion you have put forth i see that our laws are miserably deficient while they seek only to punish and not to reformthat our legislators are shortsighted if not actually wicked in neglecting to adopt means to prevent crime by reforming the criminal rather than encourage turpitude by rendering the criminal a desperate outcast oh my dear brother cried tom rain joyfully how happy i am to hear you thus express your adhesion to those theories which i have so rapidly glanced at and are not you a legislator of englandan hereditary legislator and do you owe nothing to your country believe me when i declare that were you to apply your intellectyour talentsyour energies to this great question you would render your name so illustrious that the latest posterity would mention it with veneration and gratitude rest well assured thomas that these words of yours shall not be thrown away upon me returned arthur solemnly and on my sidehumble individual that i am and that i intend ever to remain added rainford with a significant glance towards the earl my resolution is fixed to make some atonement in another part of the world for all the bad deeds i have committed in this should i reach america in safety it will be my task to reduce to practice some of these theories which i have just now broached and i believe that the results will fulfil all my expectations there is no doubt of itoh there is no doubt exclaimed jacob smith catching the enthusiasm which now animated him who was onceand so latelya lawless highwayman but whom circumstances and the never altogether crushed sentiments of a rightly constituted mind had suddenly imbued with the hope of atoning for the past by means of the good which he meditated towards his fellowcreatures poverty is a fertile source of crime observed lord ellingham but then it is declared that many are poor only through their own idleness how are such persons to be reformed i am prepared to answer the question education will teach them the value of industry and the necessity of rendering themselves independent of parochial relief and eleemosynary assistance if a child offend we say he knows no better the uneducated individual is as ignorant of the real principles of right and wrong as the lisping child and therefore must instructionnot merely religious but an enlightened species of educationbe provided for the millions it is for you to urge those great and glorious points in the proper placein the parliament of england said rainford and i repeat posterity will honour your name i am not such a hypocrite as to deny the existence of those charms which a laudable ambition possesses returned arthur no selfish considerations will however influence me in the public course which i am now determined to adopt but i am forgetting dear thomas that this prolonged discourse on an exciting topic may be prejudicial to you weak and enfeebled as you are let us not therefore pursue the theme at present it is now growing lateand you stand in need of repose jacob and myself will watch by your bedside rainford pressed his brothers hand and composed himself to woo the advance of slumber in about ten minutes he was fast asleep the earl of ellingham was seated close by the head of the bed jacob drew a stool near the foot and the two observed a profound silence the earl looked at his watch it was halfpast ten oclock the lamp burnt upon the table suddenly slow and heavy steps were heard beneathas if some one were ascending the flight of stairs under the floor lord ellingham placed his finger upon his lips to enjoin jacob to maintain the strictest silence and then instantly extinguished the light in another moment some one was heard preparing to raise the trapdoora proceeding which arthur did not attempt to thwart he knew that if the person or persons now approaching were debarred the ingress which was sought the front door would be the alternative next essayed and he therefore resolved that come what might he would endeavour to capture and secure any intruders whose presence threatened in any way to interfere with his plans these calculations were all weighed in a single moment by the energetic and brave young nobleman the trapdoor was raised slowlythe carpet was thrust aside from the aperture by the arm of him who was ascending and a light suddenly gleamed from beneath illustration the intruder carried a lamp in his hand arthur and jacob smith maintained the most deathlike silencethe former nerved for the trying scene the latter ready to sink with apprehension on account of rainford who still slept soundly having removed the carpet from the aperturea task which occupied nearly a minute as the intruder held the lamp in his left hand and was compelled to support the trapdoor in a halfopen position with his head or back while he worked with the right handthe individualfor lord ellingham was by this time pretty well satisfied that only one person was approachingprepared to ascend into the room but the moment he had removed the carpet and advanced another step or two upwards the lamp was dashed from his hand and he was violently seized by the collar in the powerful grasp of lord ellingham who exclaimed at the same instant be silentor you are a dead man the individual thus captured uttered a low growl but said nothing then quick as thought and with a degree of strength which astonished even him who exercised it the earl dragged the man up the steps into the room but fortunately without awaking the soundlysleeping rainford all this took place amidst the most profound darkness be it remembered but acting with wonderful energy and presence of mind arthur dragged the man along the floor of the bedchamber into the laboratory and then without relaxing his hold he exclaimed jacob light the lamp and bring it hither jacob muttered the prostrate intruder jacob silence cried the earl you are in the grasp of a desperate man he added in a menacing tone but if you mean no harm you will receive no injury scarcely were these words uttered when jacob smith having hastily relighted the lamp entered the laboratory closing the door behind himfor he fully comprehended the earls motive in dragging the man whoever he might be away in the dark from the chamber where rainford was lying but hardly had the light of the lamp fallen upon the countenance of the individual who was now halflyinghalfsitting on the floor restrained by the vigorous grasp of lord ellingham who bent over himwhen jacob uttered a cry of mingled horror and alarm exclaiming as he staggered back tis old death the lamp fell from his hand and was instantly extinguished footnote mr brandon in his admirable preface to mr miless work on poverty mendicity and crime places on record the ensuing observations it is a generallyadmitted axiom that among the uneducated the human mind is more prone to evil than virtue how greatly then must vice be disseminated and the evil propensities encouraged by persons of all descriptions from the hardened murderer to the truantplaying apprentice mingling and without one admonitory antidote to check them all unemployed all uneducated in the proper school of morality the idlers tyros in crime or petty misdemeanants be they boys or adults will listen with eager curiosity to the gossiping of the old and hardened offenders while relating to each other the exploits they had achieved or when giving instruction how to escape detection in certain situations which from their own experience they have been led to conceive the best and to hear them plot fresh depredations to be committed as soon as they shall have finished the term of their captivity or be set at large upon a verdict of not guilty what but evil can arise from such a state of congregating the mind cannot fail to become contaminated in some degree even in the best disposed among them whilst others incited by the picture of pleasure they have described in the event of a successful enterprise and from the encouragement given to the growing desires by the hardened wretches enter recklessly into the path of vice as soon as they have turned their backs on the prison door future accomplices and companions of the gaol bird who had been their tutor commencing their career perhaps by a robbery planned whilst in prison minds not over strong nor sufficiently guarded by moral education are easily led astray and the very punishment they are enduring as a requital for faults committed will be used as the rudder by which they are steered to crime in persuading them that they are aggrieved victims instead of criminals paying the penalty due to offended justice this is the certain effect of the present system and to expect any thing like repentance or thorough reform in a criminal would be ridiculous in a work published some time since which is generally considered authentic the autobiography of james hardy vaux a notorious thief is the following anecdote which as it corroborates and is illustrative of the facts above stated namely that vice is taught in prison is here inserted he vaux had in a most systematic manner robbed jewellers shops and as he conceived every one of note had fallen under his lash he was at length taken up for stealing a gold snuffbox and committed to newgate where he made acquaintance with two brothers both of the same profession as his own and committed for a similar offence they were very communicative to each other and vaux discovered that there were some of his favourite shops which had escaped his notice they pointed out says the text about half a dozen shops which it appeared i had omitted to visit arising either from their making no display of their goods or from their being situated in private streets where i had no idea of finding such trades although i had little hopes of acquittal it was agreed that in the event of my being so fortunate that i should visit these tradesmen i had overlooked and i promised in case i was successful to make them a pecuniary acknowledgment in return for their information he was further instructed in what manner to proceed and what sort of goods to order and a mr belger a firstrate jeweller in piccadilly was particularly recommended to his notice as a good fiat he succeeded in getting acquitted and in robbing the shops pointed out to his notice when like a man of honour he did not fail to perform his promise to the two brothershis associates in newgate the good fiat he robbed more than once and once too often for vaux was discovered by him at last and through his instrumentality convicted footnote mr brandon has these remarks in his preface just quoted frompoverty is one of the great causes and proceeds from both public and private abuse it is the originator of minor crime when it arises from want of employment commensurate to earn sufficient to maintain a large and growing family so often to be found in the hovels of the poor of the greater offences when it is owing to idleness and a total dislike to labour of which there are but too many instances the individuals never attempting to work more days than will procure food and of that a scant portion for the family while for their particular self they make up the deficiency by a quantity of those pernicious spirits so destructive to health and become besotted the rest of their time until they are compelled to labour for a supply of provision at length work fails altogether either from a slackness in trade or the party having become too enfeebled or besotted to use proper care and exertion then with poverty staring him in the face his favourite liquor refused and he turned out of the same house in which he had squandered so much when flushed with cash he becomes half mad the inflamed state of his mind from drink adding to it and the wretches he had associated with in his boozing hours being of the worst description giving bad advice he is tempted and failsbut there are others who struggle in vain and can only get a partial employ at most who find strive to their utmost they cannot gain sufficient to drive the gaunt wolf famine from the door and are doomed to behold the wife and children of their love dearer to them than life in a state of starvationwhat wonder that they should be induced to steal food to soften the cravings of hunger and alleviate the bitter cries of the young and helpless infants parental affection is strong and what for himself a man would scorn to do for the sake of his poor and suffering child he rushes to and rather than behold his family dying in the agony of starvation he begins by robbing victuals for this he is placed in prison with a set of reckless vagabonds by whom he is taught to become as degraded as themselves and crime following crime he stops not till he rises to the acme of his profession whereas if this description of prisoners had been kept apart he would have returned to society nothing the worse for his incarcerationearly marriages are one of the great causes of poverty a folly to which the labouring classes are greatly addicted getting large families before they are enabled by their strength or abilities to maintain them dr granville made a very curious table showing the ages at which they marry and as his calculation is made upon his lyingin hospital practice which is confined to the lower classes none else taking the benefit of such institutions it is confirmatory of the fact and of the extent of this evil chapter lix the jews family in the meantime mr de medina had passed a happy afternoon in company with his two daughters and little charley watts tamar acquainted her father and sister with the generous conduct of rainford towards the boy who was accordingly fetched by a servant from the lodging which he and his adopted mother had recently occupied in the city tom rains kindness in respect to charley made a deep impression upon mr de medina who had already heard and seen enough to convince him that the seducer of his daughter possessed many good qualities especially a generosity of disposition which might have made the envy of a monarch charley had been fortunately retained in complete ignorance of the real cause of the protracted absence of him whom he called by the endearing name of father he was too young to entertain suspicions or misgivings on the subject and the excuses which tamar had constantly made to account for that absence had so far satisfied his mind that he entirely believed them although he pined for the return of rainford when he beheld tamar weep which was oftenvery oftenhe exerted himself to console her throwing his little arms round her neck and yet weeping also even when tamar with the bitterest anguish arrayed herself in deep black on the awful morning the results of which she could not have possibly anticipated she had not the heart to exchange charleys coloured garments for the mourning ones which had been prepared for him noshe threw them aside she had not strength sufficient to place before her own eyes an evidence of the dreadful loss which she deemed herself that hour to sustain the dinnertable at mr de medinas house that day was gayeroh far more gay than usual for a forgiven daughter sate at the boardand charley watts was so happy to see his dear mamma smile once more and to receive the positive assurance that he would meet his papa in a few days that it was delightful to behold his sweet countenance animated with such heartfelt innocent joy the attendance of the servants was dispensed with in order that the conversation might flow unreservedly and mr de medina felt the full amount of that pleasure which consists in pardoning as tamar experienced the ineffable happiness of being by a father pardoned and estherbeauteous amiable generoushearted estheroh she was as gay and smiling as she was ever wont to be in her girlhood ere tamars disgrace had carried sorrow into the heart of the family in the evening mr de medina bade adieu to his daughters and little charley and departed in a postchaise for dover according to the arrangements already made that night when the sisters retired to rest a touching scene occurred in esthers chamber for this amiable girl led tamar to her drawers in which she showed her all the musicbooks and the pictures that had been so religiously preserved then tamar threw herself weeping with gratitude and joy into esthers arms and delicious was the embrace of purest affection in which the sisters clasped each other oh how can i ever repay thee for so much love dearest esther murmured tamar in a tone expressive of her unfeigned sincerity by thinking of me frequently when you are far away replied esther the tears streaming from her eyes as she reflected that they were no sooner reunited than they were about to separate againfor a long long periodperhaps for ever i shall never cease to think of thee my esther answered the elder sister as she now began to set at liberty the shining masses of her rich black hair preparatory to retiring to rest for she was to share esthers bed little charley being already asleep in an adjoining chamber the door of communication being left open in case he might awakeno never shall i cease to think of thee esther repeated tamar for thou hast always manifested so much devoted affection towards meand then too she added casting down her blushing countenance thou hast endured so much for my sake oh have we not agreed that the past is to be forgotten hastily exclaimed esther for a moment desisting from the occupation of laying aside her garments the deeds that are gone should only engage our thoughts when no hope survives for the future and how much hope is there yet for you she added with an emphasis upon the pronoun tamar started and gazed steadfastly upon her sisters countenance for apart from that emphasis which was not unnoticed there seemed something mournful in the sweet liquid tones of esthers voice hope for me exclaimed tamar yesthere is hope of happiness for me and for him whom i love so tenderly but you spoke my beloved sister as if there were hope for me aloneand that there was none for you ah esther have no secret from mefor i will never henceforth refuse you my fullest confidence in the letters which i shall address to you so oftenso very often esther my sweet sisteryou love the maiden buried her countenance in tamars bosom i am not deceived continued the latter yesyou love esther and perhaps you are not loved in return but tell me all and i may counsel you esther murmured a name and as she thus whisperingly pronounced it her face was burning in its contact with tamars bosomso deeply did she blush in the confusion and shame of that confession of virgin love the earl of ellingham cried tamar echoing the name which her sister had breathed alasyes answered esther raising her beauteous countenance still suffused with the rich carnation hues of modesty i can conceal the truth from my own heart no longer but he loves another whom he can never marry added tamar and therefore my beloved sister there is hope for thee can never marry lady hatfield exclaimed esther in a tone of profound surprise rainford assured me that such is the case continued tamar i am not aware of the reason because he did not volunteer an explanation and it never has been my habit to question him respecting affairs on which he has not spoken freely of his own accord but this much i can assure youthat lady hatfield and the earl of ellingham will never be united and that they no longer entertain even the idea of such union do not therefore perplex yourself relative to the cause of their severance my darling esther but nourish hopefor oh it is delicious to feed love upon the manna of hope and believe me the earl of ellingham already surveys you with so much admirationalready entertains so exalted an opinion of your characteralready looks upon you with such respect that he cannot fail to experience feelings more tender still o tamar talk not thusi may not listen to thee exclaimed esther with fluttering heart and swelling bosom for model of purity and innocence as she was the words of her sister excited pleasurable sensations within her breast and thus ever is it with the most chaste most virtuous and most unsophisticated maiden who loves for the first time naydo not compel me to keep silence on a topic which iswhich must be dear to your soul my esther said tamar were human beings to feel shame at loving there would not be an unblushing cheek in the whole world save amongst children sooner or later dear sister every one must feel the influence of that passion which spares no one oh cold and cheerless indeed would this world be were not the hearts of those who have grown up and who have cast aside the frivolities of childhood warmed and irradiated by the beams of love feel not ashamed then dearest esther on account of this passion which has so imperceptibly stolen upon thee but after all you have said tamar returned the coy and bashful maiden i shall not be able to meet the earl again without blushing and thenwere i mad enough to indulge in such a hope as you would have me nourishremember the difference of our creeds was it not the earl himself who suggested the means by which matrimonial rites could be celebrated between his own halfbrother and myself demanded tamar eagerly yes replied esther every feature of her fine aquiline countenance deriving additional charms from the crimson hues which mantled on that splendid face and spread themselves over her arching neck her gracefully sloping shoulders and the rich contours of her virgin bust which in the presence of her sister no invidious drapery now concealedyes tamar she replied but there are otheroh and far more important considerations consider how exalted is the rank of that great noblemanand consider also she added in a mournful tone how much our race is still despised even in this land which boasts of an almost consummate civilisation the earl of ellingham i feel convinced despises such absurdsuch pitiful prejudices said tamar labouring only to render her sister happy by means of joyous hope as an enlightened man he must recognise how deeply his country is indebted in respect to its wondrous prosperity to the commercial enterprise and the financial skill of our nation moreover do we not believe in the same god for the almighty whom the christians worship is the same who brought our forefathers out of egypt and gave them the promised land in a word my beloved esther arthur of ellingham is too nobleminded a being to despise you because you cling to the creed in which you were brought up and something tells me that my sister is destined to become the countess of ellingham esther sighed but made no response tamar continued to discourse in the same inconsiderate strain for several minutes she was actuated by the most generous motives towards her sister but in the enthusiasm of her affection and gratitude she forgot that she might only be exciting hopes destined never to receive a fulfilment and encouraging a passion which after all was perhaps doomed to experience the bitterness of disappointment at length esther turned towards her and exclaimed hastily tamarif you love me speak on this topic no more it may be false shame on my partbut it seems to me that it is unmaidenly thus to discourse on a subject in which one who is separated from me by so wide a gulf is concerned alas deeply do i regret that in a moment of weakness i admitted aloud that which my heart had not hitherto dared to whisper even to itself i should have exercised more command over myself oh i have been foolishvery foolish to permit such a thought even to assume the faintest shape in my imagination but we will abandon the topicand again i say tamarif you love me renew it not there was a minutes pause at the expiration of which esther began to converse gaily and rapidly on tamars future prospects in the clime to which it was contemplated that herself and rainford were to proceed and the amiable girl communicated to her sister all that she had read concerning the united states of north america this little manuvre on the part of esther was to change the topic of discourse and tamar did not attempt to renew a subject which offended the maiden pride of her sister oh happy was tamar to sleep beneath her fathers roof that nightto know to feel that she was in the parental dwelling again when she awoke once while it was yet dark she fancied that she had been dreamingso strange did all the incidents of the preceding day appear to beso truly incredible but as she stretched out her arms they encountered the form of her sister and thenin the silence and obscurity of the nighttamar joined her hands and prayed ferventlyfar far more fervently than she had prayed for some years past and christian darest thou believe that the prayers of the despised jewess were not wafted with thine own to the throne of the eternal chapter lx sir christopher blunts domestic hearth it was the morning following the incidents just related and the scene changes to the house of sir christopher blunt in jermyn street the worthy knight and his lady were seated at breakfast the table literally groaned beneath the weight of the cold viands placed upon it for the exladysmaid was particularly addicted to good things and she moreover thought that it was quite the rage to see cold fowls ham tongue perigord pie and all kinds of marmalades spread for the morning repast lady blunt was in her glory of premeditated negligence and studied deshabille she was arrayed in a peagreen silk wrapper trimmed all down the front with scarlet bows and the cape was braided with the same glaring hue so much affected by a certain lady of babylon her cap was decorated with ribands likewise of scarlet and she wore red slippers her appearance was indeed most flaming as she lolled in delightful lassitude in a capacious easy chair with her foot upon an ottoman a stranger would have thought that so fine a lady could not possibly touch any thing more substantial than a thin slice of toast or half a muffin for her breakfast but she had in reality paid her respectsand with a good will alsoto every dish upon the table sir christopher was seated opposite to her looking like a fish out of water for in order to please his dear wifeor rather to have a little peace and quiet in the househe had consented to adorn his person with a light blue dressinggown fastened by a gold cord and huge tassels at the waist and a pair of bright red trowsers large and loose like a dutchmans moreover a scarlet silk cap with a long gold tassel was perched airily over his left ear so that altogether he seemed as if he were dressed out to enact the part of a turk at a masquerade shall i cut you a leetle slice more ham my love enquired sir christopher in a mincing tone as if he were afraid of receiving a box on the ears for not speaking civilly enough no sir christopher answered the lady sharply you shant send me a leetle ham as you call it i dont like the hamand thats flat and yet my lovethat is my dear remonstrated the knight gently and yet what demanded his wife i think i had the pleasure of helping you three times my love added sir christopher astonished at his own boldness in uttering the words the moment they had escaped his lips three times ejaculated the lady turning as red as her ribands or as her husbands trowsers and if i like to be helped six timesor nine times sir christopherwhat should you say then well my lovei should say what should you say again asked the lady assuming a menacing attitude why my lovethat you had a very good appetite responded the knight looking as miserable as if he expected eight finger nails to fasten on his cheeks the very next moment i have no appetite sir christopher cried the lady in a petulant tone as she sank back again into her lounging attitude three miserable bits of ham and a trifle of cold pie with may be a taste of the chicken and just one cut out of the tongue and two eggs my love suggested sir christopher meekly welland two tiny eggs continued the ladyi am sure all that doesnt say much for ones appetite why when i was at lady hatfields i used to eat three great rounds of breadandbutter crustinesses and all but you are no longer at lady hatfields my angel said sir christopher simpering you are with one who adores youwho has given you his namea name i flatter myself that carries weight with it in certain quarters although when i did so far forget myself as to put up for portsoken now sir christopher pray let us have none of that nonsense if you please interrupted lady blunt in a tone and with a manner which showed that she knew full well she should be obeyed i cant abear to hear even the word alderman mentioned ever since a lady i lived with once in the city talked something about the guildhall policecourt when she missed the silver spoons my dear my dear said sir christopher you forget that you are now lady blunt pray let us change the topic well so we will she cried sharply and ill tell you what well talk about what my best love asked the knight your best love almost shrieked the lady then you must have other loves if im your best oh sir christopher was it to hear this that i gave up every thingall my prospects in lifeto become yours my dear girl said the knight meekly i most humbly submit to you that i do not think you had so very much to give up when i asked you to become lady blunt what do you call a good place and being my own mistress nothing to give up cried charlotte twentyfour guineas ayear and the chance of marrying a duke or a prince wellwell my love we will not dispute said the knight who in his heart wished to god that she never had given up the prospects she spoke of or that she had married some duke or princein which latter case sir christopher would not have envied either his grace or his royal highness after the trifling experience he had already enjoyed relative to the fair ones temper noi should think you would not dispute either sir christopher cried the vixen tossing her head but i was going to tell you what we would talk about when you interrupted me so rudely i was going to say that i do not approve of that hamor yet the chickenor yet the tongue and i do not mean to have my breakfast spoilt in this way ring the bell sir christopher my dearest charlotte ring the bell sir christopher repeated the lady in a still more authoritative tone as she looked daggersnay regular bayonetsat her miserable husband the knight rang the bell accordingly gulping down a sigha very profound sighat the same time a footman answered the summons john said the mistress of the house yes my lady was the reply tell mrs bodkin to step upimmediately added the wife of sir christophers rash choice yes my ladyand the footman disappeared thanking his stars that he was not in for itthe bad humour of his mistress being very evident indeed in due time mrs bodkin made her appearance in the shape of a stout matronlylooking female of a certain age as a housekeeper ought to befor mrs bodkin was neither more nor less than that high female functionary in the establishment mrs bodkin said lady blunt endeavouring to distort her really pretty face into as stern an expression as possible yes my lady returned the housekeeper that ham is detestable mrs bodkin indeed my lady the cold fowls abominable sure now my lady and the tongue frightful lawkadaisyyour ladyship dont say so i do say so though mrs bodkin cried sir christophers better half and i just tell you what it isi dont mean to have my breakfast spoilt in this way and if you cant find tradesmen wholl supply good things why please your ladyship interrupted the housekeeper quite astounded at these accusations against comestibles which she knew to be excellent mr smuggs who sent in the ham and tongue is purveyor to his majesty and then if his majesty chooses to put up with mr smuggss rubbish lady blunt will not exclaimed the mistress of the house glancing indignantly first at the petrified mrs bodkin and then at the dumbfounded sir christopher there was as romancists say an awful pause mrs bodkin knew not whether she were standing on her head or her heels sir christopher was in an equally strange state of bewilderment as to whether he had heard aright or was labouring under a delusion and lady blunt was triumphant in the impression she had evidently made upon her audience but my dear angelmy love at length stammered the knight surely you will notthat is you cannoti appeal to you my sweet as a woman of sound judgment sound fiddlestick sir christopher interrupted her ladyship contemptuously i know what i am saying and i mean what i say mrs bodkin i order you once for all not to deal no more at smuggss and if you cant choose good things youd better pack up your things and go about your business now it happened that mrs bodkin had managed during long years of servitude and by rigid economy to scrape together a very comfortable independence and feeling that she was independent she did not choose as she afterwards observed to a friend to put up with any of missuss nonsense go about my business eh she accordingly exclaimed well maamthe sooner i do that the better i think for since i cant give saytisfaction here id much rayther resign at once resign echoed lady blunt again turning red as her ribands yes maam continued the housekeeper resign i said and you ought to know thats the right wordfor i blieve you wasnt always used to sit in the parlour oh you wretch exclaimed lady blunt now manifesting a violent inclination to go off into hysterics sir christopher can you sit there and hear me insulted by that owdacious woman turn her out of the house sir christopherlet her bundle neck and crop this minute i rayther think theres no need for bundling in the matter said the indignant mrs bodkin sir christopher is too much of a gentleman to illtreat me after being eleven years in his service come next aperil but i dont require no favours at your hands maamleastways i wouldnt except them if they was offered and in a most stately manner mrs bodkin walked out of the room leaving the door wide open behind her sir christopher exclaimed lady blunt bursting into tearsbut tears of rage and not shame yes my love said the knight who was rendered so nervous by this scene that he appeared to be labouring under incipient delirium tremens youre a brute sir christopher cried the angel in the peagreen wrapper and the red bows my dearmy love stammered the knight it was not my faultyou brought it on yourselfi really think oh i did did i screeched charlotte and unable to control the fury of her passion she darted upon sir christopher adown whose cheeks the marks of her nails were in another moment rendered most disagreeably visible lady blunt vociferated the miserable man struggling to extricate himself from the power of the fury there now ive taught you not to nag me on another time said charlotte throwing herself back into her chair already sorry and ashamed for what she had done but too deeply imbued with vulgar and meanspirited pride to manifest the least proof of such compunction sir christopher wiped his bleeding face with his cambric pockethandkerchief but his heart was too full to speak he felt all the indignity which he had just sustainedand yet he had not courage enough to resent it the embarrassment of the newlymarried pair was relieved or rather interrupted by a loud and unusually long double knock which at that moment awoke every echo not only in the house itself but also halfway up jermyn street a few minutes elapsed and then the footman entered the breakfastparlour to announce to sir christopher that a gentleman who had been shown into the drawingroom wished to speak to him immediately upon most urgent business at the same time the servant placed upon the table a card bearing the name of captain oblunderbuss tell the gentleman ill be with him in a moment john said sir christopher the servant bowed and retired do you know who he is asked lady blunt no i do not responded the knight more sulkily than he had ever yet dared to speak to his wife come now sir christopher exclaimed her ladyship dont have any of your illhumours with me because i cant abear them say youre sorry for what youve done and ill not only forgive you but also patch your face for you with diakkulum plaster come nowdo what i tell you and as her ladyship seemed to examine her finger nails as she spoke in a manner which portended her readiness to make another onslaught the miserable husband muttered a few words of abject apology for an offence which he had not committed and the amiable charlotte vouchsafed a pardon which she should rather have besought than bestowed then there was a little fondor rather foolish kissing and hugging and this farce being concluded the lady hastened to fulfil her promise relative to the diachylon plaster when this operation was likewise ended sir christopher cast a rueful glance into the lookingglass over the mantel and never did a more miserable wight see reflected a more woefully patched countenance the wretchedness depicted on that face apart from the long slips of plaster stuck upon the cheeks contrasted in a most ludicrous fashion with the absurd splendour of the knights morning attire and to use a common phrase he wished himself at the devil as he wended his mournful way to the drawingroom chapter lxi captain oblunderbuss captain oblunderbuss was a gentleman of irish extraction and according to his own account possessed of vast estates in the emerald island but it was evident to all his friends that the rents were very irregularly paid inasmuch as their gallant proprietor was frequently under the necessity of soliciting the loan of a guinea and when he could not obtain that sum his demand would suddenly drop to halfacrown or even eighteenpence but whenever the captain talked of his estates no one ventured to suggest a doubt relative to their existence for the gallant officer was a notorious duellist having been engaged as principal in thirtyseven of those pleasant little contests and as second in ninetytwo more he was about fortyfive years of age and of exceedingly fierce appearance his crown was entirely bald but huge bushes of red hair stuck out between his temples and his earsenormous whiskers of the same meteoric hue and portent covered half his faceand a formidable pair of moustaches red also curled ominously over his upper lip the ends being twisted and greased so as to look like two small tails in person he was tall thin but not illmade he held himself particularly upright and as he wore a military undress coat all frogged and braided in the polish fashion and grey trousers with red stripes down the legs he really looked like what he called himself and was called by othersnamely a captain but he was not wont to be more explicit relative to his military services than he was definite concerning the locality of his estates no one knew and assuredly no one ever ventured to ask him to what regiment he had belonged he stated himself to be unattached and that was sufficient we should as faithful chroniclers observe that it had been whisperedbut then scandal is so rife in this wicked worldthat captain oblunderbuss was never in the army at all and that his formidable name was merely an assumed one and the newsmongers who propagated these reports behind the gallant gentlemans back not only ridiculed the idea of his estates but actually carried their malignant spite so far as to insinuate that he was once the driver of a jauntingcar in dublin and at that period bore the name of teddy oflaherty be all this as it may it is nevertheless very certain that captain oblunderbuss was a great man about townthat he was nodded to by loungers in the parkshaken hands with by dandies in bond streetand invariably chosen as a second in every duel that took place on wormwood scrubs wimbledon common or battersea fields such was the terrible individual who was standing on the rug in a most ferocious attitude when sir christopher blunt entered the drawingroom the captain desisted from twirling his moustaches and indulged in a good long stare at the knight whose halfludicrous halfdoleful appearance was certainly remarkable enough to attract an unusual degree of attention you resayved my carrd sir christopher blunt said the captain speaking in a strong irish accent and rattling the r in a truly menacing manner yes siri received the card of captain oblunderbuss replied sir christopher not knowing what to think or make of his strange visitor and sure im capthain obluntherrbuss exclaimed the military gentleman twirling his moustache and ive come on the parrt of my friend capthain morthauntan honourrable man sirr christopher blunt added the gentleman emphatically looking awfully fierce at the same time just as if the unfortunate knight entertained the idea of questioning the honour of captain mordaunt iive no doubt of it sir stammered the intimidated blunt looking more wretched in proportion as the tone of his visitor became more excited by the powerrs im glad ye dont doubt it cried the captain or youd find yerself desayved in yer man well sirr christopher the short and the long of the affair is just thismy friend capthain mordaunt feels himself aggraved on behalf of his sistherr and hes put the little business into my hands to manage forr him im convinced that captain mordaunt could not have chosen a better friend captain oblunderbuss said the knight scarcely able to utter a word so sorely was he oppressed by vague alarms but i hopethat is i mean iin a word what do ye mane demanded the captain advancing a pace or two towards the knight oh nothingonly stammered sir christopher dodging round the table for fear that the formidable oblunderbuss intended an attack upon him only what man vociferated the captain sure now ye dont think im afther ayting ye up nooh no im not afraid of any gentleman eating me exactly observed sir christopher but if you would state the object of your visit be jasus and thats soon done exclaimed captain oblunderbuss the shorrt facts is thesecapthain morthaunt is mightily attached to his sistherr miss julia whos a most amiable ladyfor ive jist been breakfasting with herr and herr brother at their lodgings in half moon street miss morthaunt as perrhaps you are aware returned home to her fathers mansiona sweet place by the bye in connamarrrawhen you desayved her in the most grossthe most infamous manner by running away with a ladysmaid instead of her dear self captain oblunderbuss said sir christopher she of whom you speak is now lady blunt and much good may she do ye sir christopher exclaimed the captain but as i was saying miss morthaunt comes back to london again smarrting under the influence of her wrongs which her brother has resolved to avenge and therefore sir christopher youll be so good as jist to say whether it shall be on worrmwood scrrubs or wimbledon common and well be there punctual tomorrow morning at eight oclock the worthy knight looked perfectly aghast he began to understand the real drift of captain oblunderbusss visit and he entertained the most unmitigated abhorrence of the mere idea of a duel well sir christopher say the worrd resumed the gallant gentleman with as much unconcern as if he were making arrangements for a party of pleasure but perrhaps yed like to consult a frindor referr me to him thats the best way leave it to your frind and me and well settle everything so comfortable that youll not have the least throuble in the worrld you can get your breakfast a thrifle earlier than usual breakfast echoed sir christopher in a deep sepulchral tone breakfastwhen one is going out to be shot at be the powerrs and why not demanded the warlike captain but here we are wasting our precious time while we ought to be settling the little business and thrying the pisthols at the gallery the pistols groaned sir christopher his visage lengthening most awfully and his underjaw completely dropping through intense alarm be jasus and what would ye fight with if it isnt pisthols cried the captain but pistolspistols are so apt totokill people observed the knight shaking from head to foot is it afraid ye are demanded captain oblunderbuss twirling his moustache as he surveyed sir christopher with cool contempt i do not admit such an imputation answered the knight but i will not fight with this madcap mordaunt the law shall be my protection i am my own masteri married whom i choseand i will not be bullied by any man living the astonishment depicted on the countenance of captain oblunderbuss as these words met his ears was mistaken by the knight for a feeling of apprehension and thus he had grown bold or at least energetic in his language as he had proceeded yes sir he added emphatically the law shall protect me is it shirrking that ye mane asked the captain because if it is i shall feel myself bound to administer a dacent drubbing to ye sir christopher why sirits a rale insult to me to refuse to fight with my frind and as he uttered these words the captain advanced in a menacing fashion towards the knight keep off sir dont attempt violence against me exclaimed sir christopher blunt rushing towards the fireplace to seize the poker ill not stand it captain oblunderbussi have been a sheriff in my timei once put up for portsokenand ill not submit to any insult then name your frind sir thundered the gallant officer orr ill not lave a whole bone in your skin welli will i will ejaculated sir christopher anxious to get rid of his fireeating visitor on any terms go to my nephew mr frank curtis he has killed his man often enoughaccording to his own account be the powerrs that jist suits me to a tay exclaimed the captain for may be he and me could jist amuse ourselves with an exchange of shots afther you and my frind morthaunt have settled your own small thrifle t would be a perfect godsend to me and ive no doubt your nevvy will be of the same mind where does he hang out sir christopher hastily mentioned the address of mr frank curtis and captain oblunderbuss stalked away hugely delighted at the idea of being about to form the acquaintance of a gentleman every way so worthy of his friendship as the knights nephew appeared to be fierce indeed was the aspect of captain oblunderbuss as he marched through the streets to the address indicated by the knight and to the great joy of the military gentleman he found on his arrival that mr frank curtis was at home but hes not up yet sir said the sprucelooking tiger who opened the front door at which the captain had given one of his tremendous double knocks never mind my boy exclaimed the visitor in an aweinspiring tone your masther will be glad to see me or im mightily desayved what name shall i say sir inquired the tiger faith and ill just take my name up along with me my lad returned the captain which floor may it be now first floor sirand the bedrooms at the back by jasus youre a smarrt lad and a credit to your masther exclaimed the captain the next time i come ill make ye a present of sixpence and with these words captain oblunderbuss marched up stairs on reaching the landing he knocked at the backroom door with his fist as if he were practising how to fell an ox and to this peremptory summons an invitation to come in was returned the captain accordingly stalked into the chamber where mr frank curtis was breakfasting in bed a table well spread being drawn up close by the side of his couch be jasus i knew you was a boy afther my own heart ejaculated the captain as he caught sight of a bottle of whiskey which stood near the teapot then closing the door he advanced up to the bed and pulling off his buckskin glove said misther curtis heres my hand tip us yours my boyand lets know each other without any more pother mr frank curtis accepted the proffered hand with delight for the amiable deportment of the visitor now relieved his mind from the vague fears that had been excited in it by the unceremonious entry and ferocious appearance of the captain and how are ye misther curtis continued this gentleman drawing a chair close to the bed and depositing his gloves in his hat and his hat on the table quite blooming old fellow thankee returned frank to whom all this familiarity was by no means displeasing but what will you take shall i ring for another cup and plate or will you take a dram of the whiskey the potheen my boythe potheen for me exclaimed the captain grasping the bottle youll find it rather good i fancy said curtis my friend the russian ambassador sent it round last night with his best respects and my respects to him and to you both cried the captain then having drained his glass he drew a long breath and said be jasus thats some of the right sorrt help yourself then old fellow said frank in as free and easy a manner as if he had known his visitor all his life i can get plenty more where that came from old brandyokouski the polish ambassadors butler has had orders to give me the entire run of his masters cellar for me and his excellency are as thick as two thieves he is pestering me from morning to night to dine with him no wonther misther curtis interrupted the captain for youre the most agreeable jintleman ive the honour to be acquainted with and whats your name old boy asked frank as he proceeded with his breakfast captain oblunderbuss at your service my dear frind was the answer while the individual who gave it helped himself to another glass of the whiskey which was certainly the best that the stilton cheese round the corner could supply delighted to form your acquaintance captain exclaimed curtis suddenly becoming a trifle less familiarfor the name was well known to him in connexion too with the notoriety of a duellist and might i inquire what business oh well talk about that presently interrupted the captain your uncle sirr christopher blunt recommended you to me in the strongest terrmsthe most flatterring terrms i may say indeed ejaculated mr curtis with unfeigned surprisefor he had not seen nor spoken to the knight for some weeks be the powerrs he gave you a splindid charracter misther curtis cried captain oblunderbuss and it was quite longing to know ye i was but well talk on business presently im in no hurryand well have a cozie chat first may be my name is not altogether strange to ye by no means answered curtis now thoroughly convinced that the object of his new friends visit was altogether of an amicable character i have heard of your renown and must say that i have envied it but ive done a little in the same line myselfchiefly in france though ill be bound the name of the marquis of soupemaigre is not unknown to you yesive heard spake of it returned the captain helping himself to another glass of whiskey wellthe duke and me fought with small swords for three hours one morning continued frank and at length i managed to scratch the little finger of his left hand in france you know a duel always ends when the first blood is drawn and so the count flung away his sword acknowledged that id beat him and weve been bosom friends ever since give me your hand my broth of a boy exclaimed the captain i was not desayved in you youre as fine spirited as your potheen why be the powerrs youre a confirrmed duellist to be sure and i have killed my man too responded frank delighted to perceive that he had made a deep impression on his companion there was the famous spaniard you knowwhat was his name again oh ah don juan stiletto del guerilla he was a dreadful fellowthe terror of all paris where he was staying when i was also there well one eveningit was at the kings fancyballthis portuguese fellow gave himself such airs that there was no bearing him he insulted all the gentlemen and smirked at all the ladies at length the archbishop of paris who was in full canonicals appealed to me to put down the insolent italian i undertook the taskand picked a quarrel with him in no time the ladies all looked upon me as one devoted to death and though i say it who shouldnt a great deal of tender sympathy was shown towards me well next morning me and the german met on the very top of montmartre and in a quarter of an hour my gentleman was weltering in his blood that affair won for me the love of the beautiful countess of dunkirkbut she is gone down to the tomband i am left behind to mourn her loss and mr frank curtis took a large bite of a muffin doubtless to subdue the sigh which rose to his lips at this sad reminiscence be the holy pokerr its a touching business cried the captain who had by this time fully seen through the mendacious braggadocio of mr frank curtis and had come to the conclusion that he was as great a coward in reality as his uncle but the gallant captain oblunderbuss did not choose to suffer the young gentleman to perceive that he understood him as the whiskey was too much to his taste to allow him to lose the chance of emptying the bottle by a too precipitate rupture frank firmly believing that all his fine stories were taken as gospel by his visitor rattled away in his usual styleheaping lie upon lie at such a rate that had his falsehoods been mountains the piling thereof would have outdone the feats of titan with ossa and pelion at length the captain began to thrust in a few words edgeways as the contents of the bottle got lower and lower your uncle misther curtis seems a nice old jintleman his face was rarely plasthered this mornin as if hed been in the warrrs a thrifle or so perhaps his wife had been giving him a taste of her claws said frank with a coarse giggle be saint pathrick and thats just what struck me exclaimed the captain shes a very devil i know continued frank but i say old fellowwhat little business was it that took you to old sir christophers and made him refer you to me illustration is it the little business cried the captain och and be jasus then its jist that affair of my friend morthaunt who manes to shoot sir christopherr tomorrrow morrrning before breakfast shoot sir christopher ejaculated frank apparently more surprised than annoyed or else jist get shot himself be the powerrs added captain oblunderbuss and its becase its myself thats morthaunts frind sir christopher has referred me to you as his frind then its a regular duel said frank opening his eyes wider and wider the purtiest little affair i ever had a finger in misther curtis responded the captain now looking tremendously fierce for although he had imbibed at least a pint of pure spirit without experiencing the least inconvenience in respect to his brain the effects were nevertheless apparent in an awful rubicundity of countenance the purtiest little affair certainly he continued and it now only remains for you and me jist to settle the placetime being of courrse in the mornin at eight and do you mean to say that my old uncle has agreed to fight this duel with captain mordaunt inquired frank be jasus its for you to bring him to the scratch misther curtis or else or else what demanded the young gentleman oppressed by a vague presentiment of evil or else be the holy pokerr you must fight me returned captain oblunderbuss twirling his moustache in the coolest and calmest manner possible fight you ejaculated frank turning ashy pale as a matther of courrse answered the captain a famous duellist like misther curtis cant be at a loss on a point of honour but why the devil should i fight you demanded the young gentleman his heart palpitating audibly why the devil shouldnt ye vociferated captain oblunderbuss answer me that my frind my dear sirits reallyi mean youthat is to say i think with all due deference stammered frank growing every moment more and more alarmed be jasus ive said nothing i dont mane to stick to exclaimed the martial gentleman now assuming an expression of countenance so fierce that frank curtis began to have serious misgivings that his visitor intended to assault him then and there but my dear captainthis proceeding said frank assuming a tone of excruciating politeness is going on beautifully misther curtis and so as you seem to have a little delicacy in putting yourself too forrward in the matther continued the captain well jist say battersea fields tomorrow mornin at eight oclock good bye misther curtis with these words the captain took up his hat and stalked majestically out of the room banging the door violently after him frank curtis fell back in his bed and gave vent to his feelings in a deep groan the door opened again with a crash and the captain thrust in his inflamed visage exclaiming yell remember misther curtis that i hould ye responsible in this matther and that if ye cant bring the uncle to the scratch ye must come yourself or be jasus ill be afther ye to the inds of the earrth the head was withdrawn again and the door once more slammed violently frank curtis gave a hollow moan thrust himself down in the bed and drew the clothes over his face as if to shut out some dreadful spectre from his sight chapter lxii franks embarrassments thus remained mr frank curtis for some minuteseach moment expecting that the bedroom door would again open and that the voice of the terrible irishman would once more convey some hideous menace to his ears but captain oblunderbuss had fairly departed this time and at length the miserable young man slowly pushed down the clothes and glanced timidly round the room it was no dreamas for an instant he had endeavoured to make himself believe that it was for there was the chair in the very place where the captain had satethere also was the bottle which the captain had condescended to empty a duel groaned frank in a sepulchral voicehe who had fought so many in imagination then he remembered that there existed a means of averting all danger from himself and elated by the sudden thought he leapt nimbly from his bed with the affectionate intention of proceeding forthwith to his uncle and compelling the old gentleman to go forth and be shot at whether by captain mordaunt or captain oblunderbuss frank did not care a fig having hastily dressed himself the young gentleman hurried off to jermyn street and on his arrival he was surprised to find the knights travellingcarriage at the door while the servants were busily employed in piling up portmanteaus and hatboxes and bandboxes and carpetbags halloa cried frank to jeffreys the groom who was in the act of hoisting one of the aforesaid articles of luggage to another servant who stood upon the roof of the vehicle what does all this mean means travelling mr frank responded the domestic the order was given in a violent hurryand so i havent a moment to spare but heres master and her ladyship and sure enough sir christopher and lady blunt made their appearance at that instant the former enveloped in his great coat and with a silk handkerchief tied round all the lower part of his faceand charlotte muffled in a splendid cloak i say sir christopher cried frank this wont do at any price you know what wont do sir demanded the knight in a stern tone now then jeffreysdown with the steps yes sirand the steps were lowered accordingly frank stood aghast as he saw the knight hand his better half into the carriage and the said better half pouted up her really pretty mouth in a disdainful manner as she passed the forlorn youth sir christopher was about to follow her into the vehicle when frank suddenly seized him by the skirts of his great coat exclaiming you shant sneak off in this manner you shall stay toto to what growled sir christopher from the depths of the silk handkerchief which came up to his nose to be shot at returned frank almost driven to desperation the lady inside uttered a screamsir christopher gave a desperate groan and breaking away from his nephew rushed into the carriagejeffreys put up the steps and banged the doorand the vehicle rolled away leaving curtis standing alone on the pavement the very picture of the most ludicrous despair what was to be done now the formidable captain oblunderbuss held himyes himfrank curtisanswerable for the appearance of sir christopher blunt on the field of battle otherwisebut the alternative was too dreadful to think of what then was to be done frank saw the impossibility of nerving himself so as to encounter the desperate fireeater and yet he knew that the captain would find him out even if he removed his abode from the westend to west smithfield yet something must be doneand that speedily for it was now two oclock in the afternoonand next morning at eight the captain would expect him at the place of appointment an idea struck frankhe would go and consult mr howard the attorney to that gentlemans offices he accordingly repaired composing himself by the way as well as he could so as not to express by his countenance the alarms which agitated within his breast mr howard was disengaged and gave him an immediate audience well i hope youre satisfied now that you hanged that poor fellow yesterday morning said frank as he took the chair to which the solicitor pointed it was a duty which i owed to society returned howard laconically as if the subject were not altogether a pleasant one what an idea ejaculated frank but however it is done and cant be undone after all he was a brave fellowa man just such as i could have admired barring the highway part of his calling and now you who are such a stickler about duties to society and so onsuppose you heard for instance that a duel was going to take place between some friends of yours and another partyof course youd do all you could to stop ityoud go to bow street and youd give private information concerning the where and the whenor perhaps youd speak openly and get the persons bound over to keep the peaceeh i should not do anything of the kind answered howard who already began to suspect that mr frank curtis had some special reason of his own for speaking with so much earnestnessindeed with such an air of appeal as he now displayed you wouldnteh exclaimed frank grievously disappointed at the illsuccess of his little manuvre and why not because i should only lose my time for nothing responded mr howard the devil then did you get tom rain hanged because the prosecution put money into your pocket demanded frank did you merely come to chatter with me or on business asked the lawyer evasively if the former i am busyif the latter make haste and explain yourself wellthe fact is continued frank now feeling certain that the entire affair of tom rains prosecution was a very sore subject with the lawyerthe fact is i wanted to speak to you about a little matterin which my precious old uncle has placed me in a complete fixnot that i care about a duel you knowid see a duel damned first before id care for itstill still you would rather not fight it observed mr howard with a slight curl of the lip you see my dear fellow proceeded curtis that i have so many affairs of my own to attend to i really cannot undertake to conduct those of other people theres my marriage with mrs goldberry coming off in a few daysand now bother to it up starts this duelbusiness do explain yourself frank exclaimed howard impatiently well i willand in a few words too it seems that captain mordaunt has taken a tiff at my uncles conduct towards his sister and so he sends captain oblunderbuss captain oblunderbuss eh ejaculated the attorney now becoming suddenly interested in the narrative of mr curtis yes a terriblelooking wild irishman returned this young gentleman but he didnt frighten me thoughi should think not do you know him only by name answered mr howard coolly as he glanced at a suspiciouslooking slip of parchment that lay upon his desk but go on well this oblunderbuss it appears goes to my uncle who refers him to menaturally enough seeing that i am pretty well experienced in all matters of duelling pursued frank so the captain calls on me a couple of hours ago and we discuss the business in a very friendly way every thing is settled pleasantly enough but before the captain takes his leave i catch hold of him by the button and let him know that if he fails to produce his principal on the ground tomorrow morning after all the trouble entailed on me i shall hold him answerable accordingly the captain looks rather glum at that because i did tumble down upon him a little unexpectedly with my threat however he agrees and we separate but lo and behold i go to sir christopher to tell him how comfortably i have settled the whole business for himand he is gonefledboltedmizzledcut his stickbaggage and all including his wife and therefore observed howard coolly you will have to fight captain oblunderbuss because you will not be able to produce your principal its just this that bothers me exclaimed frank if the man had offended me i shouldnt of course mind in that case one of us should never quit the ground alivefor im a desperate fellow when once i am in earnest but heres a poor devil who has never done me any injury but who seems to me to be a capital hand at the whiskeybottleand my fireeating temper places us both in that position which compels him almost poor creature to insist on our exchanging shots i really feel for the captain and not at all for yourself frank said the lawyer in his usual quiet manner oh not an atom ejaculated mr curtis but dont you admit that something ought to be done to prevent captain oblunderbuss from becoming the victim of a display of temper so unjust and uncalled for on my part i wish to heaven my friend the duke of the tower hamlets was in townhe would pretty soon put matters on a proper footing and save me from the chance of killing a man that has never injured me but as his lordship the marquis is not in town whyi must throw myself on your friendship welli will undertake to prevent the duel in this case said howard speaking as quietly as if he believed every word of mr frank curtiss version of the affair will you though cried the young man unable to conceal his joy i will indeed returned howard so make your mind perfectly easy on that head where is the duelor rather where ought it to take place in battersea fields tomorrow morning at eight precisely answered frank very good said the lawyer now you must be with me at a quarter before sevenhere at my office and i will have a chaise ready to take us there but need we go at all asked frank his countenance suddenly assuming a woeful expression again we must go to the field replied the solicitor but trust to me to settle the matter when we do get there again i tell you not to make yourself uneasy i will guarantee the complete settlement of the affairand in a most peremptory manner too thankee kindly returned frank again reassured you have taken a load from my breast not that i care about fighting you knowbut it must be in a good cause that was just what i said when my best friend the prince of scandinavia theres enough of it for the present frank interrupted the lawyer leave the affair to meand i shall manage it to your complete satisfaction be here at a quarter to sevennot a minute latertomorrow morningand now you must permit me to attend to my own engagements frank curtis took the hint and his leave accordingly wondering how the lawyer would so manage matters as to subdue the terrible fireeating propensities of the redoubtable captain oblunderbuss nevertheless the young man placed implicit reliance upon mr howards promise and it was with a comparatively light heart that he sped towards use dwelling of mrs goldberry in baker street chapter lxiii the meeting in battersea fields according to instructions given to his landlady mr frank curtis was called at a quarter to six on the morning following the incidents just related and leaping from his warm bed he proceeded with quivering limbs and chattering teeth to strike a light having after a great deal of trouble persuaded the short wick of his candle to catch the flame of the match which he held to it he drew aside the windowcurtains and looked forth to ascertain the nature of the weather the result of this survey was by no means reassuring for a mizzling rain was falling and a cheerless mist appeared to hang against the window frank closed the curtains again and looked wistfully at the bed as if he were more than half inclined to return to it and leave captain oblunderbuss to do his worstbut on second thoughts he knew that this was a hazardous ventureand accordingly he began to huddle on a portion of his garments then commenced the process of shavingalways an unpleasant one but doubly so by candlelight and when the hand is so nervous that the chances are equal whether you mow off the hirsute stubble or the tip of your nose bother to this razor cried frank it wont cut at all this morning the fault was not however in the razor but with him who wielded it at length by dint of reiterated scraping and steadying the right wrist with the left hand mr frank curtis managed to achieve this portion of his toilette when occupied with his ablutions he thought that the water had never appeared so icy cold before and his teeth chattered like a box of dominoes rattling the fact was that the nearer the eventful moment approached the more alarmed became this heroic young gentleman lest the lawyer should disappoint him or deceive himself in the task of taming the formidable captain oblunderbuss it was halfpast six before mr curtis quitted his bedroom and he had just time to take a cup of coffee in his sitting apartment while the girl of the house ran to fetch a cab she speedily returned with or rather in the vehicle but when mr curtis had taken her place he perceived to his dismay that the horse had such an unpleasant knack of suddenly bolting round each corner he came to and the driver was already so drunk even at that early hour in the morning that the chances were decidedly in favour of an upset he however reached the lawyers office in safety though not before the clocks at the westend were striking seven a hackneycoach was already waiting at the door and the moment frank rang the officebell mr howard appeared come jump inwe have not a minute to lose said the latter frank accordingly entered the coach in which to his surprise he found two illlooking shabbilydressed fellows ensconced mr howard followed himthe door was closed hastilyand away rolled the vehicle in a westerly direction mr curtis was now enabled to examine at his easeor rather at his leisure for easy he was notthe two individuals just mentioned one was a man of about forty dressed in seedy black and with a beard of at least three days growth and a shirt that seemed as if it had been worn and slept in too for a fortnight his face was pale and cadaverous and its expression sinister in the extreme his companion was worselooking and dirtier still but his countenance was red and bloated with intemperance he carried a stout stick in his hand and smelt awfully of rum got your pistols frank inquired mr howard when the coach had moved off the pavement pistols repeated the young gentleman turning dreadfully pale i thought youyouyou and his teeth chattered violently i know what i promised and what i promised i will perform responded the attorney but i thought you might like to make a show of an intention to fight before i interfered oh you know i never bully exclaimed frank if i made a show of fighting as you call it i would fightand not pretend merely welljust as you like observed howard we will settle the business the instant we get down there but is the genleman sartain the capainll be there asked the man with the stout stick and the red face hold your tongue proggs growled his companion in the shabby black these genlemen know what theyre up to silence then prevailed in the vehicle and frank curtis sate wondering who the strangelooking twain could be at last he came to the conclusion that they must be constables whom mr howard had called into requisition for the laudable purpose of putting a stop to the duel still such seedy constables were seldom seen but then reasoned frank within himself they might perhaps be in a state of insolvencya suspicion certainly warranted by their outward appearance the mistlike rain continued and though the morning grew a trifle brighter it was in a very sickly manner frank had seldom felt more dispirited in his life the weather leaguing itself with his own vague apprehensions to render him utterly miserable at length the coach reached the vicinity of battersea fields and mr howard pulled the checkstring as a signal for the driver to stop he then descended frank curtis followed and the two queerlooking gentlemen alighted also you will keep at a decent distance mr mac grab said howard addressing himself to the individual in seedy black wery good sir proggs continued mr mac grab turning to his companion you make a circumbendibus like so as to cut off the captains retreat down yonder ill skirt the river a short way and then drop down on him all right growled mr proggs and off he set in the direction indicated by his master mr mac grab howard then took franks arm and they walked on together the young gentleman shivering and trembling violently what is the matter with you demanded the lawyer you shake just like an aspen oh nothingnothing returned frank in a faltering tone only its very cold this morningand this cursed mistbut theres the captain already he suddenly ejaculated making a full stop howard glanced in the same direction towards which franks eyes were turned and beheld two individuals at a short distance one who was wrapped in a cloak was standing still the other was pacing rapidly up and down in the immediate vicinity of his companion and tossing his arms about as if in a perfect fury of indignation come on said the lawyer dragging forward the terrified frank curtis there the person who is walking up and down like a maniac has caught sight of us thats the captain almost whimpered the young man oh my stars how fierce he does look now then ye shirrkers is it keeping us waiting ye mane vociferated the terrible captain sending his voice halfway across a field in a tone of awful indignation be jasus its a rale insult to me and my frind to be seven minutes and a half behind time in this way we are coming sir as fast as we can exclaimed howard and may be a little faster than you will find to be agreeable my god dont irritate him implored frank hes capable ofofshooting us bothas we walk along dont be such a fool frank you will see a rare bit of fun in a few minutes come alongand the lawyer dragged his shrinking companion forward be the holy pokerr vociferated the captain as howard and curtis now drew near enough for him plainly to recognise their countenances be the holy poker he repeated his eyes glaring furiously sir christopher is not here morthaunt my dear frind ye are swindledrobbedpluntheredchated of the pleasure of a duel this cold mornin but ill avenge ye my boyfor i tould that misther curtis there that id hould him responsible come come captain exclaimed howard as he and frank now stopped at the distance of a few paces from the warlike officer and his friend mordaunt dont bluster and sputter in this fine fashion is it blusther and sputther to me ye mane cried captain oblunderbuss be jasus sirrye shall ate the worrds afore were done but ill shoot mr curtis first and tis yourself ill send headlong afther him morthaunt my frind instead of being principal now tis second ye must be so give us the pistholcase from under your cloak man with all my heart captain said mordaunt who was a tall awkward gentleman about thirtyfive years of age and as like miss julia as brother could be to sister howardmy dear friendmy good fellow gasped frank curtis in the ear of his companion is it possible thatthatyouve be jasus were watched suddenly exclaimed the captain whose quick eye now caught sight of a man approaching from the next field its only my servant sir who is bringing my case of pistols remarked howard not knowing whether you would be here we kept them in the coach at a short distance not be here repeated the captain do ye take us for as great cowards as ould sir christopher blunt be jasusbut that man dont look like a servant anyhow ejaculated the warlike gentleman interrupting himself and fixing a ferocious look upon mr mac grab who now came running up to the spot completely out of breath howard glanced rapidly to the left and beheld proggs approaching from that direction heres another fellow exclaimed mordaunt who had marked and followed the lawyers scrutinizing look gentlemen what does this mean yesand be jasus vociferated captain oblunderbuss what does this mane have ye had recourse to the dirthy expadient of getting constables to come forarrd to spile the purtiest little affair that was ever to come off on a misty mornin it dont mean nothink of the kind captain said mr mac grab gruffly then as with a side glance he convinced himself that his follower proggs was now only a few paces distant in the rear of the warlike irishman he continued thusthe fact is im a hofficerand youre my prisoner an officerrr vociferated captain oblunderbuss his countenance becoming actually purple with rage while frank curtis suddenly assured that all prospects of a duel were at an end began to enjoy the scene amazingly yes sirthis person is an officer said mr howard in the calmest manner possible and i am the attorney for the plaintiffmr sprigginsat whose suit you are now captured for three hundred and fortyseven pounds including costs blood and thuntherr roared captain oblunderbuss swelling so tremendously with passion that he seemed as if about to burst through his military frockcoat with its frogs and braidings this is a rale insult not ounly to me but also to ould ireland morrthaunt my boy its a very awkward business captain said the gentleman thus appealed to but i do not see why it should prevent the business on which we met pistols firstprison afterwards that wont do said mr mac grab not a bit growled proggs who was now stationed close behind the captain bastes of the earrth roared oblunderbuss do come nowenough of this gammon interrupted mac grab if you wont walk quiet off with us we must see what force will do it is no use to resist my boy whispered mordaunt to his friend who was literally foaming at the mouth but we will find another occasion to punish these cowardly fellows he added aloud casting fiery glances upon the lawyer and frank curtis be jasus and ill have some of it out of em now ejaculated captain oblunderbuss and springing upon the unfortunate frank he administered to this young gentleman three or four hearty cuffs before a hand could be stretched out to withhold him curtis roared and wriggled about with the pain but he was speedily released from the effects of this onslaught mac grab proggs and the lawyer hastening to his assistance the warlike captain was then borne away to the hackneycoach in which he was safely deposited mordaunt obtaining leave from mr howard to accompany his friend in the same vehicle as far as the prison to which he was to be consigned frank curtis declined forming one of the party and while the coach proceeded in as direct a line as possible for horsemonger lane gaol the young gentleman sped merrily along alone and on foot delighted in spite of the drubbing which he had received to think that the redoubtable captain oblunderbuss was on his way to a place where his warlike propensities stood every chance of being cribbd cabind and confind at least for a season you may conceive gentle reader that captain oblunderbuss was in a dreadful rage at being interrupted in the midst of his favourite pursuitespecially as the interruption was of so unpleasant a nature as that described but his vapouring and blustering produced little effect upon messrs mac grab and proggs who never spoke a word during the journey from battersea fields to horsemonger lane save to answer in an affirmative when mr howard proposed that they should stop at a publichouse for a few moments to partake of some refreshment and then they each respondedyesrum please the captain himself was accommodated with a glass of whiskey mordaunt and the lawyer took nothing the vehicle then proceeded without stopping to the prison where the gallant captainoh most ignominious fatewas handed over to the care of the turnkeys in the debtors department of the establishment chapter lxiv old death and his friend tidmarsh the incident which occupied the preceding chapter occurred as will probably be recollected on the morning of the wednesday after the monday on which thomas rainford was hanged and resuscitated it was on the evening of the same wednesday and at about eight oclock that we must again introduce the reader to the laboratory in red lion street a cheerful fire burnt in the grate and before it sate dr lascelles and the earl of ellingham engaged in conversation and also in the discussion of a very excellent bottle of claret conveyed thither from the earls own cellar in pall mall i wish jacob smith would return said the young nobleman looking anxiously and nervously at his watch in the same manner have you renewed the conversation after every pause that has occurred during the last two hours observed the physician my dear arthur there is nothing like patience in this world you may depend upon it all goes on wellor you would too soon have received the tidings of any evil that might have occurred bad news fly uncommonly fast i wish that i possessed a small amount of your calm and unexcitable temperament doctor returned the earl but i am so fearful lest any untoward accident should mar the successthe complete success of all our plans do not meet evils half way said the doctor every thing has gone on well as yet mr de medina acted with the dispatch of a regular man of business no one could possibly have managed better he left on monday evening for dover where he remained but just long enough yesterday morning to hire a cutter and arrange with the captain to have her in readiness to leave at a moments warning he was back in london again last night by seven and fortunately your halfbrother was so far recovered as to be able to depart in company with jacob the disguise you procured for him was impenetrable to even the eyes of the most experienced bow street runner he and his young companion reached dover early this morning and i dare swear that long before this hour gallant tom is safe in calais where mr de medina and his daughters will also be some time tomorrow then off they all go to paris where you are to rejoin them yes all has been well arranged by mr de medina said the earl and i have no doubt that the results will be as you anticipate but i charged jacob to return posthaste to londoni begged him not to spare the gold with which i furnished him so that he might be back here as soon as possible to assure us of my brothers safe embarkation for france and yet the lad is not with us yet you must admit doctor that i am not to be blamed for my apprehensions for misadventures and obstacles altogether unforeseennever dreamt of indeeddo start up so suddenly that i confess i shall enjoy no peace of mind until i receive from jacobs own lips the assurance that the object of my anxiety is beyond the reach of all danger how can it be otherwise than that he is already safe demanded the physician somewhat impatiently who can tell what may happen asked the earl on monday night while thomas was sleeping and profound tranquillity as well as perfect security seemed to prevail in the house was not the grand secret suddenly menaced by the appearance of one whom only a few hours previously i had been led to consider numbered with the dead yet doubtless you thought at the moment while at your house in grafton street that all was calm and unendangered in red lion street the sudden turning up of that old scoundrel whom thomas rainford supposed to be dead and of whom you have since told me so much was certainly very remarkable observed the physician but you certainly managed the matter most cleverlythe more so too inasmuch as my patient knew nothing of the transaction until it was all over fortunately he slept as i have already told you said the earl that excellent lad jacob was for a few minutes completely overcomestunnedstupified indeed when he recognized the countenance of benjamin bones and i myself was strangely excited when those terrible words tis old death fell upon my earsfor i knew to whom they applied moreover jacob let the lamp fall and i dared not move to obtain another lightfor bones began to struggle furiously i was sadly alarmed lest my halfbrother should awake but fortunately his slumber was profound and then i believe jacob smith recovered himself and procured another light said the physician interrogatively you see doctor returned the earl with a smile that you did not listen very attentively to my narrative of the transaction when you came back to the house yesterday morning because i remember you would persist in telling me the story at a time when i was thinking of the best restoratives for my patient answered lascelles also with a goodnatured laugh but pray give me all the details nowand the occupation will while away the time until jacob makes his appearance god grant that he may soon come exclaimed the earl but let me resume at the point where we interrupted ourselves i asked you if jacob did not procure another light the moment he had recovered his presence of mind said the physician but i remember now that you availed yourself of the opportunity afforded by the darkness to drag the old man back to the staircase leading into the subterranean and that the terrible menaces you whispered in his ears reduced him to the passiveness of a lamb he is a hideouslooking manfor after all you learnt from your brother concerning him it is clear that he is the same whom i had seen in this house on one or two occasions but whose name i did not then know he is clearly the same person said the earl welland so you got him down the breakneck stairs added the doctor and then it was you called to jacob to procure another light rainford continuing asleep the whole time but after all that had taken place in the morning his slumber would necessarily be heavy i can assure you that a more dangerous task i had seldom undertaken than that of dragging the old villain down those stairs said the earl and how it was that we both escaped broken necks i am at a loss to divine however i did get him safely down to the bottom and the great door being then bolted only on the same side as the stairs i had no difficulty in opening it jacob came down with the light and i compelled the old man to rise and enter the subterranean with me i will be bound his hideous countenance was convulsed with rage and alarm exclaimed the doctor but i must get a cast of his head when he dieswhich i dare say will be upon the scaffold yes he was positively horrible with mingled wrath and fear continued the earl but i had no pity for himas i have none now i made him walk a few paces in front of me jacob accompanying us with the light once he turned round and fixed on the lad a look so full of infernal spiteof demonlike malignity that i was horrified to think that such hateful emotions could find an abode in the breast of any human being jacob smith recoiled in affrightas if from the glare of a serpents eyes but i whispered a word to reassure himand almost at the same moment i beheld by the light of the lamp a door in the side of the subterranean you know the suspicions which had already filled my mind they then returned with renewed vigour to my memoryand i felt convinced that i touched on the threshold of a discovery i commanded the old man to stopsuffering him to believe that i had pistols about me and should not hesitate to use them in case of need the door was speedily opened and it led into the very dungeon where you were confined for four weeks said dr lascelles the villainsthe scoundrels who perpetrated such an outrage yesit was the very same dungeon continued the earl and my blood ran cold as i glanced within jacob smith understood the discovery that i had made and uttered an ejaculation of horror i now know at least one of the authors of my imprisonment i said turning to old death whose eyes were again glaring fiercely upon the lad but i added this is no time for question and answer on that headthen taking the lamp i held it in such a manner as to be able to throw its light upon that part of the cell where i had opened to myself the means of escape and i perceived that the masonry had not been replaced i accordingly resolved not to imprison the old man there and yet what could i do with him turning round to examine more minutely the nature of the place i beheld another door on the opposite side of the subterranean old death marked the fact of my eyes lingering thereon and he gave vent to something between a menace and a prayeri seek not to harm you was my reply but as it once suited your purposes that i should become a captive here for a few weeks it is now expedient according to my views that you should become a prisoner for a few days in with you old man i added having in the meantime opened the door of this second cell and there the old reprobate is now cooped up along with his friend tidmarsh exclaimed the physician laughing at the idea of the two cronies being caught in one of their own snaresfor that they were companions in iniquity he had now but little doubt you must admit that the case was a desperate and an urgent one continued the earl from all you had told me concerning this tidmarsh i felt well persuaded that he was likely to visit the subterranean and i knew that were such a casualty to ensue old death had merely to raise his voice in order to obtain his release and so you quit the subterranean and run round to turnmill street to tell old tidmarsh that dr lascelles wishes to see him immediately in his laboratory exclaimed the doctor again laughing heartilyfor the entire affair seemed to have touched a long slumbering chord of merry humour in his breast precisely so returned the young nobleman tidmarsh however eyed me very suspiciously and muttered something to himself about the doctor being very indiscreetbut i affected not to notice his peculiarity of manner he came round to the houseand you know the rest yes you took him down to join his friend old death as it seems the rascal is called observed the doctor and there they must remain until jacob smith shall have returned with the tidings of my brothers safe embarkation continued the earl it is true that they are both utterly ignorant of his escape from deathhis extraordinary resuscitation thanks to your profound knowledge and generous aid doctorbut as we have every reason to believe at least one of them to be thomass enemy they shall neither obtain a chance of discovering the secret of his new existence as i may indeed term itat all events not until he shall be beyond the reach of danger and do you know it strikes me most forcibly that tidmarsh was the gaoler who attended upon me during my incarceration in the dungeon below although the person who was my gaoler invariably spoke in a feigned tone and as laconically as possible yet i am almost certain that it was the voice of tidmarsh moreover he seemed for a moment so astoundedso struck when i presented myself at the door of his dwelling in turnmill street to deliver the forged message which induced him to accompany me round to this house that i am convinced he knew me for though he never permitted me to catch a glimpse of his countenance when he used to visit me at the trap in the dungeondoorstill he might have seen my face however when i presented myself at his abode in the way which i have described my manner appeared so offhand and sincere that had any suspicions of treachery entered his mind they were dispelled almost immediately but doctor i abominate the necessity of having to use duplicity even towards villains of that stamp your compunction is carried too far my dear arthur returned lascelles it was necessary to get that scoundrel tidmarsh into such a snare as to place him beyond the possibility of doing mischief and though the narrative which you have now given me more in detail than you did yesterday morning when you hastily sketched these incidents to your brother and myselfthough i say it makes me laugha habit not frequent with mei really commend your foresight in averting danger as well as your bravery in carrying into effect the requisite precautions i deserve and require no praise doctor answered the earl what would i not have done to ensure the safety of him who has behaved so generously to me during the whole of monday night i sate by his bedside anxiously awaiting the moment when slumber should leave his heavy eyelids for i knew that i had welcomemost welcome tidings for his ears but he slept on until you came and then doctor you were a witness of the joy which he experienced on learning that he had not been the cause of the death of benjamin bonesmiscreant though the man be scarcely were these words uttered when a low but hasty knock at the front door caused lord ellingham to spring from his seatseize the lampand hasten to answer the summons dr lascelles could hear the earl ejaculate the wordsjacob smiththen a hurried whisper took place in the halland in another moment the joyous exclamationthank god thank god bursting from the young noblemans lips met the physicians ears and dr lascelles thereby knew that rainford had succeeded in quitting the shores of england in safety chapter lxv the examination the reader will remember that according to the arrangements originally chalked out lord ellingham and jacob smith were to have accompanied tom rain to france but this project was disturbed by the appearance of old death in the house in red lion street and the incidents to which it gave rise as narrated in the last chapter for the earlhaving succeeded in making old death and tidmarsh his prisonersresolved to remain in the house not only that he might by means of frequent visits to the subterranean guard against their escape but also to supply them with food and to liberate them when circumstances should render their farther confinement unnecessary thus was it that tom rain and jacob had proceeded without the earl to dover and that the lad had returned thence to london the moment he had seen rainford safe on board the cutter which mr de medina had hired especially to convey him to france nayjacob was not content with merely witnessing the embarkation of the individual to whom he had become so deeply attached but in spite of the instructions he had received alike from the earl and tom rain himself to return with the least possible delay to the metropolis he had lingered on the pier at dover until the white sails of the cutter were no longer in sight he therefore arrived somewhat later in london than had been expected although he travelled post and spared not the gold placed at his disposal to urge the postillions on but when he frankly admitted to lord ellingham and the doctor the reason of his retarded appearance in red lion street they could not find it in their hearts to utter a word of reproach or blame nofor lord ellinghams joy was now as exuberant as his apprehensions had a short time previously been strong and oppressive and he wrung the hand of the humble jacob as if that lad had been his own brother we will presently liberate our prisoners said the earl when jacob had related the particulars of his journey with rainford to dover and of the latters safe embarkation but before i suffer them to go at large it behoves me not only to adopt the means requisite to elicit certain explanations interesting to myself but also to take those steps that will effectually prevent the mysterious subterraneans and dungeons of this establishmentor rather of the two housesfrom being accessible or available to the miscreants whom we are about to set free conceiving that jacob would be sure to come back this evening and intending that his return should be followed by the examination and liberation of those two men i have ordered the three faithful domestics who assisted us so materially on monday morning and on whose fidelity i can rely with so much confidence to be here at halfpast nine oclock for what purpose demanded the physician in astonishment to increase our number so as to overawe the wretches who are to appear before us replied the earl it is not that i fear to give them an inch of vantageground but were they to find themselves in the presence of only two men and this lad they might attempt resistance and use a violence that would alarm the neighbourhoodand i need hardly say doctor how necessary it is for all our sakes that we should not be placed in a position which would compel us to give to a magistrate any explanation of the modes in which we severally became acquainted with this establishment or those two vile men your precautions are most admirably forecast my dear earl responded dr lascelles hark there is a single knock at the front door run jacob my boy said the earl my servants have arrived the lad left the room without taking a light but the young nobleman almost immediately rose and followed hima second thought suggesting the prudence of assuring himself against the coming of any unwelcome intruder instead of his servants by the time the earl reached the middle of the stairs leading down into the hall jacob had opened the streetdoor mrs bunce exclaimed the lad starting back half in affright as he recognised her wizen countenance by the feeble light that streamed from an adjacent window what jacobyou here cried the woman whyhow come you in this house and what have you been doing with yourself lately i began to think you was playing us false but now that i find you here i suppose you know all about the trick of mr boness pretended death and have made every thing right with him but is he here yes answered jacob boldlyfor he had by this time recovered his presence of mind walk inhe wants very much to see you and so do i want to see him added mrs bunce as she entered the hall while jacob barred the door carefully i havent seen him ever since monday night and he was to be sure and come up to the dials last evening so i got alarmed and come down to see i went to turnmill streetbut i could make no one hear therefor i suppose you know by this time all about tidmarsh and the other crib yesand the subterranean too added jacob all the secrets so long kept from me are now revealed but walk up mrs buncewalk up the woman suspecting nothing wrong and not altogether displeased to find as she believed that jacob had risen so high in favour with old death as to become one of his confidantsthe woman we say walked up the staircase which was well known to her but scarcely had she reached the first turn when she was suddenly grasped by a vigorous hand and a voice exclaimed make no noise mrs bunceor it will be the worse for you illustration thank god you are there my lord cried jacob now hastily running up the stairs this woman is one of the gang which it has fallen to your lordships lot to disperse oh jacob ejaculated mrs bunce you dont know what you are doing but who is this lordand what have i done to injure him i am the earl of ellingham woman said arthur and perhaps you are not ignorant of the long imprisonment which i endured in this place but proceedi will follow you and remember that you are in the power of those who will not suffer you to escape at that instant there was another knock at the door remain here said the nobleman to mrs bunce jacob let me answer that summons arthur accordingly proceeded to the door and gave admittance to his three menservants they then all repaired to the laboratory together where the earl made dr lascelles acquainted in a hasty whisper with the cause of mrs bunces appearance on the stage of their present proceedings the moment the woman emerged from the darkness of the landing outside to the light of the laboratory she cast a hasty and inquiring glance around on those present but her eyes settled on jacob smith and she was evidently much astonished to see him dressed in a plain but most respectable manner and looking neat clean and even interesting in his appearance for the lad possessed good featuresvery bright eyesand a set of white even teeth and though his countenance was still somewhat indicative of a sickly constitution it nevertheless showed a state of health considerably improved by the excitement of travelling and by the happiness imparted to his soul by the successful escape of thomas rainford jacob saw that mrs bunce surveyed him with interest and at the moment he felt pity for the woman who had on many occasions shown him some kindness and towards whom he had also experienced at times unaccountable heartyearningsbut he could not blame himself for having just now entrapped her into the power of lord ellingham because he knew how important it was to assemble in the presence of that nobleman as many of old deaths accomplices as possible besides he was well aware that no harm was intended her and this assurance he conveyed to her in a hasty whisperthough not in such a way as to induce her to believe that he was any longer an accomplice also you will now accompany me below said the earl addressing himself to his three servants jacob hastened to light another lamp of which there were several in the laboratory and the earl attended by his domestics proceeded into the adjoining bedroom whence they passed down into the subterranean dr lascelles mrs bunce and jacob were left together in the laboratory what does all this mean demanded the woman accosting the lad in an imploring mannerfor she was afraid in spite of the whispered assurance she had received from him i cannot give you any explanation answered jacob aloud but i may go so far as to promise youand this good gentleman he added turning towards the doctor will confirm my wordsthat no harm is intended to you provided you give faithful replies to the questions that will be put to you presently the lad speaks quite properly woman said the physician and you had better hold your tongue until the prisoners make their appearance the prisoners muttered mrs bunce and it struck her that allusion must be made to old death and tidmarsh nor was she mistaken for in a few minutes the earl and his domestics reappeared escorting into the laboratory those two individuals whose hands were fastened by strong cords benjamin bones looked more hideous than ever a white bristling beard of three or four days growth gave an additional deathlike aspect to his countenance and his eyes glared from beneath their shaggy brows with mingled rage and alarm tidmarsh manifested less emotion but on entering the laboratory he cast a rapid and scrutinizing glance around as if to ascertain who were present old death did the same and when his eyes caught sight of jacob smith his forehead contracted into a thousand wrinkles with the intense ferocity of his malignant hate then he exchanged a rapid glance with mrs bunce who gave him to understand by a peculiarly significant look that she was not there as a witness against him but as a prisoner herself dr lascelles stood with his back to the fire contemplating the various persons assembled in a manner which showed that he was far from being an uninterested spectator of the proceedings indeed he not only prepared to listen with attention to all that was about to be said on account of the friendly feelings which he experienced towards the earl of ellinghambut he likewise occupied himself in studying the physiognomies of old death tidmarsh and mrs buncea survey which led him to the comfortable conclusion that if they did not all three perish on the scaffold sooner or later it would not be their own fault lord ellingham ordered the three prisoners to be accommodated with chairs and when they were seated he addressed them in the following manner you are now in the presence of one who has the power to punish you for your numerous misdeeds and who should you refuse to answer the questions to be put to you will not hesitate to hand you all three over into the grasp of justice the individual who possesses that power and who is now about to question you is myself all your secrets are known or suspectedand even should you refuse to answer my queries or if you reply to them falsely i have the means of arriving at the truth to you benjamin bones do i address myself firstanswer me thenand say wherefore your agents or accomplices waylaid me and bore me off to that dungeon opening from the subterranean speak villainand see that you speak truly one word my lord said the archmiscreant his sepulchral tones quivering and tremulous with mingled rage and alarm let me say one word to you in private not a syllable speak openlyand cause not idle delay exclaimed the young nobleman do you know asked old death that it is in my power to publish a secret which would not redound to your honour i can well divine to what you would allude returned arthur and i despise your menace go and say if thou wilt that the earl of ellingham is the halfbrother of him who was hanged on monday morning growled old death and then he chuckled horribly in the depth of his malignity ha ha ha the proud and wealthy earl of ellingham the brother of a highwayman who was hangedand that brother too the elder one and born in lawful wedlock ah this would be a pretty tale to circulate at the west end scoundrel you cannot provoke me to anger said the earl calmly but you may move me to invoke the aid of justice to punish you for daring to imprison me during four long weeks in a noisome dungeona crime for which the penalty would be transportation for the remainder of your miserable life moreover that same justice would require of you full and ample explanations respecting those rooms filled with property of immense value and of such a miscellaneous nature that the various articles could not have been honestly obtained ah you shrinkyou recoil from that menace think you that any ridiculous punctilio has prevented me from forcing the locks of those rooms and examining their contents no the day after you became my prisoner here and when i ascertained beyond all doubt that you were the tenant of those rooms i hesitated not to visit them to glean evidence against you now old man you see that you are in my power and you will do well not to push my patience beyond the sphere of indulgence and what if i tell you all you want to know said benjamin bones appalled by the unveiling of the fearful precipice on which he stood give me the fullest and completest explanation of many circumstances in the unravelling of which i feel a special interestspare me the trouble of adopting other means to obtain the solution of those mysteries to which i possess a clue exclaimed the earl and i shall forthwith liberate you and your companions having previously taken measures to prevent you from holding any farther interest in this house or the tenement in turnmill street with which the subterranean passage communicates andand my property gasped old death to allow you to retain it were a sin answered the earl emphatically to give it up to the magisterial authorities or to dispose of it for the benefit of the poor would be to court an inquiry which must inevitably lead to the mention of your name and the consequent apprehension of your persona result which would be an indirect forfeiture of the promise i have given and now repeat namely to permit yourself and companions to depart with impunity on condition that you make a full and complete confession in regard to all the points wherein i am interested what then can be done with that property exclaimed the nobleman there is but one course to pursueand that is to destroy it destroy itdestroy it groaned old death writhing with mental anguish on his chair what destroy all that hardearned wealththose treasures every article interrupted the nobleman emphatically and consider yourself fortunate in quitting this house to breathe the air of liberty rather than to be consigned to a gaol oh my god my god cried old death reduced to despair by the lamentable prospect now placed before him blaspheme not villaininvoke not the sacred name of the almighty ejaculated arthur rather implore pardon for your manifold iniquities it would take a long life of repentance to purge his soul of all the atrocity that harbours in it observed the physician who had intently watched all the variations of the old mans countenance during this colloquy my dear doctor said the earl there is hope for even those who are most deeply stained with sinyes even for this miserable man who would sooner cling to his illgot wealth than adopt the only means now open to him of avoiding the grasp of justice but it is useless to prolong this discussion benjamin bones once for all do you consent to make a full confession as the first atonement for a life of crime and to surrender all your treasures as the secondor shall i send forthwith to summon hither the officers of justice but if you take mine all you send me forth into the world a beggar cried old death in a tone which seemed to indicate that he was about to weep for very rage on that night said the earl solemnly and almost sternly when thomas rainford took from thy treasury the money which he conceived to be his due did he not leave ample sums behind and wilt thou tell me that thou hast not since disposed of those sums in other places of security thou seest villain that i can read all thy secrets so prate no more about being reduced to beggary old deaths eyes fell beneath the fixed gaze of the earl of ellingham who thereby perceived that the conjecture which he had just hazarded was indeed the right one and you will let us go free if i answer all your questions said the archmiscreant after a brief pause during which he consulted his companions in iniquity by means of a rapid interchange of glances i will replied the nobleman emphatically but what if i should tell you more than you already seem to suspectthrough ignorance of the precise extent of your real knowledge said old deathand thus make you acquainted with things likely to render you vindictive i scorn a mean and petty vengeance exclaimed the young nobleman my word is pledged to a certain condition and that promise shall be redeemed whatever the nature of your revelations may be then i consent exclaimed old death bear witness dr lascellesfor you are an honourable man the earl of ellingham is too lenient interrupted the physician but as it is i guarantee my word of honour that his lordship will faithfully fulfil his promise in spite of any thing that may transpire and for which he may not be prepared added old death determined to drive as sure a bargain as possible because he continued it is quite impossible for me to foresee the nature of the questions you are going to put to me my lordand in answering them i may only commit myself i am in your power but pray use that power mercifully mercifully cried the earl in a tone of mingled scorn and disgust i have no sympathy with you of any kind old manyou are loathsome to me i merely make a compact with youand that bargain shall be adhered to on my part if it be fulfilled on yours i however warn you that should i detect you in aught at variance with the truth our compact ceasesmy promise is annulledand you remain at my disposal as completely as if no pledge relative to your safety had ever issued from my lips weigh well then the position in which you stand continued the young nobleman sternly for i am not to be trifled with i will tell you all you require to knowallall responded old death gasping convulsively only let this scene end as soon as possiblefor it does me harm we will proceed at once to business said the earl then seating himself in front of the prisoners he addressed his questions to old death saying in the first place why was i imprisoned in the subterranean dungeon to prevent you from using your wealth to bribe the gaolauthorities to let rainford escape or your interest to save him if he was condemned answered old death in a slow and measured tone then villain that you are cried the earl scarcely able to subdue his resentment you had an interest in hurrying the son of your own halfsister octavia to the scaffoldoh i understand it all thomas felt assured that some profound secret and malign influence was at work against him for those who were put forward as the prosecutorsthe knight and his nephewwent as unwilling witnesses then it was you continued the nobleman in a tone of fearful excitementit was you whose gold doubtless bribed the attorney howard to institute those fatal proceedings it wasit was ejaculated old death trembling from head to foot but rainford deserved ithe outraged mei was good and kind to himi threw excellent things in his waybut he made me bring him to this househe learnt all my secretshe robbed me of my treasureshe carried off my private papers silence exclaimed the earl in a tone which made the archvillain and his fellowprisoners all three start convulsively give not a false colouring to that transaction rainford learnt when in the country who you were and how nearly you were allied to his late motherhe knew also how you had plundered him of his inheritanceand he was justified in the conduct he pursued towards you the money which he took was legitimately his own allowing for the accumulation of interest and compound interest and the papers were not yoursbut rightfully his property then why did he not tell me who he waswhy did he entrap me and compel me at the muzzle of the levelled pistol to conduct him to my secret places demanded old death impatiently your villany and your craft could only be met by stratagem and counterplot returned the earl emphatically and in that way did rainford meet you and yetfor the truth of my assertion you cannot denyyou have sent your own nephew to the scaffold it was his own fault persisted old death doggedly he should not have crossed my pathhe should not have proclaimed warfare against me i would have been his friend his friend exclaimed the earl in a tone of bitter scorn yeshis friend after his own fashionin the way he wanted a friend continued old death becoming garrulous with nervous excitement but he outraged me in a way i could not forgive nor forgethe penetrated into all my secretshe might have returned and helped himself again and again from my storeshe knew too much for me to be safeand moreover he bound me to a chair in such a way that i fell into a fit and should have died had it not been for this man here added the miscreant indicating tidmarsh all those things combined to render rainfords death necessaryand he has paid the penalty of his conduct towards me lord ellingham recoiled in horror from the fiendlike man who could thus seek to palliate the foul deed of having sent his own relative to the scaffold through no moral motives but merely to gratify his vengeance and remove one who seemed to be dangerous in his path let us know more of the shamdeath business on your part mr bonesor whatever your name is said dr lascelles you remember that night i came round to the house here and met you sir hastily exclaimed tidmarsh thinking that he should serve himself by exhibiting a readiness to volunteer any explanation that was required wellyou recollect that it was the night you saw rainford in your laboratory and we knew that he had gone down into the subterranean then if you please to remember we went away togetherand i took leave of you at the corner of turnmill street but i suspected there was something wrongalthough i did not dare offer to go into mr boness rooms while you were with me as soon as you had left me however i returned to the housenot by the subterranean be it well understoodand passing through your laboratory then you possess counterpart keys rascal exclaimed the physician angrily but go on well siri passed through your laboratory into the bedroom there locking the door of communication after me then i entered the first storeroom but i had scarcely put foot therein when i heard a violent noise as if some one was trying to break through the trapdoor in the bedchamber i confess that i was frightenedbecause i knew it must be rainford and i suspected him to be a desperate man who meant no good in that house i remained quite stillheard him break open the trap and come forth i also heard him dash open the door of your laboratory through which he passed but as i had neglected to lock the other door thereleading to the landinghe was not compelled to force that also welli waited a few minutes till i thought he had left the house and then having great misgivings on account of mr bones i went into the next storeroom but there i caught a glimpse of rainford standing over mr bones who was tied in his chair i was about to retreat i must confessbut rainford bolted away like a ghost and i ran up to my friend who i thought was dead i however saw enough at a second glance to convince me that he was only in a kind of trancelike fit and in a short time i recovered him thats my part of the story sir and i hope enough exclaimed lord ellingham abruptly i have now a question to ask you mr tidmarshwere you not my gaoler when i was a prisoner in the subterranean well my lordits no use denying it answered the man but spare your comments i cannot complain of the way in which you executed a task doubtless imposed on you by your master here moreover you even showed me some indulgence by permitting me to write those letters to my friends give my friend bones his due my lord interrupted tidmarsh for i showed em to him first before i posted them and as they could do no harm i let them go hastily exclaimed old death for i did not want to punish you more than i could help besides i was glad you wrote themin the first place because they prevented any noise amongst your friends on account of your disappearanceand secondly because the one you wrote to rainford was enough to convince him he had nothing more to hope from you even while you seek to conciliate me you cannot prevent the manifestation of your fiendish hate against him who was the son of your sister octavia said the earl gazing upon old death in profound surprisesurprise that his heart could be so irredeemably black but now answer me another question he continued after a few moments pause how came you to know that i was likely to use my interest or my gold on behalf of thomas rainford my spies were stationed about horsemonger lane gaol answered old death and i had a lodging in the immediate neighbourhood they came and told me that you had just gone into the prison to see rainford and i concluded that you must already be aware of the relationship which existed between you to resolve and to act with me are the same thing and i sent back my men to seize you and convey you to the subterranean and why had you stationed spies about the gaol demanded the earl because i suspected that rainford would send for you or that you would go to him of your own accord replied old death for he had taken from me the papers which proved who he wasand i supposed that his first act on possessing them must have been to communicate with you and in that i cannot have been far wrong by dint of questioning and crossquestioning the following additional facts were elicited when tidmarsh recovered old death from the species of trance or fit into which he had fallen when bound to the chair the latter determined to encompass at least the transportation if not the execution of tom rain for two or three days he remained quiet at tidmarshs abode in turnmill street brooding over his scheme of vengeance and communicating with none of his friends elsewherenot even with the bunces in planning the punishment of tom rain old death knew that he had a most delicate and difficult game to play for the highwayman was to be sacrificed to his hatred and his interestsand yet in such a manner that the victim should not know by whom the blow was struck nor the source whence his ruin came the deed must be effected with so much dark mystery that rainford should not even have any ground for supposing that bones was the real prime mover of the prosecution and in this case the archvillain felt convinced that rainford would not even mention his name nor allude to his establishments in clerkenwell when placed before the magistrate or on his trial the affair of sir christopher blunts three thousand pounds seemed the best point on which to set the whole of this complicated machinery in motion and old death knew sufficient of mr howards cold calculating and moneymaking disposition to be well aware that his aid in the business could be readily secured he communicated all his plans to tidmarsh and this latter individual suggested that rainford should be led to believe that old death was no more for said tidmarsh when i entered your storeroom and saw rainford gazing at you in your fit i concluded you were really dead and i am certain that such was the impression of the highwayman besides he fled in horror and rainford is not the person thus to act save under extraordinary circumstances this hint was adopted and it was resolved that rainford should be induced to suppose that benjamin bones was positively defuncta belief that would of course preclude the possibility of any suspicion that the said bones was the individual who set in motion the springs of that conspiracy which was to carry the victim to the scaffold these projects being all settled between old death and his man tidmarsh the latter was despatched to mrs bunce to whom the entire scheme was communicated she was instructed to set spies to watch tom rain and to convey to him if possible the information that benjamin bones was dead it was also determined not to trust jacob smith with the plan of vengeance to be carried out but as a precaution on the right side to let even him also believe that old death was no more at the same time the lad was to be used as a spy on rainford his devotion to whom was not of course suspected when mrs bunce met or rather overtook rainford in graysinnlane on the saturday night previous to his arrest it was really by accident and she availed herself of that opportunity to inform him that old death had gone to his last account according to the instructions communicated to her in the morning of that very day she endeavoured to watch whither rainford went after she parted from him but he disappeared and she concluded that he had entered some house in that vicinity that he had quitted locks fields was known to her and she therefore imagined that his new domicile must be in the lane jacob was accordingly set to watch that neighbourhood but he misled her purposely as will be remembered by stating that he had knocked at every house in the street and had ascertained that no such person as rainford lived there tom was however seen by one of the spies in piccadilly on the ensuing sunday evening as he was returning from lady hatfields house and he was dogged over to his old abode in locks fields in the meantime tidmarsh had been to mr howard whom he bribed heavily with gold supplied by old death for the purpose and the lawyer was induced to instruct dykes the bow street runner to arrest rainford on the charge of robbing sir christopher blunt this arrangement with the solicitor was effected on the saturday afternoon it was on the sunday evening that rainford was dogged to his own abode and that very night as soon as the spy could communicate with mrs bunce and dykes the arrest of the victim was accomplished in the manner described in a previous chapter throughout all these and the subsequent proceedings jacob smiths friendly disposition towards rainford was not suspected nor were his visits to horsemonger lane gaol known to the conspiratorsinasmuch as the spies who had been placed in that neighbourhood to watch for lord ellingham had no farther business there when once the earl was captured and secured such was the substance of the confession partly elicited fairly and partly extorted from the three worthiesold death mrs bunce and mr tidmarshwho were now so completely in the power of the earl of ellingham thus said arthur who as well as the physician and jacob smith was appalled at the dreadful discoveries now brought to lightthus was this tremendous conspiracy to take away the existence of a human being minutelyi may almost say scientifically planned in all its details and carried on with a secrecy and a success that manifested the most infernal talent for wicked combinations monsters that ye are he cried unable to retain his feelings any longer what vengeance do ye not merit at my hands but novengeance is for cowards and grovelling miscreants like yourselves were i inclineddid i stoop to retaliate and repay ye in your own coin for this enormous misdeedfor you old man he added turning his indignant glances upon benjamin bones who shrank back in dismayyou ere now alluded to that cause which makes me interested in all that regardsor rather regarded he said correcting himself your unfortunate victim thomas rainford but as i was observingdid i choose to wreak revenge on ye three how easy were it done i might imprison ye for the remainder of your lives in your own dungeons i might gag and bind ye in such a way that no cry could escape your lips and no avenue of escape be possible and then either leave ye to starveyes to starve to death in this room or i might set fire to the house and consign ye to the torture of flames mrs bunce uttered a faint shriek and old death gave vent to a low moan as these awful words fell upon their ears but tidmarsh remained passive and silent jacob smith and the domestics gazed upon the earl in anxious suspense not unmixed with awe for as he spoke he seemed as if he were armed with an iron eloquence to reproach and a vicarious power to punish fearfully the physician surveyed the three prisoners with ineffable disgust but no resumed the earl i would not condescendi would not degrade myself so low as to snatch from your hands the weapons with which you work and then use them against you i have yet another point on which i require information and when your answers old man he continued again addressing himself to bones shall have been given all that will remain for me to perform is the destruction of your illgot property and the adoption of a measure to deprive you of any future interest in these houses with their dark subterranean passage and their horrible dungeons benjamin bones exclaimed arthur after a few moments pause wherefore did you seek to possess yourself of that little boy whom thomas rainford had so kindlyso generouslyso charitably adopted old death explained that as he hoped to be enabled to discover the maternal parent of the lad and as he conceived that charley might afford him information calculated to assist him in that pursuit he had endeavoured to get the child into his power the letter which was found on the person of the deceased sarah watts said the earl doubtless furnished you with ideas of enacting a scheme of extortion against the boys mother should you be enabled to find her out and believing as you do that she is highborn and perhaps wealthy that letter fell into the hands of rainfordno matter how and though i have not seen it yet the nature of its contents have been communicated to me now answer meand answer me truly if thou cansthave you any farther clue beyond that which your acquaintance with the nature of that letter furnishes i have noti have not replied the old villain hastily if i had i should not have wanted to get the boy into my power that i might glean from him as much as he could impart to me i now then warn you to think no more of that child old man said the earl for he is already beyond the reach of your vile aimsand even were he not i would protect him you see that all your atrocityall your intriguingall your black wickedness does not invariably conduct you to the goal of success but moral lessons are thrown away on such as you we will therefore terminate this scene as speedily as possible then turning to his domestics he added you will repair into the storerooms of this house and you will so destroy and ruin all the rich garments and the larger articles which are there piled up that they will become comparatively valueless the jewellery you will convey into the subterranean and all those trinkets you will throw into the sewer to which there is an opening from one of the dungeons jacob you will guide my servants in this task no jacobjacob exclaimed mrs bunce hysterically have nothing to do with a business which silencesilence i command you growled old death turning a savage glance upon the woman and then fixing a look of demoniac hatred upon the lad who was already leading the servants into the adjoining rooms mrs bunce remained quiet in obedience to the order she received from old death and now relative to these housesthis and the one in turnmill street said the nobleman whose property are they they are my own freehold responded bonesbought with my money long long ago but you will not i will not rob you interrupted the earl emphatically where are the papers proving your title to the possession of this freehold in the ironsafe in one of the storerooms the nobleman quitted the laboratory but presently returned saying in a tone of authority the key of that safe it is herehere in my pocket muttered the archvillain but my hands are bound the earl took the key from the pocket of old death and again left the laboratory in a few minutes he reappeared holding a bundle of papers in his hand i see by the endorsement that these are the deeds which i require he said now set a value upon your property and i will pay you the amount but stayi will release you so that you may execute a document which my solicitor has already prepared and which simply requires the necessary filling up to render it available the nobleman drew a parchment deed from his pocket and aided by the papers which he had brought from the storeroom inserted the requisite particulars in the blanks left for the purpose he then removed the cords which confined old death who named a large sum as the purchasemoney of the freehold and for which the earl wrote a cheque on his banker without hesitation then the deed of sale and transfer was duly signed by old death and witnessed by dr lascelles this proceeding on my part said the earl when the business was concluded may appear arbitrary and even vindictive but it is necessary and is not instigated by the spirit of revenge i have paid you more than double the value of the property and therefore you cannot complain if you feel aggrieved remember that it is in my power to transport you for life on account of the outrage you perpetrated upon me by making me your prisoner in the subterranean which shall never be rendered available to you again i have now performed the whole of the task which i had imposed upon myself and you may all three depart thus speaking the earl unbound tidmarsh and having compelled this individual as well as old death to surrender their passkeys to the two houses he followed those two villains and the equally vile mrs bunce to the frontdoor the three passed out into the street but before they sped away old death raised his hand and shaking it ominously exclaimed lord ellingham i will yet be avenged the young nobleman did not condescend to offer a reply but closed the door and retraced his way to the laboratory well my dear arthur said the physician i think you have had to deal with as pretty a sample of miscreants as ever underwent examination none of those he added pointing towards the shelf on which the casts of the felons heads were ranged could possibly have competed with them do you approve doctor of all the steps which i have taken demanded the young nobleman you have acted admirably replied lascelles indeed you have behaved too well to the chief of those fiends by paying him double the value of his houses i would not allow even so vile a wretch as he to think that i had wronged him returned the nobleman you can now remain in uninterrupted possession of your laboratory doctor he added with a smile but let us see how progresses the work of destruction in the other rooms thither the doctor and the earl proceeded accordingly it would have broken old deaths heart outright to contemplate the rapid work which the noblemans servants and jacob smith were making of the task allotted to them in the room adjoining the bedchamber two of the domestics were employed in breaking the china tearing the clothes burning the silk handkerchiefs and the parcels of rich lace ripping to pieces the muffs and boas smashing the lookingglasses and pictures and committing a havoc such as only the peculiar circumstances of the case could have justified in the other storeroom the third servant and jacob smith were unpacking boxes and cases of jewels and crushing the various valuables with billets of wood the fires were lighted in both rooms and as much property was destroyed as it was safe to consume by those means the jewellery was all conveyed to the subterranean and thrown into the common sewer through that aperture which the hands of the nobleman had so lately hollowed in the wall of the dungeon the day dawned ere the work of destruction was completed and then the storerooms exhibited an appearance forming a strange contrast with their late wealthy aspect the physician returned to his house in grafton street and lord ellingham hastened home to pall mall leaving his servants and jacob smith to follow at their leisure in the course of the day he called upon lady hatfield to whom he had already written two or three notes acquainting her with the outlines of the numerous incidents which had so rapidly occurred since the moment of his escape from the dungeon and he now gave her a detailed and oral account of all those exciting occurrences their demeanour towards each other was that of an affectionate brother and a fond sister and when the earl bade her adieu they embraced with feelings far different from those which once had filled their hearts in the evening arthur accompanied by jacob smith and attended by only a single valet departed in his travellingcarriage for dover whence on the ensuing morning he embarked for france chapter lxvi mrs slingsby and the baronet again a few days had elapsed since the events related in the preceding chapter we must now again introduce our readers to the abode of mrs slingsby in old burlington street it was about ten oclock in the morning the breakfast things had just been cleared away and the pious lady was sitting in an abstractednay positively mournful mood holding in her hand the morning herald on which however her looks were not fixed there was something on her mind she was the prey alike to a source of disquietude and to the embarrassment caused by a projected scheme beset with difficulties which seemed insuperable at length a double knock at the door interrupted her painful reverie and in a few minutes sir henry courtenay whom she had been expecting was announced the baronets countenance was lighted up with an expression of joy and triumph and as soon as the servant had retired he embraced his mistress with more than his wonted ardour still that ardour seemed not to exist on account of her but rather to arise from feelings which required a vent it was an embrace that appeared to say congratulate me for i have succeeded you are unusually gay this morning my dear henry observed the lady somewhat piqued at his manner for her perception was quite keen enough to comprehend the real nature of the baronets emotions as we have just described them martha my love responded sir henry i have just brought a welllaid plot to a successful issueat least so far successful that there can be no doubt as to the result i dare say the project has but little interest for me exclaimed the lady you have become a general intriguant i am convinced sir henry and your conduct is not fair or proper towards me my dear martha i have before told you that it is impossible for me to remain completely faithful to you answered the baronet i would not bind myself to any one woman for all the world if there be a woman to whom i could so bind myself it is decidedly yourself thank you sir henry for the compliment said mrs slingsby a little softened but it is impossible i repeat moreover continued the baronet you must not complain of mefor i do all i can to render you happy my bankers book is at your service well well interrupted mrs slingsby we will not dispute indeed i have matters of too great an importance upon my mind to permit me to devote attention to petty jealousies and idle frivolities and i perceive that you have also much to occupy your thoughts but the revelation shall commence with you come henry tell me all you have to say and when we have discoursed on your affairs you shall listen to mine be it so martha said the baronet then drawing his chair close to that of his mistress he continued thus you are well aware how vexed and annoyed i was when you allowed the two girls to depart in so sudden a manner from the house and you are also aware how cruelly i was discovered and reproached by my nephew clarence added mrs slingsby i have not forgotten all you told me on that head martha returned the baronet and perhaps what i am going to tell you may set your mind at ease relative to that same nephew of yours poor clarence exclaimed the lady really touched as she thought of him he has been dreadfully ill ever since that shabby trick which mr torrens played him for three weeks he was confined to his bed and was delirious i know all that martha interrupted the baronet somewhat impatiently but do listen to me as i am going to tell you things which i have hitherto kept altogether to myself well you must know then that i was determined not to be discomfited by the abrupt return of rosamond to her fathers house and i was well aware that after all which had occurred between villiers and yourself you could not possibly give me any further assistance so i acted for myself i ascertained every requisite particular relative to this mr torrens i discovered that he is overwhelmed with difficultiestrembling on the verge of insolvencyand anxious to do any thing that may save him from so ignominious a fate i also learnt that he is a man who will sacrifice his best feelings and principles for money he has a mania for building speculations and he conceives that if he be only assisted with adequate funds he shall make a rapid and princely fortune love for his daughters he has not he merely regards them as beautiful objects to be sold to the highest bidderand on what terms he scarcely cares so that they become the means of producing him money such is the person on whom i have had to workand i have not worked ineffectually then you have formed an acquaintance with him exclaimed mrs slingsby an acquaintance cried the baronet chuckling i have formed an intimate friendship what in four or five weeks said mrs slingsby exactly so i obtained an introduction to him through his surveyor who also happens to be mine and under pretence of bargaining with him for the purchase of some of his houses i wormed myself into his confidence he at length informed me that there were heavy mortgages on all his buildings and that he was anxious to sell some in order to be able to proceed with others when i encountered the young ladies i affected to be greatly surprised that they should prove to be the daughters of the very mr torrens to whom my surveyor had recommended me you have worked systematically indeed exclaimed mrs slingsby with pouting lips but pray proceed sometimes i was enabled when i called continued the baronet to obtain a few minutes conversation with rosamond alone for adelais the elder sister usually remains in her own chamber a prey to the deepest melancholy but rosamond never appeared to comprehend any of the significant though well wrapt up hints which i dropped relative to my feelings concerning her it is evident that you proved either a bad tutoress martha or she a dull pupil i presume you are coming to a crisis henry said mrs slingsby for your narrative is somewhat of the most tedious i will endeavour to render it a little more interesting observed the baronet complacently a few days ago i called at torrens cottage and found the house in the greatest confusion an execution had been levied in the morning and the broker was there putting a value upon the property mr torrens was in a state of dark and sombre despair the young ladies were in their own apartment i had a long private conversation with the father he made me acquainted with the entire position of his affairs and i discovered that five thousand pounds would be required to redeem him from utter ruin it was then that i gradually unveiled my purposesit was then that i dropped mysterious hints of my objects and views at first he was astounded when the light began to dawn upon him and he caught a glimpse of my meaning but as i carelessly displayed a roll of notes before him he grew attentive and appeared to reflect profoundly the man who deliberates is lost said mrs slingsby quoting the hackneyed proverb and shudderingbad criminal worthless as she wasat the tremendous amount of guilt which she now more than half suspected to be already perpetrated or at all events to be approaching its consummation while we were yet far from coming to an open explanation continued the baronet as calmly as if he were narrating a history of but little moment an event occurred which hastened the affair to the catastrophe that i contemplated a sheriffs officer entered and arrested mr torrens for a considerable amountseven hundred pounds the execution levied on the property in the house was for three hundred and forty and thus he required an immediate advance of upwards of a thousand pounds to save himself from a prison and his furniture from a public sale in due course i requested the officer to withdraw from the room for a few minutes stating who i was and pledging myself that mr torrens should not attempt to escape i will not tell you all that then took place between me and the father of those girls let it suffice for you to learn that at the expiration of nearly an hours discoursevaried on his part by appeals threats prayers and imprecationshe agreed to sell his daughter rosamond as your wife exclaimed mrs slingsby in a hoarse hollow tone no as my mistressas any thing i choose returned sir henry courtenay emphatically mrs slingsby shuddered from head to foot how silly of you to affect horror at such an event exclaimed the baronet yesit is silly on my part cried mrs slingsby bitterly silly because i ought to have played a different part when first you touched upon the subject a few weeks ago but my god henryyou cannot meanyou will not surelysurely martha this passes all endurance said the baronet sternly if you do not choose to listen to me i can retire if you will not assist me there is an end to every thing between you and meand then how will you live what assistance do you require asked the widow in a low and tremulous tonefor she was shocked at all she had heard and she was terrified by the menace which the baronet had just uttered you shall learn answered the latter i advanced the sums necessary to save mr torrens from a prison and his furniture from the effects of the levy taking his note of hand payable on demand for the amountso that should he wish to retract from his bargain he is completely in my power i have agreed to give him five thousand pounds in allas the price of his daughter but he represented to me that the project can never be carried into execution until adelais and rosamond shall have been separated i was not unprepared for such an objection and i accordingly proposed that he should permit clarence villiers to marry adelais without delayher drooping health serving as the plea for this relenting disposition on his part i moreover promised my special protection on behalf of clarence for whom i can speedily obtain a government situation of far greater emolument than the paltry clerkship which he now holds then when the wedding is over and the young couple have quitted london to pass the honeymoon somewhere in the country you will request rosamond to spend a few days at your house and the baronet fixed a significant look upon his mistress as he uttered these words so pregnant with terrible meaning impossible exclaimed mrs slingsby if the deed were done herebeneath this roofit would ruin me ridiculous cried the baronet and he proceeded to argue his hellish project in a manner which showed how fully he had considered it in all its details and how artfully he had devised the means to render an exposure improbable illustration but we cannot place on record all that was urged by him or objected to by his mistress on this particular point suffice it to say that influenced by the menaces more than by the reasoning which came from his lips the pious lady at last consented to become the pander to his damnable machinations mr torrens shall this day write a letter to your nephew and invite him to the cottage said the baronet when the whole plan was fully agreed upon clarence will not of course be suffered to know that any interference on my part has brought about a reconciliation between him and the father of his beloved the marriage will be hurried on as much as possible and then rosamond will become mine but is clarence sufficiently recovered from his illness to leave his dwelling he is much better than he was a few days ago returned mrs slingsby but when he first awoke to consciousness after a months duration of alarming illness and almost constant delirium he received a severe shock which produced a partial relapse in a word he inquired concerning the highwayman thomas rainford and on hearing that he had suffered the penalty of death he exhibited the most painful and heartrending emotions but can he leave his room is he well enough to move out again demanded the baronet impatiently yes he was here yesterday answered mrs slingsby moreover a letter conveying to him such joyful news as those which mrs torrens will have to impart cannot fail to restore him speedily to health and good spirits thus far all goes well said sir henry courtenay and now martha my love it is your turn to speak i have consented to serve you henry in a most difficult and dangerous scheme observed the lady after a few moments reflection may i hope for aid and support from you in a plan which i have formed certainly proceedmy curiosity is already excited henry said mrs slingsby sinking her voice to a low and serious tone i am again the baronet started yesagain with child added the widow and on this occasion i intend to turn to a good account what would otherwise be deemed a terrible misfortune i cannot for the life of me understand you exclaimed sir henry courtenay i will explain myself resumed mrs slingsby you are well aware of the readiness which even wellinformed persons in this country manifest to put faith in anything monstrous or preposterous that may be proclaimed or established under the cloak of religion the greater the falsehood the more greedily it is swallowed there is that scoundrel and hypocrite sheepshanks for instance who was so completely exposed a few weeks ago he has taken a chapel somewhere in the tottenham court road and preached for the first time last sunday he has now become a dissenter and in his initial sermon he dwelt boldly and long on the errors of which he had been guilty he declared that he had been sorely beset by satan to whom he had for a time succumbed hence his disgraceful fall but he proceeded to aver that he and satan had since then had a long and desperate struggle together throughout an entire night in his bedchamber and that he eventually succeeded in sending the evil one howling away just as the day broke he therefore proclaimed that he had now emancipated himself from the thraldom of hell and was a chosen vessel of heaven once again this discourse produced such an effect that when he descended from the pulpit many of the congregation pressed forward to shake him by the hand and he is now in a more fragrant odour of sanctity than ever to what is all this to lead martha inquired sir henry completely bewildered by the long tirade relative to mr sheepshanks i merely mentioned the circumstances which i have related for the purpose of convincing you how easily the world is duped by persons professing extreme sanctity continued mrs slingsby to be sure ejaculated sir henry there are always plenty of fools to assemble at the beck and word of a knave and it is with these impressions added the widow that i intend to convert my present misfortune into an honour and a source of immense profit may i be hanged if i understand one word of all you are saying cried the baronet completely bewildered you are in the family way again it appears and yet you glory in the circumstance doubtless you have heard the story of johanna southcott said the widow with a glance full of meaning and you would imitate that imposture exclaimed sir henry tis madnesssheer madness your nephew who knows how intimate you and i are together would expose the miserable trick that is the principal difficulty which i should have to encounter said mrs slingsby in a calm tone and even that is not insurmountable i require your aid indeed on that very point the change which to suit your views has taken placeor will speedily take placerelative to the position of clarence and adelais already smoothes down much of the difficulty alluded to clarence will receive the benefit of your interest exert that interest then to procure him a situation in some distant colonyor the east indies if you willand his absence will alike render you more secure in the enjoyment of your rosamonds person and will remove to a distance the only individual who could possibly interfere with my project martha this scheme of yours is utter madness i repeat exclaimed the baronet i will have nothing to do with it if you attempt to palm so ridiculous a deceit on the world all sorts of prying inquiries will be made and the real nature of our intimacy must in that case be inevitably discovered noit shall not be done i will give you money to go abroad if you choose when your situation may render necessary a temporary disappearance from london but to consent to this insane project well well henry interrupted the lady terrified by the vehemence of the baronets manner you shall have your own way now you are reasonable said sir henry drawing his chair closer to that in which she was seated and beginning to toy with her but we need not prolong our description of this interview suffice it to say that mrs slingsby consented to abandon her atrocious scheme of representing herself as a second johanna southcott and on the other hand promised to lend her aid to the no less infamous conspiracy formed against the honour of the unsuspecting rosamond torrensfor which concessions the pious and excellent lady received a cheque for a considerable sum on sir henry courtenays bankers the plan which mrs slingsby had conceived would never for one moment have obtained any degree of consistency in her imagination had she not been well aware that there were thousands and tens of thousands of credulous gullssuperstitious dolts and idiotsmiserable and contemptible fanatics who would have greedily swallowed the impious blasphemous and atrocious lie in earnest belief of the christian religion and for profound veneration of all the sublime truths and doctrines taught by the bible we yield to no living beingbut it is not with common patience that we contemplate that disgusting readiness which so many of our fellowcountrymen exhibit to put faith in the false prophets and hypocrites who start up on all sides each with some saving system of his own not many years have elapsed since the reverend mr irving electrified all england with his unknown tongues and there were impostors and fanatics or fools and knaves prompt to give an impulse to that memorable delusion by lending themselves to the cheat in this civilized country tooin the nineteenth centuryin a land whose sons proclaim themselves to be farther advanced in knowledge and enlightening principles than any other race on the surface of the earthin one of the counties moreover where the refinement of intellect is supposed to prevail to a degree of brilliancy certainly not excelled in other parts of the kingdomtherein the neighbourhood of the cathedral city of canterburydid a madman at no very remote date assemble a host of enthusiastic believers in his horrible assumption of the name and attributes of the saviour of the world yesin the vicinity of a town presumed to possess all the benefit which the knowledge and learning of innumerable clergymen can possibly impart did mad tom successfully personate the messiah

conveyed for interment under a fictitious name to the buryingground attached to the chapel in st johns wood chapter lxvii the marriagerosamond a fortnight had passed since the interview between mrs slingsby and sir henry courtenay and the machinations of the latter had so successfully prevailed in accelerating the matters in which he was interested that on the morning when we must request our readers to accompany us to torrens cottage the marriage of adelais and clarence villiers was to take place the young man was still pale from the effects of recent and severe indisposition but the happiness which he had experienced during the last fourteen days had worked a greater physical improvement in him than six months sojourn in the south of france could possibly have done firmly believing that the declining health and drooping spirits of adelais had alone induced mr torrens to revoke a decree which was to have separated them for everand not over anxious to revive past topics in connexion with the subjectclarence gave himself completely up to the happiness which now awaited him and his adelais was equally ready to bury in oblivion any disagreeable reflections relative to the late conduct of her father mr torrens was cold moody and distant but this was his mannerand as the young people knew not what fierce fires raged beneath that aspect of ice they did not bestow any unusual attention on the subject the only source of grief which the sisters knew was their approaching separation for mr torrens had arranged for the young couple to proceed into devonshire and pass the honeymoon with some distant relations of his own who were anxious to see their beautiful cousin adelais rosamond was to remain with her father mrs slingsby not having as yet sent her an invitation to old burlington street for fear that clarence might throw some obstacle in the way of its being accepted thus stood matters on the bridal morningwhen adelais appeared preeminently beautiful in her garb of virgin whiteemblematical of the innocence of her own heartand when clarence villiers could scarcely persuade himself that he was actually touching on the threshold of complete felicity rosamondpoor rosamond smiled amidst the tears that flowed fast down her pale cheeks for she felt as if she were losing her besther only friend in the approaching departure of adelais there was a young ladya friendwho acted as joint bridesmaid with rosamond and there were two or three other acquaintances of the familyand of the persons thus enumerated consisted the bridal party the sisters had naturally invited mrs slingsby but that lady aware that her presence would not be agreeable to her nephew had sent to plead indisposition as the excuse for her absence and mr torrenswhat was the nature of his feelings now forced by his necessitiesor rather by that indomitable pride which urged him to make every sacrifice rather than boldly meet his embarrassments in the bankruptcy courthe had assented to bestow his elder daughter on a young man whom he disliked and to sell his younger child to an atrocious villain who had not even manifested the delicacy of hinting at marriage reader think not that when we record the dreadful fact of a father consenting to sell his own daughter for gold we are fabricating for a romance an incident which never occurred in real life such things have been done oftenare done oftenand will be done often so long as the human species shall exist the immense wealth of that corrupt and detestable monster the late marquis of hertford enabled him to purchase the favours not only of lady s but also induced that profligate woman to sell to him every one of her daughters and those daughters have since married titled men and live splendidly upon the riches bequeathed to them by the horrible voluptuary again but a few years have elapsed since a certain lady hsold her beautiful daughter priscilla to a most ignoble lord and the atrocious deed became the topic of numerous articles in the english and continental newspapers the tribunals of france having taken cognizance of the scandal we could make mention of innumerable instances of this kind the greater portion of which are however confined to the aristocratic circles for it must necessarily occur that the upper classes as they insolently denominate themselves are the most profligate unprincipled and licentious of all the sections into which society is divided wealth and idleness associated must as a general rule give a fearful impulse to immorality rich viands and generous wines must heat the blood and nights of dissipationballs routs soires and cardpartiesinflame the imagination the voluptuous dances which prevail in those fashionable assembliesthe indecent manner in which the ladies of the upper class display so much of the bosom that but little scope is left for the exercise of fancythe positive encouragement that is given in high life to men whose reputation as vile seducers is notoriousall these circumstances foster licentiousness and provide a constant aliment to sustain immorality again the morals of the fashionable world have not recovered from the effects of that dangerous poison which was instilled into them by the evil examples of the family of george the third and the flagrant conduct of the beastly voluptuary george the fourth the licentiousness of the princesses of that family became the public scandal of the day and from the ladies of the court emanated the fashion of wearing hoops to their dresses for a purpose which need not be particularly described but fashion subsists by the artifice of constant change and when hoops had enjoyed their day those ladies who had found them so convenient actually devised the scheme of giving vogue to a padding in front to make the wearers appear in the family way this is no fiction and young unmarried girls as well as married ladies actually submitted to this disgraceful and immoral fashion through servile obedience to the example of the princesses this was positively holding out a premium to licentiousnessbecause the fear of a false step indicating itself by its consequences was annihilated everyone knows that many titled ladies gloried in the reputation of being as they really were the mistresses of george the fourth with all these frightful examples in view how could the entire sphere of the fashionable world fail to become dreadfully demoralised and how was it possible to prevent the contaminating influence from spreading to the inferior grades therefore is it that the fashionable world especiallybeing the first to experience that influence and the most likely to perpetuate ithas not yet recovered from the effects of the evil example of the court true is it thank god that queen victoria has not followed the same course which so many of her near relatives adopted but still even her bright example can only gradually mitigate and not in a moment destroy the effects of the moral poison instilled into fashionable society by her royal predecessors previously to the first revolution in france the aristocracy were steeped in licentiousness and profligacy but a glorious nation rose in its mighthurled down a throne encrusted with the miseries of the peopleannihilated the bloated and infamous nobilityand even gave the proud and arrogant clergy such a lesson as they have never since forgotten the aristocracy of france have never recovered that blowand thank heaven never will the hereditary peerage exists no longer in france and titles of nobility are valueless thus by virtually destroying the aristocracy of rank and birth france has suppressed a sewer of filth and corruption which distilled its abominations through every grade and phase of society the aristocracy of talent has been substituted and the mechanic may now rise to be a ministerthe ploughman has his fair chance of becoming a politicianthe delver of the soil can aspire to the post of deputy france is regenerated england can become so only by the destruction of its hereditary aristocracy from this long digression we return to the bridal party assembled at torrens cottage and now about to repair to the adjacent church where the nuptial bond was to be indissolubly tied and to that church did the party proceedthe father who looked upon his daughters as the means of filling his pursethe daughters who knew not the utter selfishness of their sirethe young man who was so indescribably happy in at length accompanying to the altar her whom he loved so welland the guests who thought as much of the excellent breakfast which followed as of the solemn ceremony itself the banquet passedand the time came for the departure of the newly married couple a post chaise drove up to the doorthe trunks were hastily conveyed to the vehicleand adelais was torn away from the arms of her young sister rosamond who clung frantically to her an hour afterwards the guests were goneand rosamond remained alone with her father god grant that my dearest sister may be happy said the maiden her voice almost completely lost in sobs if she is not it will be her own fault observed mr torrens harshly as he paced the room she would have the young manshe set her heart upon himand i have yielded i suppose you are now sorry that she is gone and yet i dare swear you thought me a brutal tyrant for separating the lovesick pair a few weeks ago my dearest dearest father exclaimed rosamond profoundly afflicted and even annoyed at the manner in which she was addressedwherefore speak to me thus have i ever given you any reason to suppose that i was so undutiful as as to run away from the house with your sistereh interrupted mr torrens in a biting satirical tone a young lady who could take such a step would not be very particular in her observations on her fathers conduct heavens how have i deserved these reproachesat least today asked rosamond bursting into an agony of tears shall not the past be forgotten will you ever continue my dear father to recall those events which are naturally so painful well welllet us say no more about it rosamond cried mr torrens ashamed of having vented his illhumour upon his daughter and he paced the room in a manner denoting a strange and indomitable agitation the fact was that the miserable father recoiled in horror from the atrocity he had agreed to perpetrate and with an idiosyncracy so common amongst men who tremble upon the verge of committing a fearful crime he turned on the intended victim as if she were the wilful and conscious cause of those black feelings that raged within his breast he had not moral courage sufficient to retreat while it was yet timehe dared not make the comparatively small sacrifice of himself to avoid the immeasurably greater one which involved the immolation of his daughter rosamond was already deeply afflicted at parting with her sisterthat sister from whom she had never been separated until nowbut she was doomed to experience additional sources of grief in the harsh manner and alarming agitation of her father at length unable any longer to endure the state of suspense and uncertainty in which she was suddenly plunged concerning him she rose from her seatadvanced timidly towards himand throwing one of her snowy arms over his shoulder murmured in a plaintive tone fatherdearest father what dreadful cause of sorrow oppresses you now are you fearful that adelais will not be happythat clarence will not always be good and kind to her oh yes dearest fatheri am sure he will i am not thinking of the daughter who is gone exclaimed mr torrens suddenly interrupting the maiden and speaking in a tone no longer harsh but positively wild with despair my thoughts are intent on the daughter who is left behind am i a source of affliction to you father asked rosamond contemplating her sire in so plaintive melancholy and yet tender a manner that his vile heart was for a moment touched and he felt ready to throw himself at her feet and implore her pardon for the ill he meditated towards her tell me my beloved parent she said have i given you offence in any wayby word or deed oh if i have bitter will be the tears that i shall shed and sincerelymost sincerely shall i beseech your forgiveness no rosamond said mr torrens crushing the better feelings of his soul as he thought of the ruin that would envelop him were he to retract his engagements with the baronet you have not offended meand i believe i spoke harshly to you just now without a cause but let us talk no more on that subject compose yourselfwipe away those tears i shall now retire to my studyfor i have letters of importance to write but at that moment the wellknown knock of the postman resounded through the house and almost immediately afterwards a servant entered the room handed a letter to rosamond and then withdrew a note for me exclaimed the young lady in surprise while mr torrens blood ran cold and his brain whirled oh it is from dear mrs slingsbyi recognise the handwriting and hastily opening it she glanced over the contents mr torrens was about to leave the room as if the arrival of the letter were a matter of perfect indifference to him one moment dear father said rosamond detaining him by the arm you must read this beautiful letter which mrs slingsby has written to me and though i cannot think of accepting the kind invitation which it conveys what does mrs slingsby say in her letter then demanded mr torrens all his illhumour returning as this further step in the hideous plot reawakened his most poignant reflections what does she say that you speak in such enthusiastic terms of a mere letter rosamond placed the note in his hand and mr torrens turning aside towards the window read the contents as follow it has greatly distressed me my beloved young friend to have been unable to attend at the solemnization of the holy and yet deeply affecting ceremony which by the time this reaches you will have united my excellent nephew and your sweet sister but it has pleased the almighty in his inscrutable wisdom to afflict me with a severe rheumatism at this time as i assured you in a previous note and although i sincerely hope that by the blessing of that allwise being and the aid of the lotion which dr wagtail has sent me i shall be well in a few days yet i am compelled for the present to remain within the house it is my most sincere and heartfelt hope that your dear sister and my beloved nephew may experience all that happiness which the omnipotent may deign to bestow upon his elect one circumstance must essentially tend to smooth down those mundane asperities which alas they will have to encounter in the rough path of life and that is the religious faith with which they are both imbued for myself i can safely declare that if it were not for the consolations which the holy bible imparts to all who study its divine doctrines and for the solace afforded me by a few kind friends amongst whom i must include that most choice vessel of the lord sir henry courtenay i know not how i should bear up against the grievous pains wherewith it has pleased the most high to afflict me and which have just passed from the right foot into the left doubtless it is for my eternal welfare in a better world that i am thus chastened in this although dr wagtail with a levity unbecoming a professional man of his age and standing declares that if i keep my feet well swathed in flannel and take mustard baths on going to bed i shall triumph over the ailment but oh my dearest young friend what is flannel without the blessing of heaven what is mustard without the aid of the most high i am very lonely sweet rosamond and i am fearful that you must miss your dear sister much i know that mr torrens occupations take him much from home and thus you cannot always enjoy the presence and the consolations of your excellent father whom i regret to say i only as yet know by good report but whose hand i hope to press some day in friendship will you my love come and pass a week or two with me it will be a perfect charity on your part and i am convinced also that change of scene will cheer your spirits come to me my dearest rosamond early tomorrow morning god willingif your good kind father can spare you ever your sincere and attached friend martha slingsby the vile hypocrisy which characterised this letter enhanced if possible the blackness of that crime towards the consummation of which it was so material a step and mr torrens stood gazing upon the document until all its characters seemed to move and agitate on the surface of the paper like a legion of hideous reptiles swarming together but at length mastering his horribly painful emotions he turned towards his daughter saying and wherefore rosamond should you not accept an invitation as kind as it is considerate oh my dear father exclaimed the maiden i could not think of leaving you at a time when you have just lost the society of one of your children moreover i perceive that you are not entirely happyi fear that those recent embarrassments speak not of them rosamond interrupted mr torrens sternly for so great was his pride that he could not endure the idea of his own daughters being acquainted with his late pecuniary difficulties to return to the subject of that letter he added after a few moments pause i think you cannot do better than accept the invitationindeed it would appear unkind were you to refuse it mrs slingsby is suffering from indispositionand she is evidently anxious to have a companion therefore rosamond i must beg you to commence your preparations for the visit the young lady urged various remonstrances against this resolution but her father overruled them alland it was accordingly determined at length that she should repair to old burlington street on the following morning but when the morning came and the vehicle which was to convey her to london drove up to the door how appalling were the feelings which agitatednay absolutely raged in the breast of mr torrens acuteintensely acute was the pain which he endured in endeavouring to subdue those emotionsor rather in composing his features in such a way that his countenance might not indicate the awful warring that disturbed his soul with streaming eyes did rosamond take leave of her father and as she stepped into the chaise a presentiment of evil flashed across her imagination but she was youngnaturally inclined to look upon the bright side of thingsand too inexperienced to know much of the dreadful pitfalls which the artifice of man has hollowed in the pathways of the moral world her misgiving was therefore forgotten almost as soon as it was entertained and she was in comparatively good spiritsthough still affected by her recent separation from her sisterwhen she alighted at the door of mrs slingsbys residence in old burlington street footnote represented as the marquis of holmesford in the first series of the mysteries of london chapter lxviii dr wagtailrosamond torrens rosamond torrens found the pious lady reclining on a sofa and so profoundly absorbedat all events apparently soin the perusal of a chapter in the new testament that she did not immediately look up when the drawingroom door opened to give the young maiden admission ah my dearest girlis it indeed you at length said mrs slingsby in a dolorous tone of voice as she laid aside the sacred volume come and embrace me sweet rosamond i hope you are better today my dear madam was the sincere observation made by the intended victim of a damnable plot as she pressed her pure lips to mrs slingsbys polluted brow heaven blessed me with a good nights rest my love returned the pious lady and dr wagtail would insist upon my taking a little warm brandyandwateralthough as you well know i loathe alcoholic liquor which i do not consider to be a good creature of god nor fitted for our use but as a medicine rosamondand when accompanied by urgent prayerit is beneficial and now tell me sweet girl how passed off the bridal ceremony was the conduct of my nephew becoming and proper i could scarcely suppose otherwiseseeing that for years he has been benefited by the advice and example which it has been my happy lot to afford him and adelaiswas she much affected my love rosamond described the particulars of the wedding and mrs slingsby was in the midst of some very comforting remarks thereon when the door opened and dr wagtail made his appearance this gentleman was a short fat importantlooking personagewith a powdered head and a pigtaildelighting too in smallclothes and black gaiters and carrying a thick bamboo cane the gold head of which he invariably applied to his nose when he wanted to appear more than usually solemn he enjoyed a large practice and was yet miserably ignorant of the medical art what then was the secret of his success we will explain the mystery his father was a very wealthy man and paid a premium of to apprentice the subject of this sketch to the housesurgeon of one of the great metropolitan hospitals but young wagtail though cunning and crafty enough was a wretched dolt and only succeeded in passing his examination by dint of the most extraordinary cramming by these means however he became a member of the royal college of surgeons and set up in business for himself the housesurgeon of the hospital soon after hinted to him that he intended to resign and mr wagtail senior on hearing this private communication made to his son immediately sent the housesurgeon a fivehundred pound note in a gold snuffbox as a token of esteem for his high character and of admiration for his splendid talents this was intelligible enough the housesurgeon immediately began to canvass his friends on behalf of young wagtail as his successor and when the resignation of the said housesurgeon was publicly announced the majority of the persons who had a right to vote were already enlisted in the cause of mr wagtail several of the most eminent surgeons became candidates for the vacancy but their abilities stood no chance when weighed against mr wagtails interestand mr wagtail was accordingly elected he thus jumped into renown and handsome emolument almost as soon as he entered the profession and things went on smoothly enough for three or four years until he one morning took it into his head to cut off a mans leg when amputation was positively unnecessary a disturbance ensuedthe thing got into the newspapersand mr wagtail employed three poor authors constantly for six months at halfacrown a day each to get up the pamphlets which he issued in his defence he so inundated the british public with his printed statements that he literally bullied or persuaded the majority into a belief that he was right after all and then with becoming indignation he threw up his berth at the hospitaltook a magnificent house at the west endgot his doctors diploma at the same timeand announced through the medium of the morning post morning herald and st jamess chronicle that dr wagtail might be consulted daily at his residence from till his father died soon afterwards leaving him a handsome fortune and as the doctor when the time of mourning which he cut as short as possible had expired began to give splendid entertainments his dinners procured him friends and his friends procured him patients in fact he eventually rose so high in public estimation at the west end that he was quoted as the rival of the celebrated dr lascellesbut wise men shook their heads as much as to intimate that dr lascelles had more medical knowledge in his little finger than dr wagtail possessed in his entire form but then dr wagtail was so importantlooking and had such a knowing and mysterious way with himand he never insulted his patients as dr lascelles sometimes did by telling them that they had nothing the matter with them but were mere hypochondriacs on the contrary he would gratify their fancies by prescribing pills and draughts till he made them ill in reality and then he had some little trouble in curing them again but as he administered plenty of medicineshook his head a great many times even when ordering a footbath or a bread poulticeand dropped mysterious hints about its being very fortunate that he was called in just at that precise moment or else there would have been no answering for the consequencesas he did all this and was particularly liberal to nurses valets and ladiesmaids he had worked his way up to a degree of eminence which real talent legitimately exercised struggled fruitlessly in ninetynine cases out of a hundred to arrive at such was the physician who now entered the drawingroom where mrs slingsby was reclining on the sofa with rosamond seated near her bowing with important condescension to miss torrens the doctor quietly took the chair which she vacated because it was close to his patient rosamond was about to quit the room when mrs slingsby desired her to remain adding dr wagtail does not require your absence my love there is nothing so very important in my caseis there doctor important my dear madam is not precisely the word returned the physician with his goldheaded cane to his nose inasmuch as your ailment is importantas all ailments are when though trivial in themselves they may lead to dangerous consequences but how are we today my dear madam how is the pain in our legs did we suffer much last night or did we feel a leetle easier yes doctorthank you replied the sufferer who had nothing at all the matter with her but who had merely simulated indisposition as an excuse for absenting herself from the bridal i passed a better nightby the blessing of heaven wellcomeand so we are getting on nicely eh observed the doctor and what did we take for supper last evening a little gruel doctoras you ordered answered mrs slingsby in a lachrymose tonewhich was really natural enough seeing that she could have eaten a roast fowl instead of the farinaceous slop and did we take a very leetle brandyandwater hot asked dr wagtail in a most insinuating voice as much as to say that he knew very well how revolting such a beverage must have been to mrs slingsby although in his heart he had recommended it simply because experience had taught him that ladies of a certain age did not object to a small dose of cognacdid we take a leetle brandyandwater i did so far follow your advice doctor replied mrs slingsby but i hope i am not to continue it indeed but we must though my dear madam exclaimed the physician shaking his head most solemnly and with all the air of a man enforcing the necessity of swallowing a nauseous draughtindeed but we must thoughand a trifle stronger tooa mere triflebut stronger it must be or i really cannot answer for the consequences and here he looked at miss torrens as much as to imply that mrs slingsbys life would perhaps be endangered if his advice were not punctually and accurately followed well doctor said the suffering lady in a more doleful tone than ever if it must be stronger it shall be but pray make a cure of me god willing as soon as possible so that i may renounce that vile alcoholic beverage we must have patience my dear madamgreat patience said dr wagtail with increasing solemnity as he rubbed his nose against the goldheaded cane indeed so long as this nasty rheumatism hangs about us we must keep to the brandyandwater the physician knew very well that his words would cause the rheumatism to hang about the excellent lady for a considerable timeindeed that she would be in no hurry to get rid of it so long as he proscribed the vile alcoholic beverageand he foresaw a goodly number of fees resulting from the judicious mode which he thus adopted of treating an ailment that did not exist and now my dear madam he continued how is our tongue ahnot quite right yet and how are our pulse then as the case was pronounced to be important the doctor lugged out an enormous gold stopwatch and bent over it with a mysterious and even ominous expression of countenance as he felt the patients pulse well doctorwhat do you think asked mrs slingsby looking as anxious and miserable as if she had been in the dock at the old bailey about to hear the verdict of the jury we must take care of ourselves my dear madamwe must take care of ourselves said the physician shaking his head our pulse is not quite as it ought to be how is our appetite do we think we could manage a little slice of boiled fowl today but we must try my dear madamwe must try and we must take a glass or two of wineport wine of a good body we must not reduce ourselves too low and this evening for supper we must take gruel againand the brandyandwater as an indispensable medicine afterwards i will endeavour to follow your advice my dear sir said mrs slingsby though heaven knows that the idea of the old port wine at dinner well my dear madami know it is repugnant to youvery repugnant interrupted the physician in a calmly remonstrative tone but the world cannot afford to lose so excellent a member of society as yourself consider your friends my dear madamexert yourself on their account triumph over these little aversions to wine and brandyand take them as medicines in which sense do i offer them and now my dear madam i will write you out a leetle prescription you had better get it made up as usual at timmins and jakes in bond street i have no interest in recommending them you knownot the slightestbut i am sure their drugs are good my dear madam which was as much as to imply that the drugs of other chemists were not good and we may here observe that the disinterested physician merely received a thousand ayear from messrs timmins and jakes for recommending all his patients to send his prescriptions to their shop the doctor wrote some professional hieroglyphics upon a slip of paper and scrawled at the bottom something which would have represented the name of snooks or brown or thompson quite as well as it did wagtail he then rose received from mrs slingsby his fee neatly wrapped up in a piece of tissue paper and took his departure holding his stick to his nose all the way down stairs the afternoon passed away somewhat tediously for rosamond and when dinner was placed on the table mrs slingsby contrived to do honour to the boiled fowls and though she held forth at considerable length upon her abhorrence for port wine she managed to swallow four glasses of the generous juice in a manner which rosamond considered highly creditable to her moral courage seeing how much she detested it shortly after dinner which was served in the drawingroom sir henry courtenay made his appearance the baronets eyes sparkled with delight when he beheld his intended victim at the pious ladys abode and looking more sweetly beautifulmore divinely interesting than she had ever yet appeared to him the blood boiled in his veins as his glances rapidly swept her slight but symmetrical form and as he thought within the recesses of his own iniquitous heart this night thou shall become mine it will be remembered that during the last few days of her previous sojourn at mrs slingsbys abode rosamond had been taught to form a very high opinion of the baronet but the pious lady had not gone so far as to instil any voluptuous sentiment into the mind of the young maiden thus when the baronet on the occasion of his visits to torrens cottage had addressed her in a somewhat equivocal manner she did not comprehend him and hence sir henrys reproach against mrs slingsby that she was but an indifferent tutoress still rosamond was predisposed to admire the baronets character as it had been represented to her by mrs slingsby and she was by no means sorry that he had arrived to vary the monotony of the evening he exerted all his conversational powers to please her and she could not conceal from herself the delight which she experienced in listening to those outpourings of a wellinformed mind and a richly cultivated intellect the supperhour arrived while she thought the evening was still youngso rapidly had the time passed away mrs slingsby partook of her gruel with as good a grace as she could possibly assume but she ever and anon cast a longing glance towards the more substantial and succulent viands spread upon the board the brandyandwater was however a consolation and this the baronet who mixed for her made as strong as she could wish and much stronger than dr wagtail were he really sincere in his advice could have possibly intended her to take it illustration shortly before eleven the baronet rose and took his departure mrs slingsby ringing the drawingroom bell for the servant to open the front door for him with a ceremony the object of which was to let every one in the house know that he had departed and the hour at which he wentin case of any exposure following the dread plot now in progress mrs slingsby and rosamond then remained in conversation for a few minutes the topic being the excellent qualities of sir henry courtenay rosamond my love at length said mrs slingsby before you retire to your own chamber have the kindness to lock the sideboard in the drawingroom and bring me the keys for really servants are so neglectful the beautiful girl departed with the alacrity of an obliging disposition to execute this little commissionbut the moment she had quitted the drawingroom mrs slingsby emptied the dark contents of a very small phial into the only halffinished glass of port wine which rosamond had left the infamous woman then resumed her recumbent position upon the sofa andoh the abominable mockeryappeared to be occupied with her bible when the artless innocent and unsuspecting maiden returned to the room here are the keys my dear madam said rosamond and every thing is safe down stairs i shall now wish you a good nights rest finish your wine my love before you retire observed mrs slingsby in a softly persuasive tone i am not mean but you know that i am averse to waste in any shape rosamond blushed at having merited the species of reproach thus conveyed and drank the contents of her wineglass then as it struck her that the flavour of the wine was somewhat less pleasant than it should bebut without attaching the least importance to the idea and forgetting it altogether a moment afterwardsshe ate a small piece of bread to take away the disagreeable taste good night my dear madam said the maiden bending over the pious lady and kissing her cheek good night rosamond my love returned mrs slingsby i shall remain here for a quarter of an hour to perform my usual devotional exercises and then i shall retire to my own chamber rosamond withdrew and sped to the room prepared for her she felt wearied and made haste to lay aside her garments and arrange her hair but in the midst of her occupation a sensation of deep drowsiness came over her and she was glad to step into bed as speedily as possibleomitting for perhaps the first time since her childhood to kneel down first in prayer a minute afterwardsand she was sound asleep three persons at that precise period had their minds filled with the image of rosamond in the solitude of his chamber at his lonely cottage mr torrens endured the torments of the damnedmental torments indescribably more severe than the most agonising of physical pain could possibly be mercenaryselfishcoldcallous as he was he could not stifle the still small voice of conscience which told him he had done a flagranta vilean awful deed which would fill his cup with a bitterness that no earthly pleasure no mundane reward could possibly counteract or change he felt that he was a monster in human shape he was afraid to catch a glimpse of his own countenance in the glassfor when he once surveyed it rapidly its workings were horrible to behold to sell his daughter for the filthy lucre which had tempted himit was horribleatrocious and thenthen at that very moment while he was pacing his chamber the fell deed might be in consummation he walked to the windowhow black was the nighthow menacing were those clouds that seemed laden with storm he started back with a look of horrified amazement was there not some dreadful shape in the airassumed not those clouds the form of a tremendous being with a countenance of lowering vengeance and awful threatenings no it was fancyand yet the temporary creation of that fancy was dreadful to beholdas cloud piled on cloud for an instant wore the semblance of a supernal moving phantom black and menacing with impending storm the guilty wretched father clenched his fistsgnashed his teethknit his browsand compressed his lips together to prevent his voice from suddenly shrieking forth in accents of heartfelt agony having remained for about twenty minutes in the drawingroom mrs slingsby summoned her maid by whose assistance she gained her own chamberalthough she in reality no more required such aid than did the servant who afforded it the maid helped her mistress to divest herself of her clothing and then retired and now mrs slingsby instead of seeking her couchthat couch which had been the scene of guilty pleasure when jacob smith had lain concealed beneath itseated herself in a large armchair to wait until the house was quiet i could wish that any thing rather than this was to take place she murmured two or three times heaven only knows what will be the end of it but henry appears so confident of being able to appease herso certain of reducing her even to the position of one who beseeches instead of menacingthat i am inclined to suppose he has well weighed all the difficulties of his task at all events he has promised to spare meto make me appear innocent but will rosamond be so deceived nono she will view me with suspicionher eyes will gradually openand yet thought mrs slingsby suddenly interrupting the current of her reflections she will be so completely in my powerat my mercyher honour will be in my handsher reputation will depend on my secresyoh how i wish this night was past she cried passionately for the deed which is to mark it is horrible to contemplate and the third person whose mind was so full of the image of rosamond torrens at the time when she lay downbeauteous and chaste virgin as she wasto rest beneath the roof of one whom in her ingenuous confidence she believed to be a pattern of female excellence and virtuethat third person was sir henry courtenay the baronet on quitting mrs slingsbys house had returned home in his carriage which was at the door ready to convey him thither and on entering his abode he had immediately repaired to his own chamber dispensing with the services of his valet he sate down to pass away in voluptuous reflections the hour that must elapse before he could set forth again to return to the dwelling of his mistress in old burlington street he was of that age when the physical powers somewhat require the stimulus of an ardent and excited imagination and he now began to gloat in anticipation of the joys which he promised himself to experience in the ruin of the hapless rosamond remorse and compunction touched him notif he thought of the grief that was to ensue it was merely because he rearranged in his head all the details of the eloquent representations he must make to soothe that woe besides his licentious imagination represented to him the beauteous rosamond more beauteous in her tears and he had worked himself up to a pitch of such maddening desire by the time it was necessary for him to sally forth that he would not have resigned his expected prizeno not if the ruin and disgrace of ten thousand families were to ensue leaving his house stealthily by a means of egress at the back sir henry courtenay hastened back to old burlington street a few moments after he had reached the immediate vicinity of mrs slingsbys residence the clocks of the westend churches proclaimed the hour of one that was the appointed time for his admission into the house nor had he long to waitfor the frontdoor was soon opened noiselessly and cautiously and by a person bearing no light but the voice which whispered is it you henry was that of mrs slingsby and noiselessly and cautiously too she led the way up stairs he having previously put off his shoes which he carried in his hand at the door of her own bedroom mrs slingsby made the baronet pause for an instant while she procured a taper and as she handed it to him and the light revealed their countenances to each other they shrank from each others gazefor human nature at that instant asserted its rightful empire and while the woman recoiled with horror from the man who was about to commit an awful outrage on a member of her own sex the man felt a momentary loathing for the woman who was aiding and abetting in the work of this foul night mrs slingsby hurriedly pointed towards a door at the bottom of the passage in the most retired part of the house and she then retreated into her own room a prey to feelings which a convict in newgate need not have envied meantime sir henry courtenay had passed on to the extremity of the passage and now his hand is upon the door he opens that doorhe entershe closes and fastens it behind him advancing towards the bed he holds the taper so that its light falls upon the pillow and the soft mellow lustre of the waxcandle reveals a charming countenance with flushed cheeks and with rosy lips apart for rosamonds slumber is uneasy though profounddoubtless the effect of laudanum upon the nerves of one so entirely unaccustomed to its use and who has imbibed so large a dose and one of those flushed cheeks reposed on a round full and naked arm like a red roseleaf upon parian marbleand the other arm was thrown over the bedclothes which had been somewhat disturbed by the uneasiness of the maidens sleep and left exposed the polished shoulders of dazzling whiteness and the bosom of virgin rotundity and plumpness oh what a charming picture was thus revealed to the eyes of the lustful miscreant whose desires were increased to almost raging madness by the spectacle he placed the taper on the mantel and hastened to lay asidenay almost to tear off his garments and in less than three minutes he was lying by the side of the young virgin but scarcely had his rude hand invaded the treasures of her bosom when she awoke with a faint scream and a sudden startthe result of some disagreeable dream and then the baronet clasped her with all the fury of licentiousness in his arms a few moments elapsed ere she was aroused sufficiently to comprehend the dreadfulthe horrible truth but when the torpor produced by the laudanum had somewhat subsided she became a prey to the most frightful alarms produced by the conviction that some one had invaded the sanctity of her couchand a glance showed her the features of sir henry courtenay she would have given vent to her anguish and her horror in appalling screams but he placed his hand over her mouthhe muttered fearful menaces in her earshe called god to witness his resolution to possess her and though she became bewildered and dismayedthough her brain whirled and her reason seemed to be deserting heryet she battled with the ravishershe maintained a desperate an awful struggleand so unrelenting was the violence which he used to restrain and overpower her that murder would have perhaps been done had not the poor victim become insensible in his arms and then her ruin was accomplished oh ye clouds laden with storm why gave ye not forth your forked lightningswhy sent ye not abroad your thundersto smite the hero of that foul night for oh while the father was still pacing his chamber in his own dwelling the hell that raged in his breast defying all hope of slumberwhile too the no less infamous woman who had pandered to this work of ruin was trembling rather for what might be the consequences than for the deed itselfthere in that room to which rosamond had retired in the pride of innocence and chastitythere was she despoiledthere became she the victim of the miscreant ravisher release melet me departlet me fly implored the wretched rosamond in a tone so subdued with anguish and with weakness that there was no fear of its alarming the house rosamond hear mei beseech you exclaimed the baronet as he held her by the arms in such a manner that she could not escape from the bed hear reason if you can what would you do whither can you fly the past cannot be recalled but there is much to think of for the future the occurrence of this night is a secret known only to yourself and to me your dishonour need never transpire to the world oh my god my god murmured rosamond in a tone of ineffable anguish my dishonourmy dishonour and she repeated the wordthe terrible word in so thrilling penetrating and yet subdued a voice that even the remorseless baronet was for a moment touched o rosamond he said in a hurried and excited manner do not repine so bitterly for what cannot be recalled think how i love you dearest oneremember that my passion for thee amounted to a frenzyand it was in frenzy that i acted thus instead of loathing me nono i do not loathe youmy godno said rosamond becoming the least degree calmer i now perceive how dependant i am upon youhow necessary it is that your love should console me but my dear fathershould he learn his daughters disgraceoh heaven have mercy upon me and she once more burst into an agony of weeping rosamondrosamond compose yourself said sir henry courtenay with that tenderness of tone which he so well knew how to assume and on which he had so much relied as an emollient means to be applied to soothe the grief of the victim of his desires shall i repeat how deeply i love theehow ardently i adore thee oh my best beloved do not thus abandon yourself to the wildness of a vain and useless despair but have i not been made the victim of a dreadful conspiracy said rosamond was i not inveigled hither to be ruined oh i will flyi will flyi will hasten home to my fatheri will throw myself at his feet and tell him alland he will pardon and avenge me again she endeavoured to spring from the bed but sir henry courtenay held her backand through sheer exhaustion she fell weeping on his breast then the task of consoling heror rather of somewhat moderating the excess of her anguish became more easy and the baronet reasoned and vowedargued and protestedand pleaded for pardon so touchingly and with so much apparent contrition that rosamond began to believe there was indeed some extenuation for one who loved her so passionately and who had been led away by the frenzy of those feelings of which she was the object oh why my adored girl are you so beautiful murmured the baronet rather attribute my crime to the influencethe irresistible influence of thine own charms than to any deeplyseated wickedness on my part i should have become raving mad for love of thee had not the fury of my passion hurried me on to that point when reckless of all consequences i had recourse to this stratagem i know that my conduct is horriblethat it is vile and base in the extremebut i sue to thee for pardoni so proud and haughtyyes i implore thee my darling rosamond to forgive me and oh if all the remainder of my life devoted to thine happiness can atone for my turpitude of this nightif the most unwearied affectionthe most tender love can impart consolation to thee my angelthen wilt thou yet smile upon me and the past shall be forgotten then you will make me your wife murmured rosamond yes sweet girlthou shall become minemine in the sight of heaven said the baronet who would have made any pledge at that moment in order to solace and reassure his victim but wherefore not have told me that you loved mewhy not have demanded my hand of my father and have married me as clarence did my sister asked rosamond a doubt striking to her hearts core i said many things to make you understand how dear you were to me answered the baronet and you did not comprehend my meaning remember you not that one day when i called at your fathers house i met you alone in the parlour and as you offered me your hand i said happy will the man be on whom this fair hand shall be bestowed and on another occasion when you and i were again alone together the conversation happened to turn upon death and i remarked that it was dreadful to contemplate the idea of dying but that i could lay down my life to serve you oh yesi remember now murmured rosamond and i even thought of those observations after you were gone and they seemed to afford me pleasure to ponder upon them do you not now understand then dearest angel how disappointment at finding that i was not at once comprehended drove me to despair said the wily baronet can you not pardon me ifthus driven to desperationi vowed to possess youto make you mineso that you would be compelled to accept my hand as you already reigned undisputed mistress over my heart if you will fulfil your solemn promise to make me your wife i shall yet be happyand this dreadful night may be forgotten nonot forgotten continued rosamond hastily because the memory is immortal for such hours of anguish as these but you will at least make all the atonement that lies in your powerand i may yet look the world in the face rosamondmy sweet rosamond within a month from this time thou shalt be my wife said the baronet with that assurance i must console myself returned the still weeping girl and now i adjure youby the solemnity of the pledge which you have made me and which i believei implore you by that love which you declare you entertain for meto leave me this moment the baronet was fearful of reviving the storm of grief which his perfidious language had succeeded in quelling and he accordingly rose and resumed his apparel not a word was spoken during the two or three minutes which thus passed and when sir henry was once more dressed he approached the ruined girl saying one embrace rosamond and i leave thee till the morrow one word ere we part she said in a hurried and almost hollow tone does mrs slingsby knowbut surely surely she could not have lent herselfand yet added the bewildered rosamond a second time interrupting herself abruptly how could you have gained admittance into the house and in the middle of the night oh heavens the most fearful suspicions calm yourselfcompose your feelings dearest said the baronet mrs slingsby knows that i adore youis aware that i love you because the long acquaintanceindeed the sincere friendship which exists between usprevents me from having any secrets unrevealed to her but wrong not that amiable that excellent that pureminded woman by unjust suspicions i entered her house like a thiefby means of a window accidentally left unfastened and in the same manner must i escape now not for worlds would i have her suspect the occurrences of this night therefore my angel compose yourself so that your appearance may not engender any suspicion in her mind when you meet at the breakfast table in the morningfor remember my rosamond you will shortly become my wifeand then as you yourself observed you will be enabled to look the world in the face and until that moment comes said rosamond with a deep sob i shall blush and be compelled to cast down my eyes in the presence of every one who knows me oh my godwhat cruel fearswhat dread thoughts oppress me and my sister is doubtless so happy heaven grant that she may never know the anguish which wrings my heart at this moment by every thing sacred i conjure you to compose yourself rosamond exclaimed sir henry courtenay now afraid to leave her lest in the dread excitement which was reanimating her she might lay violent hands upon herselffor by the light of the taper he could perceive that her countenance was ashy pale and that while she was uttering those last words relative to her sister her features were suddenly distorted by an expression of intense mental agony compose myself oh how can i compose myself she exclaimed and then she burst into a torrent of tears the baronet knew the female heart too well not to allow her to give full vent to the pearly tide of anguish and three or four minutes elapsedhe standing by the bed contemplating with but little emotion unless indeed it were of lust the beauteous being whom he had so ruthlessly ruinedand she burying her face in her hands the tears trickling between her fingers and her agonising sobs alone breaking the solemn stillness of the night sir henry courtenay waited until the violence of this renewed outburst of ineffable woe had somewhat abated and then he again endeavoured to console the unhappy victim of his foul desiresthe ruined sufferer by his hellish turpitude and rosamond had so much need of solace and was so dependent on hope for the future to enable her to sustain the almost crushing misery of the present that she threw herself upon his honourhis mercyhis deceitful promises and she even smiledbut faintlyoh very faintlywhen he again employed his infernal sophistry to prove the deed of that dread night to be the surest testimony to his ardent love at length she was sufficiently composed to induce him to take his departure and like a vile snake as he was in heart he crept away from the chamber of the defloweredthe ravished girl as he stole thus stealthily along the passage he observed a light streaming from mrs slingsbys room the door of which had been purposely left ajar he entered and found his accomplice still up nor had the abandoned woman felt the least inclination to retire to rest for her mind had been a prey to the most terrible alarms from the moment when the baronet had first set foot in rosamonds chamber i have succeededand she will not proclaim the outrage to the world said sir henry courtenay in a low tone i have moreover kept my word with you and have made her believe that you are innocent of any share in the proceeding mrs slingsby gave no answer but bit her under lip forciblyfor vile as she herself was she could hardly prevent herself from exclaiming to her companion you are a blackhearted monster sir henry did not however notice that she was influenced by any emotion hostile to him or if he did he cared not to show that he perceived itbut wishing his mistress good night he quitted the room and stole out of the house chapter lxix misery and vice a week had elapsed since the perpetration of the atrocity described in the preceding chapter the scene changes to a miserable garret in one of the foul courts leading out of king street st giless it was about eight oclock in the evening and the rain pattered on the roof and against the little window of the wretched room which small as it was was scarcely lighted by the candle that flickered with the draught gushing in from beneath the door on a mean and sordid mattress stretched upon the floor and with but a thin and torn blanket to cover him lay a man who was not in reality above fiveandtwenty but who seemed nearly double that ageso ghastly was his countenance and so attenuated was his form with sickness and want near him a young femalealmost a mere girlwas seated on a broken chair her apparel was mean and so scanty that she shivered with the cold and though the traces of famine and care were plainly visible upon her features yet they had not carried their ravages so far as to efface the prettiness which naturally characterised the composition of that countenance beautiful she was not nor ever had been but goodlooking she decidedly wasand though attired almost in rags and with an expression of profound misery upon her face there was something interesting in the appearance of that poor creature the reader will remember that in the earlier chapters of this tale we introduced him to one of those dens of iniquity called low lodginghouses in castle street long acre and he will also recollect that a mock marriage took place in that paddingken between a thief called josh pedler and a poor labourers daughter named matilda briggs the man lying on the mattress in the garret was josh pedler and the girl sitting near him was matilda briggs well now suddenly exclaimed pedler as he raised himself with difficulty to a sitting posture what do you say in answer to my last question are we to die of starvation or are we to have bread by some means or another matilda burst into tears and wrung her hands bitterly dont sit whimpering there damn your eyes cried the ruffian blubbering wont do no goodand you know that as well as me here have i been on my beamends as one may say for the last three weeks and unable to go about to pick up a single farthingthe landlord swears he will have some money tomorrow morningall the things is pawnedand here am i only wanting a little proper nourishment to set me on my legs again but that i cant get god knows i have starved myself to give you all i could josh said matilda her voice broken with frequent and agonising sobs when you have asked me if i had kept enough meat or bread for myself i always answered yes and i turned my back towards you that you mightnt see how muchor rather how little i had kept back but what can i do my father and mother are gone back into the country to throw themselves on their parishi have no friends to apply toand yours seem unable to assist you at present something must be done tilda said the man we cant starvewe must do any thing rather than that i am as hungry as the very devil nowand i know that if i had a good steak and some porter it would put me all right again but my god we have not even the means to buy a penny roll almost shrieked the young woman there isnt a thing left to pawn i have nothing but this old gown on my backevery thing else has gonegone she added hysterically as she threw a wild glance around the naked and dismantled garret how cold it is too what can we do what can we do and she rocked herself to and fro in a manner denoting an utter despair you keep asking what can be done said josh pedler brutally and yet you know all the time that theres only one thing to be done and that it must come to that at last matilda started and turned a glance of horrified amazement upon her companion wellso i suppose you understand what i mean continued the ruffian and therefore theres no use in gammoning about it no longer were starving and theres the rent to pay thats one side of the question youre a goodlooking young ooman and can do as other vimen do thats tother side of the question oh joshand would you have me become a prostitute shrieked matilda in a tone of mingled horror and reproach comenone of your nonsense my lady said josh pedler or i shall precious soon know how to settle your hash either go and earn some tin or cut your lucky altogether if i starve ill starve by myself my god i will not abandon you murmured the unhappy young creature terrified by this menace of separation from one to whom she had grown greatly attached noi cannoti will not leave you josh and yet lets have no more of this humbug tilda exclaimed the man brutally leave off whimperingor ill as i am ill give you something worth crying for come put on your bonnet and tramp or by hell oh you could notyou would not do me a mischief she cried clasping her hands together and if i obey you now in what you have ordered me to do shall you not hate and detest me ever afterwards not a bit of it returned josh pedler softening a little as he perceived that his point was already well nigh gained for the poor young woman found powerful incentives to yield to the commands of the ruffianshe herself being almost famished not a bit of it he repeated you ought to have turned out when i was first taken ill and then if id had common necessaries i should have got well by this time so be a good girl and see if you cant bring back something good to eat and drink and a trifle to pay the landlord with a bursting heart matilda rose from her seat and put on her bonnet and her scanty shawla poor rag which the pawnbroker had refused to advance a single penny upon give us a kiss afore you go old gal said josh pedler by way of affording her some encouragement to begin the frightful course of prostitution to which he strove to urge her she bent down and pressed her lips upon his forehead murmuring are you sure that you will not loathe me afterwards dont have any more of that gammon tilda he cried but cut alongor else i shall be tempted to bite a piece out of your face im so thundering hungry matilda shuddered from head to foot and rushed from the room as she was about to quit the house a door in the passage opened and a stout illlooking fellow without a coat and smoking a short pipe came forth exclaiming ah i knowd it was you by your sneaking step now i tell you what it is mrs pedlerif so be i dont have my rent or a good part ont tonight you and your man must tramp before i shuts up ive got people as will be glad to have a airy and comfortable room like yourn and as will pay leastways ill get rid of you matilda stayed to hear no more but rushed wildly from the house the threat of the landlord ringing like the knell of hope in her ears she observed not which direction she was pursuingshe saw not the passengers who jostled her on either sideher eyes were openand yet the surrounding and the passing objects formed only one vast voidone tremendous blank to her her pace was hurried like that of a person intent on some important mission and having some defined and positive end in viewand yet she had even forgotten the motive that had sent her forth into the streets that evening to dare the cold wind and face the pattering rainshe who had but so scanty a clothing to protect her there was a humming noise in her ears but she could not discriminate the sounds of voices from the roll of carriagesand even when she crossed a street it was through no caution exercised on her part that she was not ran over at last her ideas began to assume a more settled shape and her thoughts rescuing themselves as it were from utter confusion settled gradually down into their proper cells in the brainthe racking brain which held them she walked slower and with more apparent uncertainty of aim objects assumed a defined shape to her eyes and her ears recognised the various sounds which raised the echoes of the streets at length she stood still in the midst of holborn and tears burst from her eyes for she now remembered that she was therethere in the wide and open thoroughfareto commence the dread avocation of a prostitute she shuddered from head to footbut with no ordinary tremor it was a convulsion which began at the very heart and vibrated with electric rapidity and spasmodic violence throughout the entire form now then young vomanout o the vay cried a porter carrying a huge load upon his head and like a startled deer matilda hurried along she glanced to the left and to the right and beheld magnificent shops teeming with merchandise and crowded with purchasersshe lingered in front of the pastrycooks establishmentsand she stopped to devour with her eyes the smoking joints the piles of vegetables and the large tins full of pudding in the windows of the eatinghouses but she knew it was useless to implore a mealand moreover it was something beyond food that she requiredfor money to pay her heartless landlord she must have she resumed her mournful melancholy walk now slow in pace and drooping in gait time was wearing onnine oclock would soon strikeand if she were ever to take the first step in a loathsome trade now was the moment think not reader that because this young woman had become the mistress of a thief and had passed through all the training of a low lodginghouse and several weeks of misery and wantthink not that she was prepared to rush at once and in a moment on a career of public prostitution no she was attached to her lover in the first placeand secondly she was no brazenfaced slut whose mind had derived coarseness from intemperance or callousness from illtreatment she shrank from the path which alone seemed open to her she recoiled from the ways into which a stern necessity commanded her to enter while she was endeavouring to subdue the bitterness of the reflections which crowded upon her soul a young woman scarcely a year older than herself accosted her and said my dear are you come on this beat to be one of us matilda saw by a glance that the female was one of the lowest class of prostitutes and she burst into tears oh then you are come out for that purpose exclaimed the other well you must pay your footing at all eventsand making a signal to several of her friends who stood at a short distance she cried heres a precious lark a gal which wants to be one of us and is blubbering at it matilda was now surrounded by loose women who vowed that she should treat them or they would tear her eyes out vainly did she protest that she had no money tears and remonstrances were of no avail and the prostitutes were growing more clamorousfor it must be remembered there were no new police in those dayswhen an old man decently dressed but horribly ugly stopped near the group and asked what was the matter heres a young gal which wants to go upon the town and cant pay her footing explained one of the loose women and so she shant come on our beat come come said the old man dont tease the poor thing which is she oh rather goodlooking well my dearsheres halfacrown for you to get something to drinkand ill get the young woman to take a little walk along with me thus speaking the old man handed the coin to the girl who had given him the above recorded explanation and she and her friends were too much rejoiced at the receipt of this unexpected donation to trouble themselves further concerning matilda briggs when the loose women had disappeared the old man turned towards matilda and said take my arm my dear and ill conduct you to a nice place where we can have a chat together for half an hour or so and ill make you a present of halfaguinea before we part the unfortunate girl obeyed in silence but not quite mechanicallygratitude for the seasonable assistance she had received from the old man and the idea of obtaining enough money not only to buy food but also liquidate the greater portion of the arrears of rent due to the merciless landlord were powerful motives to stifle compunctious feelings in her breast the old man was one of those sexagenarian voluptuaries who dishonour gray hairsone of those hoary sinners who prowl about the streets after dusk to pick up girls of tender age and who seldom choose females of ripe years under ordinary circumstances this old man would not have bestowed the slightest notice upon matilda because she was between fifteen and sixteen and he affected children of eleven and twelve but the incident which had brought them together had given him a sudden zest for novelty and thus the grayheaded reprobate who was old enough to be matildas great grandfather tucked her under his arm and led her off to the nearest brothel with which he was acquainted it was eleven oclock when the door of the garret in which josh pedler was lying opened abruptly and matilda made her appearance well what news demanded the man anxiously youve left me long enough i could not return sooner answered the young woman in a hoarse and strangely altered tone but sit up and eat your fill joshfor here is a good plate of meat and the landlord interrupted the thief joyfully is paid every farthing i have earned a sovereign by yielding to the hideous embraces of an old man she added in a tone expressive of deep and concentrated emotionan old man whose touch was horrible as the pawings of an imp or some filthy monster but he gave me double what he first promised and now you may eatif you can she exclaimed with a hysterical laugh and you will sit down and eat with me tilda said the thief in a coaxing tonefor he now saw that his mistress might become serviceable to him and he was anxious to conciliate her nonot a morsel she replied impatiently i am not hungrynow besides even if i was it would seem to me that i was eating my own flesh and blood but i have got some spirits in a bottle joshand i can drink a drop with you i thought you didnt like spirits tilda observed the man contemplating with some degree of alarm her pale countenance on which there appeared an expression of settled despair oh i dare say i shall like spirits well enough now she said at all events i feel an inclination for them tonight but comesit up and eat thus speaking she spread open a large brownpaper parcel before the thief whose eyes sparkled when he beheld a quantity of slices of recently cooked meat a loaf of bread and some cheese forgetting how the viands were procured josh pedler began to devour them with the voracity of one who had fasted a long time and matilda hastened to fetch him some beer when she returned she sate down and drank two glasses of raw gin with but a few moments interval between the drams and then bursting out into a hysterical laugh she said blue ruin is capital stuff i feel myself fit for any thing now thats right old galcheer up exclaimed josh pedler take another glassand then youll be able to eat a bit of this meat wellperhaps i may cried matilda i was tipsy when you and me were married by the old parson in the paddingken and ill be tipsy to night as its the first of a new period of my life damn it you are coming out strong tilda ejaculated josh pedler blue ruinpaddingkenwhy i never heard you patter flash before oh you dont know what you may see me do yet said the young woman in a voice indicative of unnatural excitement and what does it matter perhaps youll hear me cursing and swearing tomorrow any thingany thing she added her voice changing to a tone of deep intense feelingany thing so long as one can only grow hardened and having tossed off a third glass of liquor she accepted and ate the portion of food that josh pedler handed to heralthough but a few minutes before she recoiled from it as if it were her own flesh and blood now you are acting like a sensible woman said josh and you make me feel more comfortable but when you first come in i couldnt make out what the devil possessed you you looked all queer likejust as if you was going to commit suicide suicideha ha laughed matilda strangely welli did think of it as i was coming home but i remembered that you was herehungrystarvingand too ill to get up and shift for yourself so i came back josh but wont you have some gin you dont know what good it does one if i had only taken some before i went out just nowthat is if i had had the money to buy iti shouldnt have gone whimpering along the street as i did no wonder all the poor girls who walk the pavement drink so much gin i am already quite another person i do declare that i could sing but here comes some one up the stairs it cant be for us yes it is though said josh pedler as the heavy steps of a man halted at the door to which a fist was applied by no means lightly come in the visitor obeyed this invitation without farther ceremony and the moment josh caught sight of his countenance he cried joyfully tim the snammer chapter lxx tim the snammer the individual who rejoiced in the name of tim the snammer was a tall athletic wellbuilt man of about thirtytwo and tolerably goodlooking his attire consisted of a shabby bottlegreen surtout a dark waistcoat and drab trousers and he wore his hat very far down on his headprobably because it was too large for him his hair being particularly short all his superfluous curls having fallen beneath the unsparing scissors of a gaolbarber holloa josh my boy cried tim as he closed the door behind him why you are taking it cozie there in bed i have been desperate bad tim was the answer or i shouldnt lie quiet in such a damned empty garret as this here you may take your davy but when did you get out my time was up today at eleven oclock returned tim i called at the old crib in castle streetthompsons twentythree and stayed with muttonface till now she told me youd been ill and also where i should find you so ive come round to see you old fellerand may be arrange a little job that ive got in my head but since youre unable to get up tim my boy interrupted josh ive just had a deuced good supper and im sure of a breakfast and a dinner too and may be a supper also tomorrow and if i aint well with all that in two days time my name isnt pedler so if youve got any thing thatll keep so long do let me be in it matilda my dear this is my friend mr timothy splint generally knowed as tim the snammer and tim this young ooman is my jomen we was regularly spliced at the paddingken by old barlow and shes staunch to the backbone so now youre acquainted with each other and you neednt be afraid tim of talking secrets but how goes the gin tilda theres plenty leftand i borrowed two glasses of the landlord as i came up answered the young woman so heres one for mr splint call me tim my dear said that individual we have no misters and missuses among us heres your health tilda thensince thats your name heres to ye josh thankee but what plan is it that youve got in your head asked pedler ill tell you in a brace of shakes returned splint smacking his lips in approval of the dram which he had just imbibed you may very well suppose that ive no great reason to be pleased with the conduct of that scoundrel old death the damned thief cried josh he sacked the sixteen pounds and then never made a move to help you when you was had up again afore the beak no thanks to him that i wasnt transported said tim splint with a fierce expression of countenance the prigging wasnt proved very clearly and so i got off with two months at the mill as a rogue and vagabond but by hell ill have my revenge on the bilking old scoundrel that humbugged you and muttonface sal and whats more i know how to go to work too what do you mean tim demanded josh pedler why i mean thisthat muttonface knows where old death is hangingout responded the snammer she saw him last night in the borough and she dogged him into some crib this was about eight oclock well she was determined to see whether he lived there or notand she was afraid of raising suspicion and alarming him by making any inquiries so she watched near the place for a matter of three hours and he didnt come out so its pretty clear he does live there but to make all sure muttonface has gone over there again tonight and shell watch to see when he comes in if he does at alland then shell stay to see whether he comes out again if its all right you and me will just pay a visit to old death and ill be bound we shall find something worth the trouble of going for old death always has money about him observed josh and i should think that theres no one wants blunt more than you and me tim at this moment i havent a blessed mag returned splint if it wasnt for muttonface sal i shouldnt have had a dinner to eat when i got out of quod this morning till id prigged the money to pay for one and after all ive spent in thompsons paddingkens i couldnt get a lodging there for love i know but sal has managed to keep herself while ive been lumbered and now i must begin to keep her again shes got just enough to carry us on till either this business of old death or some thing else turns up and thats all i care about well said josh pedler i hope i shall be able to get up in two or three days and then im your man for any thing you like but i say tim what a life this is of ourn to be sure you dont mean to say youre atired on itdo you cried splint with a species of anxiety and almost convulsive shudder proving that a truth of an unwelcome nature and to which he never liked to be awakened was suddenly recalled to his contemplation illustration by god i wish i could turn honest man tim exclaimed pedler with unmistakeable sincerity its all very well while the excitement of drinking or business goes on but its when one is lumbered in bed as ive been for some weeks that one feels queer and qualmish tim thats why i always hate to have the least thing the matter with me i cant abear to have time to brew and mope over things i wish there wasnt no such thing as thought tim blest if i didnt often say so to myself when i was cooped up in that cursed prison josh exclaimed the snammer i tell you what it is people say were reglarly depravedthats the word joshand so they invent treadmills and all them kind of things but its quite enow for chaps like us to be left alone with our own thoughtsand theres no denying it now my idear is jist thisput a man like us into gaol if you will and dont torture him with hard labour but let him have time to think then when he comes out say to him heres work for you and a chance to get an honest living my opinion is that nine out of ten would awail themselves of the offer but suppose only one or two did itwhy it must be a blessin to society to reduce the number of them as preys upon it what do you think josh i cant abear to think about it tim returned the invalid thief now then tildawhat the hell are you piping your eyes for i spose you think my friend splint is a methodist parson but he aint thoughand dont mean to be damnation tilda leave off blubbering like thatand hand round the gin therethats a good girl blue ruin is the mortal enemy of unpleasant thinkingand thats why we all takes to it as natral as one does to opium when hes accustomed to it ive often thought josh said tim splint after draining the glass which matilda handed him that i should like to go over to america and bury myself in the backwoods that you hear talked of or read about i wish i had a chance and raly if we do get a good haul from old death i think i shall try the game for arter alland you and me may say it between ourselves in this here room cause matilda being a ooman goes for no onebut arter all theres few on us that wouldnt give up prigging if we could i wonder why they dont establish societies to reclaim and provide for menthieves as they do for unfortunit vimen blowed if i wouldnt go into such a place in a minute and do you mean to say exclaimed matilda wiping her eyes and speaking with strange energy that if you choose to leave off this kind of life you cant why youd be happier josh as a labourer with only twelve or fifteen shillings a week than you are nowfor i never heard so much from your lips as i have tonight who the devil will employ people without characters demanded josh pedler do you think that if you tried to get a place even as a scullion in a gentlemans family you could obtain it no such a thing lord bless your dear heart them as talks most about the depravity of the lower classes is always the last to give us a chance yesand yet we wasnt all natrally wicked said tim the snammer some on us was made so by circumstances and that was the case with me how came that about asked josh pedler who being in no humour to sleep was well disposed for conversation yeshow came that about inquired matilda feeling interested in the present topic you dont mean to say you would like to hear me tell my story do you exclaimed tim i should by all means answered josh pedler and i toooh above all things cried matilda particularly if you can showwhat you said she added hesitatingly you mean to say if i can prove that i didnt become what i am through my own fault observed the snammer welli think i can prove it but you shall judge for yourselves so here goes and with this freeandeasy kind of preface the thief commenced his narrative which we have expurgated of those grammatical solecisms and characteristic redundancies which if preserved would only mar the interest and obscure the sense at the same time we have kept as nearly to the original mode of delivery as possible chapter lxxi the history of tim the snammer my father was a small farmer in hampshire he had about thirtysix acres of his own all well cultivated and well stocked and free of all mortgage and encumbrance of that kind the farm was small enough god knows but it yielded a decent livingfor my father was as industrious as a beealways out by sunriseand my mother was as saving thrifty and prudent a housewife as any in the county they were not however mean novery far from that the beggar was never turned away unassisted from their door and if a neighbour got a little behindhand with his rent and deserved aid it was ten to one if the china teapot in my mothers cupboard did not contain a few pounds which were speedily placed at his disposal farmer splint as my father was called was always regular in his attendance at the village church on sunday and the only person who looked upon him as a meanspirited fellow was the landlord of the alehousebecause my father so seldom entered the george and dragon even to take a glass of beer at the barand never stopped there to pass an evening my mother was a very handsome woman and had been the villagebelle before her marriage with farmer splint this marriage was one of affection on both sides for though my mothers parents were very poor and unable to give their daughter any thing yet farmer splint preferred her to the wealthier young women of the neighbourhood on her side though my father was nearly ten years older than herself she refused the offer of a rich young farmer and became the spouse of a man whom she could respect and esteem as well as love the fruits of this marriage were two childrena daughter named marion and myself our mother found time even amongst the numerous duties and cares of the household to teach us to read and write the village schoolmaster then taught us a little arithmetic history and geography and we were as well instructed as the children of poor parents were likely to be and much better than those of even many richer people living in our neighbourhood now from all i have just told you you will see plain enough that our mother and father were good honest moral and wellintentioned people their only care was to toil with all possible diligence to make both ends meetput by a little savings when the harvest was very plentifuland bring up their children in a respectable and decent manner my father was particularly anxious to prevent his boy from resembling the young blackguards of the village he would never let me play about in the high road at marblesnor yet go birdsnesting which he said encouraged cruelty and was also the first step to poaching but he did all he could to render me hardy and promoted innocent sports of an athletic nature altogether farmer splints family was considered to be the bestbehaved and the happiest in all the county it was in the year that my history now dates from i was then thirteen years old my sister marion was eighteen and a sweet beautiful girl she was with fine blue eyes flaxen hair and a figure that couldnt have been made more graceful if clothed in silk or satin she was at that time engaged to be married to the only son of a farmer in the neighbourhood and who was well to do in the world a finer fellow than young george dalton you would never wish to see and when he and marion walked to church arminarm on a sunday every one noticed them as much as to express a conviction of the fitness of the intended union of such a handsome manly youth and such a modest pretty girl well it was the summer of and the marriage was to take place in october when all the harvest was got in and the good ale was brewed for the ensuing year every thing appeared gay and smiling for the young people for georges father had promised to give up his farm to his son but to continue to live in the house as soon as marion should have become his daughterinlaw about three miles from our farm stood the beautiful seat of squire bulkeley this gentleman had been left an orphan when young and his estates were managed by his guardians until he came of age he living with one of them in london but when he attained his majority he soon showed himself to be tired of a london life and he came down to take possession of bulkeley hall and settle there this was in the beginning of but for two or three months the squire kept himself pretty quiet all of a sudden however he became as gay as he was before tranquil and retired and this change we learnt arose in consequence of his guardians leaving him they having accompanied him to the hall and remained there until all the papers and deeds connected with his accession to his property were signed the moment they were gone a number of fashionable gentlemen from london arrived as guests at the old mansion and the long silent rooms echoed to the sounds of their late revellings then there were steeplechases and horseracing and cockfighting and badgerbaiting and all kinds of sports of that nature and sometimes the young squire was more than half tipsy when he lounged into church in the middle of the sunday evening service his residence at the hall did no good to the village tradespeople because he had every thing sent down from londonand thus no one was rejoiced at his settling in that neighbourhood my parents particularly had no good opinion of squire bulkeley but as the farm was their own they had no positive fear of him although our land joined his estates this was not so however with the daltons who were only tenantfarmers and rented their fifty or sixty acres of the squire the farm had been in old daltons family for many many years and was one of the best tilled and best stocked in the county and as mr dalton was always regular with his rent it did not seem probable that the lease which was shortly to expire would be refused renewal one morningit was in the month of june i remember marion and myself happened to be alone together in the house when the squire attended by his groom rode up to the door marion sent me out to learn the cause of his visit this is farmer splints my boy i believe said the squire who i should observe was a handsome young man in spite of his dissipated appearance i replied in the affirmative adding that my father was not at home who is at home then asked the squire for i caught a glimpse of a face so pretty just now at the window that i should not mind beholding it againthat was my sister marion sir i answered not seeing any thing insolent in his remark but perhaps rather pleased by it as it flattered a sister of whom i was very fondwell my boy said the squire leaping from his horse here is a crown for you and now be off and try and find your father as i want to speak to him in the mean time i will walk in and rest myself catching the coin which he threw me i hurried away delighted with the handsome present and naturally thinking that the visit of so liberal a gentleman must be with a motive beneficial to my father but after hunting every where for him about the farm i remembered that he and my mother had gone to the village to make some purchases the village was a mile and a half distant from our house and as i knew that they would be back to dinner at one i returned straight home expecting to find them already arrived the groom was walking the horses up and down at a little distance and therefore i was convinced that the squire was still waiting within my hand was just upon the latch of the door when a scream burst upon my ears and immediately afterwards i heard marions voice reproaching the squire bitterly for some insult which he had offered her i hastened into the house and my presence appeared to disconcert mr bulkeley completely he was standing in the middle of the room as if uncertain what course to adopt in a case of embarrassment and he turned as red as scarlet when he saw me marion was at the further end of the apartment near a door opening into the kitchen and she was arranging her hair which had been disordered while her cheeks were also crimsoned but as i thought with the glow of indignation whereas the face of the squire was flushed with shame i advanced towards marion asking what is the matter why did you scream out and what has he been doing to younothing tim she replied but with a profound sob have you met fatherno i forgot that hed gone to the village but he will be home in a minute or two as its close on onei shall call another day then miss said the squire and he hurried abruptly away for some minutes neither marion or myself spoke a word i suppose she was endeavouring to compose herself and also deliberating what course she should pursue while on my side i did not like to question her at length she approached me and said tim you are a good boy and always do what sister tells you now mind and dont mention a word about that gentleman having been rude to me i have reasons of my own for it and dont say either that you were so long away when he was here i promised to follow marions injunctions for i was very fond of her as i have before said accordingly when my father and mother had come back and we were all seated at dinner marion remarked in an indifferent manner that the squire had called to see our father and that he had given me a fiveshilling piece i wonder what he can want with me said my father it was certainly very kind of him to make tim such a handsome present but after all i have heard of him i would rather that he should honour us with his visits as rarely as possible however he can do us no harmnor any good that i know of for he has no land to let at present and i am not disposed to hire any even if he had there the subject was dismissed at least so far as remarks thereon were concerned but i saw that marion was thoughtful and even melancholy during the remainder of the day about a week had elapsed and my father and i were one afternoon proceeding along the borders of our land just where it was separated by a quickset hedge from the squires estate when mr bulkeley himself alone and on foot suddenly appeared at a stile my father and i touched our hats with the usual respect shown by country people to great folks and the squire who had for a moment shrunk back on seeing us exclaimed farmer splint you are the very man i wanted to fall in with and that very field in which you are standing is the object of my business with youhow so sir asked my fatherwhy returned the squire you see it cuts awkwardly into my estate and breaks in on the very best preserves i have in this quarterbegging pardon sir said my father i could wish it broke a little more on your preserves for your hares and pheasants do a world of harm to my fields when the corn is just springing up i lost more than an acre by them last year sirso much the greater folly on your part farmer splint exclaimed the squire to persist in remaining a landowner you never can get a good living out of so small a farm as yoursi get enough for all our wants sir and am able to assist a friend now and then said my fatherwell but if you sell your land and become a tenantfarmer you will be much better off observed the squire suppose for instance i bought the land why you would have received compensation for the injury done to your crop by the game in my preservesbut i should lose my independence sir said my father in a firm though perfectly respectful manneryour independence ejaculated mr bulkeley with a sneer then i am to imagine that you consider yourself a regular landowner one of the lords of the soil may be you will dub yourself squire next squire splint ehi am plain farmer splint sir and so i hope to remain was the answerthen you will not sell me that fieldi had rather not sirbut you may have an equivalent portion of my sevenacre field over by the mill yonder and your property will be much more compactbut the land is not equally serviceable sir answered my father and therefore i must decline the bargain besides it may be fancy on my part but it is true notwithstanding that i am rather superstitious in making boundary changes in a farm that has been so long in my family unless it was to extend it by a purchase of land and that i cant afford so good day sir and my father touching his hat walked on i saw the squires lips quivering with rage as he stood looking after us and young as i was yet i thought my father had made an enemy of himfor the conversation which i have just detailed produced a deep impression upon me six or seven weeks had passed away since this little incident when i one day met the squire as i was going on an errand for my mother to the village he was on horseback and his groom was in attendance i was thinking whether i ought to touch my hat to him or not after his insolence to my father when he pulled up exclaiming holloa youngsteryour name is splint i believeyes sirah i remember you are a very good lad and i should wish to become a friend to you i think i gave you a crown once well heres another and now answer me a question or two did your sister ever say a word to her father or mother about that visit of mine some weeks past you knowi was so bewildered by the apparent liberality of the squire and boylike was so rejoiced at the possession of the coin which i was rolling over and over in my hand that i suffered myself to be sifted by him at will and i acquainted him with the injunctions that my sister marion had given me on the occasion to which he had alluded he seemed much pleased but not particularly astonished in fact it is of course easy to understand what was passing in his mind although i could not then fathom his thoughts the respect which my father had shown him when they met in the fields evidently induced him to believe that marion had not acquainted her parents with his rudeness to her and now he was pleased to receive from my lips a confirmation of his conjecture on that point it was also natural for him to imagine that marion was not in reality so much offended with him as she had appeared to be and it was doubtless with this impression upon his mind that he proceeded to address me in the following mannerto tell you the truth my boy i behaved rather rudely to your charming sister and i have repented of it ever since i do not like to call and offer an apology because your father or mother or both might be present but if you will deliver a note to her privately i will write one for i shall not feel happy till i have convinced her that i am sorry for the pasti am sure sir i replied i shall be most happy to deliver such a letter to my sister and she will be most pleased to receive it because she has often told me that we always ought to forgive those who show repentance for their errorsan excellent maxim my boy cried the squire he then desired me to wait for him in a particular shop which he named in the village and turning back he rode thitherward followed by his groom i walked on thinking that the squire was a much better man than he had at first seemedwondering too how he could have been so harsh and unjust in his observations towards my father and yet so ready to acknowledge the impropriety of his conduct towards my sister arrived in the village i performed the commission entrusted to me by my mother and then repaired to the shop of mr snowdon chemist and druggist as directed by the young squire this gentleman was leaning on the counter writing on the sheet of paper with which the obsequious mr snowdon had provided him and when it was terminated the squire folded it sealed it and addressed it to miss marion splint mr snowdon caught a glimpse of the superscription although he pretended to be looking quite another way the letter was then handed to me by the squire accompanied by a whispered injunction to be sure and give it privately to marion while another crownpiece anointed my hand at the same time i promised compliance with the instructions given and hurried back home george dalton was there and he stayed to dinner but he departed soon afterwards taking an affectionate leave of marion as usual my father also went out to his work my mother repaired to the dairy and i was now alone with my sister marion dear said i i have got a surprise for youa surprise for me tim she exclaimedyes a letter from squire bulkeleytim she cried you surelypray read it marion dear i interrupted her its contents are a most respectful apology for his conduct some weeks ago in fact he spoke quite like a gentleman about it and said how sorry he was marion no longer hesitated to open the letter but i saw that her countenance suddenly became crimson and she hastened up to her own chamber without uttering another word an hour passed away and she came down again having assured herself that our mother was still occupied in the dairy she said to me tim dear you must do me a kindness this very eveningthat i will marion i answered what is ithere is a letter for squire bulkeley she said and it struck me that there was something singular and not altogether natural in her voice and manner if you meet father on the way say that you are going to inquire after neighbour joness little daughter and never tell any one tim that you did this for me you are not old enough yet to understand my motives but when you are you shall know themi was never accustomed to question my sister nor even to deliberate on any thing she did and away i sped to bulkeley hall the squire was not at home and so i left the letter on my return to the farmhouse i told marion what i had done she said i was a good boy and repeated her injunctions of the strictest secrecy about a week after this incident george dalton took me out for a ramble with him i never saw him so happy and in such excellent spirits he spoke of the prospects of a good harvest and observed that every thing seemed to hold out a promise of happiness for marion and himself then he told me how glad he would always be to see me at his farm when my sister should have become his wife in this way he was talking and i was listening very attentively when as we were crossing a field on squire bulkeleys estate that gentleman suddenly appeared on the other side of the hedge holloa you fellows he cried dont you know youre trespassingi wasnt aware of it sir replied george touching his hat the field has always been used as a short cut by the people of the village and there have been a footpath and a stile at each end ever since i can rememberand if my guardians chose to permit the village people to use this short cut it is no reason why i should exclaimed the squire purple with rage and so i order you off at once both of youwell sir said george still respectfully but firmly we shall never trespass again now that we know it is trespassinggo back then cried mr bulkeleyas we are nearer the other end of the field we may as well continue our walk in that direction sir returned george it cant possibly make any difference to youyes but it does though shouted the squire i order you off and you shant advance another step thus speaking he sprang through the hedge and came towards us in a menacing mannerlook you squire bulkeley said george dalton without retreating a single pace you warn me off your grounds and i am prepared to obey but you shall not bully me for all thatbully you cried the great man now turning perfectly white do you think a gentleman like me knows what it is to bullyi think it seems very much as if you did sir answered george coollylowbred scoundrel insolent clodhopper exclaimed the squire you are not fit to stand in the presence of a gentleman go back to your marion and console yourself with my leavings in that quartervillain what do you mean cried george rushing forward to grasp the squire by the throatwait one moment exclaimed the latter raising his arm and stepping back a few paces i tell you that marion knows how to prefer a gentleman to a swineherd and that boy there can prove it he added pointing to me george dalton turned a hasty and angry glance upon me and i saw him become deadly pale and tremble violentlyi suppose because he saw that my manner was embarrassed and confused tim he said in a hoarse and thick voice do you know what this person means and he pointed disdainfully towards the squire who seemed to feel a diabolical delight at the evident pain which he was inflicting upon my sisters loverif that boy tells the truth said mr bulkeley he will admitthe children of farmer splint were never known to tell a falsehood interrupted george dalton and though you sir have made most cowardly and insulting allusions to marion you are well aware that there breathes not a purer being than she is nor a greater scoundrel and liar than you are and if i restrain my hands from touching you it is only because you are too contemptible for serious notice come tim let us move onone word george dalton cried the squire his lips quivering with rage ask that boy whether he knows of any thing that has ever taken place between me and marion remember i am your landlord and your fathers lease expires next christmaswe dont care for the threats of a man like you who endeavours to cause a breach between me and a young lass that never did you any harmoh not at all but a great deal of good on the contrary said the squire with a chuckle of triumph why it is but a week ago since that boy was the bearer of the last notes which passed between usliar thundered george dalton and he was again on the point of rushing on the squire when he checked himself and turning to me said now tim you are no storyteller and indeed i ought scarcely to insult marion so far as to ask such a question but can you not tell this man to his face that he is what i just now called him namely a liarnot if he tells the truth observed mr bulkeley coollyi hung down my head and wished at the moment that the earth would open and swallow me uptim said george dalton again speaking in a hoarse tone as dark suspicions were revived in his mind does this person who calls himself a gentleman utter facts did you ever convey letters between him and your sister come answer me my boy i cannot be angry with youi faltered out a faint yesthen god have mercy upon me exclaimed george dalton in a voice of piercing anguish as he clasped his hands convulsively together the squire stood gazing upon him with fiendlike malignity i cannot describe the dreadful picture of despair which george at that moment seemed to be at length he turned again towards me and grasping my shoulder so tight that i nearly screamed out with pain he said tim tell me all or i shall do you a mischief does marion receive letters from mr bulkeleyshe did one i stammered in reply because i took it to her the squire wrote it at mr snowdonsand did marion answer it he demandedshe did i answered buthave you ever seen the squire and marion together he asked in a hurried and now dreadfully excited toneyes once i said but and again i was about to give certain explanations relative to what the squire himself had represented to me to be the nature and object of his letter to my sisternamely to apologise to her for some insult which he had offered her but george dalton had not patience to hear me rushing upon the squire he struck him to the ground exclaiming vile seducer you glory in the ruin you have accomplished and then he darted away clearing the hedge with a bound and was almost immediately out of sight the squire rose slowly and with pain from the ground muttering the most dreadful threats of vengeance and i afraid that he might do me a mischief hurried off as quick as possible i was old enough to comprehend that george dalton believed my sister to have been faithless to him and the same impression rapidly forced itself on my own mind still i was sorry that george had not waited to hear all the additional circumstances which i was about to relate and it somehow or another struck me that he would call on mr snowdon the chemist i cannot now account for this idea which i entertained but i suppose it must have been because that persons name was mentioned in the conversation and because i must have thought it probable that george would seek the fullest confirmation of his cause of unhappiness it is however very certain that i hastened off to the village as quick as my legs would carry me but just as i entered mr snowdons shop i caught sight of george dalton standing at the counter talking to that individual he had his back towards me and the chemist was so occupied with the subject of conversation that he also did not notice my entrance i knew not whether to advance or retreat and while i stood hesitating i overheard dalton say and you are sure that the letter was addressed to marioni happened to catch a glimpse of the direction answered the chemist and i saw the squire give the lad timothy some moneythen am i indeed a wretched miserable being exclaimed george dalton and he rushed wildly from the shop not noticing me as he hurried by i was so alarmed by his haggard looks and excited manner that i was nailed as it were to the spot and it was not until mr snowdon had asked me two or three times what i wanted that i recollected where i was then without giving any reply i quitted the shop and repaired homewards i was afraid to enter the house for i felt convinced that poor marions happiness was menaced and that even if she was not already aware of the presence of the storm not many hours would elapse ere it would burst upon her head and when i did reach the farm my worst fears were confirmed the place was in confusion marion was in a state bordering on distraction and my father and mother were vainly endeavouring to comfort her an open letter lay upon the tablewithout reading its contents i could too well divine their nature and whence the missive came for some minutes my entrance was unperceived but when at last the intensity of marions grief was somewhat subdued and her eyes fell on me she exclaimed oh tim what have you done what have you been telling george that he has written to say he will abandon me forever and that you can explain the causereveal the whole truth boy said my father sternly as some atonement for the misery which you have been instrumental in producingi then related all that had occurred with the squire and at the apothecarys shopmy father and mother showed by their lowering countenances and searching glances towards my sister that they were a prey to harrowing suspicions but they did not interrupt the current of my story then when i had concluded marion without waiting to be asked for an explanation gave it in the following manner you cannot my dear parents think for a moment that i have acted unworthily imprudent i may have beenbut guilty oh nono one day the squire called here as you are well aware and he sent tim to search after you father this was most probably a mere vile subterfuge on his part for when tim had departed the bad man began to speak to me in a disparaging way of george and when i begged him to desist as he was wronging an excellent being his language took a bolder turn he paid me some compliments which i affected not to hear and at last his language grew so insulting that i was about to quit the room when he caught me round the waist oh how can i tell you his insulting languagebut he proposed to meto me your daughter and beloved by george dalton as i then wasthe detestable man implored me to fly with him to his mansionto become his mistresshere my father and mother made a movement indicative of deep indignation and marion then continued thusi started away from himi was rushing towards that inner room when tim returned i was now no longer alarmed though still boiling with anger nevertheless i had presence of mind sufficient to command my emotion so far as not to utter a word of reproach or complaint in the presence of my brother for in a moment did i perceive how necessary it was to retain in my own breast the secret of the gross insult which i had received i reasoned to myself that the squire was the landlord of the daltonsthat their lease would expire at the end of the yearthat it would break the old mans heart to be compelled to quit a farm which had been in his family for so many yearsand that george possessed a fiery spirit which would render him blind to the consequences of avenging on the squire the insults offered to me of all this i thought those ideas flashed rapidly through my brainand i therefore not only resolved to remain silent in respect to the insolence of mr bulkeley but also tutored tim to be so reserved that you my dear father and mother should not notice any thing unusual having occurred when tim brought me the squires note a week ago i scarcely hesitated to read it thinking that it might indeed contain an apology but oh you may conceive my feelings when i discovered that it repeated the insulting proposals made to me on the first occasion i knew not how to act and prudence struggled with wounded pride but i reflected that mr bulkeley was wealthy and powerful enough to crush us allfor we have seen instances my dear parents of the rich landowners ruining the small farmers who to all appearance were independent of them and again i resolved to adopt a cautious line of conduct i accordingly answered the squires note i implored him as he was a gentleman and a christian not to molest me more with importunities from which my very heart revolted i besought him not to ruin for ever the happy prospects of two families by any means of vengeance with which circumstances or accident might supply him and i conjured him to believe that in keeping secret all that had hitherto passed between us i was actuated only by the best of motives that letter was the one which tim conveyed to the squire and now my dear parents you know all i remember perfectly well that my father and mother were greatly affected by the narrative which my pureminded sister thus related to them and which was frequently interrupted by bursts of bitter anguish on her part she moreover added that she possessed the squires letter to her and a copy of the one which she had written to himgive me those papers my dear child said my father and i will at once proceed to neighbour daltons house if i find george at home i will undertake to bring him back with me to pass the remainder of the day and to implore your forgiveness for his unjust suspicions and if he is not there i am sure to see my old friend to whom i will give all the necessary explanationsmarion was somewhat soothed by the hopes thus held out and our father departed to the daltons farm which was about a mile off two hours elapsed before he came back and when at last we perceived him returning through the fields he was alone marion burst into tears a presentiment of evil struck a chill to her heart and as our father approached the serious expression of his countenance filled us all with alarm he entered and seated himself without uttering a word marion threw herself into his arms saying in a broken voice father tell me the worst i can bear every thing save suspensemy dearest child answered the old man tears trickling down his cheeks it has pleased heaven to afflict thee and all of us likewise through thee george has quitted his home andand what demanded marion hastilyand his father knows not whither he has gone continued he but when the first fever of excitement is over there can be no doubt that he will return old mr dalton is perfectly satisfied but marion heard not the words last addressed to her she had fainted in her fathers armsand when she was restored to consciousness she was so unwell that she was immediately removed to her own chamber for three weeks her life was despaired of and she was constantly raving of george dalton but at last youth a good constitution and the care taken of her triumphed over the rage of fever and she was pronounced out of danger alas what replies could be given to her anxious earnest questions concerning george old dalton had not heard of him since the fatal day when he disappeared was he no more had he in a moment of frenzy laid violent hands upon himself there was too much reason to suppose that such was the case otherwise would he not have written or returned as gently as possible was the fatal truth that no tidings had been received of him broken to marion and a partial relapse was the consequence but in another week she rallied again and then the first time she spoke of him she said in as excited a tone at her feebleness would allow had he ceased to love mehad he loved another i could have borne it but that he should think me lostfaithlessdegradedoh that is worse than even the bitterness of death slowlyslowly did marion recover sufficiently to rise from her bed but how altered was she the gay cheerful ruddy girl blooming with health and rustic beauty was changed into a pale moping mournful creature whose very presence seemed to render joy a crime and smiles a sacrilege the autumn camethe corn was cutthe harvest as plentiful as had been expected was gathered in had george been there then that was the period settled for the wedding and strange as it may seem it was precisely on the day originally resolved upon as the one to render the young couple happythat old dalton did receive tidings of his son george was alive and had enlisted in a regiment then stationed at chatham but shortly to embark for india the young man wrote a letter communicating these facts and referring to a former letter which he had written to his father a few days after he had quitted home but the miscarriage of which had produced so much uncertainty and painful suspense the colour came back to marions cheeks when she heard that her lover was alive and she said even though i may never see him more i can yet be happy for he will now learn that i am still as i have ever been his faithful and devoted marion meantime old dalton and my father were deliberating together what course to pursue and it was determined that the discharge of george should be immediately purchased the proper steps were taken under the advice of an attorney in the nearest markettown and in the mean time his father wrote to him a full account of the squires treachery and marions complete innocence the return of post brought the tenderest and most pathetic letter to marion imploring her forgiveness and assuring her that his extreme love had driven him to such a state of desperation as to render his native district hateful to him and had induced him to enlist i need scarcely say that marion now enjoyed hopes of happiness again her cheeks recovered their lost bloomher step grew light as formerly and her musical voice once more awoke the echoes of the homestead in six weeks time we heard that george was free and on his way home he cameit is impossible to describe the unbounded joy of the meeting and now there was no longer any obstacle to the union of the lovers nor any wish in any quarter to delay it the marriage was accordingly celebrated and a happier pair never issued from the villagechurch nor did ever the bells appear to ring so merrily before there were grand doings at our farmhouse for my mother was determined to give a treat to all her neighboursand the feast was such a one as i never can forget long after george had borne away his bride to his fathers house which as already long before arranged was to be the young couples home the dancing was kept up on the green in front of our dwelling though the cold weather had already begun to show itself but all hearts were gay and happy and warm with good feelings and the old ale and the punch flowed bountifully for it was one of those days in peoples lives which are a reward for whole ages of care ah when i look back at those times and think of what i wasand now reflect for a moment on what i ambut no i must not reflect at all let me continue this history without pausing for meditation the happiness of both families was now complete for even old dalton declared that he had so much reason for joy in the turn which circumstances had lately taken that he could even make up his mind to receive a refusal when he should apply for the renewal of his lease but just at this time fortune seemed determined to be propitious for squire bulkeley who was in london when the return of george and the marriage took place sent down a legal gentleman to make arrangements with his steward for the sale of a part of his estate in hampshire as he wanted to make up the money to purchase a small property in kent he was a wild and reckless fellow and full of whims and fancies and he cared not which portion of his land was sold so long as his preserves and park were left well it happened that old dalton hearing of this went straight to the lawyer and proposed to purchase the farm which had been rented by his family for so many years the offer was accepted by the aid of my father the money was made up and paid dalton was now a landowner but he did not remain so longfor he made over all his newly acquired property to his son george who laboured hard to improve it shortly after this transaction it was rumoured in the neighbourhood that the squire had flown into a tremendous passion when he received the news that the daltons had purchased the farm he had no doubt intended to turn them out at christmas but he had omitted to except their farm from the part of the estate to be sold the daltons cared nothing for his anger and george even said that he now considered himself sufficiently avenged upon the perfidious gentleman shortly after christmas the squire came down to bulkeley hall with a party of friends and the mansion once again rang with the din of revellers and now i come to a very important incident in my narrative one day george dalton had occasion to visit the neighbouring markettown to buy a horse and he stayed to dine in company with the other farmers at the principal inn the landlord of the inn dined at the same table with his guests and during the meal he informed the company that a poor discharged gamekeeper had died at the house on the preceding evening leaving behind him his only possessionthe only thing that he had been able to retain from the wreck of his former prosperitynamely a beautiful greyhound the farmers were interested in the tale and instantly made a subscription to defray the expenses of the poor mans funeral and remunerate the good landlord for the care and attention which he had bestowed on the deceased during his last illness the hound was brought in and every one admired it greatly the landlord observed that his wife had such an aversion to dogs he did not dare keep it on the premises and he proposed that the farmers should raffle amongst them to decide to whom the hound should belong this was assented to and the lot fell on george dalton he accordingly took the dog home with him and related all that had occurred to his father and his wife both of whom were much pleased by the acquisition of such a fine animal and under such interesting circumstances the poor gamekeepers dog accordingly became an immediate favourite about a week or ten days afterwards and in the month of february george went out early accompanied by the hound the morning was fine and frosty but excessively cold and george whistled cheerily as he went along ponto trotting close at his heels suddenly a hare started from her form and away dashed the greyhound after her george knew that he had no right to pursue game even on his own land and he ran after the dog as hard as he could calling him back but he might as well have whistled against the thunder ponto was too eager in the chase to mind the invocations of his master well after a short but exciting run the hound caught and killed the hare in the very last field belonging to georges farm the adjoining land being the squires and sure enough at that very instant mr bulkeley appeared accompanied by two gamekeepers on the other side of the boundary palings george dalton by god cried the squire with a malignant sneer on his countenancebut george took no notice of his enemy for he had promised marion in the most solemn manner to avoid all possibility of quarrelling with so dangerous an individuali did not know that you took out a certificate mr dalton observed the squire after a pauseneither do i sir replied george in a cold but respectful manner and i have done nothing that i am ashamed of for if you have been here many minutes you must have heard me trying to call the dog offwe know what we heard mr dalton said the squire with a significant grin at his gamekeepersand away the gentleman and keepers went chuckling audibly the very next day an information was laid by the squire against george dalton who accordingly attended before the magistrates squire bulkeley was himself a justice of the peace and he sate on the bench along with his brother magistrates acting as both judge and prosecutor the two gamekeepers swore that they saw george encourage the dog to pursue the hare and it was in vain that the defendant represented the whole circumstances of the case he was condemned in the full penalty and costs and abused shamefully into the bargain smarting under the iron scourge of oppression and acting by the advice of an attorney whom he had employed in the case george dalton gave notice of appeal to the quarter sessions his wife my father and old mr dalton implored him to settle the matter at once and have done with it but he declared that he should be unworthy of the name of an englishman if he suffered himself to be thus trampled under the feet of the despotic magistracy the attorney who was hungry after a job nagged him on too and thus every preparation was made to carry the affair before the sessions the event made a great stir in that part of the country and the liberal papers took georges part they said how utterly worthless as an engine of justice was the entire system of the unpaid magistracy and they denounced that system as a monstrous oppression instituted against the people well the case came on before the assembled magistrates but on the bench sate not only the justice who had condemned george dalton but likewise squire bulkeley the prosecutor himself judgment was given against my brotherinlaw and he suddenly found himself called upon to pay about sixty poundsthe amount of all the aggregate expenses which the original case and the appeal occasioned the money was made up with great difficulty and not without my fathers aid and though george dalton was thus relieved from any fears of the consequences yet he became an altered man he went to work with a heavy heart because he could not prevent himself from brooding over his wrongs he also found frequent excuses for visiting the village and on those occasions he never failed to step into the alehouse for a few minutes there he found sympathizers and his generous nature prompted him to treat those who took his part one pot led to another and every time he entered the alehouse his stay was prolonged care now entered both the farmhouses in one old dalton and marion deplored the change which had taken place in george and in the other my parents could not close their ears to the rumours which reached them nor shut their eyes against the altered manner of their soninlaw the great proof of dogged obstinacy which george gave was in his conduct respecting the hound those who wished him well implored him to dispose of it but he declared that he considered himself bound by reason of the manner in which he had acquired the dog to maintain and treat the animal kindly he however kept ponto chained up in the farmyard illustration time wore on the summer arrived and passed and the autumn yielded so good a harvest that the produce was a complete set off against the heavy expenses entailed on the two families by the unlucky appeal this circumstance somewhat cheered georges spirits and the birth of a fine boy restored him almost completely to his former gaiety in the evening instead of finding some pretence to repair to the village he sate with his beloved marion and happiness once more entered the homestead but misfortune was again impending over the head of george dalton it was one morning in the month of november that he was repairing to his work with a spade and a hoe over his shoulder whistling as he was wont to do ere oppression had wronged him and wondering also how he could ever have been so foolish as to pay such frequent visits to the publichouse in the village his mind was occupied too with the image of his marion whom he had left nourishing her babe and perhaps his heart was never lighter than at that moment but suddenly he heard a slight noise behind him and turning round he beheld ponto who having succeeded in slipping his collar had scampered after his master georges first impulse was to secure the dog but as the devil would have it at that very instant a hare jumped from her form close by ponto escaped from georges grasp and the chase ensued my brotherinlaw was bewilderedhe knew not how to act but at last he pursued the hound taking care however not to call him away went pontothe hare doubled and turnedgeorge managing to keep them in sight at length to his horror the hare swept towards a hedge which in that point separated the daltons property from the squires preservesthe hedge was passed by the pursued and the pursuing animals and the chase was now maintained on mr bulkeleys estate but the run soon terminated by the death of the hare and george after casting a rapid glance around to assure himself that the coast was clear sprang through the hedge to secure ponto he was however doomed to misfortune on this as on the former occasion the gamekeepers were up before he could retrace his steps into his own property and he was immediately seized as a poacher and a trespasser in dogged silence he accompanied the keepers to the house of the same magistrate who had before convicted him but that worthy gentleman was absent in london and the prisoner was accordingly taken before the rector of the parish who was also in the commission of the peace the squire was sent for and the case was entered into under all the unfavourable circumstances of a previous convictiona fruitless appealthe exaggerated or positively false representations of the gamekeepersthe malignity of the squire and the readiness of his reverence to believe every thing that was set forth to the prejudice of the prisoner the parsonjustice determined to send the case to the sessions and george was ordered to find bail this was easily done and he was accordingly liberated this second misfortune of the same kind plunged the two families into the deepest affliction and made marion very ill george said but little on the subject he refused this time to employ any legal advice in getting up his defence both on account of the expense and because it was notorious that the unpaid magistrates always dealt more harshly with those persons who dared to show fight with the weapons of the law again there was a great sensation in the neighbourhood and every one waited anxiously for the day of trial that day came and george left his marion on a bed of sickness to repair to the markettown the squire the parsonjustice and the magistrate who had convicted the defendant on the previous occasion and who had by this time returned from london were all on the bench the two gamekeepers swore that george dalton had coursed with the same hound which had led him into trouble beforethat he had persisted in keeping the dog in spite of the remonstrances of his friendsthat in the case then under the cognisance of the court he had encouraged the dog to chase the harethat he had followed into the squires landand that he was in the act of concealing the hare about his person when he was stopped by the keepers george told the entire truth in defence and implored the magistrates not to allow him to be crushed and ruined by the malignity of squire bulkeley he was then about to enter into explanations to show wherefore the squire persecuted him but the chairman stopped him abruptly saying that he had no right to impute improper motives to any member of the court the squire moreover indignantlyor at least with seeming indignationdenied any such selfish purposes as those sought to be imputed to him and it was very evident that even if the magistrates were not already prejudiced against dalton this attempt at explanation on his part fully succeeded in rendering them so george was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the county house of correction and he was forthwith removed thither without being allowed to go home first and embrace his sick wife you may suppose that marion was distracted when she received this intelligence although my mother went and broke it to her as gently as possible old dalton was so overwhelmed with grief that he became dreadfully ill took to his bed and died three weeks after his beloved sons condemnation my mother went to stay altogether with marion until georges return which took place at the expiration of his sentence but how he was alteredaltered in mind as well as in personal appearance he was gaoltainted his honourable feelings were impairedhis generous sympathies were ruined he was still kind and tender to marion and his child but his visits to the alehouse soon recommenced and he neglected his work more and more one night about six weeks after his release from prison a tremendous conflagration was seen in the immediate neighbourhood of the squires mansion all the outhouses and farms were on fire and despite of the assistance rendered by mr bulkeleys people those premises were reduced to ashes that it was the work of an incendiary was clearly ascertained and suspicion instantly pointed to george dalton he was taken before a magistrate and examined but nothing could be proved against him the magistrate however observed that he felt convinced of georges guilt and deeply regretted the necessity there was to discharge him i well remember that my father and mother evinced by their manner their fears that george was indeed the incendiary from that moment a dreadful change came over my sister marion she grew profoundly melancholy but not a murmur nor a complaint escaped her lips there can be no doubt that she was aware who the incendiary was and that knowledge was the deathblow to her happiness the child deprived of its proper nutrimentfor marion wasted to a mere shadowdrooped and died and the poor mother declared hysterically that its loss was the greatest blessing which could have happened to her this was the only allusion she was ever heard to make direct or indirect to the unhappy state of her mind and of her home george continued kind to her but kind rather in the shape of forbearance than in tokens of affection that is to say he never said a harsh word to hernor beat hernor slighted her but he gave her little of his society and was usually silent and thoughtful when in her presence one day the parsonjustice whom i have before mentioned called on the daltons and remonstrated with george on his conduct in absenting himself from churchi shall never go again sir was the dogged answerand why not demanded the clergymanbecause i got no good by it replied dalton the more i strove to be respectable the more i was persecuted the hound i liked almost as if it was a human being and which got me into two dreadful scrapes was obliged to be given away my father was killed by grief for my wrongs and my wifes sorrow has led to the death of my child my character is gone and i know that sooner or later i must be ruined as i have no heart for work every thing that one prays for and that i have so often prayed for has been swept away i mean an honest reputation the bread of industry a cheerful disposition and the health and long life of those who are near and dear to usthen you refuse to go to church any more said the parsonjusticei do was the answer and the law cant compel mewe shall see observed the rector and away he went a few days afterwards the squire issued a summons for george dalton to attend before him george went and found that the rector had laid an information against him under an obsolete act of parliament for having absented himself from divine service during a period of six months george was astounded at the charge but could not deny its truth the squire accordingly sentenced him to a months imprisonment in the house of correction and george was taken back to his old quartersto the farther contamination of a gaol this was another dreadful blow for marion and it produced such an effect upon our father that like old dalton he fell ill and soon died when george was liberated once more he was compelled to part with his farm at a great loss for his misfortunes and his absence on two occasions had left it but indifferently cultivated and moreover as my father was now gone it was thought better that we should all live together daltons farm was accordingly put up for sale and the squire became the possessor of the land once more george was now almost constantly at the alehouse instead of expending the money realised by the sale of the farm after paying the debts due in increasing the stock and improving the tillage of our land he squandered it away on worthless companions his wife never remonstrated when he came home late but would sit up for him patiently and resignedly and if ever my mother said any thing she would observe poor george feels his wrongs too acutely to be able to bear up against them there are great allowances to be made for him thus did about two years pass away and though i and the two labourers whom we kept worked hard on the farm yet it wanted the masterhand to superintend and we found that its produce now scarcely yielded a bare maintenance when every thing was paid marion gradually got worse but her endurance was inexhaustible it often gave me pain to look at that poor pale wasted young woman and think of her blooming charms when she first loved george dalton her heart was breaking slowlyslowlyslowly had she been passionate or liable to the influence of strong emotions she would have gone rapidly down to the tomb but she was so meekso amiableso resignedso patientso enduring that her very weakness was her strength upwards of two years had passed since georges second liberation from confinement when it was found necessary to raise money to increase the stock of the farm and buy seed for sowing george applied to the same attorney who had got up his defence on the occasion of his appeal and this man offered to induce one of his clients to lend a certain sum on georges and my mothers joint bill of exchange which he said would save all the expense of a mortgage my mother objected strongly but george promised so faithfully to amend his conduct if she would consent that she did agree the money was raised but a considerable portion found its way to the publichouse before any purchases were made even then george forgot his pledges and became if possible more idle and dissipated than before the bill became due and there were no assets to meet it the lawyer however undertook to manage the affair and he induced george and my mother to sign some parchment deed which he previously read over in a hasty mumbling way and in which blanks were left for the names of another person who appeared to be interested in it and also blanks for certain dates fixing the particular conditions as to time my mother inquired why the name of the other party was not filled in and the lawyer replied with a chuckle oh that is for the name of my client and as he has only lent the money to serve you and not as a mere lender motives of delicacy induce this suppression for the time beingmy mother did not like it but george urged her to sign and she did so three months after that an execution was levied upon the farm at the suite of squire bulkeley the lawyers accommodating client who had hitherto kept his name secret george dalton was at first a prey to the most terrific rage but he mastered his feelings at the intercession of marion and our mother we were compelled to quit the farm which now became the property of the squire by virtue of the roguish deed which had been drawn up by the unprincipled attorney and we retired to a humble lodging in the village need i say how we all felt this sad reversethis dreadful degradation my mother and marion strove hard to subdue their anguish in order not to irritate the already much excited george but there were moments when his outbursts of rage were furious in the extreme he invoked curses upon the head of the squire whom he denounced as the murderer of his father and of mine and also of his child and he vowed to wreak a deadly vengeance upon him at the alehouse it seems these threats were repeated accompanied with the bitterest imprecations on the following day george was arrested and conveyed before the parsonjustice on a charge of threatening the life of squire bulkeley he was ordered to find good bail for keeping the peace but security was impossible in respect to one so fallen lost and characterless as he to prison then again he was sent and for three months he languished there doubtless brooding over the awful wrongs which the squire had heaped upon him and all this time the squire held up his head high and no one in his own sphere of life seemed to think that he had acted at all unjustly or tyrannically on the contrary the gentry and the influential farmers in the neighbourhood looked on george dalton as an irreclaimable scamp who had only got what he well deserved even those persons of the poorer class who were formerly our friends looked coldly on us and shook their heads when the name of george dalton was mentioned so sure is it that if you give a dog a bad name you may hang him we lived as sparingly as possible on the wreck of our little property during the three months that georges third imprisonment lasted but i found it very difficult to get work as the farmers said that i was as bad as my brotherinlaw and yet there was not a steadier lad in the whole county than myself and though invited i never set foot in the alehouse i was moreover regular in attendance at church along with my mother and sister but i got a bad name without deserving it and even when i could procure a little employment i was subjected to a thousand annoyances unpleasant hints would be dropped about the burning down of the squires outhouses and the name of george dalton was darkly alluded to in connexion with that business or if i refused on a saturday night to accompany my fellowlabourers to the alehouse i was taunted with knowing something that i was afraid of confessing in my cups at that time i often thought of running away and seeking my fortune elsewhere but when i looked at my poor mother now deprived of almost necessaries and my sister pining away i had not the heart to do it besides i was greatly attached to george dalton and was anxious to see in what state of mind he would come out of prison three times during his incarceration was marion allowed to visit him and on each occasion she returned home to our humble lodging weeping bitterly neither my mother nor myself ever questioned her much for we knew her extreme devotion to george and that she would not only always endeavour to conceal his failings as much as possible but that she likewise strove to hold out hopes of his complete reformation but when he was emancipated once more he had become sullen dogged and moroseforbearing only in respect to marion to whom he could no longer be said to be positively kind he did not mention the name of the squire nor in any way allude to him neither did he visit the alehouseand thus my mother and i began to hope that marions fond hopes were likely to be fulfilled having recruited his strength by a few days rest after his halffamished sojourn in the gaol george one morning said to me now tim you and me will go out and look for work we accordingly set off but applied fruitlessly at all the farmhouses in the neighbourhood some did not want hands others positively refused to have any thing to do with george dalton or any one connected with him we were returning homeward mournful enough when we passed a large limekiln the owner of which had been very intimate with georges father and mine he happened to be coming up from the pit at the moment when we were passing and stopping us he entered into conversation finding that we were in search of work he offered to employ us in the chalkpit and we readily accepted the proposal next day we went to work and when the saturday night came round we were paid liberally thus several weeks elapsed and we earned enough to keep the home comfortably our master was good and kind to us and the spirits of my brotherinlaw appeared to revive but he never mentioned the squire nor alluded to the past oftener than he could help we had been employed in this manner for about three months when one evening george and i stayed later than the other labourers in the chalkpit to finish a job which we knew the owner wanted to be completed as soon as possible it was ten oclock before we made an end of our toil and we were just on the point of retiring when we saw two persons walking slowly along the brink of the chalkpit the moon was brightthe night was beautifully clear and we obtained a full view of the two figures but as we were at the bottom of the precipice they could not have seen us even if they had looked attentively downward tim said george in a low hoarse whisper one of those men is the squire i recognised his infernal countenance just now when the moonlight fell full upon itwe remained perfectly quiet at the foot of the chalky side of the pit although i do not believe that george had any bad intention in view and i only stayed because he did the squire and his companion began to talk together and by the name in which mr bulkeley addressed the other george and i immediately knew that he was one of the very gamekeepers who had twice perjured themselves in misstating the circumstances connected with the exploits of pontoand so you say that the scoundrel dalton works in this pit now eh observed the squireyes sir replied the other hes come down to that at lastby god i never shall be contented till i send him to botany bay or to the scaffold exclaimed the squire but sooner or later you see i obtain vengeance on those who offend me old splint refused to sell me his field and spoke insolently to me he died of grief through all that has happened and the entire farm is now mine old dalton contrived to buy his land through my cursed neglect in forgetting to tell my agent to except his property from any part that might be sold but he also died of grief and the land has come back to me ah ah i bought that in again too no doubt to the vexation of young dalton then next we have the insolent jade marion she refused my overtures and persisted in marrying dalton and what has she gained nothing but misery as for george dalton himself he insulted and struck me besides carrying off marion as it were before my very eyes and making her his wife when she was much more fitted to become my mistressand what has he got for his pains i have crushed and ruined him and i will never stop till i have shown him what it is to dare to offend an english landowner but you say that this is the pit where he worksyes sir answered the gamekeeperwell i shall see his master tomorrow continued the squire and ill be bound to say george dalton will not do another weeks work in this place you may now go and join your men in the preserves and i shall return to the hall by the short cut through the fields the night is uncommonly fine however and is really tempting enough to make one stay out an hour or twoit is very fine sir answered the gamekeeper good night sirand the man walked rapidly away the squire remaining on the edge of the pit about thirty feet above the spot where george and i were crouched up tim said george at lastand his voice was deep and hollow although he spoke in a low whisperdo you remain here quite quiet i must have a word or two with that manfor gods sake george i said do not seek a quarrelno i wont seek a quarrel exactly returned my brotherinlaw but i cannot resist the opportunity to tell my mind to this miscreant who is now seeking to deprive us of our breadand before i had time to utter another word george was gliding rapidly but almost noiselessly up the craggy side of the chalkpit holding by the furze that grew in thick strong bunches i confess that a strong presentiment of evil struck terror to my soul and i remained breathless and trembling where he had left me but gazing upwards with intense anxiety holloa suddenly exclaimed the squire who had remained for nearly three minutes on the top of the precipice after his gamekeeper had quitted himmost likely brooding over the new scheme of vengeance which his hateful mind had planned holloa he said who is therei george dalton cried my brotherinlaw suddenly leaping to within a few paces of where the squire was standing and confronting the bad man like a ghost rising from a grave in the presence of the murdererand what the devil do you want here scoundrel exclaimed the squirerather what do you want plotting against me still demanded george i overheard every word that passed between you and your vile agent and if there was any doubt before as to your detestable malignity there is none nowlisteners never hear any good of themselves retorted the squire and if i called you a rascal as perhaps i might have done i meant what i said and you heard yourself mentioned by your proper namevillain miscreant cried george now quite furious you shall no longer triumph over meand in another moment they were locked in a firm embrace but not of love and in the next moment after that they rolled over the edge of the precipice down to within a few paces where i was standing a scream of terror escaped me for i thought that they must be killed the squire lay senseless but george leapt upon his feetand almost at the same instant a low moan denoted that his enemy was not deadthank god murder has not been done i exclaimedbut murder will be done tim this night said george in a voice not loud but so terrible in its tone that it made my blood run cold in my veins yes he continued my mortal enemy is now in my power for a long time have i brooded over the vengeance that i had resolved to take upon him when no one should be near to tell the tale for you will not betray me timyou will not give me up to the hangman on account of what i may dogeorge i implore you not to talk thus i said falling on my knees at his feetas there is a living god tim above us said george solemnly if you attempt to thwart me i will make away with you also and having thus spoken he raised the squire in his arms while i still remained on my knees horrified and speechless never never shall i forget the feelings which then possessed me the squire recovered his senses and exclaimed where am i who are yougeorge dalton your mortal enemy was the terrific replyoh i recollect now cried the squire wildly but do not murder meyour last hour is come and your death shall be as terrible as human revenge can render it said george in a voice which i should not have recognised without a foreknowledge that it was actually he who was speakingmercy cried the squire as george dragged him away towards the middle of the pit oh then i divined the dread intent of my brotherinlaw but i could not move a hand to help nor raise my voice to shout for assistance in behalf of the victim there i remained on my kneesspeechless stupified deprived of motionable only to exercise the faculty of sight and that showed me a horrible spectacle for having half stunned the squire with a fearful blow inflicted with a lump of chalk george dragged him towards the kiln in which the lime was still burning diffusing a pale red glow immediately above mercy once more cried the squire recovering his senses a second timemercy miscreant exclaimed george what mercy have you ever shown to me and as he uttered these words he hurled his victim or rather his oppressor into the burning pit there was a shriek of agonybut it was almost immediately stifled and the lurid glow became brighter and the form of my brotherinlaw seemed to expand and grow vast to my affrighted view so that he appeared some dreadful fiend bending over the fiery receptacle for damned souls still was i a motionless speechless stupified spectator of that horrible tragedy at a distance of about twenty yards but no words can describe the dreadful feelings that seized upon me when i suddenly beheld an object reach the top of the burning kiln and cling there for an instant until george dalton with his foot thrust him backfor that object was indeed the squireinto the fiery tomb then a film came rapidly over my eyesmy head seemed to swim roundand i fell back senseless i was aroused by a sensation of violent shaking and on opening my eyes i saw george dalton bending over me i shuddered fearfullyfor all the particulars of the dreadful deed so recently performed rushed to my mind with overwhelming force and i remember that i clasped my hands together in an agonising manner exclaiming my god george how could you do ittim he replied i do not repent what i have done human endurance could not stand more if i had to live the last hour over again i would act in the same manner your fathermy fatherand my child were all as good as murdered by that man and he has deserved death death he has met at last and the sweetest moments i ever tasted were when i saw him crawling painfully up from the smouldering bottom of the pit with his flesh all scorched his clothes singed to tinder and his face awfully disfiguredclinging too with his burnt hands to the burning lime and too wretchedyes too full of horror even to utter a moan then i kicked him back and i watched his writhings till all was over he died with difficulty tim and my only regret is that he was not ten hours in the tortures of that death instead of as many minutes but come get off your knees and let us be going i do not ask you whether you mean to tell of me because that would not prevent you if you have the intentiongeorge do you think it possible i exclaimed scarcely able to recover from the horrified sensations which were excited by the cold implacable manner in which he had described the dying efforts and agonies of his enemywell tim he said i dont ask you for any promises you can do as you like one thing is very certain i could never harm you and so if you do take it into your head to turn round upon me you would be treating me as i never should treat you let us say no more about it and if you can keep a composed countenance before the women do we left the pit and when we reached the top george said you go one way and i will go another if you are met out late by any one you would not be suspected but i shouldand i would not involve you in any danger by your being seen with me for remember tim he added as we were about to separate if i should happen to be caught out i shall never say that you were present and now get home as soon as you can and say that you left work an hour ago but that you took a walk or something of that kind before you went home you can also seem surprised that i have not yet come back that is if i dont get home before you we parted and i took the nearest road to the village which i reached a little after eleven marion and my mother were rather uneasy at our absence and i was quite unable to master my feelings so far as to appear composed and comfortable indeed they were already overwhelming me with questions when george made his appearance i was astonished to see how happy he appeared there was positively a glow of animation in his countenance as if he had done some admirable deed somehow or another his good spirits were catching and i began to think that an admirable deed had really been accomplished in ridding the earth of a monster whose delight was to crush and oppress the poor george said that he had been to deliver some message to the owner of the kiln after he had separated from me and that made him so late i had already stated that i had taken a good long walk and our tales were believed but when the two women retired to rest and george and i were left alone for a few minutes his manner suddenly changed as he said in a hoarse low whisper tim there is danger menacing me a few minutes after you and i parted i met the squires gamekeepers near the pit as they were going their rounds on account of the poachers and they recognised me my only chance of safety is in the probability that the lime will consume the body entirely at all events i shall be the first at the pit in the morning i was horrorstruck at what he told me and conjured him to seek safety by flight but he declared his resolution to await the issue of events and trust to fortune he said that he felt perfectly happy in having wreaked his vengeance upon the squire and should not experience other feelings were he on the scaffold he then rose and went to join marion while i prepared to spread my bed as usual on the floor of our little parlour it was not yet daylight when i was awakened by hearing a noise in the room and on inquiry i found that it was george about to sally forth as he had intimated to me on the preceding night i offered to get up and accompany him but he said not for the world tim should any thing happen to me you must be at least safe for those poor creatures of women cannot be left without a friend and protector he then left the room and in a few moments i heard the streetdoor closing gently i lay down again and tried to sleep but could not an indescribable feeling of uneasiness was upon me and i found myself even against my will balancing and calculating the chances for or against the detection of the murder at length my mind was worked up to such a pitch of excitement that i could remain in bed no longer and i rose and dressed myself having opened the shutters i found that the day was just breaking i cleared away the bedding and laid the breakfasttable as was my custom presently my mother and marion made their appearance and we sate down to the morning meal but i could eat nothing and my uneasiness was soon perceived tim said marion there is something upon your mind i know there is you cannot conceal it and if you deny it you will not be speaking the truth in the name of heaven tell me what grieves you and why has george gone out so unusually early and without his breakfast this morningi assured both my sister and mother that there was nothing the matter with me and that george had merely gone out early to do a good days work as he hoped to get an increase of wages marion was not satisfied but she saw that it was useless to question me at least before our mother accordingly when the latter left the room after breakfast my sister again urged me to make her acquainted with the cause of the secret anxiety which she knew was preying upon me i renewed my protestations that she was mistaken well tim she said in her quiet plaintive manner while her blue eyes filled with tears if any thing should happen the blow will be certain to kill me because i shall be unprepared for itfor a few moments i hesitated whether i would confide to her the terrific secret of the murder but i had not the courage and hurried away to join my brotherinlaw at the kiln as i passed through the village with my pickaxe on my back i met a person whom i knew splint said he have you heard any thingi know that i turned deadly pale as i stammered out no nothing particularhe did not notice my change of countenance but added the squire is missing and foul play is suspected that is all i have heard but where is georgewhy should you instantly ask that question after mentioning the report about squire bulkeley i asked and it was with the utmost difficulty that i could restrain my feelings so as to speak in a manner at all composedoh only because if any thing should be wrong you know i am afraid that george dalton would be suspected first as every one is aware that he is no friend to the squireand the man passed on his way not having intended to say any thing cruel or cutting for he was a good kind of a fellow my alarms increased and i felt so terribly uneasy that i knew not whether to throw down my pickaxe and run away altogether or whether i should proceed to the chalkpit but while i was still weighing in my mind all the chances for and against detection i came within sight of the fatal spot where the dreadful murder had been perpetrated there was the height from which my brotherinlaw and the squire had rolled down so firmly locked in each others hostile embrace there was the chimney of the kiln in the burningpit of which the wretched man had endured such fearful agonies before death released him i know not how it wasbut though i really wished to fly from the fatal spot some strange influence urged me on or rather attracted me thither when i reached a point from which i could command a view of the depths of the chalkpit an icy chill struck to my heart george was in the grasp of the squires two principal gamekeepers and the labourers of the pit were gathered round the mouth of the kiln in a manner which convinced me that they had made some discovery at that instant the words which george had addressed to me that morning flashed back to mindshould any thing happen to me you must be at least safe for these poor creatures of women cannot be left without a friend and protectormy soul recovered all its power and i felt that the truth of those words was strong indeed yeswhat would become of my poor mother and the unhappy marion if both of their protectors were snatched away from them never was presence of mind more necessary with a firm step i descended the sloping path leading into the pit and affected extreme surprise when i beheld george in the custody of the gamekeepers a rapid but significant glance on his part encouraged me to maintain the part i was playing and fortunately no one suspected that a mere lad of fifteen or sixteen like me had any hand in the dreadful deed of which there was now evidence to prove the perpetration it was however with no affected horror that i gathered from the hurried words of the labourers the particulars of the discovery it appeared that the absence of the squire from home all night had created an alarm and this was augmented when it was ascertained that the squire had been with one of his gamekeepers at the chalkpit and that half an hour afterwards this same keeper and another had encountered george dalton in the same vicinity the gamekeepers finding that the squire had not returned home all night repaired direct to the chalkworks where they found george dalton had just arrived and the dawn of day showed them enough at the bottom of the limepit to convince them that murder had been perpetrated to the questions put to him by those who arrested him george replied that he had parted from me at about a quarter to ten oclock on the previous eveningthat i had returned homeand that he had remained behind to finish his workbut he denied having seen the squire at all i may as well state now although i was not aware of the fact till some hours later on that terrible day that the squires bailiff had been sent for the moment george was arrested and the murder was discovered and that having heard georges answers to the questions put to him he set off for the village by a short cut over the bulkeley estate whereas i took the main road to the pit and therefore had not met him it appears that on his arrival at the village the bailiff went straight to our lodgings and began to question marion and her mother as to whether george had been home at all during the night and if so at what hour he had returned marion named the hour at which he had returned adding that he was so late because he had been on leaving off work to deliver a message to the owner of the chalkpit the bailiff then brutally revealed the whole terrible truth to the two females and though i was not there to witness the same yet it is easy to believe that it was terrible and heartrending indeed but heedless of the misery which his abrupt discourse had produced the bailiff hastened off to the owner of the chalkpit and learnt from him that george had not been near him on the preceding evening back to the pit went the bailiff now accompanied by its owner and the next step was to convey the prisoner before the nearest magistrate who happened to be the rector of the parish i was desired to go with the party but no suspicion was attached to me it was proved that the calcined remains of a human body were found in the hole where the lime was burnt and that the metal buttons picked up were those which belonged to the coat the squire had on the previous evening i need not detail the nature of the evidence which appeared to tell against george dalton because you can well understand it from all the circumstances i have already related he conducted himself with wonderful calmness and presence of mind throughout the long examination which lasted for several hours and when the magistrate asked him if he had any thing to say in his defence or to show why he should not be committed for trial he answered in a firm tone i am innocent and have nothing more to say he was accordingly committed for trialhandcuffs were put upon him and he was removed to an outhouse guarded by constables until a cart could be got in readiness to convey him to the county gaol but in the yard of the rectors abode a heartrending scene took place marion was there waiting to see her husband of whose guilt she poor thing could entertain no doubt she had left our mother who had fallen down in a fit when the disclosure was so rudely made by the bailiff to the care of the landlady of the house in which we lived and crushed with deep afflictionweaksicklyalmost heartbroken as she was she had dragged herself to the place where she heard the examination was going on oh george george she exclaimed as she rushed forward to embrace her husband whose manacles rattled as forgetting that he wore them he endeavoured to extend his arms to receive her how poor marion weptwhat convulsive sobs escaped her bosom george wept also but he said every thing fond and endearing to console her the parsonjustice appeared at the door of his house and perceiving the sad spectacle said take that woman away i will not have such scenes under my windows she is no doubt as bad as henever shall i forget the look of imploring anguish which marion turned towards that minister of the gospel who spoke so sternly and so unjustly then in the next moment she fell senseless upon the ground the constables rushed upon george to drag him off to the outhouse but he hurled them away manacled as he was crying in a voice that struck terror to my soul i will not move an inch till i see this poor innocent creature properly cared for keep offor i shall do another murderanother murder exclaimed the rector then he confesses that of the squirebut george heard not the observation nor did he seem to notice the tremendous oversight which he had committed in the bewildering anguish of the moment bending over marion he raised her with his chained hands while one of the rectors servants more humane than his master brought out water to sprinkle upon her countenance at length she slowly opened her eyes and george beckoning to me said now tim take her away i cannot bear this scene any morei approached and lent my support to poor marion while george of his own accord hurried to the outhouse not once casting a look behind him i know not how i got my wretched sister homeand i was nearly as wretched as herself but at length we reached our humble lodging where the landlady who appeared to be the only friend left to us in the world did all she could to console the miserable young wife had it not been for that kindhearted woman we must all have perished through sheer want for i received notice from the owner of the chalkpit that my services would be dispensed with in future and no one else would give me work a week after georges committal my mother died and she who was once the wife of a farmer welltodo in the world was now buried at the expense of the parish when the funeral was over and marion grew somewhat more composed she insisted upon removing to winchester so as to be near the gaol wherein her husband lay if we go said i we must beg our waythen we will beg our way tim answered marion for whether innocent or guilty george is my husband and i can never cease to love himi offered no farther remonstrance so bidding our kind landlady farewell we set out with only halfacrown in our pockets and for that sum we were indebted to that same good landlady on our arrival at winchester we took a small lodging near the goal and marion went to see her husband she insisted upon going alone and i did not thwart her in any of her wishes when she returned to me she seemed a little more tranquil than she had yet been since the dreadful disclosure of georges arrest on an accusation of murder she was consoled by having seen her husband although she could not do otherwise than believe him guilty but of that she never spoke to me and i was very careful not to touch upon the point i now tried to obtain work but at some places where i applied character was inquired about and at others no assistance was wanted at last i was actually compelled to go into the streets and beg for marion was attacked with severe indisposition one evening as i was returning home without having succeeded in obtaining a single halfpenny all day long and in a state bordering on despair i was warned by a beadle that if i was seen begging in the streets again i should be taken up as a rogue and vagabond frightened by his threats i hurried away and was already in sight of the house in which we lived and where i had left my poor sister in the morning when by the light streaming from a shopwindow i saw an old gentleman drop something on the ground as he drew out his pockethandkerchief he went on without noticing the occurrence and i picked up the object which proved to be his purse gold glittered through the network at one endsilver was in the other i ran after the gentleman as hard as i could hoping to receive a reward for my trouble but i could not find him thinking he had entered some house in the street i waited for nearly an hourbut still he appeared not it came on to rain hard i was soon wet through to the skin for my clothes were old and tattered and the pangs of hunger were now dreadful the idea of using a small portion of the money in the purse by degrees grew stronger and stronger in my mind i thought of poor marion who was famished as well as myselfthe temptation was too strongand i yielded rushing to a bakers shop i procured bread thence i proceeded to a generaldealers and purchased a little tea sugar butter and other necessaries i then returned home and told marion that a charitable gentleman had given me halfacrown and that i was also promised work alas my poor brother she said you are compelled to think of supporting me as well as yourself but it will not be for long tim she added i feel it there nowand she touched her foreheadas well as hereand she placed her hand on her hearti burst into tears and implored her not to talk in that mournful way she shook her head sighing piteouslybut said nothing next day i went out and remained absent until night when i came home again i said that i had obtained work at the rate of two shillings a day and was to be paid every evening so i laid two shillings on the table i forgot to observe that the purse contained about eleven pounds in gold and silver and i was determined to dole it out in such a way that marion should not suspect me of deceiving her as often as the gaol regulations would permit she visited her husband for the little comforts which i was now able to provide for her restored her strength in a trifling degreeat all events sufficiently so to enable her to drag her drooping form along to the dungeon which held all she deemed most dear once only did i see george before the day of his trial for marion preferred to visit him alone he was greatly affected at beholding us together and thanked me for my kindness towards my sister at last after the lapse of about three months the assizes commenced and on the second day the trial came on george had counsel to defend him for i supplied the means from the purse having invented some tale to account for the possession of the requisite sum to fee the barrister so that marion was satisfied it was with the greatest difficulty that i could persuade her to remain at home during the proceedings at which i was compelled to be present as a witness i need not detail all the particulars of the evidence given against my unhappy brotherinlaw circumstances all told in his disfavour and the observation which he had let slip i shall do another murder was made the most of by the counsel for the prosecution i was examined and i swore that i had quitted the prisoner at the limekiln at a quarter to ten on the night in question it was proved that it was not until past ten that the gamekeeper accompanied the squire to the neighbourhood of the fatal place and therefore no questions were put likely to embarrass me the counsel for the defence argued most ingeniously in georges favour but the judge summed up against him the jury did not deliberate ten minutes and the verdict was guilty george was standing in the dock all the time that the jury were whispering together and when the foreman pronounced his doom and a slight muscular twitching of the lips was the only sign of emotion the judge put on the black cap and sentenced him to death in the usual horrible terms i must confess that though i had but little room in my soul for reflection of any kindso much was it occupied with the one dreadful fact of the dayi shuddered and looked with loathing upon the judgeto hear that old man himself having one foot in the grave uttering such a disgusting cruel and inhuman sentence as thisyou shall be taken back to the place whence you came and thence to a place of execution where you shall be hanged by the neck until you are dead then when man has done his worst and will not forgive nor attempt to reform the criminal the awful atrocity concludes with the damnable mockeryand may the lord have mercy upon your soul i call it a mockery because it is insulting to heaven to invoke that pity and compassion which human beings so positively refuse but then the old judge was a mere mouthpiece through which the bloodthirsty law spoke and he was compelled to do a duty for which he was so well paid still i loathed that old man who could sell his feelings for money and who could be allured by the temptation of a large income to undertake an office which constrained him to doom his fellowcreatures to die the deaths of mere dogs i wondered whether he could sleep comfortably in his bed afterwards and i thought at the time that i would sooner be the veriest beggar crawling on the face of the earth than a judge with all his moneyall the respect shown to himand all his titles of lordship illustration but i have wandered away from my subject poor george was removed from the docki mean he accompanied the turnkeys back to the gaol for he walked as firmly as i could do at this moment i now had a most dreadful duty to performto convey the result to marion but i hastened back to her fearful lest she should learn that result from lips which might not break the horrible tidings slowly to her when i entered the garret where i had left her i found her on her knees praying aloud and fervently the sight was too much for me and i burst into tears she rose slowly took me by the hand and said timdear tim you need not attempt to break it gently to me as i know you have come to do i feelsomething tells me indeedthat it is all over and i have been long prepared for this awful moment i have never allowed myself to indulge in vain hopes the world i was convinced would persecute my poor husband until it drove him tobut i cannot cannot say where that he was guilty of the deed tim i have known all along and dreadful as that deed was i could not reproach him for it he was goaded to desperation by wrong heaped upon wrong and instead of being treated as a criminal he should be looked upon as a victim himselfmarion had spoken with an unnatural calmness which made me tremble lest her reason was deserting her but when she had concluded her address to me she threw herself into my arms and burst into a violent flood of weeping i endeavoured to console her she grew frantic the command which she had maintained over herself throughout that dreadful day and in the solitude of that garret had tried her powers of endurance too severely and now that her long pentup anguish burst forth it was awful in the extreme oh my god i exclaimed what have we done that we should be thus tortured on earth as if we were in helland then i thought of the crime i had committed in appropriating the contents of the purse to my own useand i felt ashamed but in a few moments other feelings came over me it struck me that there was no use in being good old daltonmy fathermy motherpoor marionand until the date of that one deed myselfnone of us had ever been wickedand yet how awfully had we suffered the three first had positively been killed by misfortune and george toothere was not a more upright honourable generoushearted man in existence than he until oppression and cruel wrong wrought a change in his nature such were my thoughts and again i asked myself what was the use of being good from that moment i determined to do as i saw the world doing around me the execution was fixed for the second thursday after the trial which took place on a tuesday and during the interval marion saw her husband three times i accompanied her on each occasion for i was afraid to allow her to venture out alone george maintained his courage in an astonishing manner but never alluded to the crime in our presence he showed the greatest affection towards his wife and the warmest attachment for me and implored her not to give way more than she could help to grief on his account the third interview was on the evening previous to the fatal day and that was heartrending indeed marion no longer resigned and enduring was absolutely frantic and she was borne away raving wildly from the condemned cell i managed to get her home and some female lodgers in the same house put her to bed a surgeon was sent for and he pronounced her to be in the greatest danger i sate up with her all that night throughout which she slept at intervals awaking to rave after her dear murdered husband had she not been my sister i never could have supported the horrors of that awful night towards morning she seemed quite exhausted and fell into a deep slumber the execution was to take place at twelve precisely and i hoped sincerely hoped that she might sleep until all should be over hour after hour passedeleven oclock struck and still she slept every now and then she started convulsively and murmured the name of her husband oh how anxiously did i then wait for the chimes that proclaimed the quarters and how slowly went the time poor george what are your feelings now i kept repeating to myself a quarter pasthalfpast elevena quarter to twelvethese had all struck and still she slept as i sate by her bedside i could hear the rushing crowds in the street below and i also heard all the lodgers hastening down the stairs to witness the execution but still marion slept and in the bitterness of my own grief this circumstance was a slight consolation at length the chimes announced the hourthe fatal hour scarcely had they done playing when marion awoke with a sudden start and raised herself to a sitting posture in the bed wildly she glanced aroundand again she started fearfully as the chimes being over the clock began to strike the hour onetwothree she began in a tone of piercing anguish and on she went counting the strokes till her tongue had numbered twelve my god tis the hour she exclaimed with a dreadful shriek then extending her arms wildly she cried i come georgei come and fell back heavily in the bed as if shot through the heart she was no more it appeared that the drop fell about half a minute after the last stroke of twelve and therefore by a strange chance poor george must have breathed his last almost at the very instant when marion uttered those words so wildlyi come i comethus died my persecuted brotherinlaw and my poor sister and i was now left alonefriendlessunprotected in the wide world a strange whim now suddenly entered my head i would bury the remains of the illfated couple in the same grave such was my idea and so determined was i to carry it into execution that i set out deliberately and calmly for the purpose of robbing some one to obtain the means for the purpose when i got into the street i found the crowds dispersing after having witnessed the execution of my brotherinlaw how i loathed the inhuman creatures who had shown such eager curiosity to view the last struggles of a man hung up like a dog by the bloodthirsty mandates of the law some were laughing and joking together as they walked along and such observations as these caught my earshow game he died didnt hethat jack ketch is a devilish clever fellow at his businessit was the best turnoff i have seen for a long timei propose that we dont go to work today lets make a holiday of it for my part i never fail to attend all executions that take place in the county and i always look upon it as a holiday just like easter monday or whit monday for instancewhat fun it was to see that old chap whom i bonneted in the crowd how he did curse and swear just as the parson was reading the last prayer on the scaffoldi never had such a jolly good lark in my life i had my arm round tom tiffins wifes waist all the timewhat a precious sight of pickpockets there was in the crowdthese and a hundred other observations of the same kind met my ears as i walked along the streets through which the people were returning from the execution at length i passed the door of a public newsroom and there several gentlemen were standing in conversation about the hideous spectacle which one of them had witnessed and which this individual was describing with wonderful minuteness to his companions i pretended to be looking at some pictures in the shopwindow but was in reality surveying the group thinking that one of them might become paymaster though against his will for the funeral of my sister and brotherinlawyou dont mean to say that the woman really did it cried one of the gentlemeni mean to say answered the person who had witnessed the execution that immediately after the criminal was dead or rather as soon as he had ceased to struggle the woman went up on the scaffold and the executioner put the murderers hand upon her face to cure the kings evil and when she had gone down again a countryman ascended to the platform and was touched in the same way for a wen which he had got upon his head i saw it all myselfwell i could scarcely believe it said the other gentleman who had spokeni will lay you ten guineas exclaimed the one who had witnessed the execution that if you ask any other person who was present he will tell you the same thing and thus speaking the gentleman drew out his purse his friend however declined the wager and the purse was reconsigned to the pocket but not before i had seen enough of it to convince me that its contents were worth having i felt the less remorse in robbing that man because he had described with such methodical coldbloodedness all the minute details of the execution and availing myself of on opportunity when the group had got deep into a loud and excited discourse on the incidents of touching for the kings evil and the wen i managed to extract the purse in even a far more skilful manner than i had expected the robbery was not immediately perceived and i got clear away on returning to my miserable garret and by the side of the bed whereon lay the remains of my once beautiful and amiable sister i counted the contents of the purse eleven guineas i murmured to myself and as i glanced tremblingly at the corpse it actually seemed to me at the moment as if an expression of deep gloom and sorrow suddenly passed over its countenance oh my sistermy dear sister i cried i have done it for your sakeand then unable to remain any longer near one who seemed to reproach me even in death i hurried away to the prison to claim the body of my brotherinlaw this request was granted without difficulty and in the course of the day the husband and wife lay together upon the same bedside by sidemotionless white and coldthe former murdered by the law the latter by cruel wrong and diabolical oppression the undertaker had received my instructions and the preparations for the funeral were in progress but two nights did i pass in the same room with those dead bodies for although i was afraid yet something seemed to whisper to me within that it would be heartless and cruel to abandon even those inanimate remains until the grave should close over them and as i sate by their side while a candle burnt dimly on the table i thought to myself all this tremendous amount of sorrow calamity and woe has been caused by a wealthy and unprincipled landlord had it not been for squire bulkeley those two would still have been alive and would have been happy prosperous and useful to society but the tenant or the small landowner has no chance against the proprietor of great estates if the latter chooses to be a tyrant the herring has as much right as the whale to swim in the waters which god has made and yet the whale swallows up the herring so is it with the great and the small landholder well the funeral took placeand there were four mourners one real and three sham the real one was myselfthe three sham were the undertaker and two of his dependants nevertheless my aim was accomplished george and his wife slept in the same grave and the money of a man who had greedily devoured the hideous spectacle of public strangulation had served to bury them in spite of my grief i chuckled at this idea it seemed something like retributive justice i had now no object in staying at winchester and with eleven shillings in my pocket i set out to walk to london during my journey i passed the chalkpit where the dreadful deed had taken placei passed it purposely because i now wanted to harden my mind as much as possible for i saw it was no use for a poor friendless orphan like me to think of being honest in the most civilised country as it is called in the world i had seen such abominable acts of oppression perpetrated under colour of law that i envied those naked savages in islands a great way off of whom i had read in books for i thought that it was better to be barbarians without the pretence of civilisation than to be barbarians with that pretence i had heard a great deal said by my father by old mr dalton and also by the clergyman from the pulpit about the paternal nature of the english government but i now began to perceive that it had been mere delusion on the part of my wellmeaning parent and mr dalton and rank hypocrisy and wanton deception on the part of the parson all i could now think of the paternal government was that it favoured institutions by means of which poor men might be driven to desperation and then they were coolly and quietly hanged for the deeds to the perpetration of which they had been so goaded i began to look upon the english people as the most chickenhearted and contemptible nation in the world for allowing the aristocracy to ride roughshod over them whereas the great and highminded french people as i had read in books had risen up like one man and overthrown their aristocracy altogether but let me continue my history having passed by the chalkpitthe fatal chalkpiti visited the immediate neighbourhood of the farmhouse where a happy family had once dweltmy own now it was tenanted by strangers i went on and came to the house to which george dalton had borne my sister marion a blooming bride that tenement was now desertedand it struck horror to my heart to observeor rather to feelthat deathlike silence which pervaded a place where the joyous laugh of george dalton and the musical voice of my dear sister had once been heard o god that so much misery should have fallen upon two families who strove so hard to live honestly and in peace with all mankind the tears streamed down my face as i turned back into the high road and pursued my way towards london i now thought as i went along that if i could possibly obtain honest employment in the great city honest i would endeavour to remaini say remain because although i had committed two thefts yet i was far from being utterly depraved the tears which painful remembrances had called forth had softened my heart and the image of my lamented sister appeared to urge me to virtue armed with this resolution i proceeded towards the metropolis it was evening when after two days fatiguing journey i entered london and put up at a miserable lodginghouse in the window of which i saw a bill stating that single men might have a bed for fourpence a night eight hours good rest gave me strength and spirits to begin my search after employment i went into the city and inquired at several warehouses if a light porter was wanted having met with many refusals and being wearied with walking about i went into a publichouse to get some refreshment and happening to mention my situation to the landlord he very kindly recommended me to apply at a certain warehouse which he named and where he knew that a porter was wanted i did so and was fortunate enough to succeed in obtaining the place with a salary of twelve shillings a week i commenced my new avocation on the following morning and exerted myself to the utmost to obtain the good opinion of my master i was regular in the hours of attendance and frequently remained behind at the office when the clerks had departed to finish the labours which had been assigned to me in the morning i was economical and prudent in my expenditure and the pittance which i received was ample to keep myself at the expiration of four months from the time when i first entered this establishment i had entirely gained the confidence of my employer my salary was increased and i began to think that fortune was once more inclined to smile upon me when a circumstance occurred which convinced me that the long lane of life had not yet taken a turn my employer one morning desired me to proceed to a particular address at the west end of the town and insist upon the payment of a bill which in the course of business had fallen into his hands and which had been protested i instantly set out for the place intimated and having inquired for the gentleman whose name was familiar enough to me though i could not suspect the identity which proved to be the case i was shown into an elegant apartment where a gentleman was sitting with his face to the fire and his back to the door smoking a cigar who the devils that demanded the occupant of the room without turning his head but in a voice which was not unknown to me if youre a dun i aint at homei have called for payment i beganholloa who have we here ejaculated the gentleman and rising from his chair he disclosed the features of the magistrate who had first committed george dalton for poaching what tim splint he cried is this youit is i the brotherinlaw of the man whom you helped to persecute i returned equally surprised at this unexpected encounterno impudence my good fellow said the magistrate very coolly or else i shall be compelled to kick you out of the room but what vulgar thing have you got in your hand therea bill with your name to it and the payment of which i am come to require was my immediate answeroh thats itis it ejaculated the magistrate casting his eyes over the document which i displayed to his view well let me see how shall i pay this in bank notes or by kicking you out of the house or by recommending the holder to read his bill again this day six months oh i have itand sitting down to an elegant writingtable he penned a hasty note sealed it and desired me to give it to the person who had sent me i then withdrew anxious to avoid a dispute which would be perfectly useless and which would probably prejudice the interests of my employer i returned to the office in the city and delivered the note the merchant opened it and his countenance changed as he perused its contents for some moments he remained absorbed in thought and then apparently acting in obedience to a sudden impulse passed the note to me who had been anxiously watching the strange demeanour of my master the letter contained the following wordsmrwould be much obliged to the holder of his acceptance for a hundred and sixtyeight pounds if he would forbear from sending the brother of a man who has been hanged to demand the amount as such persons are by no means welcome at the abode of mr however well they may suit the holder of his bill the meaning of this request would be ascertained were the porter timothy splint questioned as to his connexion with the murderer george daltoni folded up the letter returned it to my employer and said i cannot deny the truth of its contents but i am innocent although my poor brotherin law died on the scaffoldyou should have been candid at the commencement interrupted my employer firmly but mildly whether you are innocent or not matters not now had you told me your real position when you first came to me i should have admired your frankness and given you a fair trial as it is we must part at oncei attempted to justify my silence respecting the ignominious end of my relative but the merchant was inexorable in his determination not to hear any thing in the shape of an explanation he paid me the wages due to me with a sovereign over and dismissed me i forthwith began to look after a new situation and i remembered the parting words of the merchant whom i had left resolving to be candid in the first instance when soliciting a new place my duties at my recent situation had compelled me to visit other mercantile firms on many occasions and i had formed the acquaintance of several of the persons employed in those establishments to some of them i repaired to ascertain where vacancies were to be filled up and having obtained a considerable list i set out upon a round of applications the first house i inquired at was that of a general merchant and warehouseman who required a porter and collector of monieshave you ever served in that capacity before was the first demandi was in the employ of a highly respectable merchant i returned mentioning his name whose service i only left a few days agoi remember that you were engaged there i thought your face was familiar to me said the merchant and i also recollect that i heard you spoken of in the highest possible terms he continued indeed you were represented to me as being invaluable in your particular department but of course you did not leave your late employer for any misconduct on your partnot at all sir was my answer i must however explain a certain circumstancewell i will just send round merely for the forms sake you know and ascertain that it is all right and if you will call tomorrow morning i have no doubt i shall be enabled to give you a favourable answeri must really sir said i speak to you very seriously for a moment before you take any trouble on my behalf if you will have the kindness to listen to me i shall explain my real position the truth is though perfectly innocent of any crime myself i have the misfortune to be related to a persecuted man who was driven by despair to commit a deed for which he suffered on the scaffoldthe scaffold ejaculated the merchant in dismayyes sir i continued hastily endeavouring to give a full explanation and if you will but permit me to tell you in a few words the melancholy history you will see no reason to be displeased with my candour on the contrary you will i am sure pity me siri thank you for such candour interrupted the merchant buttoning up his breechespockets and locking his desk but i regret that under circumstances i cannot think of taking you into my servicebut do pray listen to me sir i exclaimed you are doubtless a man of sense of justice and of impartiality and i appeal to youmy good young man it is no use to take up my time interrupted the merchant impatiently i am certainly not going to receive you into my service under existing circumstances i was compelled to take my departure i left the house ashamed and abashedfearful that my evil doom was sealedafraid to look those whom i met in the faceand fancying that every one seemed to know who and what i was but a few moments reflection taught me to believe that i had no reason to anticipate failure every where because i had met with a repulse in one place i accordingly proceeded to another establishment where a light porter was also required the head of this firm was a venerable old man with long grey hair falling over his coatcollar a bald head and a huge pair of silver spectacles on his nose there was altogether something so kind so unassuming and so philanthropic in the appearance of this individual that i was immediately inspired with confidence i began my narrative and related the main incidents without interruption from my hearer who listened to me with the greatest attention and apparent interestmy good young man said the merchant taking off his spectacles and wiping them i feel deeply for you every word which you have told me i firmly believe your manner and your language inspire me with confidence merciful god into what a state would society be plunged if innocence that had been wronged could not obtain the credence of those to whom it offered its justification i repeat i am interested in you i feel deeply for you you have had your share of misfortune poor young man most sincerely do i hope that your future prospects will not be equally embittered i have a son of just your agehe has gone to the east indies in a freetrader in which i have a share and if it were only for his sake i should feel interested in you for you resemble him in person heaven what a world this is why man is a cannibal in a moral sense for he is constantly devouring his fellowman upon my word i could weep i could shed tears when i think of the misfortunes which you have enduredi am overcome by your kind sympathy said i now certain that this time i had encountered the man who would not allow my misfortunes to stand in the way of my appointment to the vacant situation how much did you receive per week at your last place asked the old gentlemani named the sumand what hours did you keepthis question i also answeredwas your master kind and considerate proceeded the venerable merchant in a compassionate tone of voicehe was very kind in his manners but at parting he behaved harshly and ungenerously when he discovered all i have just told you and i think i had reason to complainah it was cruel it was ungenerous said the venerable old gentleman musing but dont you see he added that as society is at present constituted and i admit that its constitution is vitiated in the extreme it is impossible for a man who depends upon the world for his subsistence to act contrary to the received notions and usual habits of that world now for my part i should be glad i should be delighted to take you in a moment but i dare not i am very sorry but i really would strain a point to serve you if i possibly couldyou may suppose that i was astonished at this announcement i had made sure of the situation from the first moment that the old merchant had addressed me and i now saw my hopes cruelly and fatally defeated with a heavy heart i went away and the tears ran down my cheeks as i reflected upon all i had just heard never did my situation in the world appear more lonelynever more truly desperate my position was too hopeless to allow me to apply at another mercantile establishment for upwards of an hour it required that interval to soothe and soften down my feelings and i then ventured into the warehouse of an export merchant upon a very extensive scale whose name was down upon my list i was introduced into the presence of a young man who wore a large blue figured satin stock with an enormous gold pin and a chain hanging over an elegant silk waistcoat this gentleman sate on one side of a desk and his partner who was dressed as well as he was occupied the other i immediately attracted their attention and the elder partner laying down his pen exclaimed why youre a devilish smart looking fellow here sit down and take a glass of porter you seem tired by the bye we havent had our cigars yet dick he added addressing his partner lets smoke and talk over this business at the same time sit down my man we have no humbug about us i can tell youand so indeed it appeared for the two gentlemen produced cigars and bottled porter and i was very soon engaged in a most comfortable chat with them at length they began to speak about the business which had taken me there and when i told them my story in a straightforward manner they declared with an oath that they would take me on my word and that they didnt want any damned reference or any thing of that kind the terms were agreed upon and i was to commence my duties on the following morning when i took my leave the two partners shook hands with me expressing their conviction that i was a damned good fellow and understood what was what and also that i was just the kind of bird they had some time been looking for i accordingly entered on this new place but i had not been there long before i began to notice though i was regularly paid that a great many persons called for money and never could obtain a settlement of their accounts on some occasions the partners were denied although they were in the countinghouse drinking and smoking and then the applicants were very much disposed to be insolent making use of such terms as swindlers rogues c some would express their conviction that it was all a regular do while others felt equally certain that it was nothing but a plant there was also another circumstance which astonished me and that was the singular mode in which the business of the firm was conducted no sooner did the bales of goods arrive by the front door than they were carried out at the back and sent away in vans altogether it was a most extraordinary firm and one morning i discovered that the doors were closed the partners had bolted and the cityofficer was inquiring after them in consequence of a warrant which he had with him for their apprehension thus i lost a place where the duties were easy but where the respectability attached to it was not very likely to increase my own i was thus thrown once more upon the world and again was i compelled to look out for a situation i applied at numerous warehouses and offices but when i stated my real conditionwhen i revealed the secret that i was related to a man who had been hangedi was thrust from the doors of some reproached for my impertinence in calling by others and treated with coolness or contempt by a third set of men no one seemed to believe that i could possibly be honest day after day saw the renewal of disappointment and that sickening at the heart which leads to despairnight after night did i return to my lodging to meet a landlady who wanted the money i owed her at last she would have no further patience and one night when i went back late she poked her head out of a window desiring me to begone and loading me with abuse i slunk away almostheartbroken at the treatment i had just received and at the deplorable situation to which i was reduced accident or rather necessity conducted me back to the low lodginghouse at which i had put up on my first arrival in london and there i fell in with some persons who were very willing to assist me in a certain way in fact they proposed that i should join them in a robbery which they were arranging and after vainly struggling with my better feelings i consented it is no use to tell you how i got on from bad to worseyou can both very well guess how it is that when once a man gets regularly into this line he seldom or ever gets out of it again till his career is cut short by transportation or the scaffold thus terminated tim the snammers history which as we stated at the conclusion of the preceding chapter we have greatly modified in style and changed in language without however omitting altering or exaggerating any one incident nor any one sentiment it was now late and the snammer took his leave of josh pedler and matilda briggs having promised to call again next day and arrange with the former the contemplated robbery of old death footnote taken as a body there is not a more infamous and tyrannical set of authorities on the face of the earth than the unpaid magistracy of england how the high spirited people of this country can endure such an atrocious system is to us surprising almost entirely irresponsiblechosen on account of their wealth and influence in their respective counties but without the least reference to their abilitiesand by the very circumstances of their position opposed to the interests of the masses the justices of the peace are so many diabolical tyrants vested with a power which completely coerces the industrious and labouring classes if it be necessary to have paid barristers as magistrates in the cities and great towns why should not the same rule apply to smaller towns and to rural districts to invest an irresponsible narrowminded and prejudiced body of men with such immense powers as those wielded by magistrates is a foul blot upon our civilisation prisonchains fines and treadmills are at the disposal of these justices and the use they make of their power proves that the entire system on which their attributes and jurisdiction are based deserve universal execration thousands and thousands of honest wellmeaning hardworking families have been ruined by this hierarchy of terrestrial fiends talk of the freedom of the british subject and boast of the trial by jury why any magistrate by his own single decision can award heavy fines or months of imprisonment the unpaid magistracy exists as a protection and also as an agency for the infernal game laws their local powers and influence give them immense weight in general elections for poor people are afraid to offend them but the worst kind of unpaid magistrates are the clergymen who are in the commission of the peace these men usually act more like offshoots of the czar of russia than as magistrates in a civilised country and as ministers of the charitable and generous doctrines of the christian faith footnote this act is not only still unrepealed but was put in force about eighteen months or two years ago by certain county magistrates against two or three poor labourers footnote it is generally understood that the judge should be merely an expounder of the law affecting the cases brought under the cognizance of the court and also a means of refreshing the memories of the jurymen by reading over his notes or the salient points in them at least to our thinking a judge should never allow his own opinion on the point at issue to transpire if he do he is almost sure to bias the jury but unfortunately nearly all the judges in this country act in a dictational manner with regard to juries they direct the verdicts returned this assumption on the part of the judges of the privileges and attributes of juries renders the latter perfectly unnecessary for ourselves we believe that trial by jury is in these islands a mere farcean idle mockerya contemptible delusion the judges are the real juries after all and yet we boast of the institution that institution would indeed be a glorious one were the judges to discharge their duties properly but in nine cases out of ten they do not footnote there is something uncommonly barbarous in many of our institutions and customs were it not associated with such solemn occasions we should laugh at the mountebank piece of solemn humbug of the black capas if the judge himself could not assume a demeanour serious and dignified enough for the awful and atrocious duty which the law imposes upon him in pronouncing death sentences the custom of judges and barristers disfiguring themselves in huge wigs is a mere relic of barbarism and unworthy of a civilized age if the law cannot maintain its solemn majesty without such wretched aids heaven knows there must be something radically wrong either in the constitution of the tribunals themselves or in the conduct of the functionaries of justice away with all such mockeries and foolsplay as wigs and black caps and let men distribute the justice of men as men and not muffled up and disguised like old women the maintenance of all customs which our barbarian ancestors handed down to us shows an aversion to progress on the part of the government and the legislature the wisdom of those ancestors existed we imagine only in the wig let the wisdom of the present day show itself by the fact of discarding all useless pomp and vain ostentation footnote the aristocracy of england a history for the people by john hampden junior the pseudonym of a very clever writer whatever his real name and whoever he may be is a work which should be read by all classesby the aristocratic sections of society because it may warn them of the impending storm and by the middle and poorer grades because it will shew them their oppressors in their true characters this and william howitts history of priestcraft both published by messrs chapman newgate street are glorious signs of the times in which we live from the firstmentioned book we quote the ensuing passage look at france every one is familiar with the dreadful condition to which its proud and imbecile aristocracy reduced it every one knows in what a storm of blood and terror the oppressed people rose and took an eternal vengeance on their oppressors if we read the accounts of france just previous to the revolution we cannot avoid being struck with a terrible similarity of circumstances and features with those of our own country now nay the following description by their own historian thiers seems to be that of england at presentthe condition of the country both political and economical was intolerable there was nothing but privilegeprivilege vested in individuals in classes in towns in provinces and even in trades and professions every thing contributed to check industry and the natural genius of man all the dignities of the state civil ecclesiastical and military were exclusively reserved to certain individuals no man could take up a profession without certain titles and the compliance with certain pecuniary conditions even the favours of the crown were converted into family property so that the king could scarcely exercise his own judgment or give any preference almost the only liberty left to the sovereign was that of making pecuniary gifts and he had been reduced to the necessity of disputing with the duke of coigny for the abolition of a useless place every thing then was made immoveable property in the hands of a few and every where these few resisted the many who had been despoiled the burdens of the state weighed on one class only the noblesse and the clergy possessed about twothirds of the landed property the other third possessed by the people paid taxes to the king a long list of feudal droits to the noblesse tithes to the clergy and had moreover to support the devastations committed by noble sportsmen and their game the taxes upon consumption pressed upon the great multitude and consequently on the people the collection of these imposts was managed in an unfair and irritating manner the lords of the soil left long arrears with impunity but the people upon any delay in payment were harshly treated arrested and condemned to pay in their persons in default of money to produce the people therefore nourished with their labour and defended with their blood the higher classes of society without being able to procure a comfortable subsistence for themselves the townspeople a body of citizens industrious educated less miserable than the people could nevertheless obtain none of the advantages to which they had a right to aspire seeing that it was their industry that nourished and their talents that adorned the kingdomis not that a wonderful facsimile of our own present condition but these circumstances produced revolution in france what will they produce here if they are allowed to continue they will produce the very same thing the french historians assert that had the cries of the people been listened to before they grew maddened with their miseries there would have been reform instead of revolution and their nation would have been spared the years of unexampled horror and selflaceration through which it had to wade now is the same saving crisis with us the people the most industrious of them in town and country starve by tens of thousands or lead a sort of half life in incessant labour rags and hunger all parts of our social system call out for relief the manufacturer the farmer equally complain the agricultural labourers are reduced to a condition worse than serfdomto a condition of unparalleled destitution and in some districts gangs of them are driven to the field as we learn from parliamentary reports under gangmasters and are lodged promiscuously like cattlemen women and children in temporary booths fitter for beasts than human beings in many parts of this once happy country the agricultural labourers are getting but five and six shillings per week while they are asked l an acre for bits of land to set a few potatoes on the author of the mysteries of london would not have his readers imagine him to be in favour of physical force nowe abhor war even with foreign powers but no words are strong enough to express our loathing and abhorrence of the bare idea of that infernal scourgea civil war another quotation from the work of john hampden junior will serve to express also our opinions on the point the neglect of the public interest it extends to the whole frightful mass of delegated taxation under which the nation groans even more heavily than under the direct national imposts the reviewer justly remarks that the maxim of legislators is every one for himself and the public for us all but could this state of things possibly exist if englishmen did their duty if they resolved to do their own public business as they do their privateto do it themselves and not foolishly intrust to men who have shown themselves at once so incapable and so unworthy of trust in every respect is there any reason why the people of england who conduct their commerce their manufactures their domestic trade and affairs so admirably should not conduct the affairs of their government just as well if they were to set about it is there any reason that a man who guides a ship round the world clear of rocks and breakers should not as well help to steer the vessel of state why should not he who governs a steamengine just as well govern or assist in governing a country the great oxenstiern chancellor of sweden said to his son mark my son with what a small stock of talent a nation may be governed but our aristocracy have for ages demonstrated that they do not even possess this small stock of talent or of as much honesty and the remedy for the evils they have covered us with is as clear as the daylightthe power must be wrested from them but how by arms no englishmen know too well the dangers of revolution they have too much to lose and they have too much humanity the soil of england will not willingly drink in the blood of its children as in the barbarous ages the remedy is alike simple and conspicuous it lies in one joint rising and stern demand of all and every class in the country allmanufacturer and farmer gentleman and ploughman merchant and shopman artizan and labourerall must combine and with one dread voice like another cromwell command the aristocrats to quit the peoples house and give place to better men this is the simple and sole remedy a thousand evils are complained of the whole head is sick and the whole heart is sore but the great root of all is the usurpation of the commons house of parliament by the aristocracy one party proclaims that the whole people is corrupted by the bribery of these patrician senators and demand the universal franchise and in that they demand the true and only remedy but because some are for this and some for that and do not all join in the hearty rending shout for the franchisethat magic word in which lies the constitutionthat cure for all bribery for who can bribe thirty millions of peoplethat guarantee for the steady maintenance of the constitutionfor once in the hands of the totality the totality will never relinquish it againthey cry but they cry in vain till we obtain the franchise we obtain nothing when we obtain that we obtain every thing every petition every demand however stern or resolved that asks for any thing short of the universal franchise is the preparation of an absurdity and the greatest of all absurdities he is just as wise who asks short of this as if he prayed the pope to abolish the catholic religion or a jew to give you all he is worth the aristocracy have usurped the house of commonsfor what just for this very purposeof resisting the proper demands of the peopleof maintaining and perpetuating all the evils for whose removal you pray it is true the people combining on some great emergencydriven as it were into this combination by some desperate pressuremay alarm the aristocracy into some individual concession as in the case of the reform bill but this is a stupendous exertion a violent and convulsive sort of action in the political system which wrests only at the point of famine or national ruin its own rights from the usurping party public opinion is said in this country to be the actual ruling power but it is a fitful and irregular power like the indian or the boaconstrictor it is aroused to action only by hunger or imminent impending danger at the smallest return of ease it pauses it becomes drowsy again and the mischief goes on for another period if public opinion really rules it should lift itself to the necessary height of command and do its work effectually that would save us all much trouble there is but one perfect permanent remedybut one means of absolute cure for our perpetually recurring evils we must have these usurpers out of the peoples house and rule in it ourselves and this is to be done only by insisting on the franchise the whole franchise and nothing but the franchise chapter lxxii mr and mrs curtis it was about two oclock on the following afternoon that a travellingcarriage with four posters thundered along baker street to the great admiration of that semifashionable neighbourhood and at length stopped at a house the door of which was immediately opened by a footman wearing a livery of such varied colours that the rainbow was nothing to it divers countenances appeared at the windows of the neighbouring dwellings for it would seem that the travellingcarriageor rather the persons whom it contained were an object of curiosity and interest to the elderly ladies in turbans in the drawingrooms and the servantmaids in the garrets the latter of whom completely flattened their noses against the panes in their anxiety to obtain a view of the fashionably dressed gentlemen who handed the magnificently attired lady from the vehicle while the footman in the transcendent livery assisted the ladysmaid to alight from the high seat behind and since all the neighbourhood of baker street appears to know right well who the arrivals are we shall not affect any mystery with our readers but plainly distinctly and at once declare that the fashionably dressed gentleman was mr frank curtis and the magnificently attired lady was mrs curtis late mrs goldberry this excellent couple had just returned home after passing their honeymoon in the country as all rich and fashionable people are bound to do and five little goldberrys were crowding at the front door to welcome their mamma and their new papa these specimens of the goldberry race formed in respect to their ages an ascending scale commencing with number and terminating with number and exhibiting as much pleasing variety as could possibly exist in the pugnose species and the chubbyface genus these delightful children set up a perfect yell of joy which was heard at least ten houses off when their new papa assisted their old mamma to alight from the carriage for mrs goldberry could not be said to be young she being on the shady side of forty though blessed with such a juvenile family happy is the man says the psalmist meaning also woman who hath his quiver full of them but mrs goldberry fancied that it rather spoilt the effect of a brides return to behold a hall full of them nevertheless she gave them each a maternal hug and the youngest set up a shout because she did not give him a box of toys into the bargain let us suppose half an hour to have elapsed since the return of the happy pair at the expiration of that period we shall find them seated in the drawingroom enjoying a pleasant ttette chat until the early dinner which had been ordered should be duly announced by the rainbowexcelling footman mrs goldberry was as above stated a trifle past forty although she never acknowledged to more than thirtyone she was somewhat stout had coarse masculine features a tolerably good set of teeth certainly fine eyes and was as yet independent of the adventitious aids of the wigmaker and rouge manufacturer little of her history was known by mr curtis until the period a few weeks previously to the marriage when he became acquainted with her through the simple process of picking up her youngest boy who happened to fall into some mud one day when the lady and her children were taking a walk in the vicinity of baker street this little act of politeness on the part of frank had naturally led to the exchange of a few observations the exchange of a few observations brought mrs goldberry to her own door her own door admitted her into the house whither frank was politely invited to follow her the following her in was followed by the serving up of luncheon the luncheon led to increased communicativeness and the communicativeness made frank aware that his new acquaintance was the widow of the late mr goldberry gentleman and the undisputed possessor of a clear income of five thousand a year glorious news this for frank who suffered the lady to understand that he enjoyed a similar income and then they laughed a great deal at the funny coincidence when frank took his leave he requested permission to call again and this favour could not be refused to a gentleman who had picked the child out of the mud and who had five thousand a year thus frequent visits led to tender proposals the tender proposals ended in marriage and the marriage ended in but we were going on much too fast and therefore we must pause at the point indicated ere we commenced this brief digressionnamely at the ttette discourse while awaiting the announcement of dinner well my love said frank here we are once more in london upon my word theres nothing like london after allas my friend the earl of blackwall says and yet i think we were very comfortable in the country frank observed mrs curtis late mrs goldberry with a simper as fascinating as she could possible render a grimace formed by a large mouth oh but you and i can be happy any where dear said frank we mustnt remain in baker street though i shall take a slapup house in grosvenor square if i can get one there at all events somewhere more in the fashionable quarter now ill tell you what ive been thinking ofand im sure that youll approve of my plan you see theres all those dear children of yoursim sure i love them as well as if i was their real father the darlings youre quite a duck frank exclaimed mrs curtis tapping him slightly on the face welli dont think im a bad fellow at all continued the young gentleman smoothing down his hair very complacently and the plan im going to propose to you will prove it indeed its just what my very particular friend the marquis of woolwich did when he married under similar circumstancesi mean a lady with a young family and what did his lordship do inquired mrs curtis he made this arrangement with his wife explained frankall his own property was to be left in the funds to accumulate for the benefit of the childrennever to be touchedto be locked up like a rat in a trap as one may say and the ladys property was to serve for the household and all other expenses now this is just what i propose we shall do my hundred and forty thousand pounds shall be so locked up and your income my love will do for us to live upon in fact ill make a will tomorrow settling all my fortune on you in case you survive me or on the children at your death it is astonishing how blank mrs curtiss countenance became as her beloved husband proposed this arrangement but she managed to hide her confusion from him by means of her handkerchief while he flattered himself that his generous consideration of her children had drawn tears from her eyes this little arrangement will decidedly be the best continued frank and i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that your dear children are well provided for in fact it was but the day before the happy one which united us that i met my friend the duke of gravesend and he was advising me how to act in the matter saying what he had done as i told you just now and his graces authority is no mean one i can assure you my dear but you dont answer me what are you thinking about mrs curtis was thinking of a great deala horrible idea had struck her was it possible that franks vaunted property was all moonshine and that he was now inventing a means of concealing this fact from her she had been vain enough to suppose all along that he was enamoured of her person far more than of her alleged five thousand a year and he had given her so many assurances of the disinterestedness of his affection that she had congratulated herself on hooking him most completely she knew that he was the nephew of the rich sir christopher blunt and had readily believed therefore that he himself was rich also and experienced though she were in the ways of the world she had not instituted any inquiries to ascertain the truth of his assertions relative to his property in a word she fancied she had caught a green foolish but wealthy young fellow whereas she was now seized with the frightful apprehension that she had laboured under a complete delusion and this alarm was the more terrible as the reader may conceive when we inform him that she herself was a mere adventuresswithout a farthing of annual income derivable from any certain sourceand overwhelmed with debts her creditors having only been kept quiet for the last few weeks by her representations that she was about to marry a young gentleman of fortune in a word she had only taken the house in baker street on the hopeful speculation of catching some amorous old gentleman of property and she had deemed herself particularly fortunate when she received the proposals of an amourous young gentleman who in the course of conversation happened to intimate that he possessed five thousand a year mrs curtiss confusion and terrornay absolute horror may therefore be well conceived when the dreadful suspicion that she herself was as much taken in as her husband flashed to her mind you dont answer repeated frank what the deuce are you thinking of i was thinking my love replied the lady subduing her feelings as well as she could and still clinging to the faint hope that all might not be so bad as she apprehendedi was thinking my love that your arrangement is not feasible for this simple reasonthat my fortune is so locked up and settled on my children i can only touch the dividends and i shall have nothing to receive till july moreover i run very short at my bankers nowindeed i believe i have overdrawn themand so all things considered it will be impossible and unnecessary even if possible to carry your generous proposal into effect illustration i didnt know your money was so locked up exclaimed frank looking mightily stupid in spite of his strenuous endeavours to appear perfectly happy and contented i thought your fortune was at your own disposal certainlythe interest responded mrs curtis now finding by her husbands manner that her worst fears were considerably strengthened the devil murmured frank petulantly what did you say dearest asked the lady oh nothing loveonly that it doesnt signify at all so long as we have the interest of the money settled on your childrenand thats five thousand a year which with your five thousand a year makes us ten love added the lady eyeing him askance to be sure said frank and walking to the window he hummed a tune to conceal his desperate vexation this worthy pair had however each a consolation leftone real the other imaginary the real consolation was on the side of the lady who had saved herself from the danger of a debtors prison by marrying mr curtis the imaginary consolation was the idea which this gentleman nourished that his amiable spouse enjoyed at all events the annual income of five thousand pounds moreover as he glanced round the elegantly furnished drawingroom and in imagination at all the other apartments in the dwelling he thought to himself well hang it with five thousand a year and this splendid house i think i can manage to make myself pretty comfortable of course every things paid forand thats a blessing scarcely had mr curtis disposed of this solacing reflection when the livery servant entered to announce that dinner was served up frank offered his arm to his lady in the most jaunty manner possiblefor as the reader may suppose he had many reasons to induce him to be uncommonly attentive to one who as he thought held the purse and the lady on her side accepted in a most charming manner the homage thus paid herbecause she was not as yet quite certain that her husbands property was really aerial and even if it should prove so he must become the scapegoat between herself and her ravenous creditors indeed the little tokens of endearment which the happy couple thought it fit to lavish upon each other as they descended the stairs created such huge delight on the part of the livery servant following them that this individual totally forgetting the dignity which should have accompanied such a gorgeous livery actually and positively diverted himself by means of that wonderful arrangement of the hands commonly called taking a sight the dinner passed off in the usual way and when the cloth was removed and the domestic was about to retire frank exclaimed in an authoritative manner john bring up a bottle of claret yes sirclaret sir said the servant fidgetting about near the door and glancing uneasily towards his mistress who did not however happen to observe him i specified claret as plain as i could speak john cried mr curtis angrily and so make haste about it yes sironly again hesitated the domestic only what vociferated frank only there aint none sir was the answer no claret john cried mrs curtis now taking part in the discussion no maam there was but two bottles of wine left when you went away maamwith masterand thems the port and sherry on the table now maam john you must be mistaken exclaimed frank your mistress assured me that the cellar was well stocked yes my dear interrupted mrs curtis and i was so far right in telling you what i did because on the very morningthe happy morning dear you knowwhen we went away i wrote to mr beeswing my winemerchantor rather our winemerchant i should sayto order in a good stock of port sherry champagne and claret and what the devil then does mr beeswing mean by this cursed neglect cried frank theres log wood and juice my friend lord paddingtons winemerchants who would be delighted to serve us did you know of this order john that your mistress gave yees siri did was the stammering reply delivered with much diffidence and many twirlings of the white napkin well my dearit is no use to make ourselves uncomfortable about the business said mrs curtis evidently anxious to quash the subject at once you can put up with what there is today and tomorrow you can give an order to your noble friends winemerchants that will do johnyou can retire noby god that will not do vociferated frank this fellow beeswing has behaved most shamefully its a regular insultas the prince of gibraltar would call it but i dare say he forgot it and since you knew of the order john why the devil didnt you see that it was executed while we were away my dear began mrs curtis in a tone of remonstrance answer me you fellow cried frank turning in a threatening way towards the domestic and unable to resist the opportunity of indulging his bullying propensities why the devil didnt you attend to the order given by your mistress well sirand so i did responded the servant now irritated by the imperious manner of his master i went a dozen times to beeswings while you and missus was away frank deardo leave this to me urged the lady no my dearthis concerns me as the master of the house exclaimed frank looking very pompous and very fierce well johnand what the deuce did beeswing say when you did see him please sir he said hed rayther not was the astounding answer mr frank curtis looked aghast i always knew he was the most insulting fellow in the worldthat beeswing cried the lady colouring deeply and affecting violent indignation but we will never deal with him again i vow and declare john tell him to send in his billat once mind he has maam interrupted the servant in fact theres a many letters waiting for master then why the devil didnt you give them to me before exclaimed frank not knowing precisely what to think of mr beeswings conduct but in a very bad humour on account of the disappointment relative to the claret john the servant made no reply to the question last put to him but advancing towards the table produced from his pocket about thirty letters and other documents all of which he laid before his master his countenance the while wearing a most curious and very sinister expression as much as to say youre a very bumptious kind of a young man but these papers will perhaps bring you down a peg or two you may retire said frank savagely and this intimation was forthwith obeyed very curious conduct that of beeswing my dear continued mr curtis as soon as the door had closed behind the servant very deari cant make it out responded mrs curtis but pray dont bother yourself with those letters and papers now they cant be very particular and you will have more time tomorrow dear oh i can look over them and we can go on talking all the same said frank because i cant think how the deuce so many letters should be addressed to me hereinstead of at my own placei mean i shouldnt have thought that such a lot of my friends would have already heard of our union love he added with a tender glance towards the lady who was sitting very much in the style figuratively represented in common parlance as being on thorns and mr curtiss visual rays having thus benignly bent themselves on his companion were once more fixed on the pile of letters and documents lying before him the lady tossed off a bumper of port and filled her glass again in an evident fit of painful nervousness while her husband opened the first letter the contents of which ran as follow oxford street sir we beg to enclose our account for furniture supplied to mrs curtis late mrs goldberry and respectfully solicit an early settlement as the bill has been running for a considerable time your obedient servants tuffle and tunks the devil ejaculated frank as he cast his eyes over the inclosure bill delivered s d god bless my soul thats a stinger why i thought all the furniture must have been paid for my dear not exactly loveyou perceive returned the lady one never pays an upholsterers bill for so long a time you know indeedit quite slipped my memory its such a trifle well so it is dear observed frank reassured by the calm and indifferent way in which his wife disposed of the trifle and he proceeded to open another letter which announced a second trifle in the ensuing manner furnivals inn sir we are desired by messieurs ore and dross jewellers to apply to you for the payment of l s being the amount of debt contracted by your present wife late mrs goldberry with our clients and unless the same be paid together with s d for cost of this application within three days from the date hereof we shall be compelled to have recourse to ulterior measures without farther notice your obedient servants dawkins and smasher what a thundering lot of jewellery you must have to be sure dear exclaimed frank as he handed this letter to his wife but pon my soul i think youve been rather extravagant lovehavent you oh my dearladies must have jewellery you know returned mrs curtis and after all i have paid ore and dross i really am surprised at their importunity but we will pay them and have done with them dear so we will love responded frank and ill ask my friend the duke of hampstead to recommend his jeweller to us but heres a precious letter whywhat the deuce theres a dozen pawnbrokers tickets in it i declare mrs curtis fell back almost senseless in her chair while her husband perused the ensuing letter i rite maddam inform u that i cant sel the dewplikets wich u placed in mi ands as seckeuraty for mi bil and has uve married a

madam its all a cursed plant vociferated frank curtis starting from his seat and throwing down the letter during the perusal of which he had been scarcely able to control his impatience i see it allits a cursed impositionan infernal plantand im aadamned fool thus speaking the young gentleman shook his better half violently by the shoulders and she having nothing to urge in explanation of the extraordinary letter of her washerwoman screamed just loud enough to appear hysterical without alarming the servants and went off into a fit as a matter of course fooleddupeddone brown by god exclaimed curtis as he began to pace the room with no affected agitation saddled with a wife and five childrenoverwhelmed with her debts and my ownand whats a deuced sight worse made an ass of ive regularly sold myself as my friend the dukeno damn the duke im in no humour for dukes and that kind of nonsense nowi dont know a duke and never didand never shalland so its no use telling a parcel of lies any more plague take this old cat with her halfdozen bratsor near upon that number and plague take you then screeched the newlymarried lady recovering with most surprising abruptness from her fit and starting up like a fury why you swindling scoundrel how dare you call me names ill tear your eyes out i will if you say over again what youve just said i say youre a regular adventuress cried frank and you are an impostora cheat yelled the lady your fortune is all a gammon exclaimed curtis and yours all moonshine retorted his wife youve taken me in shameful and youve done the same to me youre cried frank nearly suffocated with rage and so are you whatever youre going to call me vociferated the late mrs goldberry curtis was unable to give forth any rejoinder and mrs curtis resuming her seat had recourse to the truly feminine alternative of bursting into tears a long pause ensued constituting a truce to recriminations and vituperations for several minutes and affording the pair leisure for reflection we will describe the ideas that gradually expanded in their minds as such explanation will the more easily prepare the reader for the result of the quarrel frank curtis on his side recognized the grand truth that what was done could not be undone and then he came to the philosophical conviction that it would be prudent to make the best of a bad job he reflected on the folly of an exposure which would be attended with immediate ruinbringing about his ears a host of creditors who would only become the more clamorous when they were brought in contact with each other and were placed in a condition to ascertain their number and compare the amounts of their claims he fancied that by allowing himself to be represented as a man of property his wife might silence the creditors for a time during which the war could be carried on and though an explosion must sooner or later take place yet it was some consolation to the young gentleman to think that the evil day might be postponed by keen manuvring and skilful generalship he feared being laughed at much more than the idea of a debtors prison and delay was every thing to a man in his desperate circumstances there was no telling what might turn up and he thought that if he could only dazzle the eyes of his uncle sir christopher with fine stories relative to the brilliancy of the match which he had formed with the late mrs goldberry he might contrive to wheedle a large sum of money out of the old gentleman on some such pretext as a desire to discharge divers debts and a disinclination to confess to his wife that he had contracted them on the other hand mrs curtis fell into a similar train of thought it would she fancied be easy for her to visit the numerous creditors assure them that she had as yet intercepted all the letters they had written to her husband and implore them not to ruin her in his good opinion by exposing her liabilities to him she even arranged in her head the very words which she would use when calling on themmy husband is about to sell an estate in ireland and the moment the purchase money is paid i am sure to be enabled to obtain from him a sum sufficient to liquidate all my debts have a little forbearance therefore and all will be well thus she also recognised the utter inutility and monstrous folly of exposing themselves by means of quarrels and as their minds were by these parallel systems of reasoning prepared for reconciliationor at least the show of itthe making up of their dispute was no very difficult matter frank was the one to break the ice with the first overture well i think were two pretty fools he said approaching the chair in which she was rocking herself to and fro dont you to alarm all the house and let our servants know every thing added the lady nono it isnt so bad as that yet returned frank but i vote that we have no more quarrels i am sure i agree to the proposition frank was the answer its carried then without a dissentient voice exclaimed curtis as my friend the duke let us have no more falsehoods interrupted his wife you said just now that you knew no dukenever had known oneand never should but i thought you was in a fit at that moment my dear said frank maybe i wasbut still i could hear all that passed as you very well know however let us be good friends and hold a consultation how we are to proceed good cried frank and we will begin with a glass of wine each therelet us drink each others health heres to you my dear and now to business i suppose all these letters and bills are about unpaid debts of yours precisely so love answered mrs curtis how much do you think they amount to about eighteen hundred pounds i should say and how much money have you got towards paying them dear inquired frank eighteenpence love responded the lady extracting that sum from her pocket there was a pause during which frank curtis refilled the glasses and then the happy pair looked inquiringly at each other as much as to ask well what shall we do this is devilish awkward observed frank but ill tell you what ive been thinking of i am all attention dear said his better half mr curtis then conveyed in words the substance of those reflections which we have recorded above and which had bent his mind towards a reconciliation i entirely approve of all you say remarked mrs curtis and i will now tell you what i have been thinking of fire away love was her husbands encouraging observation the lady detailed in her turn the reflections which had occupied her mind a few minutes previously then we both hold the same opinions exclaimed frank exactly and if we play our cards well there is no immediate danger of any thing remarked the lady but all the threatened writsthe probability of a sudden arrestand the clamours of such small tradesmen or other persons as your delectable washerwoman who is about to add to her family two years after the death of her husband exclaimed frank interrogatively i have trinkets plate and such like things which will realise a hundred pounds said mrs curtis and with that sum we can settle the little claimants who are always more noisy and clamourous than the large ones the colloquy had just reached this highly satisfactory point when a tremendous double knock threatened to beat in the front door and the bell was instantaneously afterwards set ringing in frantic accompaniment some ones ill cried frank and they take this house for a doctors at all events it is no dun observed mrs curtis here the thundering knock and insane ring were repeated i just tell you what my dear resumed the young gentleman rising from his chair and looking as fierce as possible ive a deuced great mind to go out and ask who the devil it is that dares knock and ring twice in half a minute at our door in that fashion im certain its no friend of yoursand its none of mine soas sure as my name is francis curtis esquire of baker streetill but at this instant the diningroom door was thrown open by the domestic in gorgeous livery and the countenance of the warlike francis curtis esquire of baker street grew white as a sheet when the servant announcedcaptain oblunderbuss chapter lxxiii captain oblunderbuss again be jasus and it is my dear friend misther frank currtis exclaimed the redoubtable officer as he stalked into the room then perceiving the lady he untiled his head in a most graceful manneror in plain terms removed his foraging cap with a certain rounding sweep of his right arm saying your servint mim i presume that i have the honourr to pay my rispicts to mrs curtis yeesthat is mrs curtis captain said frank while the lady gave a somewhat cold inclination of the head and a sweet and iligant wife yeve got ye dog cried the captain bestowing a friendly poke in the ribs of the newly married gentleman come shake hands misther currtis men like you and me mustnt harbour animosity against each other let the past be past as the saying is and an excellent saying it is too maam he added in a tone of bland appeal to the lady as he nearly wrung her husbands fingers off in the enthusiasm of his anxiety to convince him that this time at least he came for no hostile purpose sit down captain said frank now feeling more at his ease than he had done since the unexpected appearance of the famous duellist will you take a glass of wine theres port and sherry on the table and theres champagne claret hock and burgundy in the cellaras well as capital whiskey be the holy pokerr exclaimed captain oblunderbuss and ill jist throuble ye for the potheen the thrue irish potheen maam he continued turning once more towards mrs curtis is the most iligant beverage unther the sun on my estates in ould ireland i allow no water at all and my pisanthry is the finest to be seen in the whole counthry indeed sir observed mrs curtis beginning to grow amused with the strange character who had thus intruded himself upon the momentous discussion which she and her husband were carrying on at the time be jasus mim and its as thrue as youre sitting there exclaimed the captain in my own counthry mim im a justice of the pace and i never allow my pisanthry to be interfered with by the gaugers i let them keep as many illicit stills as they like and the consequence is they adore me i should think that to be very likely said frank but heres the whiskeyand theres hot water now john put the sugar on the table thats right the servant having retired captain oblunderbuss proceeded to compound his favourite beverage by mixing equal parts of spirit and water and adding thereto three lumps of sugar i always brew the first glass sthrong mim he observed in honour to ould ireland your health mim but im not irish sir responded the lady laughing then im sure ye ought to be mim cried the captain and be jasus if ye was yed be an honour to the counthry mrs curtis simpered and bowed in acknowledgment of the compliment come old fellow said frank you neednt mind my wife being presentshes a woman of the world as my friend the archbishop of paris used to say of his nieceand so you may as well tell us how you managed to get out of a certain place and what made you think of honouring us with this visit och and be jasus ill answer the last question firrst mr currtis responded the captain well thin ye must know that ive taken a great affection for ye because be the powerrs ive heard spake of your bravery in a many quarrters and it isnt me that would cherish animosity against a gallant fellow the captain might have added that being in want of grog supper and lodging he had racked his brain all day to think of some soft easy individual amongst his acquaintance on whom he could quarter himself for a week or so and having at length remembered to have seen the marriage of mr curtis and mrs goldberry duly announced at the time in the fashionable newspapers the said announcements having been duly paid for as a matter of course it had struck him that he might make himself very comfortable in baker street for a short period well i feel highly flattered by your good opinion of me said frank its quite true that ive killed a man or two in my time and winged half a dozen othersbut really those are trifles which one scarcely thinks of any value at the same time captain we duellists you know are devilish chary of our reputation and so its just as well that the world should talk in a respectful way about useh be the holy pokerr and yere right my boy exclaimed the captain mixing the second glass of grog then turning towards mrs curtis he said i always make my second jorum mim a little stronger than the first for the honour of ould england because thats always my second toast so heres for ould england and now continued captain oblunderbuss after having taken a long draught of the potent liquor ill answer your first question misther currtis and sure its how i got out of limbo that ye was asking about well ill tell ye and be jasus yell say that such a rum start never was seen the cowardly bastes locked me up in horsemonger lane ye know at the suit of one spriggins for three hundred and fortyseven pounds including costs for three whole days i was jest for all the world like a rampagious lion theres an inferrnal iron grating all round the yarrd where the prisonerrs have to walk about and be jasus i chafed and foamed inside those barrs till the other prisonerrs got so frightened they sent a petition to the governor to get me locked up in the sthrong room so the governor sends for me and says he capthain obluntherbuss yere a terror to the other people in the debtors department of the prison and yed betther be after thinking of making some arrangement with your creditor or i shall be forced to put you by yourself in the sthrong roombe jasus says i and ill skin any man who shall darr to lay even the tip of a finger on me for such a purposewell says the governor but if youve ever so little in the shape of ready money to offer your creditor ill see him myself and thry what i can do for yeso i pulled out my purse and behold ye id jest two pound three shillings and sixpence to pay three hundred and fortyseven pounds withis it threehalfpence in the pound yell be afther offering asks the governorjest that same says i and if ever misther spriggins gets another farthing out of me then ill skin myselfso away goes the governor to the creditor and heaven only knows what blarney he pitches himbut in the course of a day or two down comes a discharge on condition that i pay the threehalfpence in the poundnow says i thats trating an irish jintleman as he deserves and so i got clean out of that inferrnal place heres your health mim and the captain emptied his glass you managed that business capital exclaimed frank curtis who began to think that it would be no bad speculation to maintain the martial gentleman altogether in baker street to frighten away the creditorsor at all events to employ him to go round to them in case they should prove inclined to act in a hostile manner towards him at that moment his eyes met those of his wife and the glance of intelligence which was exchanged between them showed that the same thought had struck them both and at the same time help yourself captain said frank that whiskey was sent me as a present by the crown prince of denmark for having been second to his illustrious wifes uncles stepmothers first cousins nephew in a duel three years ago blood and thuntherr ejaculated captain oblunderbuss what a disthant relation but the potheen is beautiful i always mix my third glass sthronger than the two first because in this same thirrd i dhrink to the ladiesthe sweetheartsand god bless em mrs curtis again acknowledged the compliment with a simper and an inclination of the head and by the time the captain had disposed of his third glass the domestic in transcendent livery announced that coffee was served in the drawingroom thither the party accordingly proceeded captain oblunderbuss escorting mrs curtis with a politeness which would have been perfectly enchanting had he not smelt so awfully of poteen and now in a few minutes behold the trio seated so cozily and comfortably at the table in the drawingroom sipping the nectar of mocha while a friendly little contest took place between frank and the captain to decide who could tell the greatest number of lies in the shortest space of time be jasus cried oblunderbuss this coffee is an iligant beverage but saving your prisence mim it dont come up to the coffee which i grew on my own estate in ould ireland the thruth was i had such a vast extent of bogland that i was at a loss what use to turrn it toso i sent my steward off to arabiayes be the holy pokerr direct off to arabiato buy up as much coffee as he could get for money och and with a powerr of coffeeberries did he come back in the next west indiaman up the meditherranean and wasnt it a sowing of them same berries that we had in the bog ye should have seen the land eight months afterwards with the coffeeplants grown up bigger than gooseberry bushes and making the whole counthry smell of coffee for eight miles round i rayalized seven hunthred pounds by that spec the first year and i have gone on with the culthure of coffee ever since oh said frank it is astonishing what improvements might be introduced in that way if one only had the sense to do it when i was staying in paris i was very intimate with the governor of the bank of france and he had a beautiful conservatory on the top of the bank he took me up one day to see it twas in the middle of winter and cold as the devil in the open airbut warm as a toast inside the conservatory well there i saw melons as large as a bumbshell growing in flowerpots no bigger than that slopbasonpineapples hanging over the sides of teacupsand a kind of fruit the name of which ive forgotten but i know that it was as large as a horses head and of the same shape so i said to my friend the governor of the mint says i mr curtis stopped for the radiant footman entered the room saying please sir two men wish to speak to you immediately two men exclaimed frank casting an uneasy glance towards his wife who it was evident shared her husbands very natural apprehensions yes sirbut here they are added the footman then turning round towards the intruders he said why didnt you wait quiet down in the hall till id informed master that you wanted to speak to him cos we doesnt do business in that ere way old feller responded a voice which was not altogether unknown to either mr curtis or the captain proggs the officerrby god vociferated the latter starting from his seat yesits me and my master mr mac grab at your service genlemen said proggs pushing his way past the footman and entering the room with his hat on his head and his stout stick in his hand please mr curtis siryoure wanted and as these words were uttered by the subordinate the principal himselfnamely mr mac grabmade his appearance and a very dirty one it was too in the doorway while the footman stood aghast and mrs curtis went off into hysterics wanted cried frank casting an appealing glance towards the captain who the devil wants me whose suit is it at sir asked proggs turning towards his superior beeswing winemerchantdebt two hundred pounds owing by the lady answered mr mac grab is it arresting my friend misther curtis ye mane demanded captain oblunderbuss advancing towards the officers with tremendous fierceness now that he found his own personal security unendangered and why not growled mac grab shrouding himself behind his man proggs is it why not yere afther asking shouted captain oblunderbuss now be jasus and if ye dont both make yourselves as scarce as ye was before ye was borrn its myself thatll tayche ye a lesson of purliteness in the twinkling of a bedpost oh thats all gammon muttered proggs mr curtis must either pay the money or come along with us he wont do neither the one nor the tother ye bastes of the earrth exclaimed the captain i say now began mac grab but before he had time to utter another word the redoubtable captain wrenched the short stick from the hands of mr proggs and throwing it to a distance boldly attacked the officers with his long sinewy arms in such an effectual manner that they disappeared from the drawingroom in as short a space of time as their assailant had represented by that beautiful figure of rhetoricthe twinkling of a bedpost mrs curtis had deemed it most prudent to go off into a fitfrank was nailed to the floor by the terror of being captured and dragged off to a debtors prisonthe footman considered it wise to remain a mere spectator of the fightand thus the captain was unassisted in his gallant onslaught upon the sheriffs officer and his man the captain however had an advantage on his side namely that when he had once succeeded in driving the enemy back as far as the staircase it was comparatively an easy matter to fling them headlong downa feat which he performed without the least ceremony or hesitation to the infinite alarm of the femaleservants in the kitchen who came rushing up into the hall from that lower region screaming as heartily as they could under the conviction that the house was tumbling about their ears hold your pace my dears exclaimed captain oblunderbuss rushing down the stairs after the vanquished enemyhis countenance purple with whiskey and excitementevery vein in his forehead swollen almost to burstingand his fists clenched for a renewal of the onslaught well make you smart for this my man growled mac grab as he rose painfully from the hallfloor im jiggered if we dont too added proggs picking himself up as it were from the last step and feeling his legs and arms to see if any of his bones were broken out of the house ugly bastes that ye are thundered the captain the officers had received sufficient evidence of the redoubtable gentlemans warlike propensities to induce them to beat a rapid retreatand the moment they had evaporated by the frontdoor the captain banged it violently after them securing it with bolts and chain thats the way we serve out the riptiles in ould ireland my dears he exclaimed turning towards the female servants who having at length comprehended the nature of the amusement going on had ceased to scream and were enjoying the animated scene as much as if it had been a play frank curtis had heard the front door close violently and the drawing of the bolts afterwards convinced him that the house was cleared of its invaders he accordingly descended the stairs laughing heartily now that the immediate peril had been averted by the prowess of the captain the resplendent footman was following close behind his mastervery anxious to solicit his wages and his discharge there and then and only prevented from acting thus abruptly by the formidable presence of captain oblunderbuss now my frinds exclaimed this gallant gentleman who was quite in his element under existing circumstances the house is in a complate state of siege ye must look to me as the commander of the garrison so let the area and the groundfloor windows be all properly fastened take care of the back door wherever it leads toand be jasus well keep the rascals out i know em well theyll be thrying all manner of dodges to get in but theyll find themselves as mistaken as the old lady was when she scratched the bedpost and thought she was scratching her head then with wonderful alacrity captain oblunderbuss hastened to superintend the arrangements and the precautions which he had briefly suggested he examined the windows in the drawing roomhe descended to the kitchenwent out into the areapoked his nose into the coalcellarinspected the yard at the backissued his orderssaw that they were executedand then drank off half a tumbler of whiskey neat both as a slight refreshment after the exertions of the evening and as a token of his satisfaction at the various measures which he had adopted with a view to convert the house into an impregnable fortress by this time mrs curtis had made up her mind to recover from her fit but she was so dreadfully shocked at the exposure which had taken place before the servants that she retired to her bedchamber forthwith the captain and frank then sat down to hold as the former gentleman expressed it a council of warrr and as one bottle of whiskey had been emptied and there was not another in the house the martial gentleman was kind and condescending enough to put up with gin of which exhilirating fluid he found to his great satisfaction there was a large supply in the cellar what the devil would you have me do in this cursed embarrassment asked frank be jasus and ill jest tell ye now answered the captain let me seethis is thuesday well we must maintain the siege until sunday and then you must give the traps leg bail into another counthy whose furniturr is it in the house whyits ours and it isnt responded frank och and be asy nowi understand ye my boy cried the captain it isnt paid fur ye manebut possission is nine points of the law and be the holy pokerr well make it the whole twilve jest allow me to carry ye through this little affair next sunday night me lad ye must be off into surrey with the lady and little ones and lave me to manage here on monday at the top of the mornin ill have in a broker and sell off every stick and ill bring ye over the proceeds like a man of honourr as i am so far so good said frank but how are we to get things to eat between this and sunday if no one is to stir out of the place is it ayting ye mane when theres three gallons of gin in the house demanded captain o blunderbuss with something like indignation in his tone and manner well but the wife and the children cant live upon gin captain observed frank even though the servants should have no objection not live upon gin me boy vociferated captain oblunderbuss in a state of astonishment as complete and unfeigned as if some one had just shown him his own name in the army list or presented him with the titledeeds of his often vaunted irish estates not live upon gin misther curtis he repeated surveying frank as if this young gentleman were actually taking leave of his senses show me the discontended mortal my frind that says he wont live upon gin and ill jest just what asked frank somewhat dismayed at this irascibility on the part of his companion ill skin himby the holy pokerr cried captain oblunderbuss rapping his clenched fist violently upon the table there was a long pause during which the two gentlemen emptied and refilled their glasses be the way me boy suddenly exclaimed the captain as if an idea had just struck him is that old uncle of yours in town at present yes he came back some days ago i understand replied frank dye think hed bleed asked the captain for tis supplies to carry on the warr in an iligant style for a long time to come that we want since now that were once on a frindly footing together curtis im not the boy to desert ye in your throubles he might have added that he would stick to mr and mrs curtis so long as they had a bottle of spirits to give or a shilling to lend him i really think that its very likely you might be able to draw the old bird said frank and to tell you the truth i had already entertained the idea besides he wont dare refuse you captain be jasus i should take it as an insult if he did exclaimed the man of war caressing his moustache but let us strike the irrron while it is hot dthraw up a letter to sirr christopherr in your best style and ill be off with it at once trust me for getting out of the garrison safe and coming back again in the same way but mind and keep a sharp watch while im gone frank promised compliance with this injunction and hastened to pen a letter to his uncle the captain kindly undertaking to dictate the sense in which it was to be written the precious document ran as follows my dear uncle i hope this will find you blooming as it leaves me and as you and me have both made ourselves happy by marriage dont let us have any more animosity between us in fact i will show you at once that i mean to forget the past and treat you as an uncle ought to be treated by his dutiful nephew well then to come to the point my friend captain oblunderbuss whom you have the pleasure of knowing and who improves vastly on acquaintance has kindly lent me five hundred pounds just to settle a few pressing debts which i had contracted during the time that i was so unfortunate as to be on bad terms with you and as the captain wants his money again and i dont like to tell my wife so soon after marriage that i owe this sum you will greatly oblige me by giving the captain a cheque for the amountor else bank notes at oncehe isnt very particular which i dare sayand i will repay you the moment i get my quarters allowance as the beloved and angelic creature whom i shall have so much pleasure in introducing to you and to my dear aunt charlotte has promised me seven hundred pounds every three months to spend as i like and no questions asked so no more at present my dear uncle from your dutiful attached obliged and grateful nephew francis curtis what do you think of that demanded frank triumphantly when he had read the letter aloud for the opinion of his friend is it what i think exclaimed the captain be the powerrs and its as well as i could have done it myself if id studied it for a week thanks to your suggestions added frank and now ill just seal and direct it while you finish your glass captain oblunderbuss did drain the contents of his tumbler as frank foresaw that he would do for it was one of that gallant gentlemans maxims never to waste good liquorand being thus fortified with upwards of a pint of whiskey and ditto of ginthe effects of which were evident only in the fiery hue of his complexion but by no means in his gait nor speechhe prepared to set out on his expedition to the dwelling of sir christopher blunt frank said he putting on his foraging cap and conveying the letter to his pocket take the pokerr the poker repealed the young man with mingled surprise and dismay and what else would ye take to dash out the brains of any man who should thry to spring in at the door while i go out exclaimed oblunderbuss thats right me boy he added as curtis shouldered the fireimplement not that its likely for any of them bastes of the earrth to be lurrking about so soon afther the little affair of jest now but its as well to be on our guarrd accordingly frank curtis stood behind the front door poker in hand as the redoubtable officer issued forth but the coast was clear so far as the retainers of the sheriff were concerned and the peace of the garrison remained unmolested frank closed chained and bolted the door again and captain oblunderbuss wended his way with an awful swagger down the street frightening by his fierce looks all the small children whom he happened to encounter chapter lxxiv three months after marriage sir christopher blunt was pacing his drawingroom in a very agitated manner and the expression of his countenance was so ludicrous in its reflection of the thoughts that were stirring within his breast that it was impossible to say whether he was influenced by commingled hope and suspense on the one hand or by fear and shame on the other it was pretty evident that he had not been out all day for he was unshavenand he wore the light blue dressinggown the bright red trousers and the scarlet silk cap which his dear wife had devised as a most becoming morning costume but which gave him the appearance of a mussulman quackdoctor as the golden lustre of the handsome lamp brought forth all the flaunting effects of the garb advancing towards the timepiece sir christopher compared his watch with that dial a quarter to nine he murmured to himself as he restored the huge gold repeater to his fob and the doctors have been an hour with her already welli never heard of such a thing beforethree months after marriageits impossiblequite impossible dr wagtail is a very clever man no doubtbut hes wrong for once in his life if it was six or seven months nowone might suppose that a premature birthbut three months and the worthy knight paced the apartment in a manner which showed that he didnt know wha the deuce to make of it well he continued again speaking in a murmuring tone after a short pause it may be so after all for really science does discover such wonderful things nowadays and the world seems to undergo so many strange changes that upon my word i should not be at all surprised if on going out some morning i was to see the people walking on their heads along jermyn street ah things werent like this when i was a boy but then i must recollect that i live in the fashionable quarter of the town now and ladies at the west end aint like those vulgar citizens wives thank god that i didnt get in for portsoken it was quite enough to have filled the high and responsible office of sheriff and to have received the distinguished honour of knighthoodbut three months exclaimed sir christopher interrupting himself and flying back with ludicrous abruptness to the idea that was uppermost in his mind three months and after all who knows but that its the fashion at the west end and im sure that if it is i shall be very glad that it has happened so and yet the most extraordinary part of the business is thatwhen i suspected something of the kind and just hinted at it to lady bluntsheshe scratched my face to pieces for me very extraordinary indeed sir christopher now became lost in a maze of conjecture vague suspicion and bewilderment through which he certainly could not find his way and heaven only knows how long he might have remained in the labyrinth had not dr wagtail appeared to his rescue well doctor exclaimed the knight hastening to meet the physician my dear sir christopher i congratulate you said dr wagtail considering it decent and becoming to assume a joyous and smirking expression of countenance for the occasion while he wrung the knights hand with most affectionate warmth for it is my duty he continued now suddenly adopting the pompous and important style of the fashionable physician to a rich familyfor it is my duty sir christopher to announce to you that you are the happy father of a charming boy with whom her ladyship has been kind enough to present you illustration a boyeh doctor faltered the knight but of course it isnti meanit cant beaafull grown child well my dear sir christopher responded dr wagtail who perfectly understood where the shoe pinched from what mr snipekin the talented and muchsoughtafter accoucheur whom i deemed it prudent to call in just nowfrom what mr snipekin says sir christopher i do believe that the dear little creature has come a leetle before his time but pray dont make yourself uneasy on that account my dear sir christopher for the sweet babe is in no danger and is an uncommonly fine child to be sure then it is a little before its time doctoreh said sir christopher butdoctoryou and me are old friends and you can speak candidly you knowandthe truth isyou must remember thatthatour marriage only took placethree months agoand it seems to me rather unusualnot that i suspect dear lady blunts virtue for a momenton the contraryi know her to be a perfect paragon of morality at the same timethree months doctorand a fine boy my dear sir christopher responded dr wagtail foreseeing that the amount of his fee would depend vastly upon the state of mind in which the knight might be when he should give it and acting moreover upon his favourite principle of humouring the whims and wishes of all persons with whom he had any professional connexionmy dear sir christopher he said looking very solemn indeed your avocations in the world have not allowed you time to dive into the mysteries of science and investigate the arcana of learningmuch less to pursue with sesquipedalian regularity the routine of that course of study which in the abstract and also considered in a purely professional point of viewand having due regard to the wonders of physiological sciencein factahemyou understand me sir christopher yees doctor drawled forth the bewildered knight but i think you were going to satisfy meyou knowabout the three monthsand a fine boydoctor i was coming to that point my dear sir christopher said dr wagtail in fact i was about to observe that physiology properly considered in its etymological signification comprehends the entire science of nature but i must impress upon your mind sir christopher that the ratiocinative propensities of modern physicians have induced them doubtless after much profound cogitation to restrict the term to that department of physical knowledge relating referring and belonging exclusively to organic existence and thus sir christopherahemyou follow me oh quite easyindeed returned the knight wondering in his own mind whether it were dog latin that stunned his ears and also how any one individual could possibly pick up and retain such an immense amount of knowledge butthe point was doctor precisely my dear sir christopher exclaimed the physician looking as wise as all the seven sages of greece put together it was to that very point which i was comingbut i thought that a detailed and full explanation would prove most satisfactory to you oh decidedly doctorand i am sure i am very much obliged to you for taking the trouble toto well then my dear sir christopher interrupted the fashionable physician all my premises being granted and the arguments which i have adduced being fully admitted i think that the demonstration is easy enough consequently sir christopher it is quite apparent that a child may be born three months after marriage at the same time i think i can assure you that in future your excellent and amiable lady will not be quite so premature in her accouchements it is not unusual then doctor amongst your female patients said sir christopher who was not entirely satisfied yet it is by no means unusual that a first child should be born a few months after marriage my dear sir christopher answered the physician and perhapsperhaps its rather fashionable than otherwise asked the knight in a hesitating manner welli dont know but what it is sir christopher replied dr wagtail taking a pinch of snuff and now that your mind is completely set at rest on this pointas indeed it must and ought to be after the full and professional explanation which i have given youi will return to the chamber of your amiable and excellent lady and see whether you can be permitted to visit her for a few moments do my dear doctor and doctor cried the knight as a sudden idea struck him pray donti mean it is not necessary to let lady blunt know thatthatin a wordthat i asked you any questions oh certainly not my dear sir christopher exclaimed the physician and he then quitted the room well thought the knight to himself as soon as he was again alone and so i am the fatherthe happy fatherand he made a slight grimaceof a fine boy a fine boyeh pon my honour im very gladvery glad indeed a son and heira little christopher how very kind of my dear wife it is a tie which will bind us togetherperhaps soften her temper a leetleand make her more sparing in the use of her finger nails wellif its only for that the coming of this child will be a great blessinga very great blessing but i really do wish the dear babe had made its appearance about six months later not that it matters muchseeing that i must be its father and that the thing is rather fashionable than otherwise besidesdoctor wagtail is such a clever mansuch a very clever manand his explanation was so completely satisfactoryso very lucid and cleara fool might understand it well i really ought to be a very happy fellow but all the knights attempts at selfpersuasion and selfconsolation were futile there was a weight upon his spirits that he could not throw offand in the depths of his secret soul there was an awful misgiving to the existence of which he vainly endeavoured to blind his mental vision he strove to be gayhe tried to establish the conviction that he was perfectly happy and contentedhe did all he could to make himself admit to himself that the doctors reasoning was conclusivestill he could not shut out from his heart the ever recurring thought that the physicians argument might be very conclusive indeed but that he was totally unable to understand a word of it then came the fear of ridiculeand this was the most galling sentiment of all but on the other hand there was an apprehension which was not without its weight namely the anger of his wife in case she should discover that he had dared to doubt her virtue thus by the time the doctor came back the silly old gentleman had determined to take matters just as he found them and though half suspecting that there was something wrong in the business he resolved to maintain as contented an air as possible as the only means of combatting ridicule should he experience it or of quieting his wife should she hear of any thing to excite her irritability we are getting on so well my dear sir christopher said the physician that we can see you for a few minutes but we cannot bear any loud speaking as yet and we establish it as a condition that you do not attempt to kiss our child more than once for fear you should set it crying and make our head ache sir christopher attempted a pleasant smile and followed dr wagtail to the chamber of the indisposed lady the moment the door was opened the shrill but nevertheless apparently halfstifled cry of a newborn child saluted the knights ears and hastening up to the bed he bent over and kissed his wife see what heaven has sent us sir christopher said the lady in a low and weak voice well suited to the solemnity of her observation and slightly uncovering the bedclothes she exhibited a tiny object looking amazingly red but which she assured him was the sweetest little face in the world that it isthe pretty creatur observed a hoarse voice which appeared to emanate from the chimney but which in reality came from no further off than the fireplace and belonged to an elderly woman of tremendous corpulency who was arranging some babylinen on a clotheshorse ive nussed a many ladies continued the stout proprietress of the hoarse voice but never such a patient dear as yourn sir christopher and i never see such a angel at its birth as that babby why continued the woman advancing towards the knight and giving him a good long stare while potent odours of gin assailed his nostrils all the while i do declare that the babby is as like his father as he can be sir christopher grinned horribly a ghastly smile and slipped halfaguinea into the nurses hand at which proof of his generosity she dropped him a curtsey that shook the house so profoundly as nearly to drop her through the floor yesthe babbys as like you sir as two peas is like each other continued the nurse while dr wagtail and the accoucheur exchanged rapid but intelligent glances at the excellence of the idea and sir christopher grunted like a learned pig which has just put its snout upon the right card in a show im sure sir you ought to be wery much obleeged to missus for presenting you with such a cherub poor dear she had a sad time of itbut she bore it like a saint as she is wont you let master have just one kiss at the little dear my lady the saint was just at that moment wondering whether the child as it grew up would bear any resemblance to a certain tall footman in a certain family at the west end but why such an idea should enter her head we must leave to the readers to divine the nurse repeated her question adding do let the little dears pa just kiss it once and then we must turn him out you know maam for the present yes sir christopheryou may kiss the little cherub if you like said lady blunt in a tone which was meant to impress on her husbands mind a full sense of the favour conferred upon him but pray dont make the sweet child squeal outfor youre so rough the knight accordingly touched the babe with his lips which he smacked to make believe that the kiss was a hearty one in spite of his wifes injunction and this ceremony being completed he was turned out of the room by the nurse whose power on such occasions amounts as all fathers know to an absolute despotism the nurse is a species exhibiting but little variety stout and in good spirits she must always be and bottled stout and ardent spirits she highly esteems she moreover has an excellent appetite and is fond of many meals in the course of the day she awakes at five or six in the morning and makes herself strong hot coffee and a couple of rounds of toast putting a great deal of sugar to the former and a vast quantity of butter to the latter at nine she is ready for her breakfastthe first meal not being so denominated and in fact considered as nothing at all if her mistress be awake the nurse will amuse her with innumerable stories relative to her former places and she will not fail to make herself out the very best nurse in the world she will describe how one lady was inconsolable because she could not have her at the desired time how another lady would eat nothing unless prepared by the said nurses own hands how a third would have died if it had not been for her care and attention and how she never slept a wink nor put her clothes off once for a whole month while in attendance upon another lady then she is sure to be well connected and to have seen better days and if asked for her address she is certain to reply lord bless you my dear all you have to do is to send and inquire for me in suchandsuch a street and any body will tell you where i live in fact she is as well known in her quarter of the town as the queen is at pimlico butto continue the category of mealsat eleven oclock she is quite prepared for a muttonchop and half a pint of stout and she forces a basin of gruel down her mistresss throat accompanied with many a poor dear im sure you must want it at two oclock she has a good appetite for her dinner and then she manages to get on pretty comfortably till teatime the nurse is very fond of her tea and likes it strong after tea as her mistress most likely sleeps she gets hold of an odd volume of a romance or a newspaper not more than a week old and it is ten to one that she believes every word she reads in both if her mistress happen to be awake the nurse will comment upon what she reads the newspaper especially is sure to set her talking on the hardness of the times and arouse all her reminiscences of when she was a gal she will often express her mysterious wonder at what the world is coming to and invariably speaks as if every thing had undergone a great change for the worst she is sure to know a poor family whom she is mainly instrumental in saving from starvation and she is equally certain to descant upon the necessity of sobriety and frugality amongst the working classes then she remembers that it is time for missus to take her medicine but when she goes to the shelf or the cupboard she stays a little longer there than is quite necessary to pour out the medicine aforesaid and as she approaches the bed to administer the same she wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and her eyes are observed to water the invalid lady may now thank her stars if she be not assailed with an odour of ardent spirit while she receives her medicine from the hand of the nurse well the time passes away somehow or another until the supper hour and it is a remarkable fact that the nurse never seems wearied of the monotony of her avocation but then in the evening she manages to get halfanhours chat with the servants down stairs and the chat is rendered the more pleasant by a little drop of something short out of a black bottle which the cook mysteriously produces from the cupboard on these occasions the nurse exhibits all her importance she assures the listening domestics that it was very fortunate she happened to be sent for to attend upon missus as if any other nurse had been called in the results would have been most unpleasantly different she then expresses her opinion of the medical attendant and her estimation of this gentleman is invariably regulated by the amount of his liberality towards her if he gave her the odd shillings which accompanied the sovereigns in the little piece of paper containing the fee then he is sure to be a very clever man indeed but if he forgot this important duty then in the nurses estimation he is certain to be a most unfit doctor to call in and it was quite a wonder that he didnt kill poor dear missus having thus delivered her opinion which is received as gospel by the servants she hastens up stairs again and relates to her mistress her own version of the conversation which has taken place down below after supper she no longer partakes of ardent spirit on the sly and unblushingly brews herself a potent glass but then she is sure to have an excusesuch a dreadful pain in the stomach or a bad cold and her mistress whose peace of mind depends on keeping her attendant in a good humour says in a mild languid voice do make yourself comfortable nurse and the nurse obeys the hint to the very letter the liquor induces her to descant upon spirits in general and she is sure to inform her mistress that the duke of wellington doesnt sell near such good things as the duck and drake but that the beautifullest gin is at the public round the corner sometimesand this is one of the worst features in her characterthe nurse will take it into her head to relate gloomy stories to her mistress and when once she gets on this subject the devil himself could not stop her she tells how she knew a lady who went on very well for ten days and then popped off all on a sudden or else she was once in a house which caught on fire in the middle of the night and the poor lady and child were burnt to death if the husband should happen to be out late the nurse when she is in this gloomy vein talks mysteriously of the danger of the streets and says how she knew a gentleman who was run over by an omnibus during the fog but in justice to the nurse we must observe that these horrible subjects are not very frequently touched on by herand only when she gets somewhat maudlin with too much ardent spirit or bottled stout for the first week she is in her place no one comes to see her but in the course of the second she is visited by her married daughter and her married daughters eldest girl during the third week the nurse is constantly wanted by people who come to see her or inquire for her and at the beginning of the fourth the front door bell is rung frantically and the nurse hears with a countenance so innocent that it is almost impossible to think she has prearranged the whole matter that mrs soandso whom she has pledged herself to attend upon is just taken in labour and she the nurse must go to her directly her mistress is by this time well enough to do without her and the nurse receives her full months wages for three weeks attendance but let us return to sir christopher blunt whom we left at that pleasant point when having undergone the ceremony of embracing the babe which according to his ladys account heaven had sent him he wended his way back to the drawingroom at that precise moment sir christopher would have given just one half of his fortune to be enabled to undo all he had done three months previously he had married in haste and he now repented at leisure but it was too late to retract and he found to his infinite mortification that he must grin and bear it the accoucheur shortly entered the room to report that all was going on as well as could be expected and having received his fee he took his departure soon afterwards the pompous and selfsufficient dr wagtail made his appearance and received his fee which out of sheer ostentation the knight rendered as liberal as the physician had anticipated these little matters being disposed of sir christopher rang the bell ordered up a bottle of claret and was about to console himself with the solitary enjoyment of the same when an astounding double knock and tremendous ring at the frontdoor startled him so fearfully that he spilt the wine over his red trousers and nearly upset the table on which his elbow was leaning who can this be he exclaimed aloud captain oblunderbuss cried the footman throwing open the door as wide as possible to afford ingress to the swaggering officer chapter lxxv the knight and the captain captain oblunderbuss murmured sir christopher in a faint tone as he sank back dismayed into his seat be the powerrs and how are ye my hearty old cock was the polite salutation of the gallant gentleman as advancing close up to the knight he grasped his hand and shook it with as much energy as if he were a policeman carrying off a starving mendicant to the stationhouse for the heinous crime of begging thank you captainiim pretty well responded sir christopher well thats a blessing be jasus cried the captain coolly taking a seat is it claret that youre after dhrinking sirr christopher he demanded taking up the bottle and holding it between his eyes and the lamp iligant stuff in its waybut not my lush have ye no potheen in the house sir christopherr potheen repeated the knight not understanding the name nor half liking the intrusion is it you sirr christopher that dont know what rale irish potheen is cried the captain why theres niver a child in ould irreland that cant spell potheen whiskey sir christopherwhiskey but ill save ye the throuble of ringing for it yourselfand with these words captain oblunderbuss applied his hand most vigorously to the bellpull the footman answered the summons your masther says sirrah exclaimed the captain that yere to bring up a bottle of the best irish whiskeyrale potheenwith a tumbler a spoon a lemon hot water and sugar and look sharrp about it too the domestic retired and sir christopher stared in amazement at the captain for the worthy knight was so astounded by the free and easy manners of his visitor that he was not quite certain whether he sir christopher blunt was actually in his own house at the moment or whether he was in some public coffeeroom where every one had a right to order the waiter about as he chose i hope youre not offinded with me sir christopherr by making myself at home said the captain but it isnt me thats the boy to stand on any ceremony the knight thought that his visitor could never have said a truer thing in his life not i be jasus continued captain oblunderbuss but thin im the man to let others do the same with me and if you should ever find yourself in the wilds of conamarrra sir christopher jist ask the first naked urchin ye meet with to show the way to bluntherbuss park and see if i wont trate ye as ye deserve to be trated blood and murther its me that keeps open house save whin the sheriffsofficers are prowling about the neighbourhood which is generally from the st of january to the st of december in every year the servant now made his appearance with the whiskey and the et ceteras which the gallant gentleman had ordered and the said gallant gentleman straightway began to brew himself some toddy with the air of an individual who had had nothing stronger than mild ale to drink all day long may i request to be informed began sir christopher his courage reviving now that the captains visit appeared to be one altogether of an amicable nature faith and is it to be informed yed be ejaculated oblunderbuss as he stirred his whiskeyandwater up with the spoon but dont alarm yourself sir christopherr my call this evening was merely jist to ask ye how ye do and present ye with a little note from that rale broth of a boy misther frank curtis frankmy nephew exclaimed sir christopher what can he want with me surely tis not to congratulatebut nohe cant have heard of that yet be the powerrs and is there any thing to congratulate ye upon sir christopher cried the captain have ye been made a baronetor elected an alderman i would have you know captain oblunderbuss said the knight in a solemn tone that i was once so unadvised as to put up for portsoken be jasus have nothing to do with portit lies heavy on the stomach my frind interrupted the gallant officer dhrink potheenand youll niver grow old nor yet gray but we were spaking of congratulations is it possible that your dear wife has tumbled down stairs and broken her neck or has she presented ye with a pledge of her affiction since you must know captain oblunderbuss responded the knight it isthe latter i give ye joy old brick vociferated the gallant officer and seizing sir christophers hand he subjected it to such a process of violent shaking that the victim almost yelled out with agony but from what frank tould me continued the captain at length relinquishing the hand which he had so unmercifully squeezed i thought you hadnt been married long enough for such a happy evint to take place howeveri wish ye joy my frind and now to business read this little bit of a note and yell be charmed with the kind way in which frank curtis spakes of ye the knight received the letter which the captain handed to him but ere he had time to break the seal the door opened and the nurse made her appearance well nursewhat is it demanded sir christopher please sir was the reply missus wants to know who it was as come with such a chemendous knock and ring that it has set her poor head aaching ready to split and the blessed babby acrying as if he was in fits tell your misthress nurse exclaimed the visitor in an imperious tone that its captain obluntherbuss of bluntherbuss park irrreland with an awful rattling of the rs and prisint my best rispicts to your lady and the babby thankee sir replied the nurse but missus says sir christopher please that she hopes you wont make no noise in the house very wellvery well my good woman exclaimed the knight hastily tell your mistress i shall not be engaged long and will come up and see her presently wery good sirand the nurse withdrew sir christopher then proceeded to open the letter but it was with trembling handsfor the visit of the nurse had thrown him into a most unpleasant state of nervousnesshe being well aware that he should receive a blowing up on account of the captains callalthough no one could possibly wish more devoutly than himself that such a call had not taken place ye thrimble sir christopher cried the captain but theres no need to be alarrmedfor your nevvy hasnt sent ye a challenge so let your mind be at paceand read the little note at your leisure im in no hurry for an hour or two and indeed the captain appeared to be quite comfortable for he brewed himself a second glass of whiskey and waterthrew some coals upon the fireand trimmed the lamp in such a way that the flame rose above the globe meantime sir christopher perused the letter with great attention and did not altogether seem to relish its contents i really cannot oblige my nephew in this respect he said fidgetting the paper about in his hands the truth ishe has not behaved altogether well to menor to lady bluntand if i was to do this for him lady blunt would be so angry he must fight his own way in the world captain oblunderbuss as i did for i have no hesitation to admit that i rose from nothingindeed i glory in the fact and having filled the high and responsible office of sheriff with credit to myself and advantage to my fellowcitizens damn the high office of shiriff exclaimed the gallant gentleman striking his fist upon the table i want my moneyand it isnt captain obluntherbuss that yell be afther putting off in this snaking fashion but my dear sir said the knight in a tone of gentle remonstrance i dont owe you the money be jasus but your nevvy doesand therefore its all in the family cried the captain that is a proposition i cannot agree to my dear sir returned the knight d ye mane to differ from me demanded the captain looking desperately ferocious whyas for thatii d ye mane to differ from me i repate vociferated captain oblunderbuss again striking the table with his fist but so violently this time that the bottles and glasses danced a hornpipe answer me that sirr christopherr i dont wish to offend you captaini couldnt wish to do that but added the knight i must beg leave most respectfully to dissent from the proposition that i am in any way answerable for the debts of mr curtis and since he has married a lady of fortune let him be candid with her at once and is it candid that hes to be when the wife would kick up hell and blazes cried oblunderbuss but i tell you purty frankly my frind that if ye dont shell out the seven hunthred pounds seven hundred ejaculated sir christopher it says only five hundred in the letter i dont care two rraps for the letther answered the captain all i know is that misther frank curtis your nevvy had seven hunthred of meand be jasus ill have seven hunthred of you it cant be done said sir christopher doggedly then be the holy pokerr ill shoot ye tomorrow mornin vociferated the gallant officer so name your frind and ill take care that ye shant be afther shirrking this time as ye did when ye had to mate my frind morthaunt really captain oblunderbuss this strange conduct on your partisis stammered the knight scarcely knowing what to say or do while his countenance became elongated to an awful extent sthrangesthrange do ye say exclaimed the captain why yere adding insult to injury man but dont desayve yourselfye wont come the counterfeitcrank over me be jasus im not the boy to be bullied afther this fashion sir christopherr so shell out the eight hunthredor be the lorrd harry eight hundred murmured the miserable knight now cruelly alarmed at the ferocious manner and the progressive attempt at extortion on the part of his visitor eight hunthred is what i lent and eight hunthred is what ill have back said the captain in a determined tone and if yere afther denying your debts of honourr sir christopher ill make such an example of ye as shall let all the worrld know what ye areas soon as ive shot ye dead which ill do in the mornin you surely wouldnt commit such a crimewithoutwithout just provocation urged the knight in a coaxing manner ill not hear another word of palthry excuse sirrah replied the captain starting from his seat and if the money isnt forthcoming in the twinkling of a bedpost ill flay ye first and shoot ye aftherwards oh dearoh dear said the wretched sir christopher what shall i doi wouldnt mind the five hundred that my nephew asks forsince he promises so faithfully to pay me again but eight hundred nine thundered the captain dye mane to tell me as good as that im a liarr and that i cant recollect amountsbe jasus i niver was so insulthed in my lifeand nothing but blood can wash it away blood murmured sir christopher my blood and i the father of a family as i may say so much the more dishonourrable for ye to dispute a just debt and thry to shirrk off in this bastely fashion cried the captain twirling his moustache and eyeing sir christopher in a way which made the latter tremble in every limb i always thought that ye was a man famous for your straightforard dalings but im desayvedgrossly desayvedand ill sind my frind to ye tomorrow mornin before youve had time to break the shell of your first egg at breakfast well captainto oblige you said sir christopher i dont mind if i write a cheque for five hundred pounds but i positively will give no morei wont indeedi cant put down the palthry five hunthred then on the dhraft exclaimed the captain and ill make misther curtis fork me out the rest at his convaynience the miserable sir christopher though feeling that he had been completely bullied into the settlement of the demand made upon him nevertheless stood in such awful dismay of the warlike irishman that he wrote a cheque for the five hundred pounds which said cheque the captain secured about his person exclaiming and now my frind ill look over all the insulting words ye have applied to me this evening but be the powerrs if i hadnt a great respict for ye id make a mummy of ye before ye was twelve hours oulder having thus spoken the captain tossed off the remainder of his whiskeyandwater shook the knight violently by the hand once more and took his departure just as the nurse was coming down to desire that sir christopher would get rid of his guest and send up the keys of the winecellar to her ladyship now strange as it may appear to the readerconsidering all that they know relative to the character of captain oblunderbussit is nevertheless a fact that he never once thought of appropriating to his own use the amount just extorted from the knight he was a man who would not hesitate to get into debt without the least intention of ever paying the samehe moreover thought that he had accomplished a highly meritorious deed in extorting the five hundred pounds from sir christopher but he was honourable after his own fashionthat is to say he would scorn to perpetrate an actual robbery or to betray the trust reposed in him by an accomplice he was in fact one of those curious but not uncommon beings who might be trusted with a thousand pounds to convey to the bank for a friend but who would borrow eighteenpence without the remotest intention of ever repaying it and who thought that the most brilliant act a gentleman could achieve was to chouse a creditor accordingly the clock had scarcely struck eleven and frank curtis was already beginning to get uneasy when the captains thundering knock at the front door in baker street proclaimed his return and in a few moments the young gentleman was made acquainted with the success experienced by his friend and now be the holy pokerr well make a night of it said the captain when the frontdoor having been duly secured the two worthies were once more seated in the diningroom and its myself thatll tell ye stories and sing ye rale irish songs to keep ye awake my boy and a night they did make of it heaven knowsand tremendous inroads were effected upon the supply of gin then in the garrison as the captain now termed the house such lies too as the captain and frank curtis told each other until the latter gentleman began to entertain the pleasing idea that the room was spinning round and that there were four candles on the table instead of two the gallant officer on the other hand carried his liquor like a man who was inaccessible to its inebriating fumes and when curtis fell dead drunk upon the carpet the captain considerately picked him up tossed him over his shoulder as if he was a sack of potatoes and thus transported him to the door of his wifes bedroom at which he deposited the senseless gentleman having intimated in stentorian tones that mrs curtis would do well to rise and look to her husband the captain then went down stairs again finished the bottle last opened and throwing himself on a sofa fell into a sound sleep chapter lxxvi tim the snammer and josh pedler out on business he who delights in wandering amongst the mazes of this mighty city of londonthis wilderness of brick and mortarand who can view with the eye of a philosopher or a moralizer the various phases in which the metropolis is to be considered may find ample food for reflection and much changing interest of scene if he post himself at that point in the borough of southwark called newington butts from this point diverge blackman street the newington road the borough road and horsemonger lane blackman street and the newington road constitute the great thoroughfare between london bridge and the elephant and castle tavern and incalculable are the multitudesinnumerable are the vehicles which pass along the busy wayoh so busy because the love of money and the love of pleasure cause all those comings and goingsthose hurryings hither and thitherthose departures and those returns what a tremendous conflict of interestswhat a wondrous striving to accomplish objects in viewwhat an energywhat an activitywhat an unwearied industry are denoted by a great thoroughfare like this nor less does that bustle speak of recreation and enjoymentparties of pleasure to end in dissipationamusement diversion and holiday too often to be dearly paid for thereafter close by newington butts you behold a portion of the wall of the bench prison with its chevaux de frise denoting rather the criminal prison than a place of confinement for unfortunate persons what a horrible cruelty it is to incarcerate men who are unable to liquidate their liabilitiesas if such immurement would place within their reach the philosophers stone where one dishonest debtor finds his way thither a dozen human beings who are enclosed within that gloomy wall would gladlywillingly acquit themselves of their responsibilities if they had the means and shall the law be so framed that in order to punish one it must cruelly oppress twelve individuals is such a principle consistent with common sense justice or civilisation many and many a heart has been broken within those walls many and many a fine spirit has been crushed down to the very dust and the man who went into that prison with honourable feelings and generous sympathies has gone forth prepared to play the part of a sneaking swindler for a creditor to lock his debtor up in prison is the same as if a master took away the tools from a mechanic and said now do your work as usual the legislature does not understand this it allows an expensive process to take place so that the debtor who cannot originally pay l for instance has his liabilities immediately increased to l then when responding negatively to the demand for this larger sum he is taken away from the avocations by pursuing which he might obtain the means to settle with his creditor and is thrown into prison the routine is precisely thisif a person cannot pay a debt you increase it for him and having increased it you tie his hands so that he shall have no chance of paying it at all merciful heavens is this common sense the system of imprisonment for debt falls trebly hard upon the poor the gentleman though reduced himself has friends who can assist him but the poor are too poor to aid each other then money can purchase bail when a schedule has been filed in the insolvents court but the poor man must languish in prison until his hearing oh the advantages of wealth or wealthy connexions in this mercenary landoh the benefits of being by birth a gentleman it was about ten oclock in the evening when tim the snammer and josh pedler encountered each other by appointment at newington butts and as it was yet too early for the business which they had in hand they repaired to a publichouse hard by where they drank porter smoked pipes and conversed until the clock in the taproom denoted the hour of eleven they then rose paid their score and took their departurebending their way into horsemonger lane tim the snammer now fell a few paces behind his comrade josh pedler who hurried a short distance up the lane and stopped at the door of a house of mean sordid and sombre appearance he knocked at the door which was opened by an old and hideouslooking woman holding in her hand a candle by the light of which she surveyed the visitor in a very suspicions manner i want to speak to a genelman of the name of bones which lives here said josh placing his foot with apparent carelessness in such a way over the threshold that the door might not be shut against his inclination no sich a person dont live here returned the woman gruffly and she was about to close the door when josh again addressed her well said he if he dont pass by that there name he does by anotherand its all the same we aint partickler maam as to names but my business is partickler thoughand ive got an appintment with mr benjamin bonesor old deathor whatever else he calls hisself or is called by others it aint of no use a standing bothering here my good man said the woman cause vyno sich a person lives here i tell youand i dont know sich a person by sich a name at all humbug cried josh and giving a low short whistle he pushed into the house a moment had not elapsed ere tim the snammer was at his heelsthe door was forcibly closedthe candle was wrested from the old womans handand she was threatened with throttling if she attempted to raise an alarm the two men bound her with a cord and carried her into the room opening from the passage they then left her vowing with terrible oaths to return and do for her if she dared make the slightest disturbance there isnt a room on tother side of the passage is there tim demanded josh of his companion who carried the light no and now lets creep up stairs as gentle as if we was mice said the snammer youve got your barkers tim asked pedler yesand a damned good clasp knife too replied the ruffian with a significant leer at his accomplice and speaking in a low whisper i dont think we shall find any one else in the house besides that old woman and ben bones hisself cause muttonface sal is a devilish keen oneand she would have found it out if there was any lodgers well cut up stairs tim said josh pedler and dont let us be astanding here palaveringor the old scamp may overhear us and get out by the back windows or some such a dodge ill go fust if you like noill go fust josh answered the snammer for its me that has got the most spite agin the ancient willain with these words tim splint crept cautiously up the narrow and dirty staircase josh pedler following close behind him the robbers stopped at the door on the first landing and knocked but no answer being returned they broke it open in a few moments by means of a small stout chisel such as housebreakers are in the habit of using whos there cried the deep sepulchral voice of old death as he started from the armchair in which he had been taking a nap its only two of your friends returned tim the snammer and as friends you had better treat us tooor itll be the wuss for you i dont know that i ever treated you in any way but as friends said old death glancing somewhat uneasily from the one to the other as for you timi can guess why youre angry with me but i wasnt at libertyi wasnt my own master i can assure youon that saturday when i promised to get you out of the jug or i should have kept my word but its too long a story to tell you noweven if i was disposed to do so and so the shortest way to make us all right is for me to give you back the money that was placed in my hands by josh pedler and whatll pay me for the two months of quod that i had all through you you cheating old fence demanded tim splint placing his back against the door in a determined manner i couldnt help it timi couldnt help it returned old death with a hideous grin and may bemay be he added with the hesitation habitual to him i can put something in your way that will make up for the past wellthat looks like business at all events observed tim exchanging a rapid glance with his companion for it struck the two robbers at the same moment that they should perhaps act prudently to join old death in any enterprise which he might have in hand and then plunder him afterwardsprovided that the affair he had to propose gave promise of a better booty than that which they stood the immediate chance of obtaining from him old death looked leisurely round the small mean and illfurnished room as much as to say what can you hope to get out of mefor the meaning of the glances which he had observed to pass between the two robbers was perfectly well understood by him is the business you hinted at for tonight demanded josh pedler after a brief pause for tonight replied benjamin bones but sit down my good friends and may be i can find a dram of brandy in the bottle for you thankee well stand old chap said the snammer but we shant refuse the bingo for all that old death regaled his two visitors each with a wine glass full of brandy and then took a similar quantity himself yes he said continuing the discourse it is for tonightand a good thing may be made of it if youre staunch and resolute in fact i wanted to meet with a couple of such active fellows as you are for i have been sadly used latelyin more ways than one well what is it demanded tim the snammer you know that were the lads to do any thing it ought to be done and i dont see the use of wasting time if the business is really for tonight i have had positive information continued old death his dark eyes gleaming snakelike beneath the shaggy brows that overhung them that a gentleman who lives in a lonely house not many miles off this morning received a considerable sum of money at a bankers on a cheque which he get cashed there and in a few days he will pay it all away to his creditorsfor he has been building a great number of houses at norwood and so i think added bones with a horrible chuckle that it would be just as well to anticipate him and can you rely on this information asked tim the snammer comelet us know all the particklers two or three days ago he took into his service a man named john jeffreysa groom who was lately in the household of a certain sir christopher blunt said old death and this person sells his secrets to those who pay him best in plain terms hes in your pay exclaimed josh pedler wellthats all right what next nothing more than that if you like to crack that crib you can do it tonight and ill smash the notes which will be of no use to you till theyre melted into gold answered old death thereby intimating to them first that he should take no active part in the business and secondly that it would not be worth their while to cheat him of his share of the plunder inasmuch as they were totally dependent on him for rendering the hopedfor booty at all available tim the snammer and josh pedler consulted together for a few moments in low whispers but how do we know said the former suddenly turning round upon old death that this isnt all a cursed plant to get us out of the house hereor may be to inveigle us into some infernal trapeh answer us that read john jeffreys note said old death coolly as he produced the letter from the pocket of his capacious old grey surtout coat tim the snammer and josh pedler accordingly read the contents of the paper which ran as follow this cums to tel you sir that master resceved a chek for about twelve undred pouns yesterday from sir enry courtenee a barrownight and that master got it keshed this mornin at the benk wich i no becos i had to go with him in the gigg to the benk and i see him cum out of the benk acountin the notes and i no he will pay it all away in or days to his bilders and arkitecks and carpinters at norwood anny thing you leeve for mee in a broun paper parsel at the ushoul crib will reech mee yure fatheful servant j j satisfactory enow exclaimed tim the snammer with an appealing glance to his comrade who nodded his head approvingly well continued the thief give us the necessary description of the place and well be off at once its fortnit that weve got our tools about us which you have used against my miserable lodging observed old death with a grim smile however i would rather youd have introduced yourselves in that way than not come at all for i should have let this matter he added pointing to jeffreys note which now lay on the table go by without attending to it so its lucky for us all that you did make your appearance and if you serve me well in this case you shall not want employment of my finding illustration good again old tulip said tim the snammer and now tell us where this mr torrings livesor whatever his name isand we will lose no time old death gave the necessary explanation and the two men took their departure having first acquainted their employer with the condition in which they had left the old woman down stairsa piece of information which made him hasten to her rescue footnote the records of the insolvent debtors court prove that the average dividend paid upon the estates of persons who take the benefit of the act is one farthing in the pound chapter lxxvii the father and daughter proceed we now to torrens cottage on the road to which place we have just left tim the snammer and josh pedler it was past eleven oclock and mr torrens was seated alone in his parlour examining a pile of papers which lay before him a decanter more than half emptied of its ruby contents and a wineglass also stood upon the table and the flushed countenance of the unprincipled man showed that he had sought to drown the remorseful feelings of a restless conscience by means of the juice of the grape but he could notand though ten days had now elapsed since the sacrifice of the beautiful rosamond had taken place there were moments when the father felt even more acutely than on the fatal night when in the solitude of his chamber he endured the torments of the damnedmental torments indescribably more severe than the most agonising of physical pain could possibly be he had received the price of his infamy and her dishonour the last portion of the price of blood he had drawn from the bankers in the morningand he was now arranging and casting up his accounts to satisfy himself that he had actually obtained sufficient to settle all his liabilities but his occupation was every moment interrupted by a gush of terrible thoughts to his maddening brainand if he laid down the pen it was to grasp the bottle what would the world say if his black turpitude were to transpirehow should he ever be able to meet clarence villiers and adelais again if they were to become acquainted with rosamonds dishonour he knew that the baronet had hitherto managed somewhat to tranquillise the ruined girl by promises of marriage and eternal affectionhe was also aware that rosamond had endeavoured to subdue her anguish as much as possible in order to avoid the chance of arousing any suspicion on the part of mrs slingsby but a term must at length arrive to those specious representations and mendacious assurances adopted by sir henry courtenay to lull the agonising feelings of the unhappy girland thenoh it was then that the danger would be terrible indeed of all this mr torrens thought and he suffered more acutely from his fears than from his consciousness of infernal iniquity the timepiece upon the mantle had struck the hour of eleven some time and mr torrens was in the midst of his terrible meditations when a loud long and impatient knock at the frontdoor caused him to start from his seat he had already desired the servants not to sit up on his account as it was probable that he should be occupied with his papers until a late hour in the night and he was therefore now compelled to answer the summons himself a cold chill struck to his heartfor he entertained a presentiment of what was about to occur indeed such an anticipation was natural on his part when we reflect that his soul was a prey to conscious guilt and that the knock at the door was hasty and imperative for a moment he staggered as if about to fall then calling all his firmness to his aid he proceeded to open the frontdoor the knocking at which was repeated with increased vehemence his presentiment was correctfor scarcely had he drawn back the bolt when the door was pushed openand rosamond rushed into the house my dearest father she exclaimed and fell insensible into his arms he conveyed her to a sofa in the parlour tore off her bonnet and shawl and sprinkled water upon her paleher very pale countenance merciful heavens how acutehow agonising was the pang which shot to his heart as he contemplated that lovely brow on which innocence had so lately sate enthroned until the spoiler had pressed the heated lips of lust thereon then for a few moment all the fathers feelings were uppermost in his soul and he gnashed his teeth with rage at the thought that he himself was dishonoured in that dishonoured daughter oh to have given her back her purity and her selfrespectto have known that she could raise her head proudly in maiden prideto have been able to embrace her as the chaste and spotless being she was ere hell suggested its accursed machinations to achieve her destruction but it was too latehere lay the ruined childand there were piled the notes and gold which had purchased her virtue three or four minutes elapsed and still rosamond gave no signs of returning animation suddenly the father desisted from his endeavours to restore her for an infernal thought flashed to his mind he would suffer her to die no sooner did the atrocious idea enter his soul than he longed to see it fulfilled he dared not meet her eyeseven should she be unsuspicious relative to his unnatural treachery noit were better that she should die but the infernal hopes of the wicked man were not to be realizedand monster that he was he could not slay her with his own hands slowly at length her bosom began to heavea profound sigh escaped hershe opened her eyes and gazed vacantly around rosamond said her father now mastering his feelings of bitter disappointment so far as to be able to speak in a kind tone rosamond dearestwhat ails you fear notyou are at home but why do you look at me so wildly oh my godwhat have i done that i should have deserved so much misery exclaimed the young girl in a voice of the most piercing anguish as she covered her face with her hands and burst into a flood of tearsthen raising herself to a sitting posture on the sofa she seized her fathers hands saying in a different and more profoundly melancholy tone my parentmy only friend i am unworthy to look you in the face do not speak thus rosamond said mr torrens seating himself by his daughters side and maintaining a demeanour which bespoke the deepest interest in her behalf something has cruelly afflicted you he added interrogativelyas if he had yet the fatal truth to learn oh heavensyour kindness kills me dearest father shrieked rosamond yesnever did you appear so kind to me beforeand iibut merciful saviour my brain is on fire my sweet child returned mr torrens whose soul was a perfect hell as he listened to the words which came from his daughters lipsyou can surely have no secrets from me has any one caused you chagrin has any one dared to insult you and what means this sudden arrival at homeat so late an hourand when i fancied that you were staying with that excellent woman mrs slingsby mrs slingsby repeated rosamond with a shudder which denoted the loathing and abhorrence she entertained for that woman oh my dear father that mrs slingsby is a fiend in human shapea vile and detestable hypocrite who conceals the blackest heart beneath the garb of religion rosamondrosamondyou know not what you are saying exclaimed mr torrens affecting to be profoundly surprised and even hurt at these emphatic accusations alas i know too welloh far too well the truth of all i am saying said rosamond a hectic glow of excitement appearing upon her cheeks hitherto so ashy pale yes fatherthat woman is a disgrace to her sex this eveningbut two hours agoi accidentally heard a few words pass between her and sir henry courtenay sir henry courtenay is at least an honourable man said mr torrens sir henry courtenay is a monster cried rosamond emphatically then bursting into tears again she threw herself at her fathers feet exclaiming oh that i had a mother to whom i could unburthen all the woes that fill my heartbut to youto youmy dearest parenthow can your daughter confess that she has been ruineddishonouredundone unhappy girl cried the hypocrite affecting a tone and manner denoting mingled indignation and astonishment what dreadful things are these that you have come home to tell me the truth my dear fatherthe horrible the fatal truth continued rosamond in a fearfully excited tone speak lowerlower my child said mr torrens the servants will be alarmedthey will overhear you and now resume your seat near merise from that humiliating postureand humiliating indeed interrupted rosamond sinking her voice to a comparative whisper but with an utterance that was almost suffocated by the dreadful emotions raging within her bosombecause i myself am so signally humiliated she added and yet i am innocent dear fatherit was not my faultnot for worlds would i have strayed from the path of virtue but a hideous plota diabolical scheme of treacherydevised between that bad woman and that still more dreadful man no moreno more rosamond exclaimed mr torrens still maintaining a wellaffected semblance of indignation and astonishment i understand you but too welland you shall be avenged alas vengeance will not make me what i once wasa happy and spotless girl said rosamond and now that i am dishonoured it would require but the contumely with which the world would treat me to drive me to utter desperationto madness or to suicide mr torrens said all he could to console his unhappy child and he very readily promised her to abandon all ideas of vengeance on those who had been the authors of her shame until this evening said rosamond her head reclining upon her fathers shoulder i had hoped that sir henry courtenay would repair the wrong he had done me by means of marriagefor alas my dear father i loved him buttwo hours agoi overheard a few words pass between him and mrs slingsbya few words which rivetted me to the spot where i was at first only an involuntary listener then i became a willing and attentive eavesdropperfor oh the little which had already met my ears intimatelytoo intimately regarded myself and dear father you can conceive with what horror and dismay i learnt enough to convince me that she whom i had loved and esteemed as a dear friend and a model of perfection was a vilean abandonedan infamous womanthe mistress of sir henry courtenay and in the way to become a mother also i could not believe my earsi fancied that i was dreaming but alas it was indeed a frightful realityand then i heard that i had been soldyes soldi your daughter sold to sir henry courtenayand i suppose by that dreadful woman yesyesfather she continued wildly i was sold to his armsand he never intended to marry me i screamed noti uttered not a word i was crushed too lowi had too great a load of misery upon my soul to be able to give vent to my feelings but i dragged myself away from the spot where i had overheard that terrible discoursea veil had fallen from before my eyes and i saw all the extent of my hopeless position in its true light how i managed to reach my bedroom i know not my brain began to whirl and i thought that i should go mad of what followed i have but a dim recollection but methinks that having put on my bonnet and shawl i was flying from the house when sir henry courtenay pursued me down the stairsand how i escaped from him i cannot say there was a chaos in my bewildered brain and when i was enabled to collect my scattered thoughtswhen consciousness as i may term it came back i found myself hurrying along the streets i looked round fearful of being pursued but there was no cause for alarm nevertheless i hastened onand all that long distance have i accomplished on foot dear father for oh i felt that home was the place where my deep sorrows would receive sympathy and where only i could hope to enjoy security and now my beloved parent added rosamond throwing her arms around his neck you will not spurn your unhappy daughteryou will not thrust her from you my god why did i ever reveal to you all this oh it was because my heart was so full of woe that if i had not unburthened it to you in the hope of receiving consolation it would have brokenit would have broken rosamond said mr torrens you did well to reveal all these dreadful things to me because i alone am the proper person to counsel and console you a fearful crime he continued shuddering at his own monstrous duplicity has been perpetrated but alas the criminals must go unpunished yesrosamond you were right when you declared that vengeance would lead only to exposure and that exposure would kill you my poor child not even your sister must be made acquainted with this awful calamity nono exclaimed rosamond it is sufficient that you are aware of the ignominious treatment which i have received not for worlds would i have the bridal happiness of my dearest sister poisoned by the revelation of my wrongs and clarence tooclarenceoh from him of all men must this secret be kept or he would perhaps be urged to wreak on his aunt and on that vile baronet a vengeance which would lead to exposure and render adelais miserable for ever it charms me rosamond said mr torrens to perceive that the wrongs heaped upon you have not impaired your prudence between you and me shall this secret now remainfor depend upon it the authors of this cruel outrage will not themselves be anxious to publish their own infamy you are now beneath the paternal roofand here you are certain to enjoy security and from this night forth rosamond let us place a seal on our lips so far as the one dread topic is concerned and you my father asked the ruined girlshall you not love me the less shall you not look with loathing and abhorrence upon your daughter oh if there be a change in your sentiments towards me i shall have no alternative save to die the miserable and criminal father embraced his dishonoured child and said every thing he could to console her rosamond then retired to her chamberthat chamber which she had left ten days previously a pure and spotless virgin and to which she now returned a deflowered and ruined girl mr torrens remained in the parlour amidst all the horrible thoughts that forced themselves upon his mind he saw one glimmering of consolation and this was that rosamond suspected not his complicity in the nefarious plot which had destroyed her it was evident that in the conversation which she had overheard between mrs slingsby and the baronet his connivance had only been hinted attoo darkly and mysteriously for rosamond to comprehend the meaning of those words which alluded to the fact of her having been sold but what pen can describe the tortures which the guilty man experienced as he pondered on the scene that had just occurred in spite of that gleam of solace he was the prey to ineffable anguishfor he could not help feeling as a father nature asserted her empireand he was in despair as he contemplated the awful crime which had led to the dishonour of his own child never had she appeared to him so beautiful as when ashy pale she had awakened from the deep trance into which she fell on crossing the parental thresholdnever did he feel more inclined to love her or to be proud of her charms than when he afterwards saw her kneeling at his feet the light of the lamp falling with rembrandt effect upon her upraised countenance alas through him was she ruinedby his machinations was she destroyed and of what avail was that beauty now since honour was lost he fixed his eyes upon the gold and endeavoured to console himself with the contemplation of the glittering metal it seemed drossvile dross in his eyes and could he have recalled the deeds of the last ten days he would gladly have fallen back into the inextricable labyrinth of his pecuniary difficulties and have dared even the disgrace and punishment of a debtors prison so that he might not have had to reproach himself with the sale of his daughters virtue chapter lxxviii retribution it was long past midnightand mr torrens was still pacing the parlour with uneven steps when a low double knock at the frontdoor aroused him from his painful meditations wondering who could visit the cottage at that late hour he hastened to reply to the summons and to his surprise the lustre of the parlourlamp which he carried in his hand streamed full upon the pale and agitated countenance of sir henry courtenay making a sign to the baronet not to speak mr torrens led the way into the parlour and the visitor in the excitement of the feelings which had brought him to the cottage neglected to shut the frontdoor close as he entered but merely pushed it back in such a way that the bolt of the lock did not catch this little incident was unperceived by the two gentlemen when they were both in the parlour mr torrens shut the roomdoor and said in a low whisper she has come home thank god she is safe then observed the baronet also in a subdued voice the fact is mrs slingsby and myself were so dreadfully frightened that she might either make away with herself or else adopt some measure that would lead to a certain exposure that we have both been hunting for her through all the streets at the west end and at last i determined late as it was to come over and acquaint you with her flight but it never struck me that i should hear of her return home she is unaware of my sad complicity in the dreadful business replied mr torrens sternly but pray repeat to me the whole conversation which took place between mrs slingsby and yourself and which she unfortunately overheard i shall then be enabled to judge whether reflection on that discourse may lead her to imagine that her own father was indeed a party to her ruin for i must confess that i have terrible fears lest she should indeed imbibe such a suspicion give me a tumbler of wine torrens said the baronet throwing himself upon the sofa which had so lately been pressed by his victim when in a state of insensibility i am regularly exhausted for i have walked all the way hitherand when i have a little recovered myself i will detail all the conversation which took place between me and mrs slingsby as nearly as i shall be able to recollect it mr torrens produced a bottle of wine from the sideboard he having already emptied the decanter upon the table help yourself sir henry he said and in the meantime i will steal cautiously up stairs and see if rosamond be yet retired to restfor i would not for worlds have her come down and find you here a wise precaution observed the baronet mr torrens accordingly quitted the parlour and hastened up stairs he stopped at the door of his daughters chamber and listened profound sobs and impassioned ejaculations indicative of terrible grief met his ears and he grew alarmed lest she should feel herself so thoroughly wretched and lonely as to be unable to sleep and perhaps return to the parlour he accordingly knocked gently at the door and rosamond speedily opened it she had not as yet divested herself of a particle of her clothing nor made any preparation to retire to rest and her countenance was so truly woebegoneso thoroughly the picture of a deeplyseated grief that even her ironhearted father was affected to tears she threw her arms around his neck and thanked him for his kind solicitude he remained with her nearly halfanhour exerting all his power of language to console her and the anxiety which he experienced to induce her to seek her couch so that he might return to the parlour and get rid of sir henry courtenay as soon as possible rendered him so eloquent and so effective in the to him novel art of administering solace that he succeeded fully now i am convinced that you do not loathe despise and hate your daughter said rosamond at length and this impression has removed an immense weight from my mind though true happiness may never more be mine yet shall i find a substitute in christian resignation to my fate and henceforth dear father i will not make you unhappy by compelling you to act the part of a comforter and now good night my only friendmy beloved parent and fear not that i shall give way again to that violent outpouring of grief in which you so kindly interrupted me mr torrens embraced his daughter and a pang shot to his heart as he thought of his infernal conduct towards that good and affectionate girl as he descended the stairs he heard her lock her chamberdoor and he was just congratulating himself upon the success of his attempt to console her when the murmuring sounds of voices apparently coming from the front parlour caused him to redouble his pace thitherfor the idea flashed to his mind that mrs slingsby might also have visited the cottage in her alarm concerning rosamond and that the baronet had probably afforded her admission while he was up stairs with his daughter tim the snammer and josh pedler bent on their predatory intent and hoping to reap a good harvest at the house of mr torrens approached that dwelling nearly half an hour after sir henry courtenay had entered it perceiving a light gleaming from the divisions in the parlourshutters they crept cautiously up to the window and through those crevices beheld the glittering gold piled upon the table and a person lying upon the sofa apparently in a profound sleep the fact was that the baronet was completely exhausted with his long walk from old burlington street to the cottage and having tossed off a tumbler of wine he lay down on the sofa to await mr torrens return but we have seen that the father had found his daughter in such a state of profound affliction as to be totally unable to leave her for nearly half an hour and during that interval an irresistible drowsiness stole over sir henry courtenayspeedily wrapping him in a deep slumber tim the snammer and josh pedler were determined to risk the crack in spite of the sleeper whom they descried upon the sofa and whom they believed to be mr torrens for neither was this gentleman nor the baronet known to them by sight with their housebreaking implements they were on the point of making an attempt on the frontdoor when it yielded to their touch and swung noiselessly open at this they were not at all surprised for it immediately struck them that john jeffreys had expected the visit that night and had left the door ajar on purpose they stole into the house and succeeded in entering the parlour without arousing the baronet tim the snammer instantly drew forth his claspknife and bending over sir henry courtenay held the murderous weapon close to his throat while josh pedler hastily secured the notes and gold about his person we may as well have the plate if there is any whispered this individual to his companion in fact well have a regular ransack of the place and if he awakes ill cut his infernal throat in a jiffey added tim the snammer josh grinned an approval of this summary mode of proceeding and opened one of the sideboard drawers but the noise which a sugarbasin or some such article made inside the drawer by falling over with the sudden jerk aroused the sleeper sir henry courtenay startedopened his eyesbeheld a strange countenance hanging over himand was about to utter a cry of alarm when the terrible claspknife was drawn rapidly and violently across his throat there was a dull gurgling noisea convulsive quivering of the entire framebut not a groanmuch less an exclamation of terrorand sir henry courtenay was no more come along tim said josh pedler whose face was ghastly pale weve done enough for tonight yeslet us be off returned the murderer now shuddering at the dreadful deed which he had just perpetrated and they were issuing from the room when the noise of footsteps on the stairs made them redouble their speed to gain the frontdoor it was mr torrens who had thus alarmed them but they escaped without molestationfor when that gentleman reached the hall and beheld two men rushing towards the frontdoor he was himself seized with such profound terrorpainfully strung as his feelings had been that nightthat he was for a few moments stupified and rivetted to the spot but when he saw the frontdoor close behind the strangers he took couragehastily secured it withinand then hurried to the parlour in agony of fear lest his gold and notes should have become the prey of plunderers one glance at the table was sufficientthe money was gone mr torrens dashed his open palm against his forehead with frantic violence and was about to utter a cry of rage and despair when the remembrance of his unhappy daughter sealed his lips at the same instant he looked towards the sofabut holy god what a spectacle met his view for there lay the baronet with his head nearly severed from his bodymurderedbarbarously murdered upon the very sofa where his victim had so lately reposed in trancelike insensibility on that sofa slept he his last sleep and even in that appalling moment when mr torrens recoiled shuddering and shocked from the dreadful sight it struck him that there was something of retributive justice not only in the loss of his own treasure but also in the death of sir henry courtenay the frightened man uttered not a murmur as that spectacle encountered his eyes his amazement was of so stupifying a nature that it sealed his lipsparalysed his powers of utterance with staring orbs he gazed on the grisly corpse from which he recoiled staggeringly and several minutes elapsed ere he could so far command his presence of mind as even to become aware of his own dreadful predicament but as the truth dawned upon him he was seized with indescribable alarmswith horrible apprehensions the double crime of robbery and murder had been perpetrated so speedily and so noiselessly that not a soul in the house was alarmed by any unusual soundand mr torrens felt the sickening conviction that it would be a difficult thing to persuade a jury that he himself was innocent suspicion must inevitably attach itself to himcircumstantial evidence would be strong against him in a word the appalling truth broke in upon him that he would be accused of the assassination of sir henry courtenay mr torrens sate down and burying his face in his hands fell into a profound but most painful meditation should he raise an alarmarouse jeffreys and the femaleservant as well as his daughterand proclaim all he knew about the horrible transaction nosomething whispered in his ear that he would not be believed rosamond not knowing that he was the baronets accomplice in achieving her dishonour would naturally conceive that the murder was the result of paternal vengeance it was then impossible to suffer the occurrence to transpire but what was he to do with the bodyhow dispose of it terrible dilemma all the atrocity of his crime towards his daughter now returned with a tremendously augmenting intensity to his mind his punishment on earth had already begunhe was doomedaccursed wretched man gold was thy destroyer ah goldbut thou hast lost thy goldand in a few days the creditors who yet remain unpaid will be upon thee but whatdoes such an idea actually strike himurging him to plunder the murdered victim of any coin which there may be about the corpse yesand now behold the father who sold the honour of his child about to examine the pockets of that childs assassinated ravisher the purse contains some fifteen or sixteen sovereigns and these mr torrens selfappropriates the pocketbook of the deceased is next scrutinized but there are no banknotesnothing save papers and memoranda totally valueless mr torrens stamps his foot with ragehis predicament is truly awful ruin still menaces him on one side in respect to his affairsfor having reckoned on the money to be produced by the sale of his daughters virtue he had contracted fresh liabilities within the last ten days and on the other side is the terrible danger in which the presence of that corpse may involve him add to these sources of agonising feelings the conviction that the sacrifice of rosamond will after all have proved ineffectual in respect to the complete settlement of his affairs even should he succeed in burying the more serious eventnamely the murderin impenetrable mysteryand the wretched state of mind in which mr torrens was now plunged may be conceived he rose from the chair on which he had a second time flung himself after plundering the corpse and approached the timepiece it was halfpast one oclock but as mr torrens glanced at the dial which thus told him how short an interval remained for him to take some decisive step if he really intended to dispose of the corpse before the servants should be stirring he caught a glimpse of his countenance in the mirror over the mantel he recoiledhe shrank back with horror was it indeed his own countenance that he saw or was it that of some unquiet ghost wandering near the spot where its mortal tenement had been cruelly murdered he turned round suddenly to avoid farther contemplation of that ghastly visageand again he recoiled from an object of terrorstaggeredand would have fallen had he not caught the back of a chair for support for in the half open door way he beheld a human face which was withdrawn the moment his eyes encountered it driven to desperation and reckless now of what might happen to him the maddened man rushed into the hall in time to observe a figure turn the angle of the staircase in another moment he had caught that figure by the arm and dragging the person forcibly down beheld his new manservant john jeffreys by the light of the lamp streaming from the open parlourdoor totally forgetful at the instant of the presence of the corpse in the roomso terribly excited and bewildered was hemr torrens dragged jeffreys into the parlour to demand the reason why he was up and dressed at that hour of the nightor rather morningand it was not until he saw the man himself turn ghastly pale as his eyes encountered the hideous spectacle on the sofa that mr torrens remembered the frightful oversight which he had committed then hastening to close the roomdoor which he locked also mr torrens said why are you up and wherefore were you prying about the house the fact was that jeffreys had expected a visit from some of old deaths gang that night and had never retired to bed at all he heard the two doubleknocks at the doorthe first being that given by rosamond and the other by the baronetand when the robbers had quitted the house closing the frontdoor after them jeffreys thought it must be the last visitor whoever he might be going away after that the house had remained quiet for some little time and jeffreys fancied that mr torrens had retired to bed he had accordingly stolen down from his bedroom to unfasten a window shutter and thus render the ingress of the expected robbers an easy matter but perceiving a light in the parlour he began to suspect that they must be already there accordingly he crept cautiously up to the door and was for a moment stupified when he obtained a glimpse of the reflection of his masters ghastly countenance in the mirror a view of which he could command from the hall why are you up and wherefore were you prying about the house demanded mr torrens the truth is sir i heard a noise just now and i was afeard that thieves was breaking in was the ready reply so i got up and dressed but sir and he glanced significantly towards the dead body jeffreys said mr torrens in a hurried and excited tone a dreadful event has occurred tonight this gentleman came to call upon me lateon very particular businessi left him here while i went up stairs to speak to my daughter who has returned homeand on coming down stairs again i saw two men escaping from the house when i entered the parlour a considerable sum of money which i had left on the table was goneand my poor friend was as you now see him the manservant believed the tale but he affected not to do sofor he was villain enough to rejoice at such an opportunity of getting his master completely in his power you smile incredulously john said mr torrens and yet i take heaven to witness its orkard sirvery orkard observed jeffreys and may be itll lead to scragging if the stiffun isnt put away mr torrens shuddered from head to foot what do you mean to do sir asked jeffreys i am quite ready to assist you but its getting on for two oclock yes i know it interrupted mr torrens i am madi am driven to desperation what would you advise but will you be faithful will you keep the secret i can reward you well talk of that another time sir said jeffreys for the present lets think of making away with the stiffun we must bury it stay here a moment sir while i go and get the stable lanthorn and a sack or rather observed mr torrens i will fetch some water to wash the carpet fortunately the blood has not trickled upon the sofa noiselessly the two crept away from the parlourone to the stables the other to the kitchen in a few minutes they met again by the side of the corpse which they thrust into the sack and between them the load was conveyed to the stable you go and clean the carpet sir said john jeffreys whose superior presence of mind served to invest him with authority to direct the proceedings while i dig a hole in the garden mr torrens hastened to obey the suggestion of his servant and returned to the parlour where he cleansed the carpet as well as he could he then took a bottle of portwine from the sideboard and broke it over the very spot where the blood had dripped down leaving the fractured glass strewed about and drawing the table near the sofa so as to produce the appearance of the bottle having been accidentally knocked off it nearly half an hour was consumed in this occupation and mr torrens whose mind was already much relieved hastened back to the garden where jeffreys was busily engaged in digging a grave for the murdered baronet when the servant was tired his master took a turn with the spade and as the soil was not particularly hard an hour saw the completion of the labour the corpse was thrown into the hole and the earth was shovelled over iteach layer being well stamped down by the feet when the task was accomplished mr torrens and jeffreys reentered the house and ere they separated to retire to their respective rooms the former said in a low whisper once more i conjure you to maintain this secret inviolable and i will find means to reward you well for the present take this and he slipped ten sovereignsa portion of the murdered baronets moneyinto the hands of jeffreys dont be afeard that im leaky sir responded the man clutching the gold and consigning it to his pocket where he had already stowed away the baronets handsome repeater and gold ringsto which valuables he had helped himself while his master was busily engaged in cleansing the carpet in the parlourfor mr torrens had merely plundered the corpse of the contents of the purse and had not touched the jewellery through fear that it might lead to the detection of the murder if seen in his possession master and man now separatedthe former to seek a sleepless couch and the latter to dream of the good fortune which that nights adventure had brought him and in his unconsecrated gravea victim to the assassins knifeslept the once gay dissipated and unprincipled sir henry courtenay chapter lxxix the earl of ellingham and lady hatfield again it was about two oclock on the day following the incidents just related that we shall find the earl of ellingham seated with lady georgiana hatfield in the drawingroom at the residence of the latter arthur had returned on the preceding evening from france accompanied by mr de medina and esther after having seen tom rain tamar and jacob smith embark at havredegrace for the united states rainford and tamar were united in the bonds of matrimony in paris and mr de medina had insisted upon placing in the hands of his soninlaw a sum of ten thousand pounds as a proof of his perfectly cordial feeling towards him and of his determination also fully to recognise tamar as his daughter again the earl communicated all these incidents to lady hatfield who listened to them with the greatest interest i propose to introduce the medinas to you shortly georgiana said the young nobleman you will find the father a person of very gentlemanly manners well read and particularly agreeable in conversation while his daughter miss esther is as amiable and accomplished as the child of such a man should be arthur replied lady hatfieldfor they now addressed each other in the same friendly or rather familiar manner when alone together as if they were brother and sisteri would rather not form the acquaintance of your friends for the present the earl appeared surprised and vexed georgiana he exclaimed in a tone of gentle remonstrance is it possible that you entertain any of those ridiculous prejudices which only very ignorant or very narrowminded persons can possibly entertain towards a most estimable race oh nono cried lady hatfield emphatically i have read much concerning the jews and i feel convinced that they are most unjustly treated by christians heaven knows arthur that i have no bad prejudices of that nature and were i imbued with them i would never rest till i had stifled such evidences of an illiberal and narrowed mind i am delighted to hear you thus express yourself said the earl during my sojourn in france with the medina family i have obtained a great insight into the jewish character and i am convinced that it is fully as benevolent as generous and as liberal as that of the christian but we were speaking of my proposed presentation of mr de medina and his daughter esther to you from all that i have said to them concerning you they are most anxious to form your acquaintance and you have yet to explain to me the meaning of your observation that you would rather postpone the introduction to justify myself returned georgiana blushing against your suspicion that i entertain illiberal prejudices arthur i will frankly state my motives for expressing that wish indeed i know not why any consideration should induce me to retain those motives a secretespecially as the explanation of them will afford me an opportunity to give you my advice for have we not agreed to be unto each other as brother and sisterand in what can a sister more conscientiously advise her brother than in matters regarding his happiness my happiness exclaimed the earl starting slightly and evincing some degree of astonishment at lady hatfields remark yes arthuryour happiness repeated georgiana with difficulty suppressing a sigh now listen to me attentively i have heard that miss esther de medina is eminently beautifulexcessively accomplishedvery amiableand endowed with every qualification to render her worthy of becoming even a monarchs bride georgiana cried the earl of ellingham his heart fluttering with mingled suspense surprise and joy yes observed lady hatfield and since you have learnt she added more slowly and in a softly plaintive tonethough she endeavoured to subdue the emotion which so modulated her voicesince you have learnt that our union is impossible arthursince you have ceased to look upon me otherwise than as a sisterit is probablenay it is both natural and certain that you cannot have beheld esther de medina with indifference georgiana exclaimed arthur in a solemn tone i never can forget that my first love was devoted to you andalthough circumstances have alas prevented our unionyet i should be unwilling to promise to another that heart which i so freelyso gladly gave to you it is alike unjust and ridiculous for me to suppose that as i cannot become your wife arthur you may never marry no continued lady hatfield i should despise myself were i to entertain such abhorrent selfishness my ardent desire is to know that you are happy and esther de medina is well qualified to ensure your felicity nayinterrupt me not remember it is now a sister who counsels a brother granting even that you could never love another as you have loved meand this is a supposition which i have not vanity enough to entertain for a momentbut even granting it for arguments sake you may yet treat a beautiful and affectionate wife with that tendernessthose delicate attentionsand that cherishing kindness which will make her happy oh believe me such a state of bliss would soon beget love in your hearta love for esther as ardent and sincere as that with which you honoured me for it is the mere idle theory of romancewriters that the same heart cannot love twice nature herself proclaims the falsehood of the doctrine and the experience of all wise legislators whether secular or ecclesiastic declares the same by the mere fact of allowing second marriages believe me arthur i am speaking solely in regard to your happiness and the day shall come when your lips breathe the words georgiana i thank thee for the counsel thou gavest me the earl surveyed with respectful admiration that noblehearted woman who thus stifled her own feelings through generous solicitude for his felicity and now she resumed after a moments pause you can divine the reasons which induced me to express a wish that my introduction to the medinas should be postponed for the present i am but a weak womanand though i can proudly say that no petty feeling of jealousy would ever enter my heartyet i would rather not awaken in my mind painful recollections of what might have been by beholding you in the society of one to whom you would be engaged moreover as miss de medina has doubtless heard that our union was once resolved upon added lady hatfield now unable to suppress a profound sigh it would not be agreeable for her to visit me if she accept you as her husband until after your marriage those are my motives arthur and now you will admit that so far from entertaining any illiberal prejudices against the jews i have proved the very contrary by earnestly recommending you to espouse an amiable and beautiful lady belonging to that nation illustration dearest sisterfor such indeed you are to me said the earl of ellingham i appreciate all the excellence of your intentions in thus advising me and i will frankly admit to you that did i now think of uniting my fate with any woman esther de medina would be the object of my choice since my alliance with yourself has been rendered impossible but i am not quite prepared to take that stepnor do i even know whether miss de medina would accept my suit were i to proffer it if her affections were not engaged before she saw youbefore she knew so much of you exclaimed georgiana she loves you now oh of this i am convinced she continued enthusiastically consider how much you have done to render her grateful to you and gratitude in woman is the parent of affection you have saved her beloved sister tamar from the depths of despair by adopting those wondrous schemes by which he who is now her husband was snatched from the jaws of deathyou reconciled a father to a long discarded daughterand you have at length seen that daughter made a wifethe wife of the man she adores oh arthur think you not that esther ponders on all this yesand in the gratitude of her generous soul she already sees a godlike being in the earl of ellingham you will render me quite vain georgiana said the young nobleman for you are magnifying into glorious achievements a few very commonplace acts on my part i am giving you your due for all that is great and noble in your dispositionall that is excellent and estimable in your character replied lady hatfield in a tone of fervent sincerity and that you are every thing i describe is so much the more to your credit inasmuch as you belong to a class not famous for good qualities the aristocratic sphere is characterised by intense selfishnessby a love of illegitimate powerby an abhorrence of the inferior gradesand by a hollowness of heart which brings shame and reproach upon their hierarchy when then we find this corrupted and vicious sphere possessing a glorious exception such as yourself the world should be the more ready to recognise your merits but i will say no more on this head my dear arthur added georgiana with a smile for fear that you should think i wish to coax you into following that counsel which i ere now so seriously and so conscientiously gave you and on that advice will i reflect deliberately replied the earl who could not conceal from himself that he was rejoiced it had been given and now georgiana i must take my leave of you for the present he added rising from his seat for i have a commission of a somewhat important nature to execute for my halfbrother indeed the mention thereof reminds me that i have never made you acquainted with one of the best traits in his character but does it annoy youdoes it vex you to hear me speak of him nono answered georgiana somewhat hurriedly since i have known that he is your brother i have been pleased to hear you say as much good of him as possible and this incident to which i allude continued the earl is not the least praiseworthy of the many fine deeds which must be placed to his account on the bright side it appears that about three months ago he adopted a little boy under very peculiar circumstances a poor woman died suddenly through want and exposure to the inclemency of the weather at an obscure house in seven dials rainford happened to be there at the time and he took compassion on the little boy whom this poor woman had in charge the boy was not the womans childas a certain letter found upon the person of the female proved this letter was at first detained by those miserable wretches who so persecuted my poor brother but it subsequently fell into his hands and he entrusted it to a mr clarence villiers in order that this gentleman might institute inquiries relative to its contents i am now about to seek mr villiers and obtain the letter from him because it appears from all i have heard that it is indubitably addressed to some lady of title although no name be mentioned in it in fact the poor womanwhose name was sarah watts sarah watts repeated lady hatfield with an hysterical scream a deadly pallor overspreading her beautiful countenance that is the namebut my god you are illand the earl rushed forward to catch georgiana in his arms as she was falling from her chair he conveyed her to the sofa but for some moments she seemed insensible he was about to summon her female attendants when she opened her eyes glanced wildly around her and then said in an excited tone do not ring for any onei shall be better in a minuteremain with me arthuri have now much to tell you surprised and grieved at the effect which his words had produced on lady hatfieldyet unable to comprehend wherefore the mere mention of a name should have so seriously touched her feelingsthe earl gazed upon her with interest and curiosity at length a faint tinge of red appeared upon her cheeks and with reviving strength she sate up on the sofa motioning the young nobleman to take a chair near her arthur she said i ought not to have kept that one secret from youfor are we not now brother and sister but alas youwith your generous heart and fine feelingscan well understand how painful it is for me to speak of my own dishonourand the more so since that degradationthat deep disgrace was caused by him who is nearly allied to you what can it be possible exclaimed the earl a sudden light breaking in upon him that childthat boy whom rainford has adopted as his own is mine said georgiana in a voice of despairand covering her face with her hands she burst into an agony of tears the earl of ellingham started from his seat and began to pace the room in a manner denoting the most painful excitement he was indeed deeply afflicted how wrongedhow profoundly wronged had georgiana beenand by him who as she herself had said was so nearly allied to him oh tom raintom rain that was the darkest episode in thy life thus thought the earl likewiseand bitter was his sorrow at the revival of such appalling reminiscences as those which now rent lady hatfields heart with anguish and called forth the floods of grief from her eyes arthur at length she said exercising a violent effort to subdue her sorrow give not way to bitter reflection on my account for your sake all has been forgiventhough it may never be forgotten for memory is immortal but that childthat boy of whom you speakhe is indeed with his own father and providence doubtless willed that it should be so she paused and stifled the sobs which rent her bosom you may think me a cruel and heartless mother arthur she resumed at length now speaking in a mournful plaintive tone thus to have abandoned my offspring but reflect ere you blame me i was as it were alone in a house situated in a retired part of the countrya man entered at nighthe found his way to my chamberhe took advantage of my lonelinesso god how have i survived that disgracethat infamy desperate was my resistancebut vain and the ravisher as you already know was rainford alas pardon me if i then mentioned his name with bitterness but human patience could not speak it calmly when such a cloud of crushing reminiscences come back to the soul again she paused the earl remained silent what could he say he loathedhe abhorred the conduct of his halfbrother whom he would not attempt to justifyand his good sense told him that it were worse than mockery to aim at consoling the victim of that foul night of maddened lust and atrocious rape some weeks afterwards continued lady hatfield in a voice scarcely audible and deeply plaintive i found that i was in a way to become a mother you may conceivebut no it is impossible to imagine the state of mind into which this appalling conviction threw me and yet i was compelled to veil my grief as much as possiblefor at that time a suspicion of my condition on the part of the world would have driven me to suicide i need noti could not enter into the details of the plan which i had adopted to conceal my dishonour suffice it to say that i succeeded in so doingand in a small retired village and under a feigned name did i give birth to a son to sarah watts was the babe confidedand for a sum of money paid down at once she agreed to adopt it as her own by an accident she discovered who i wasmy name was on an article of jewellery which i had with me but she promised the strictest secrecy and i put faith in her words oh do not blame me if i acted as i have now describedif i abandoned that child whose presence near me would only have been a proof of my dishonour and a constant memorial of the dread outrage which no levityno encouragementno fault on my part had provoked blame you georgiana exclaimed the earl approaching and taking her hand kindlyhow could i blame you you acted as prudence dictatedand indeed as circumstances inevitably compelled you butnow that the parentage of this child is at length discoveredhow do you wish me to act remember georgiana every thing in this respect shall be managed solely with regard to your wishessolely according to your directions shall i communicate in a letter to my halfbrother the secret which has thus strangely transpired this dayor shall i leave him in ignorance of the fact that he has adopted his own son he knew not that the outrage he perpetrated led to that consequence said lady hatfield now cruelly bewildered and uncertain how to decide nohe could not even suspect itfor i never met him again until that night on the hounslow roadand even then i recognised him notand it was only at the policeoffice in bow street that i again beheld him who had been my ruin i am convinced observed the earl that rainford has not the least suspicion that you indeed became a mother and oh when i touched upon the subject of his atrocious behaviour towards youwhile we were in parishad you seen the tears of contritionheartfelt contrition which he shedbut no added the earl suddenly interrupting himselfit were impossible that you could forgive him i forgive him for your sake arthur said georgiana in a mild but firm tone and now relative to that childyeshe shall know that he is with his father and your brother must be informed that he has adopted his own son providence indeed seems to have so willed it for we cannot believe that accident alone threw the child thus wondrously into the way of the author of its being arthur she added taking the young noblemans handyou will write to rainfordand you will tell him all it is not necessary to enjoin him to treat the child with kindnessfor you say that his disposition is naturally generous neverthelessi should wish continued the lady looking down as she uttered these words and sinking her voice almost to a whisperfor maternal feelings were stirring within her bosomnevertheless i should wish that you impress upon the mind of your halfbrother the necessity of bringing that child up in the paths of virtue and honour your wishes shall be complied with answered the earl but fear not that rainford would inculcate evil principles into the mind of his son nohe is thoroughly changed and will become a good and i hope a happy and prosperous man the young nobleman then took leave of lady hatfield whom he left a prey to emotions of a very painful nature for deeply and tenderly did she love arthur and great violence did she to her feelings when she so generously and conscientiously counselled him to take the beautiful jewess as his wife and as the earl returned home to his mansion in pall mall to pen a letter to rainford who was then on his voyage under an assumed name and accompanied by tamar jacob smith and little charley to the united stateshe reviewed all the details of that long and interesting conversation which had that afternoon passed between lady hatfield and himselfand he found that the tendency thereof was to make him ponder more seriously and more intently upon the image of the charming esther than he ever yet had done footnote we have been much gratified by observing that our attempt to vindicate the jews against most of the unjust charges which it seems to be a traditionary fashion to level against them has not passed unnoticed all the jewish papers have quoted the exculpatory passage at page of this series of the mysteries of london many provincial journals have also transferred it to their columns and in no of chamberss edinburgh journal new series it was printed with the following record of approval on the part of the editors of that wellconducted periodicalwe cordially agree in this manly defence of a cruelly misrepresented people in this enlightened age it is really horrible to think that the most abominable prejudices should prevail amongst christians against the jews england boasts her high state of civilisation and yet the jews labour under innumerable disabilities which have been abolished in france after all the french understand what civilisation really is much better than the english the idea of a jew sitting in the house of commons would send all the church party raving mad but in france there are many jews in the chamber of deputies the learned selden said very justly talk what you will of the jews that they are cursed they thrive whereer they come they are able to oblige the prince of their country and others too by lending him money none of them beg they keep together and for their being hated my life for yours christians hate one another as much the worst feature in the malignant persecution and misrepresentation of the jews is that the evil prejudice against them has been and still is fostered by christian divines and theological writers a spanish theologian has placed on record the following infamous specimen of malignity the tribe of judah treacherously delivered up our lord and thirty of them die by treason every year the tribe of reuben seized our lord in the garden and therefore the curse of barrenness is on all they sow or plant and no green thing can flourish over their graves the tribe of gad put on the crown of thorns and on every th of march their bodies are covered with blood from deep and painful wounds those of asher buffeted jesus and their right hand is always nearly a palm shorter than the left those of napthali jested with christ about a herd of swine since when they are all born with tusks like wild boars the tribe of manasseh cried out his blood be on us and on our children and at every new moon they are tormented by bloody sores the tribe of simeon nailed our lord to the cross and on the th of march four deep and dreadful wounds are inflicted on their hands and feet those of levi spat on the saviour and the wind always blows back their saliva in their faces so that they are habitually covered with filth the tribe of issachar scourged christ and on the th of march blood streams forth from their shoulders the tribe of zebulon cast lots for the garments and on the same day the roof of their mouth is tortured by deep wounds the tribe of joseph made the nails for crucifying jesus and blunted them to increase his sufferings and therefore their hands and feet are covered with gashes and blood those of benjamin gave vinegar to jesus they all squint and are palsied and have their mouths filled with little nauseous worms which in truth adds our author is the case with all jewish women after the age of because it was a woman who entreated the tribe of joseph not to sharpen the nails used for the crucifixion of our lord that wretchedly prejudiced and unprincipled writer justin martyr wrote as follows while apostrophising the jews god promised that you should be as the sand on the sea shore and so you are indeed in more senses than one you are as numerous and you are as barren and incapable of producing any thing good chapter lxxx mrs slingsby and mr torrens while the scene related in the preceding chapter was taking place at the residence of lady hatfield in piccadilly incidents requiring mention occurred elsewhere mrs slingsby was seated in her drawingroom a prey to the most frightful alarms sir henry courtenay had left her the evening before to acquaint mr torrens with rosamonds flight and consult with him relative to the necessary steps to be taken to prevent the exposure which himself and mrs slingsby so much dreaded on thus parting with her the baronet had faithfully promised to call early in the morning and inform her of the particulars of his interview with mr torrensbut it was now past one oclock in the afternoon and he had not made his appearance what could his absence meanhad any thing disagreeable occurredwas it possible that rosamond could have made away with herself and that sir henry had taken to flight through dread of an exposure and its consequences the suspense which mrs slingsby endured was horriblehorrible guilty consciences invariably magnify into giants even the most dwarflike causes of apprehension and there was no exception to this rule on the present occasion a hundred times had she glanced at the elegant ormolu clock on the manteland as hour after hour passed and he came not her restlessness increased to such a degree that it at length reached a state of nervous excitement no longer endurable she accordingly hurried to her chamber dressed herself in her walkingattire and having left word with her servants that in case sir henry courtenay should call he was to be requested to wait until her return sped to the nearest hackneycoach stand where stepping into a vehicle she ordered the driver to take her over to torrens cottage yesthither she was determined to proceed without delay even at the risk of encountering rosamond though she could scarcely believe that the wronged girl had returned home for not precisely remembering all the details of the conversation which took place between herself and the baronet and which rosamond had overheard the guilty woman imagined that something more than mere allusions might have been made to the connivance of mr torrens in the ruin of his daughter and hence mrs slingsbys very natural supposition that the victim of the infernal plot had not returned to the parental dwelling the coach did not proceed with particular celerity and the distance from the west end to torrens cottage was greatmrs slingsby had therefore ample leisure to continue her harrowing meditations upon the real or supposed dangers which menaced her in sooth her position was by no means an enviable oneunless indeed a convict under sentence of death might have preferred her state to that of imminent and ignominious death for circumstances appeared suddenly to combine against her she was in the familywayand this was alone sufficient to cause her the most serious chagrin especially as her impious scheme of proclaiming herself a second johanna southcott had been so completely frustrated by the determined opposition of her paramour then there was the affair of rosamond torrens one word from whose lips would have the effect of tearing away the mask of hypocrisy which mrs slingsby had so long worn and exposing her to the world in all the hideous nudity of her criminal character lastly the unaccountable absence of the baronet filled her mind with the most serious misgivings for she knew that if he had indeed absconded and if he should cease to maintain her in a pecuniary sense her position would become lamentable in the extreme all these maddening reflections raised a storm of agitation in her guilty mind and she could scarcely subdue her excitement so that it should escape the notice of the coachman as he opened the door of the vehicle when it stopped opposite torrens cottage mr torrens was at home and mrs slingsby was immediately conducted by jeffreys to the parlourthe very parlour where her paramour had been murdered on the preceding evening rosamond from her bedroom window had observed the arrival of the hateful woman and was lost in surprise at her conduct in daring to visit her fathers abode mr torrens received mrs slingsby in the apartment where as we have just stated the awful tragedy of the previous night had been enacted and this was the first time the criminal pair had ever met bad as mr torrens himself was he could not help feeling a sentiment of extreme loathing and disgust for the woman who concealed so black a heart beneath the garb of religious hypocrisyand though he endeavoured to speak politely to her as he desired her to be seated his manner was cold reserved and indicative of the influence which her presence produced upon him we know each other by name mr torrens began mrs slingsby but it is only now that we have met you can doubtless conjecture the object of my visit yes madam exclaimed rosamond suddenly bursting into the room evidently in a state of fearful excitement then hastily closing the door she added my father can too well divine the purport of this insolent intrusion you doubtless seek to recover possession of meto take me back to your infamous abodeto surrender me up to your own vile paramour oh my dear father surelysurely you will not allow this polluted creature to remain beneath your roof a minute longer rosamondrosamond said mrs slingsby becoming the colour of scarlet you will regret those harsh words i came for the purpose of giving certain explanations to your respected parent explanations madam cried the young girl with a bitter smile of contempt what explanations can you offer which i have not already given i have every reason to believe that you overheard a conversation between sir henry courtenay and myself said mrs slingsby growing bolder as she perceived that the atrocious complicity of mr torrens was not suspected by his daughter and that conversation seems to have alarmed youfor your flight from the house was wild and precipitate had i not already tarried there too long demanded rosamond emphatically oh think not to be able to delude me any more with your specious misrepresentationsyour disgusting sophistry a veil has fallen from my eyesand i now behold you madam and that baronet whom you so much vaunted in your proper colours you are wrong thus to suspect us so cruelly said mrs slingsby the conversation which you overheard was but the repetition of another conversation which sir henry courtenay had himself overheard between two persons whom you know not and which he was relating to me but i appeal to your father whether he believes me enough madam exclaimed rosamond in a tone which convinced the base woman that she was indeed no longer to be imposed upon my father knows you to be a degraded hypocriteand your insolence is extreme in thus daring to violate the sanctity of the paternal dwelling to which i have been forced to return for shelter and refuge and were it not she added bitterly that i should be proclaiming my own dishonour not a moments hesitation would i manifest in tearing away the mask from your face and exposing you to the world oh when i think of all the insidious wiles which you have practisedall the abhorrent tutoring which you have brought to play upon my mind i deploreyes deeply do i deplore that necessity which compels me to place a seal upon my lips mrs slingsby had heard enough to satisfy her that no exposure would take place at the hands of rosamond and she was not very solicitous to prolong her visit the cause of the baronets absence she had yet to learn but she concluded that it was not at torrens cottage she must seek to have her curiosity in that respect gratified she accordingly rosebowed to mr torrens who had remained a mute but most alarmed spectator of the whole sceneand hastily withdrew just in time to avoid coming in collision with john jeffreys for that worthy judging by the excited manner in which he himself unobserved had seen rosamond rush into the parlour that something extraordinary was connected with the arrival of mrs slingsby had very coolly and quietly listened at the parlourdoor to every word that was uttered within mrs slingsby returned home somewhat consoled by the conviction that her character was safe from any vindictiveness on the part of rosamond but she was still alarmed in respect to the baronetand this fear increased greatly when on her arrival in old burlington street at about four oclock she learnt that he had not called she immediately despatched a note to his residence but the domestic returned with the answer that sir henry courtenay had not been home since the preceding daya circumstance which caused no small degree of alarm in the baronets household inasmuch as though he often slept away from his abode his servants were invariably kept ignorant of those proofs of irregularities on his part in a word he was accustomed so to arrange matters that his nocturnal outgoings were never suspected at his own residenceand thus his absence on this occasion had naturally inspired some degree of apprehension mrs slingsby was astounded at the message which her servant had brought back she could not even hazard a conjecture relative to the cause of sir henry courtenays disappearance and she was at a loss where to search for him she therefore resolved to remain at home in the hope that he would presently call upon her but time passedand still he came not at length there was a loud double knock at the door and she fancied it was the announcement of sir henrys arrival but instead of the object of her anxiety mr torrens was ushered into the drawingroom i fancied madam he said that you had some particular reason in calling upon me just now and which the presence of the unfortunate rosamond prevented you from explaining i therefore lost no time in waiting upon you my alarm was somewhat appeased by the words which fell from your daughters lips answered mrs slingsby motioning to her visitor to be seated inasmuch as she expressed her intention of remaining silent on a subject which neither i nor you would wish to become a matter of public gossip but i am astonished and grieved at the behaviour of sir henry courtenay who left me last night with the intention of proceeding direct to your house and whom i have not since seen he came not to me madam answered mr torrens with an unblushing countenance this is most extraordinarymost alarming cried mrs slingsby for he has not been home all nightnor yet todayand i begin to have vague suspicions that something wrong must have occurred sir henry courtenay is a gallant man yes interrupted mrs slingsby hastily as if the subject were not a very agreeable one but he also maintains a character for propriety and good conductand his dependants are never suffered to know that he stays away from home at night you see that i am compelled to be candid with youfor the affair is most serious now only reflect for a moment mr torrens upon what my state of mind would be were i questioned relative to sir henrys disappearance suppose i say that he did not soon come backthat he continued to be missingit would transpire that he was with me until late last eveningthat we went out togetherfor we did go out to search for rosamondand that i came back alone no one could suspect you madam of having made away with him observed mr torrens nobut i should be overwhelmed with the most embarrassing questions exclaimed mrs slingsby hastily and do you know that remark of yours has inspired me with horror and alarm no one would suspect me of having made away with him of course nothow could a weak woman assassinate a man in the streets of london and not leave a trace of the dreadful deed behind but might not inquiries be mademight it not be discovered that sir henry and myself were frequent visitorsi must speak candidly to youto a house of illfame and thenoh then what a dreadful exposure would take place you are torturing yourself with vain apprehensions mrs slingsby said mr torrens experiencing the greatest difficulty to conceal his own agitation i should have thought that you mr torrens would have assisted me with your adviceconsidering how we have been involved in the same transactionrather than treat my fears with levity said mrs slingsby in an excited manner and if i tell you the candid truth she added fixing her eyes upon his countenance in a way which seemed intended to read the inmost secrets of his soul i must declare my conviction that you know more of the cause of the baronets disappearance than you choose to admit imadam exclaimed mr torrens shrinking from the accusation in spite of himself yesyou returned the lady growing more and more excited and that suspicion which i hazarded i scarcely know why is now confirmed by your manner i again say yesyou know more of the cause of sir henry courtenays disappearance than you are willing to admit i am convinced that he did visit you last nightand if he never came back what account will you givewhat explanation will you render your anxiety in coming after me just nowthe singularity of your remark that no one would suspect me of foul play towards the baronetand your trepidation when i named the suspicion which had flashed to my mind concerning youall these circumstances convince me that you are no stranger to the cause of sir henry courtenays disappearance madamthis outrageous chargeimplying a crime of which i am utterly incapable began mr torrens scarcely knowing how to meet the accusation and seriously inclined to divulge the whole truth i do not say that you have murdered sir henry courtenay interrupted mrs slingsby speaking in a low tone and giving a strong hollow emphasis to that dreadful word which few can breathe without a shudder but that some quarrel may have taken place between youthat you were compelled to appear violent and vindictive in respect to him your daughter perhaps being presentand that all this led to a fatal issue are things which now seem to form a complete and connected train of horrible impressions in my mind at all events mr torrens she added sinking her voice to a low whisper be candid with metell me the whole truthand we will consult together circumstances having already rendered us colleagues in one transaction i have nothing to tell you mrs slingsby in respect to this business said mr torrens and i am as astonished at sir henry courtenays disappearance as yourself then if i were questioned observed the lady you would have no objection to my saying that i parted last night from sir henry courtenay near st jamess church piccadilly his last words being to the effect that he was about to call at torrens cottage on particular business as she thus spoke mrs slingsby fixed her eyes in a searchingnay a piercing manner upon the countenance of her companion who for a moment quailed and betrayed evident signs of the desperate efforts he was making to conceal his agitation yesyou may safely say that if you perceive any utility in so doing returned mr torrens at length then his features suddenly assuming a ferocious expression he added but why proclaim war against me do we not know too much of each other to render such a warfare safe or useful to either were you not the paramour of sir henry courtenaydid you yourself not admit ere now that you visited a house of illfame with himand are you not at this moment with child by him womanwoman muttered torrens between his teeth provoke me notor it shall be war indeedwar to the knife be reasonable sir said mrs slingsby now assuming a cold and resolute air and let us talk as two accomplices ought to converseand not with menaces and threats agreed madambut be you reasonable also returned mr torrens then wherefore keep anything secret from me demanded mrs slingsby i have read the truthi have divined itand your language has just confirmed my impression but think not that i care for sir henry courtenay as a loving mistress or wife might care for him no she added contemptuously any affection which i may ever have experienced towards him has long since vanished and of what avail would it be to you to know that sir henry courtenay was no more even for a moment granting that he indeed exists no longer asked torrens i will tell you replied mrs slingsby in a low and hoarse whisper while she looked intently and in a manner full of dark meaning into her companions eyes as she bent her countenance towards him if i were assured that sir henry courtenay was indeed no more i would become possessed of two thousand pounds by ten oclock tomorrow morning ah ejaculated mr torrens his mind instantly conceiving the idea of sharing the produce of whatever plan the lady might adopt to accomplish her purposefor we have already said that his necessities were still great and that unless he shortly obtained funds he would be as badly off as he was ere he sold the virtue of his daughter yes resumed mrs slingsby and to show you that i have more confidence in you than you have in me i will give you a full and complete explanation sir henry courtenay promised me two thousand pounds as a reward for my connivance in the plan respecting rosamond go ongo on said mr torrens hastily that reward i have not received because the payments which sir henry had to make to you and other claims upon him had caused him to overdraw his bankers but yesterday morning he paid in eight thousand pounds and he intimated to one of the partners that he should give me a cheque for two thousand in the course of the afternoon the fact is continued mrs slingsby those bankers believe that i have property in india which sir henry courtenays agent there manages for me and that the proceeds therefore pass through sir henrys hands this tale was invented to account for the numerous and large cheques which i have received from the baronet on that bankit was the saving clause for my reputation now those two thousand pounds which were promised me i can have for little trouble and a small risk indeed said mr torrens becoming more and more interested in this explanation yes continued mrs slingsby and i will tell you how almost immediately but i must first observe that i should have received the cheque last evening had not the sudden flight of rosamond interrupted the discourse which i was having with the baronet and thrown us into confusion butand again she lowered her voice to an almost inaudible whisperi can imitate the handwriting of sir henry courtenay to such a nicety that it would defy detection now do you understand me i doi do answered mr torrens and you perceive that i have full confidence in you added the widow mr torrens rose and paced the room for a few minutes he was deliberating within himself whether he should repose an equal trust in mrs slingsby and he decided upon doing so she saw what was passing in his mind and remained silent confident as to the result my dear madam he said resuming his seat i will at once admit to you that sir henry courtenay is indeed no more the lady heard him with breathless attention for though she was fully prepared for the avowal yet when it came it sounded so awfullyso ominously that she received it with emotions of terror and dismay it is indeed too true continued torrens but think not for a moment that i am a murderer nono bad as i may beas i know myself to be in finei could not perpetrate such a deed as that a strange and wonderful combination of circumstances led to the shocking catastrophe listenand i will tell you all mr torrens then related every incident of the preceding evening suppressing only that portion of the tale which involved the fact of his servant john jeffreys being acquainted with the occurrence and having lent his aid in disposing of the body this circumstance he concealed through that inherent aversion which man ever has to confess that he is in the power of any one and he made it appear by his own story that unassisted he had buried the corpse at first mrs slingsby was incredulous relative to the version of the murder which she heard she thought that torrens was himself the perpetrator of the act but when he declared how cruelly the robbery of his money had embarrassed him and when she reflected that there really could have been no reason urgent or strong enough to induce him to make away with the baronet she ended by fully believing his narrative then he is indeed no more she exclaimed but my god what will be thought of his disappearanceand will not those enquiries which i so much dread be made as no suspicion can possibly fall upon either yourself or me responded mr torrens it is far from likely that any such enquiries will be instituted noyou need not be alarmed on that head my dear madam i should rather be inclined to entertain apprehensions for the success of your own scheme ofthe forgery he added after a moments pause no danger can possibly attend that undertaking said mrs slingsby the baronet stated at the bankers that he should give me the cheque yesterday and it will be paid in a moment even if they have already heard of his disappearance which is scarcely probable because the fears excited by that fact have not as yet become so strong as to lead to the suspicion that he has indeed met with foul play you are then confident of being enabled to counterfeit his handwriting successfully asked mr torrens beyond all possibility of doubt replied the widow and shall you want my assistance inquired torrens thinking how he could start a pretext for claiming a portion of the expected proceeds of the nefarious plan listen to me said mrs slingsby after a few moments deliberation and now speaking as if she had finally come to a settled resolution on a particular point which she had been revolving in her mind almost ever since mr torrens entered the room i have something to propose to you which regards us both and which may suit yourself as well as it would suit me you are involved in embarrassments i am indeed replied mr torrens now awaiting breathless suspense the coming explanation which by the leading question just put appeared to relate to some scheme for relieving him of his difficulties and these embarrassments are very serious continued the widow so serious that they are insurmountable as far as i can see at present was the response then you fear executionsarrestprisonand all the usual ordeal of an insolvent debtor asked the lady just so and sooner than enter on that ordeal i would commit suicide rejoined mr torrens the alternative i have to propose to you is not quite so serious nor alarming as that resumed mrs slingsby i have shown you that i can put myself in possession of two thousand pounds tomorrow morning will that sum relieve you completely from your difficulties and enable me to carry out those speculations which must produce a large fortune answered torrens then those two thousand pounds are at your disposal on one condition said mrs slingsby and that condition gasped mr torrens in mingled joy and suspense is that you marry me returned mrs slingsby as calmly as if she were making a bargain of a very ordinary nature marry you exclaimed her companion quite unprepared for this proposal yesmarry me repeated the widow you want money to save you from ruini want a husband to screen me from disgrace you are involved in pecuniary troublesi am in a way to become a mother i can save your person from a gaolyou can save my character from dishonour the arrangement is indeed an equitable one said mr torrens not without the least scintillation of satire in his remark but i see one fatal objection and that is your daughter rosamond observed mrs slingsby surely the whimthe aversionor the phantasy of a girl will not induce you to reject a proposal which will save you from ruin and imprisonment and yet what could i say to her how could i explain my conduct what would she think after all she knows of you demanded mr torrens she has not the power to prevent the match and that is the principal point in the matter returned mrs slingsby coolly you may as well urge as an objection that clarence villiers my nephew is your soninlaw but i am not so foolish as to be alarmed at such scruples and you must have seen too much of the world to allow yourself to be irretrievably ruined for the sake of a few idle punctilios give me your decision at onceaye or nay if it be the former the marriage may be celebrated by special license tomorrow evening if it be the latter there is at once an end of the business and we need not be the less good friends you regard the whole proposition then entirely as a matter of business said mr torrens wellthat is indeed the way to look at it of course if we strike a bargain and unite our fortunes we shall require only one establishment will you break up this in old burlington street and be contented to dwell at my cottage certainly was the reply the sale of my furniture will pay my debts and perhaps leave a surplus at all events we shall have the two thousand pounds clear and that sum you will place in my hands tomorrow morning said mr torrens interrogatively notomorrow evening after the ceremony responded the widow then we cannot trust each other continued mr torrens i think we should act prudently to adopt as many mutual precautions as possible observed mrs slingsby coolly granted exclaimed mr torrens and what guarantee have i that when once the indissoluble knot shall have been tied you will hand me over the promised sum simply the fact that i do not wish to marry a man who will be the next morning conveyed away to a prison that is a mere assertion and no security remonstrated mr torrens we are talking the matter over in a purely businesslike sense now as far as i can see the advantages will be all on your side if you happen to be in debt you will have a husband on whose person your creditors will pounce instead of on your own and at all events as you are with child you will have a person whom you can represent as the legitimate father of the expected offspring i will tell you how the business can be managed said mrs slingsby after a pause a thought has struck me i will lodge the money in the hands of a very respectable solicitor whom i know and you can accompany me to his office for the purpose in his keeping shall it remain with the understanding that it is to be paid to you on your becoming my husband good observed mr torrens who is the solicitor mr howard was the answer i know him and have no objection to him as the agent in the business i think we have now got over all obstacles in that respect a difficult task will it however prove to me to prepare my daughter this evening for the step which i am to take tomorrow oh i have no doubt you will succeed said mrs slingsby it would be indeed hard if a father could not overcome with his reasoning the objections of his own child i must do my best observed torrens rising at what hour tomorrow shall i call to accompany you to the lawyers at about twelve i shall go to the bank between ten and eleven and you can in the meantime obtain the marriagelicense it shall be done returned mr torrens the ceremony will be performed here he added interrogatively yesat seven oclock in the evening i will make arrangements with two ladies whom i know to be bridesmaids and dr wagtail will give me away after the ceremony we will repair to torrens cottage thus calmly and deliberately was settled the solemn covenant between the man who had sold his daughters virtue and the licentious woman who was now prepared to commit a forgery and the worthy pair separated mr torrens having embraced his intended wife because he considered a kiss to be as it were the seal of the bargain just concluded and also because mrs slingsby by her manner appeared to invite the salutation chapter lxxxi rosamond at home we shall follow mr torrens homeward and see how he acquitted himself of the disagreeable and difficult task of breaking his matrimonial intentions to his daughter the fair but ruined rosamond it was past nine oclock in the evening when he reached the cottage and rosamond with a charming filial solicitude to render her parents home as comfortable as possible had superintended the preparations for supper exercising a command too over the sad feelings which filled her bosom and invoking resignation with christian fortitude to her aid she even manifested a species of cheerfulness as she opened the frontdoor at the sound of his wellknown knock but alas it was not the innocentartless cheerfulness of other daysit was merely the struggle of the moonbeam to pierce the mass of dark and menacing clouds and now behold the father and daughter seated at the suppertablethat repast which the care of rosamond had endeavoured to render as agreeable as possible but which was disposed of hastily and without appetite on either side at length when the things were cleared away and mr torrens had fortified his courage with sundry glasses of wine he prepared to enter on the grave and important subject which occupied his mind rosamond my love he said speaking in as kind a tone as it was possible for his nature to assume i have something to communicate to you and shall be glad if you will hear me calmly and without excitement i have this evening seen mrs slingsby that woman exclaimed the daughter starting oh i had hoped that her name would no more be mentioned in this house i begged of you not to give way to excitementi warned you to be reasonable said mr torrens severely surely you can accord me your attention when i am anxious to discourse with you on matters of importance pardon me dearest fatherand oh do not blame nor reproach me if i manifest a very natural irritabilitya loathingan abhorrence she could say no more but burst into a flood of tears mr torrens suffered her to give full vent to her emotions for he knew that the reaction would produce comparative calmness rosamond he at length said you can be reasonable when you chooseand i do hope that you have sufficient confidence in your father to accord him your attention and to believe what he may state to you listen thenand rest assured that i should never take the part of any one against my own daughter i have seen mrs slingsby rosamond gave a convulsive start but her father appearing not to observe it proceeded it struck me he continued that she would never have had the presumption and impudence to call here this morning if she were really as guilty as you supposed her to be i therefore deemed it an act of justice to ascertain the nature of those explanations which she proffered in this room and which your presence cut short with that object in view i proceeded to her abode and she assured me that she was entirely innocent of any connivance in the atrocity perpetrated by sir henry courtenay innocent almost shrieked rosamond oh my dear father you know not how specioushow plausible that woman can be when she chooses and it has suited her purpose to be so with you but be not deceived do you imagine that i am not old enough and sufficiently experienced to discriminate between sincerity and duplicity demanded mr torrens i tell you rosamond that you wrong mrs slingsbythat your suspicions are most injurious reflectconsider before you thus condemn you overheard a few words which immediately threw you into a state of such excitement that your imagination tortured all the subsequent discourse into an evidence of guilt on the part of a lady who is deeply attached to youwho loves you as if she were your own motherand who will die of grief if you continue thus to misjudge her yes rosamondmrs slingsby has declared that she will put a period to her existence if you persist in your present belief she accuses you of ingratitude towards her after all her affectionate kindness in your behalf and should she carry her dreadful threat into executionwhich i much fear for she seems literally distractedher blood will be upon your head illustration merciful heavens exclaimed rosamond appalled by this terrible announcement but if i cannot command my own convictions she added hastily you must cherish a christian spirityou must be less prompt in forming opinionsless ready to arrive at those convictions which you represent to be uncontrollable said mr torrens endeavouring to bewilder his daughter and thereby render her spirit ductile and her mind pliant so that he might manage both as he pleased so far from nourishing malignity against mrs slingsby you should seek consolation with her for your own mother is not here to console you god be thanked that my mother is not here to witness my disgrace ejaculated rosamond clasping her hands fervently for the sake of my daughters i was wrongyes i was wrong not to have married again said mr torrens as if musing to himself i should have given a protectress to my childrena lady who would have been a second mother to them and then all this would not have occurred but it is not yet too late to ensure your future welfare rosamond by those means he added turning towards his daughter who had listened with surprise to her fathers previous observations and in accomplishing that aim i may at the same time afford a convincing proof to a deserving wronglysuspected and misjudged woman of my own esteem and inferentially of your regret at the calumniatory sentiments you have cherished concerning her my dear fatheri do not understand you cried rosamond a dreadful suspicion weighing on her mind and which nevertheless seemed so wild and ridiculousso utterly impossible to be wellfounded that she fancied she had not rightly comprehended the sentiments of her parent i am thinking how i can best ensure your welfare and happiness rosamond he said by giving you a substitute for that maternal protectress whom you have lostone who will be a companion and a friend to you father exclaimed rosamond horrified at the idea of having a stepmother and trembling with indescribable alarms lest she had indeed too well read her sires intentions respecting the one whom he proposed to invest with that authority will you hear me with calmnesswill you subdue this excitement which amounts to an undutiful aversion to all i am projecting for your sake demanded mr torrens again assuming a severe tone then perceiving that his daughter was dismayed by his manner he hastily added as if determined at once to put an end to a painful scene if i have consulted you rosamond on the step that i propose to take it was because i deemed you sensible and reasonable enough to merit that proof of confidence on my part and obedient enough to submit becomingly to the dictates of my superior wisdom and experience know then that it is my intention to marry againfor your sakeand that my inclinations as well as my interests induce me to fix my choice upon mrs slingsby rosamond uttered not a word but fell back senseless in her chair obstinate fool muttered torrens between his teeth as he hastened forward to save her from slipping off on the fender but i will neither argue nor consult any morei will command where i wish to be obeyed he applied a scentbottle to her nostrils and she soon gave signs of returning animation opening her eyes she glanced wildly at her father as if to interrogate him whether that were really true which appeared to have been haunting her like a horrid dream fatherfather she murmured grasping his hands you will notno you will not do what you have said oh i implore youi conjuresacrifice not your own happiness and mine at the same instant i was not mistaken in one syllable that i overheard between that woman and that manand their discourse filled me with horror she is his paramour fathershe is in a way to become a mother silence daughter cried mr torrens sternly and now listen to me while i make you acquainted with my commands not only is it my intention to marry mrs slingsby but i desire that you will treat her with respectif not with affection and as you value my love and the continuance of my kindness you will observe these instructions if any thing more be wanting to induce you to comply with my desire that additional argument will perhaps be found in the fact that if i do not marry mrs slingsby i shall be ruinedutterly undonemy property wrested from memy person conveyed to a prisonand you thrust out houseless and penniless into the wide world without a soul to protect or befriend you now i have told you alland it is for you to decide whether your prejudices shall prevail against my most substantial interests rosamond was astounded at the words which met her ears and she knew not how to reply for a few moments she stood gazing vacantly upon her fathers countenance as if to read thereon a confirmation of words the import of which seemed too terrible to be true then probably experiencing the necessity of seeking the solitude of her own chamber for the purpose of giving vent to the overflowing fulness of her hearts emotions she hurried from the room poor friendless girl dreadful was the position in which she found herself placed oh why were not clarence and adelais near to console herto receive her beneath their protecting influence alas she would not have dared to face them even were they in the metropolis at the time for she could not have revealed to them her dishonouroh no she would sooner have died throwing herself on a seat in the privacy of her bedchamber she burst into tears and gave vent to her anguish in heartrending sobs an hour passedand still she thought not of retiring to restshe was in a state of utter despair she heard her father ascend to his chamber but this circumstance reminded her not that the usual hour when she herself sought her couch had gone by suddenly she was aroused from the deep reverie of woe that had succeeded the violent outburst of her anguish by the movement of the handle of the door as if some one were about to enter her room she started and listened the bed being between the place where she was and the door so that she could not see the latter yessome one was indeed entering the chamber with a faint scream she darted forward and beheld a man in the act of closing the door behind him the intruder was jeffreys the recentlyhired servant what has brought you hither john enquired rosamond in hasty and anxious tonefor she feared lest something had happened to her father nothink but your own beautiful self miss answered the ruffian advancing towards her as well as he was ablefor he was much intoxicated begone cried rosamond her whole countenance becoming suddenly crimson with indignation begone i sayand tomorrow my father will know how to punish this insolence your father miss wont do no such a thing returned jeffreys and itll be all the worse for you if you holler i know a many things that wouldnt render it safe for master to quarrel with me so give me a kiss villain exclaimed rosamond bursting into tears how dare you thus insult me leave the roomor i alarm the house at any riskand she rushed towards the bellpull none of that nonsense missor ill hang your father as sure as youre alive said jeffreys placing his back to the door folding his arms and surveying rosamond with the insolence of a licentious drunken bully hang my father repeated the unhappy girl staggering back and sinking into a chairfor so many dreadful things had recently occurred that her mind was more attuned to give immediate credence to evil than to receive good tidings yes by jingo said jeffreys i can hang him any day i like but whats more i know pretty well all thats happened to you i didnt listen for nothink at the parlour door this morning when that mrs bingsby or stingsby or whatever her name is was here my god my god murmured rosamond pressing her hands to her brow with all her mightfor she felt as if she were going mad now dont take on so miss said jeffreys im sure i didnt mean to vex you like that but the fact is ive took a great fancy to you and if so be i let out that your father did draw a knife across the throat of that baronet which come here last night and which i spose was the same you spoke of this morning to mrs bingsby monster shrieked rosamond in a shrill penetrating tonefor she was unable any longer to subdue the horrible emotions which racked and tortured her goading her almost to madness in another instant mr torrens was heard to rush from his chambera moment more and he forced his way into his daughters room hurling the villain jeffreys forward with the violence exerted in dashing open the door fatherdear father exclaimed rosamond springing into his arms save mesave me from that monster who has told me such dreadfuldreadful things be calm rosamond said mr torrens in a low and hoarse tone or you will alarm the other servant jeffreys he added turning towards the fellow who was swaying himself backwards and forwards in the middle of the room in that vain attempt to appear sober so often made by drunken men how dare you to intrude here but follow mei must speak to you alone fatherone word said rosamond in a voice indicative of deep feeling this man uttered a frightful accusation against youoh an accusation so terrible that my blood curdles nonsense rosamond interrupted mr torrens cruelly agitated you see that he has taken a drop too muchhe is a good well meaning fellowand will be very sorry in the morning sorry why the devil should i be sorry cried jeffreys with the dogged insolence of inebriation i dont know what ive got to be sorry for come come said mr torrens gently pushing his daughter aside and approaching the manservant in a coaxing conciliatory way this is carrying the thing too far john wellwell we can talk it over in the morning missand i dare say we shall make matters right enough together stammered the drunken hind as he allowed himself to be led away from the chamber by mr torrens youre a pretty galand if i said anythink amiss the almost maddened father hurried him over the threshold and rosamond hastened to secure the door behind them both then flinging herself into a chair she exclaimed my god what horrors have met my ears this night misfortunescrimeswoesfearsoutrages have entered the house like an army carrying desolation along with it but my fathera murdereroh heavensnonoit cannot be and yet that dread accusationso coolso systematicmy god my god and she wept as if her heart would break from this painfulor rather most agonising condition of mind she was aroused by a low knock at her door and in answer to her question who was there the voice of her father replied she hastened to admit himbut as he entered she started back appalled by the ghastliness of his countenance every lineament of which denoted horror and fearful emotions father tell me allkeep me not in suspenselet me know the worst exclaimed rosamond clasping her hands in an imploring manner dreadful things have happened i am sureand my brain is reeling maddening daughter said mr torrens taking her hand you must and you shall know the worst nowfor i find that the miscreant jeffreys has indeed told you too much for me to attempt to conceal the truth just heavens my fatherstained with bloodthe blood of vengeance on account of his dishonoured daughter said rosamond speaking in broken sentences and with hysterical excitement while her eyes were fixed intently and with a fearfully wild expression upon the haggard countenance of her sire nonot so rosamond answered mr torrens emphatically sit downthereand try and compose yourself for a few moments while i give you an explanation which circumstances have rendered imperative the wretched girl suffered herself to be placed on a seat her father then drew another chair close to the one which she occupiedand leaning with folded arms over the back of it he continued in these terms last nightafter you had retired to your roomsir henry courtenay called yeshe dared to visit the house into which such dishonour and so much misery had been brought by his means but he came to offer every possible atonement which it was in his power to make and then i ascended to your roomhereto make you aware of his presence in the parlour below and of the proposals which i had received but i found you in a state of mind too profoundly excited to bear the announcementi remained with you to console and tranquillise youand when i saw that you were growing more calm i retraced my way down stairs merciful heavens what a spectacle then met my eyes and mr torrens having introduced his fearful history by this deceptive and well coloured preface proceeded to narrate the facts of the murder precisely as they had really occurrednot forgetting to mention the robbery of a sum of money which he had left on the table he then explained the part which john jeffreys had subsequently performed in the occurrences of the preceding night and he wound up in the following manner thus you perceive dear rosamond how a fearful combination of circumstances would fix dark and dreadful suspicions on me were this tragedy to be brought to light and now too you can understand how that miscreant jeffreys dared to presume upon his knowledge of the shocking eventhow believing me to be completely in his power he fancied that i dared not defend my own daughter from his licentious ruffianism and more than all this rosamondmrs slingsby holds me also beneath the rod of terrorism for she knew that the baronet came hither last nightshe knew also that he did not returnand i was compelled to reveal to her the whole truth even as circumstances have now forced me to reveal it to you and this is the secret of my intended marriage with hera marriage that will take place tomorrow and into which she has coerced me thus rosamond if you ever loved and if you still love your unhappy fatherpity him pity himbut do not reproach himnor aggravate his grief and his mental anguish by thought or deed on your part so ingeniously had mr torrens blended truth and fiction in his narrative to work upon the feelings of his daughterso artfully had he combined and explained the various incidents in order to represent himself as the victim of cruel circumstancesthat the generousminded rosamond felt the deepest commiseration and sympathy on behalf of her father rapidly taking possession of her soul my dearest parent she said i crave your pardoni implore your forgiveness for having wronged you by the most unjustthe most horrible suspicions but the conduct of that man jeffreyshis awful accusationthe reluctance you appeared to exhibit in dealing summarily with him when you entered the room the first time this nightall these things operated powerfully upon my mind which has been attenuated by so many dreadful shocks within the last ten or twelve days alas what sorrows have overtaken uswhat perils environ us let us fly from this neighbourhood dear fatherlet us leave england it is impossible rosamond interrupted mr torrens hastily i had myself thought of that means of ensuring personal safety but i abandoned the idea almost as soon as formedfor it was better to stay here surrounded by danger yet having bread to eat than seek a foreign clime to starve we can work dear fatherwe can toil for our livelihood but nonever should you be reduced to such a painful necessity so long as your daughter has health and strength to labour for our mutual support exclaimed the excellenthearted girl oh let us flylet us quit this countrylet us repair to france i have some few accomplishmentsdrawingmusica knowledge of all the branches of needlework and it will be hard indeed if i cannot earn enough to procure us bread nono rosamondit cannot be said mr torrens tears now trickling down his cheeksfor the better he became acquainted with the admirable traits of his daughters charactertraits which adversity misfortune and danger now developedthe more bitterly did his heart smite him for the awful treachery he had perpetrated with regard to her and wherefore is it impossible she asked consider my dear father by what circumstances you are now surrounded on one side is jeffreys whom you dare not offendwhom you cannot dischargeand from whose ruffianism your daughter is not safe on the other side is this marriage with mrs slingsbya marriage which i now perceive to be forced upon youa marriage that will bring into this house a person whom neither of us can ever love or respect enough enough rosamond exclaimed mr torrens all these sad thingsthese dangers and these sacrificeshave become interwoven with the destiny which it is mine to fulfil and i must pursue my painful coursefollow on my sad career in the best manner that i may i cannot risk starvation in a foreign landi could not support an existence maintained by the toils of my daughter besides i am confident of being able to realise a fortune by my speculations in this neighbourhood here then must i remain and now rosamond it remains for you to decide whether you will receive the motherinlaw whom imperious circumstances force upon youor whether you will abandon your father never never will i leave you cried the affectionate girl throwing her arms around her parents neck and embracing him tenderly the interviewthe painful interview between the father and his child then terminated the former retired to his own apartment a prey to feelings of the most harrowing nature and the latter sought her couch to which slumber was brought through sheer exhaustion but the horrors of the early portion of the night were perpetuated in her dreams chapter lxxxii the forged cheque oh what a strange and at the same time what a wondrous world is this in which we liveand how marvellous is human progress the utmost attainments effected by the wisdom of our ancestors were but ignorance and shortsightedness compared with the knowledge of the present day antiquity had its grand intellects and its sublime geniuses but it furnished not the same abundance of materials to act upon as is afforded by the discoveries and likewise by the spirit of this age but are we proportionately happier on this account than were our forefathers is the workingman for instance more prosperous more comfortable more enviable as to his condition than the aboriginal briton who lived in a cave or the hollow of a tree and who painted his body to protect it against the cold with all our prosperitywith all the grandeur the glitter and the refinement of our civilisationwith all our moralising institutions and our love of social order and mental improvement we yet find the national heart devoured tortured and preyed upon by that undying serpentpauperism yes the millions are not so happy so prosperous or so comfortable as they ought to befor they are compelled to gnaw the tares of civilisations field while the proud and heartless oligarchy selfappropriate the corn proud and heartless indeed are the rulers and the mighty ones of this land and if the millions remain passive and patient that pride and that heartlessness will grow the one more despotic and the other more selfish it was but a few days ago that we marked two distinct articles in the morning newspapers which formed a contrast fearfully significant in its evidence of the pride and the heartlessness which we abominate on the one hand and of the distress and suffering which we so deeply deplore on the other one of these articles consisted but of four lines the other occupied nearly two columns the first stated as laconically as possible that bread had risen to thirteenpence the quartern loaf and recorded a rapidlydisposed of regret that provisions should be so dear on account of the poor the second gave a laboured fulsome and tediously wiredrawn narrative of her majestys state ball thus the misery endured by millions in consequence of dearness and scarcity is a trivial matter deserving only of four lines whereas the trumpery nonsense and childish tomfoolery of a royal dance are deemed of sufficient importance to merit nearly two columns oh instead of giving balls and splendid entertainments at such a time if the sovereign of this land were to say to the people ye are starving and it makes my heart bleed to think that from your very vitals are wrung the hundreds of thousands of pounds which are wasted by myself and the other members of the royal family on our frivolities our whims our caprices and our wanton extravagances therefore will i give ye back one half of the enormous income which i have hitherto enjoyed in the full confidence that my example will be imitated by many others who prey upon youdid the sovereign thus speak to the nation the nation would be justly proud of its sovereign and yet this sovereign would only be performing a duty dictated by humanity and common justice what would be thought of the father of a family who feasted on turtle and venison accompanied by generous wines every day while his children were thrust into the cold humid cellar to devour a mouldy crust and drink water yet the sovereign delights in the attribute of a general and comprehensive paternal solicitude in the welfare of the people but it is an attribute which exists only in the imaginations of grovelling courtiers or lickspittle historians royalty and aristocracy are intenselynecessarilyand thoroughly selfish and as for any anxiety on behalf of the toiling and suffering millions the idea is absurdthe notion is a mere delusionthe assertion that such a feeling exists is a liea monstrous wicked atrocious lie there is more of the milk of human kindness in a single cottage than in all the palaces of europe taken together there is more true philanthropy in one poor mans hovel than in a thousand mansions of the great and wealthy in the fashionable quarters of london oh if the father or the mother can dance and be glad while the children are famishing the sooner all ties are severed between such worthless parents and such an oppressed and outraged offspring the better nero danced and sang on the summit of a tower at the spectacle presented to his eyes by burning romeand festivity and rejoicing reign in our english palaces at a moment when scarcity menaces the land with famine and its invariable attendantpestilence people of england ye now understand how much sympathy ye may expect on the part of those who derive all their wealth from the sweat of your brow people of ireland ye now comprehend how much pity your starving condition excites on the part of your rulers people of scotland ye now perceive how worthy the great ones of the realm are of your adulation but it is sickening as it is sorrowful to dwell on this subject some of our readers may perhaps ask us wherefore we broach it at all we will reply by means of a few questions is not every individual member of a society interested in the welfare of that society or ought he not at least to be so is he not justified in denouncing the errors or the downright turpitude of the magistrates whom that society has chosen to govern it and who derive their power only from its good will and pleasure or is it not indeed his duty to proclaim those errors and that turpitude should not this duty be performed even if it be unpleasant and can we ever hope to ameliorate our condition unless we expose the abuses which oppress degrade and demoralise us oh let no one rashly and in a random manner say that he cares nothing about politics such an assertion denotes a wilful disregard not only of his neighbours interests but also of his own were all men to entertain such an indifference the people would be the veriest slaves that an unrestrained despotism and an unwatched tyranny could render them it is as necessary for the industrious classes to protect their rights and privileges by zealously guarding them as to adopt precautions to save their houses from fire one word more it is a common saying and as absurd as it is commonoh women have no right to meddle in politics women on the contrary have as much right as the lords of the creation to exhibit an interest in the systems and institutions by which they are governed for the sake of their children as well as for their own they should assert and exercise that right it is a lamentable delusion to suppose that the intellect of woman is not powerful nor comprehensive enough to embrace such considerations the intellect of woman is naturally as strong as that of man but it has less chances and less opportunities of developing its capacity the masculine study of politics would aid the intellect of woman in putting forth its strength and we hope that the day is gone by when the female sex are to be limited to the occupations of the drawingroom the nursery or the kitchen we do not wish to see women become soldiers or sailors nor to work at severe employment but we are anxious to behold them thinkers as well as readersutilitarians as well as domestic economists and we know of no greater benefit that could be conferred on society in general than that which might be derived from the influence of the well developed intellect of woman her mind is naturally better poised than that of man farseeing and quicksighted is shea readiness at devising and combining plans to meet emergencies is intuitive with her her judgment is correcther taste goodand she profits by experience far more usefully than does man is it not absurd thenis it not unjustand is it not unwise to deny to woman the right of exercising her proper influence in that society of which she is the ornament and the delight alas that there should be such exceptions to the general rule of female excellence as martha slingsbya woman whose principles were thoroughly corrupt whose licentious passions were of the most devouring insatiable kind and whose talent for wicked combinations and evil plottings was unfortunately so great let us return to this hypocritical and abandoned creature and follow her in the vile scheme which now occupies all her attention having breakfasted at an early hour she seated herself at her desk whence she drew forth a packet of letters received by her at various times from sir henry courtenay and the signatures of which now became the objects of her special study the art of counterfeiting the late baronets autograph was practised by her for nearly half an hour for though she was already tolerably confident of her ability to forge his signature most successfullyas she had assured mr torrensshe nevertheless deemed it prudent to render the imitation as perfect as possible at last the atrocious deed was accomplished to her complete satisfaction and a cheque for two thousand pounds lay drawn in a thoroughly businesslike manner upon her desk she was bold and courageous in the execution of plots and the carrying out of deep schemesbut this dark and dangerous crime which she had just perpetrated caused her to shudder from head to foot hitherto all her wickedness had been of a nature calculated only if detected to involve her in disgrace and not in perilto ruin her character but not place her life in jeopardy now she had taken a stepa bold and desperate stepwhich at once set her on the high road that conducts all those who are found treading its pathway to the foot of the scaffold yesshe shrank back and she trembled violently as she rose from the desk whereon the forged cheque now lay and for a moment she was inclined to seize itto rend it into a thousand piecesand thus to dispel at once and in an instant the tremendous black cloud of stormy danger which she had drawn over her own head but noshe had courage enough to be wicked and rash but she had not strength of mind sufficient to render her prudent she therefore decided on daring allrisking everything by the presentation of the forged cheque having dressed herself in a style of unusual elegance she proceeded in a hackneycoach to lombard street and alighted at the door of the bankinghouse on which the cheque was drawn saying to herselfnow for the aid of all my courageshe entered the spacious establishment and advanced towards the counter one of the numerous clerks in attendance instantly received the cheque which she handed across to himand as it left her hand a chill struck to her heartand she would at that moment have given worlds to recall it her composure was now only the effect of utter desperation but so unruffled was her countenance that not a lineament was so changed as to be calculated to engender suspicion the clerk took the cheque to the nearest desk upon the counter and after reading it with more than usual attention as mrs slingsby thought he said this is dated the day before yesterday madam have you seen sir henry courtenay since then i have not answered mrs slingsby wondering how she was able to speak in a tone so cold and collected i believe she added that he is gone out of town pardon the question madam observed the clerk but one of his servants was here last evening just before closing time to enquire if we had seen sir henrythen after a few moments pause he said how will you have this immense was the relief suddenly experienced by the guilty woman she seemed as if drawn abruptly forth from the depths of an ocean in which she had been suffocatingdrowning the revulsion of feeling was so great that whereas she had been enabled to stand without support throughout the few minutes of frightful ordeal just passed she was now compelled to cling to the counter though the clerk observed not her emotion having specified the manner in which she desired the amount of the cheque to be paid her mrs slingsby received the produce of her crime and quitted the bank she was now so astounded at the complete success of her schemealthough when able to reflect calmly upon it she had never once doubted the issuethat she could scarcely believe in its realization her brain whirledher heart palpitated violently as she ascended the steps of the hackneycoachand its motion as it rolled away from the door of the bank increased the excitement under which she was now labouring on her return to old burlington street she found mr torrens waiting for her it being nearly twelve oclockthe hour appointed for their visit to the solicitor the moment she entered the drawingroom mr torrens rose from his seat and advanced towards her his eyes fixed intently upon her countenance in fact mr torrens was deeply anxious to learn the result of the bold venture which mrs slingsby was that morning to make with him it was now a matter of pecuniary ruin or salvation and he had overcome so many difficulties alreadystifling his own scruples at taking an immodest woman for his wife and reducing his daughter to a belief in the necessity of his submitting to this matrimonial arrangementthat he trembled lest some unforeseen accident should thwart him just at the moment when he appeared to be touching on the goal of success moreover he had that morning ere quitting home so contrived matters with john jeffreys as to induce this man to leave his service without delay and he had enjoyed the supreme satisfaction of seeing that dangerous person leave his house ere he himself had set out to keep his appointment with mrs slingsby thus every thing had progressed in accordance with mr torrens views and wishes so far as the preliminaries to his change of condition were involved well my dear madam what tidings he eagerly demanded as he approached to meet mrs slingsby i have succeeded she said throwing herself into a chair but i would not for worlds undergo again the same dreadful alternations between acute suspense and thrilling joycold tremor and feverish excitement and yet the transaction has given a charming glow of animation to your countenance observed mr torrens now for the first time inflamed by desire in respect to the amorous widow whom he was shortly to make his wife i have procured the license and and rosamondwhat of her demanded mrs slingsby hastily she will receive you with a respectful welcome at torrens cottage was the answer by dint of reasoning with her i overcame all her scruples and rendered her pliant and ductile to our purposes all progresses well then said mrs slingsby let us now away to mr howard and to that gentlemans office did the pair proceed their business was soon explained to the attorney who manifested no surprise nor any particular emotion at the singularity of the transaction for mr howard was a perfect man of business ready to receive instructions without expressing any feelings at all calculated to annoy his clients and never indicating a curiosity to learn more than those clients might choose to confide to him i am to keep this sum of two thousand pounds until such time as mr torrens may claim it in the capacity of your husband he said as coolly and quietly as if he were receiving a deposit on the purchase of an estate exactly so answered mrs slingsby and tomorrow morning my dear sir added mr torrens with a smile i shall come to claim it good exclaimed mr howard locking up the banknotes and gold in his iron safe i give you joy mr torrens mrs slingsby i wish you all possible happiness thus speaking the attorney bowed his clients out of the office mr torrens escorted mrs slingsby back to old burlington street and then repaired as fast as his horse and gig would take him to his own dwelling to sit down to an early dinner and afterwards dress himself for the interesting ceremony of the evening but on his arrival at the cottage he learnt from the female servant who opened the door that his daughter rosamond had left home an hour previously left home ejaculated mr torrens but she will return he continued interrogatively did she not say that she would return she desired me to give you this note sir answered the domestic mr torrens tore open the letter placed in his hands and read the following impressive lines pardon me dearest father for the step which i am now taking but i cannotcannot support the idea of dwelling beneath the same roof with that lady who is soon to be my motherinlaw i know that i promised not to desert the paternal home that promise was given in sinceritythough maddening reflections now render me incapable of keeping it you are well aware how dreadfully my feelings have been woundedhow cruelly my heart has been lacerated during the last few hours and i have struggled against the violence of my griefi have endeavoured to subdue my anguishbut the occurrences of last nightthe outrage attempted by that villain jeffreysthe revelation of the terrible secret relative to sir henry courtenayoh my dear father a mind ten thousand times stronger than that of your unhappy daughter could not endure the weight of all this aggregate of misery therefore sooner that my presence should render my fathers house unhappy i depart thence hoping to be followed by your blessing grieve not for me dear fatherheaven will protect me from time to time i shall write to you and should happier days arrivebut of that alas i dare entertain no hope at present to you must i leave the painful task of accounting to my dearest dearest sister and her esteemed husband for my absence when you see them again farewellfarewell my beloved father i scarcely know what i have writtenmy brain is on firemy heart is ready to burstmy eyes are dimmed with tears the servant watched the countenance of her master with evident interest and curiosity as he perused this note did miss rosamond appear much excited he asked in a tremulous tone and without raising his eyes from the letter which he held in his hand she was crying very much sir responded the servant and it made me quite sad to see her i attempted to comfort her but she only shook her head impatiently and then sobbed as if her heart would break i knew that she was going to leave because she had a small package in her hand and she did cry so dreadful when she told me to give you this note mr torrens turned aside and hastened to his chamber where he remained until halfpast five oclock he then descended to the parlour dressed for the nuptial ceremony to the servants enquiry relative to the serving up of the dinner he replied that he had no appetite and immediately gave orders for the horse and gig to be got ready by a stableboy who had been hastily hired in the morning to take the place of jeffreys until a more efficient substitute could be found this command was soon obeyed and shortly before seven oclock mr torrens arrived in old burlington street the flight of his daughter from home had proved a more severe shock to him than the reader might imagine considering the cold and heartless disposition of this man it was not that he felt he should miss her societynohe did not love her enough to harbour a regret of that naturebut her departure from the paternal dwelling had made him writhe beneath the maddeningthe galling conviction that his independence was in a measure gone and that a stern necessity had compelled him to assent to link his fate with that of a woman so vile and abandoned that his own child fled at the idea of her approach influenced by such feelings as these it was no easy task for mr torrens to assume a complacent demeanour suitable to the occasion of his nuptials he nevertheless managed to conceal the emotions which wrung him so acutely and played his part with tolerable satisfaction to mrs slingsby as she introduced him to dr wagtail and the other guests including a clergyman who were already assembled at her house the ceremony was performed by the reverend gentleman just alluded to dr wagtail giving the bride away a splendid banquet was then served up and shortly after ten oclock mr and mrs torrens departed together for the cottage chapter lxxxiii the reward of crime at halfpast eleven on the following morning mr torrens entered the office of mr howard the solicitor his countenance wore a smile of satisfaction in spite of the various events which had lately occurred to harass him for he was about to receive a large sum of moneyand his fingers itched to grasp the banknotes and the gold which he had seen stowed away in the safe on the preceding day he already beheld his debts paidhis mind freed from pecuniary anxietiesand his speculations prospering in a manner giving assurance of the realization of a splendid fortune and these pleasing visions with which his imagination had cheered itself during the drive from the cottage to the attorneys office naturally tended to bestow on his countenance the expansiveness of good humour and after all it is a pleasant thing to enter a place where one is about to receive a good round sum of money even though the amount will not remain long in pocket but must be paid away almost as soon as fingered mr torrens had never felt more independent than he did on this occasion and the look which he bestowed upon a poor beggarwoman with a child in her arms as he ascended the steps leading to the frontdoor of mr howards abode was one of supreme contemptas if a pauper were indeed a despicable object wellmr torrens entered the office with a smiling countenancebut he was immediately struck by the strange aspect of things which there presented itself the place was in confusion the clerks were gathered together in a group near the window looking particularly gloomy and conversing in whispersseveral gentlemen were busily employed in examining the japanned boxes which bore their names and contained their titledeedsand two or three females were weeping in a corner and exchanging such dimly significant observations asoh the rascalthe villainto rob us poor creatures mr torrens recoiled aghast and speechless from the contemplation of this alarming scene a chill struck to his heart and in common parlance any one might have knocked him down with a straw good heavens gentlemen he exclaimed at length recovering the use of his tongue what is the meaning of this ask those youngsters there sir said one of the individuals engaged in examining the tinboxes and the speaker pointed towards the clerks in a manner which seemed to imply that the news were too shocking for him to unfold and that it was moreover the duty of the lawyers subordinates to give the required information well gentlemen what is the matter demanded mr torrens turning to the clerks has any thing sudden happened to mr howard oh very sudden indeed sir was the answer vouchsafed by one of the persons thus appealed to and accompanied by a sinister grin is he dead enquired mr torrens his excitement now becoming absolutely intolerable no sirhe isnt dead exactlybut but what cried torrens trembling from head to foot hes bolted sir was the astounding answer absconded murmured mr torrens faintlyand reeling like a drunken man he would have fallen had he not come in contact with the wall yesit was indeed too true mr howardthe cold phlegmatic matteroffact businesslike lawyerhad decamped no one knew whither though numbers had to mourn or curse his flight are you ill sir enquired one of the clerks at the expiration of a few moments for mr torrens was leaning against the side of the room his countenance pale as death his eyes rolling wildly in their sockets and his limbs trembling convulsively nonoi shall be better in a minute groaned the unhappy man but this blowis cruelindeed he gasped in a choking voice two thousand poundsruinruin ah theres many wholl be ruined by this smash sir said the clerk youre not the only oneand thats a consolation a consolation indeed it was none for mr torrens who saw himself ruined beyond all hope of redemptionruined in spite of the immense sacrifices he had made to avert the impending stormthe sacrifice of his daughters innocence to sir henry courtenay and the sacrifice of himself to an abandoned and profligate woman miserablemiserable man what hast thou earned by all thine intriguingsthy schemingsthy black turpitudeand thy deplorable selfdegradation oh betterbetter far is it to become the grovelling whining beggar in the streets than to risk happinesscharacternamehonourall on such chances as those on which thou didst reckon and now behold him issue forth from that office into which he had entered with head erect selfsufficient air and smiling countenancebehold him issue forthbent downcrushedovercometen years more aged than he was a few minutes previouslyand an object of pity even for that poor beggarwoman whom ere now he had treated with such sovereign contempt miserablemiserable man has not thy punishment commenced in this worldis there not a hell upon earthand is not thy heart already a prey to devouring flames and thy tongue parched with the insatiate thirst of burning fever and thy soul tortured by the undying worm oh how canst thou return to thy house in the vicinity of which lies interred a corpse the discovery of which may at any time involve thee in serious perilhow canst thou go back to that dwelling whence thine injured daughter has fled and over the threshold of which thou hast conducted a vile strumpet as thy bride when we consider how fearfully we are madehow manifold are the chances that extreme griefsudden ruinand overwhelming anguish may cause a vessel in the surcharged heart to burst or the racked brain to become a prey to the thunderclap of apoplexyit is surprisingit is truly wondrous that man can support such an enormous weight of care without being stricken dead when it falls upon him and yet to what a degree of tension may the fibres of the heart be wrung ere they will snap asunderand what myriads of weighty and maddening thoughts may agitate in the brain ere reason will rock on its throne or a vein burst with the gush of blood in the meantime occurrences of importance were taking place at torrens cottage mrs torrenslate mrs slingsbywas whiling away an hour in unpacking her boxes and disposing of her effects in the wardrobe and cupboards of her bedchamber congratulating herself all the time on the success which her various schemes had experienced she had obtained a husband to save her from disgrace and that husband had set out to receive as she fancied a considerable sum of money which would relieve him of his difficulties and enable him to pursue his undertakings in such a manner as to yield ample revenues for the future she was moreover rejoiced that rosamond had quitted the housefor shameless as this vile woman was she could not have failed to be embarrassed and constrained in her new dwelling had that injured girl met her there while mrs torrens was thus engaged with her domestic avocations and her selfgratulatory thoughts in her bedchamber the stableboy who had been hired on the preceding day was occupying himself in the garden well what do you think of your new missus he said to the maidservant who had just been filling a stonepitcher at the pump in the yard she seems a decent body enow was the reply but i havent seen much of her yet what are you doing there harry why you must know that im rather a good hand at gardening answered the lad desisting from his occupation of digging a hole in the ground and resting on his spade and im going to move that young tree to this spot herebecause its all in the shade where it stands now and will never come to no good illustration ah thats one of the young trees that jeffreys plantedhim who went away so suddenly yesterday morning and which made me come and fetch you to help us here observed the maid but comego on with your work she added laughing and let me see whether you really know how to handle a spade wellyou shall see returned the boy and he fell to work again with the more alacrity because a pretty girl was watching his progress but ill tell you fairly he said after a few minutes pause in the conversation this digging here is no proof of what i can do because the ground is quite softand the more i dig the surer i am that the earth has been turned up here very lately that i am certain it has not exclaimed the maidservant but i say that it has though persisted harry look herehow easy it is to dig out do you think i dont know you fancy yourself very clever my boy said the femaledomestic laughing but youre wrong for once we had no manservant here before jeffreys comeand he never dug there i declare now i just tell you what ill do for the fun of the thing cried the lad ill dig out all the earth as far down as it has been dug out beforebecause i can now see that a hole has been dug here he added emphatically youre an obstinate fellow to stand out so said the maid but ill come back in five minutes and see how you get on the goodnatured servant hastened into the kitchen with the pitcher of water in her hand and the lad continued his delving occupation in such thorough earnest that the perspiration poured down his forehead by the time the maidservant returned to the spot where he was digging he had thrown out a great quantity of earth and had already made a hole at least three feet deep still hard at work she said why you have made a place deep enough to bury that little sapling in and what a curious shape the hole is to be sure just for all the world like as if it was dug to put a dead body in i wish you wouldnt go on digging in that way harryi shall dream of nothing but graves a cry of horror bursting from the lips of the boy interrupted the maidservants goodnatured loquacity what is it harry she demanded peeping timidly into the hole from which the boy hastily scrambled out you talk of dead bodies he cried shuddering from head to foot and with a countenance ashy palebut look therea human hand the maid shrieked and darted back into the kitchen uttering ejaculations of horror mrs torrens heard those sounds of alarm and hastily descended the stairs oh missus cried the boy whom she encountered in the passage leading from the hall to the back door of the house such a horrible sightoh missus what shall we dowhat will become of us speakexplain yourself said mrs torrens amazed and frightened at the strange agitation and convulsed appearance of the boy oh missus he repeated his eyes rolling wildly and his countenance denoting indescribable terror in that hole therea dead bodya mans hand merciful heavens shrieked mrs torrens now becoming dreadfully agitated in her turnfor rapid as lightningflash did the thought strike her that the corpse of sir henry courtenay was discovered yes missustis a mans hand peeping out of the earth continued the lad and im afraid i hacked it with the shovelbut im sure i didnt mean to do no such a thing the newlymarried lady staggered as these frightful words fell upon her earsand a film spread over her eyes but a sudden and peremptory knock at the frontdoor recalled her to herself and she ordered the trembling maid who was now standing at the kitchen entrance to hasten and answer the summons the moment the frontdoor was opened two stout men shabbygenteel in appearance and smelling uncommonly of ginandpeppermint walked unceremoniously into the hall is mrs torrens at home my dear said one who carried an ashstick in his hand cos if she is youll please to tell her that two genelmen is a waiting to say a word to her what name demanded the servantmaid by no means well pleased at the familiar tone in which she was addressed oh what name repeated the selfstyled gentleman with the ashstick wellyou may say mr brown and mr thompson my dear i am mrs torrens gentlemen said that lady who having overheard the preceding dialogue now came forward and i suppose that you are the persons sent by the auctioneer about the sale of my furniture in old burlington street wellnot exactly that neither maam returned the individual with the ashstick the fact is were officers officers shrieked the miserable woman an appalling change coming over her yesand weve got a warrant agin you for forgery maam added the bow street runner who was no other than the readers old acquaintance mr dykes mrs torrens uttered a dreadful scream and fell senseless on the floor come young ooman bustle about and get your missus some water and vinegar and so on exclaimed dykes here bingham my boy lend a helping hand and well take the poor creatur into the parlour the two officers accordingly raised the insensible woman and carried her into the adjacent room where they deposited her on the sofathat sofa which had proved the deathbed of her paramour in the meantime the servantmaid though almost bewildered by the dreadful occurrences of the morning hastened to procure the necessary articles to aid in the recovery of her mistress and in a few minutes mrs torrens opened her eyes gazing wildly around her she exclaimed where am ithen encountering the sinister looks of the two runners she again uttered a piercing scream and clasping her hands together murmured my god my god for a full sense of all the tremendous horror of her situation burst upon her and there was a world of mental anguish in those ejaculations shes a fine ooman whispered dykes to his friend while the goodnatured servant endeavoured to console her mistress yes she be replied bingham what a pity tis that shes sure to be scragged so it is added mr dykes and now you stay here old chapwhile i just make a search about the place to see if i can find any of the blunt raised by the forgery thus speaking the officer quitted the room oh maam pray dont take on so said the goodnatured servantmaid endeavouring to console her mistress it must be some mistakei know it isyou never could have done what they say i wish master would come homehed soon put em out of the place my god my god what will become of me murmured mrs torrens pressing her hand to her forehead oh what shall i do what will the world say just heavens this is terribleterrible at that moment the parlour door was opened violently and mr dykes made his appearance dragging in the lad harry who was straggling to get away and blubbering as if his heart were ready to break hold your tongue you damned young fool cried dykes giving him a good shake which only made him bawl out the more lustily no one aint a going to do you no harmbut we must keep you as a witness bless the boyi dont suppose you had any hand in the murder these last words brought back to the mind of mrs torrens the dread discovery which had ere now been made in the garden and the remembrance of which had been chased away by the appalling peril that had suddenly overtaken her but at the observation of the bow street runner to the boy she uttered a faint hysterical scream and fell back in a state of semistupefaction murder did you say old fellow demanded bingham yessummut in that way returned dykes at all events theres a man with his throat cut from ear to ear lying at the bottom of a hole in the garden you dont mean to say he was left all uncovered like that exclaimed bingham nono answered dykes them as did for him buried him safe enough and it seems that this boy has been adigging there and comes to a hand sticking out of the ground so hes too much afeared to go down any farther but i deuced soon shovelled out the earthand behold ye there lies the dreadfullest spectacle you ever see bingham in all your life but it wont do to waste time in talking here you cut over to streatham and get a couple of constablescos theres plenty of work for us all in this house it seems bingham departed to execute the commission thus confided to him and dykes remained behind in charge of the premises it would be impossible to describe the wretchedness of the scene which was now taking place in the parlour the lad harry was crying in one corner despite the assurances which dykes had given himthe maidservant horrified and alarmed at all the incidents which had occurred within the last quarter of an hour was anxious to depart from a house which circumstances now rendered terrible but she could not make up her mind to leave mrs torrens who was in a most deplorable conditionfor the unhappy woman lay gasping for breath and moaning piteously on the sofaher countenance distorted with the dreadful workings of her agitated soul and her eyes fixed and glassy beneath their halfclosed lids dykes accosted the boy and was beginning to put some questions to him with a view to ascertain when it was likely that mr torrens would return when that gentleman suddenly drove up to the door in his gig now my lad said dykes go and open the door and mind and dont utter a word about what has taken place here this morning the boy hastened to admit mr torrens who passed him by without even appearing to notice his presence and proceeded straight to the parlour in a mechanical kind of manner which showed how deeply his thoughts were occupied with some allabsorbing subject but the moment the ruined wretched man opened the door he shrank back from the scene which offered itself to his view for the condition of his wife and the presence of so suspicionslooking a person as mr dykes told the entire tale at oncethe forgery had been discovered oh master exclaimed the servantmaid i am so glad youre come backfor your poor dear lady yes masterand that dreadful sight in the garden interrupted the boy whimpering againthe murdered man in the hole mr torrens staggeredreeledand would have fallen had not dykes caught him by the arm saying sit down sirand compose yourself im very sorry that i should have been the cause of unsettling your good lady so sir but im obleeged to do my dooty and as for tother business in the gardeni spose i presume you are an officer cried mr torrens suddenly recovering his presence of mind as if he had called some desperate resolution to his aid thats just what i am sir answered dykes and you have come here toto to arrest mrs slingsby that wasmrs torrings that isfor forgery was my business in the first instance continued dykes and now its grown more serious cos of a orkard discovery made in the garden what demanded torrens with strange abruptness but he was a prey to the most frightful suspense and was anxious to learn at once whether any suspicion attached itself to him relative to that discovery the nature of which he could full well understand the dead bodythe murdered gentleman master exclaimed the lad harry throwing terrified glances around him i do not understand you said mr torrens in a hoarsehollow tone what do you mean all this is quite strangeand therefore the more alarming to me but the ghastly pallor and dreadful workings of his countenance instantly confirmed in the mind of dykes the suspicion he had already entertainednamely that mr torrens was not ignorant of the shocking deed now brought to light and the officer accordingly had but one course to pursue mr torrens sir he said the less you talk on this here business perhaps the better cos every word thats uttered here must be repeated again elsewhere and it will be my dooty to take you afore a magistrate take me ejaculated the wretched man and his eyes were fixed in horrified amazement on the officer im sorry to say i must do so answered dykes marthamartha ejaculated torrens starting from the seat in which the officer had just now deposited him and speaking in such wild unearthly tones that those who heard him thought he had suddenly gone raving mad why do you lie moaning there get upand face the danger bravelybravely ah ah here is a fine ending to all our glorious schemesand he laughed frantically howard has run awayabscondedgone i tell you yesgone with the two thousand pounds but i did not murder sir henry courtenay he continued abruptly reverting to the most horrible of all the frightful subjects which racked his brain noit was not i who murdered himyou know it was not martha and he sank back exhausted and fainting in the seat from which he had risen sir henry courtenay cried dykes wellthis is strange for its on account of forging his name that the lady is arrestedand notice of his disappearance was given at our office this morning late that evening the entire metropolis was thrown into amazement by the report that a gentleman named torrens who had hitherto borne an excellent character and was much respected by all his friends and acquaintances had been committed to newgate on a charge of murder the victim being sir henry courtenay baronet and this rumour was coupled with the intelligence that the prisoners wife to whom he had only been married on the previous day and who was so well known in the religions and philanthropic circles by the name of slingsby had been consigned to the same gaol on a charge of forgery chapter lxxxiv old deaths party while these rumours were circulating throughout the metropolis old death was preparing for the reception of visitors at his abode in horsemonger lane the aged miscreant assisted by the old woman who acted as his housekeeper arranged bottles glasses pipes and tobacco on the tablemade up a good fire so that the kettle might boil by the time the guests should arriveand carefully secured the shutters of the window in order to prevent the sounds of joviality from penetrating beyond that room when these preparations were completed the old woman was despatched to the nearest cooksshop to procure a quantity of cold meat for the supper and shortly after her return with the provender the visitors made their appearancearriving singly at short intervals the housekeeper was dismissed to her own room and the four men having seated themselves at the table began to mix their grog according to their taste i spose youve heard the news mr bones said jeffreys about your late master and his wifeeh asked old death just so theyre in a pretty pickleaint they exclaimed jeffreys with a chuckle we little thought last night when we was a talking over the whole business and dividing the swag that the corpse would so soon turn up again but i say he added now breaking out into a horrible laugh and turning towards tim the snammer and josh pedler it was rather curious though that i should have had a hand in burying that there feller which you made away with and still more curious replied tim that we should have done for a stranger while the master of the house hisself escaped altogether but tis no use talking of that there now i wish it hadnt happened it was however done in a hurry never mind the little windpipeslitting affair said josh pedler impatiently we got the swagold death here smashed the screensand thats all we ought to think of twelve hundred between us wasnt such a bad nights workalthough it did lead us to do a thing we never did afore and now my late master is certain sure to be scragged for it exclaimed jeffreys for no one could believe such a tale as he must tell in his defence wellim not sorry for him he is a harsh reserved sullen kind of a chap but theres one thing im precious sorry for whats that demanded old death whyhe promised me fifty pounds to be paid this evening at seven oclock answered jeffreys on condition that id leave his service at an instants notice and the blunt isnt of course forthcoming never mind thatdont make yourself uneasy my boy said old death with a significant chuckle youve got plenty of money for the present and the business which weve met to talk about will put ever so much more into your pocket welllets to business then exclaimed jeffreys the fact is i shant go out to service no more for since im reglarly in with you fellers now i shall stick to you and i can always find you employment lads observed old death comehelp yourselves we shall get on so much more comfortable when were a little warmed with good liquor the cunning old file exclaimed tim the snammer laughing and winking at his comrade josh pedler he wants to make us half lushy so as to get us to undertake anythink no matter how desperate on his own terms pon my word tim said old death affecting a pleasant chuckle which however sounded like the echo of a deeptoned voice in a cavern you are too hard upon me i dont mean any such thing ill treat you liberally whatever you do for me and so you ought old boy returned tim splint for you know how i suffered by youand how cursed shabby you behaved towards me we agreed yesterday to let bygones be bygones said benjamin bones somewhat sternly do you mean to keep to that arrangement or am i to consider that you still bear me a grudge nono cried tim what i said was only in fun so tip us your hand old boy there now well each brew another glassand you shall explain your business while we blow a cloud the fresh supplies of grog were duly mixed jeffreys josh pedler and tim splint lighted their pipesand old death addressed them in the following manner there is a man in london who has done me a most serious injuryan injury so great that i can never cease to feel its consequences as long as i live in a word continued old death his features becoming absolutely hideous with the workings of evil passions he discovered my secret storeshe destroyed all the treasures the valuables and the possessions which i had been years and years in accumulating destroyed them cried tim splint stole them you mean nodestroyed themwantonly destroyed themdestroyed them allall yelled forth old death his usually sepulchral voice becoming thrilling and penetrating with hyenalike rage the miscreantthe fiend allall was destroyed thousands and thousands of pounds worth of valuables wantonlywilfullymethodically destroyed i did not see the work of ruin but i know that it must have taken placebecause the man of whom i speak is what the world calls honourable perdition take such honour but of what use was all that property to you since you didnt convert it into money demanded josh pedler of what use cried old death again speaking in that yelling tone which manifested violent emotions is there no use in keeping precious things to look atto gloat uponto calculate their value to be sureto be sure there is he continued with a horrible chuckle but of that no matter it is sufficient for you to know that i was deprived in one hourin one minute as you may sayof that property which had been accumulating for years and the house too which was mine so longwhich i had purchased on account of its convenienceseven those premises this man of whom i speak made me sell him but i swore to have vengeance on himi told him so when we partedand i will keep my word who is this person that you speak of asked tim the snammer the earl of ellingham was the reply he is a great and a powerful nobleman i suppose observed tim it will be difficult and dangerous to do him any harm whats a nobleman more than another cried john jeffreys i for one will undertake any thing that our friend mr bones may propose and so will iif were well paid added josh pedler but theres one thing i must mention while i think on it dont none of you ever speak about that affair down at torringss you knowthe cutthroat business i meanbefore my blowen matilda i like to have a little comfort at home and a womans tongue is the devil when its set a wagging in the blowingup way well mind our ps and qs before tilda said tim the snammer it isnt likely that any of us would be such fools as to talk of that business to women or to others besides ourselves but let mr bones continue his explanations i have told you enough resumed old death to convince you that this earl of ellingham deserves no mercy at my hands and if i say that i will give each of you a hundred poundsyes a hundred pounds eachto do my bidding in all things calculated to accomplish my vengeance on that manif i make you this promise i suppose you will not refuse to enlist yourselves in my employ but mark you he added hastily and with a sinister knitting of the brows before you give me your answer bear in mind that my vengeance is to be terribleterrible in the extreme you mean to have the earl murdered i suppose said john jeffreys murderedkillednono exclaimed old death that would be a vengeance little calculated to appease me he must live to knowto feel that i am avenged added the malignant old villain he must experience such outragessuch insultssuch ignominythat he may writhe and smart under them like a worm under the teeth of the harrow he must be made aware whence the blow comesby whose order it is dealtand wherefore it is levelled against him will you then for one week devote yourselves to my service if you agree i will at once give you an earnest of the sums promised as your recompense if you refuse there is an end of the matterand i must look out elsewhere but you havent told us what we are to do to earn our reward said josh pedler there is no murder in the case observed old death emphatically then i for one consent without another minutes hesitation exclaimed josh pedler and me too said tim the snammer and im sure im not going to hang back cried john jeffreys good continued benjamin bones though youve all got plenty of money in your pockets theres no harm in having more i will give you each thirty pounds on account of the business i have now in hand he added taking his greasy pocketbook from the bosom of his old grey coat the specified amount was handed over to each of the three villains who received the banknotes with immense satisfaction three or four more things like torringss and this observed tim the snammer and we shall be able to set up in business as genelmen for the rest of our lives now listen to me resumed old death his countenance expressing an infernal triumph as if his vengeance were already more than half consummated in the first place i must tell you that im going to move tomorrow morning up to bunces house in earl street seven dials and tomorrow night must you perform the first duty i require of you and whats that demanded josh pedler you know that a few weeks ago a certain person named thomas rainford was hanged at horsemonger lane gaol proceeded old death glancing rapidly around from beneath his shaggy overhanging brows the very prince of highwaymena glorious fellowa man that i could have loved exclaimed josh pedler in a tone the enthusiasm of which denoted his hearts sincerity wellwell said old death impatiently but hes put out of the waydeadand goneand its no use regretting him i suppose he added that if you saw tom rains body here you wouldnt mind spitting in the face of the corpse or treating it with any other kind of indignity if you was well rewarded for your pains whymy respect for the man while he was living wouldnt make me such a fool to my own interests as to refuse to do what you say now that hes dead answered josh pedler besides a dead bodys a lump of clay or earthor whatever else you may choose to call it at all events it cant feel any thing thats done to it but what in the world has made you touch on such a queer subject because it is with tom rains body that you will have to come in contact tomorrow night responded old death in a low sepulchral voice and now fixing his eyes as it were on all the three at the same time and those three men started with astonishment at this extraordinary and incomprehensible announcement yes proceeded benjamin bones it is just as i tell youfor the late thomas rainford was the elder brother of the earl of ellingham and was legitimately born this declaration excited fresh surprise on the part of the three men to whom it was addressed and therefore continued the aged miscreant his countenance contracting with savage wrinkles it must be by the desecration of the corpse of tom rain that the earl will be alike exposed to the whole world and goaded to desperation by the insult offered to the remains of his brother now do you begin to understand me no well then i will explain myself more fully it is known that the earl demanded of the sheriff the corpse of the highwaymanthat his request was complied withand that the body was interred privately in consecrated ground i set people to make enquiries and it was only this morningthis very morningi learnt that a coffin with the name of thomas rainford on the plate was buried in saint lukes churchyard this intelligence my friend tidmarsh gleaned from the sexton of that church tomorrow night added old death it is for you three to have up that coffin and convey it to the bunces house in earl street seven dials do you want us to turn resurrectionists demanded josh pedler in unfeigned surprise i wish you to do what i direct and what i am going to pay you well for answered benjamin bones if you refuse give me back my money and ill find others who will be less particular oh i dont want to fly from the bargain said josh only youll allow me the right of being astonished if i chooseor rather if i cant help it as for the resurrection part of the business id have up all the coffins in saint lukes churchyard on the same terms i thought you were not the man to retreat from a bargain observed old death wellwhen you have brought the coffin to earl street well take out the body put a rope round its neck and a placard on its breast and that placard shall tell all the world that it is the corpse of thomas rainford the famous highwayman who was executed at horsemonger lane gaol and who was the rightful earl of ellingham this being done it will be for you to convey the body to pall mall just before daybreak and place it on the steps of the hated noblemans mansion there will be danger and difficulty in performing that part of the task said tim the snammer not at all exclaimed old death a light spring cart will speedily convey the burthen to pall mall and it will be but the work of a few moments to achieve the rest besides at that hour in the morning there is no one abroad all this can be managed easy enough observed jeffreys i dont flinch for one is that every thing we shall have to do nono replied ben bones with a grim smile i cant quite give three hundred pounds for one nights work but since we are on the subject i may as well explain to you what else i require in order to render my vengeance complete the three men replenished their glasses and their pipes and old death then proceeded to address them in the following manner from certain information which i have received i am confident that the earl of ellingham experiences a great friendship towards esther de medina who was i am pretty certain rainfords mistress it must be remembered that benjamin bones knew nothing of those incidents which have revealed to the reader the existence of tamarher beautiful sisters counterpart this esther de medina is now in london having been absent for a short time with her father another important point is that the newspapers some weeks ago announced the intended marriage of the earl of ellingham and lady hatfield we are therefore aware of these two factsthat the earl is attached to esther de medina as a friend and to lady hatfield as her future husband it may also be proper to remind the reader that as old death knew nothing more of the position in which the nobleman and georgiana stood with regard to each other than what he had gleaned from the fashionable intelligence in the public printsso he was completely ignorant of all the circumstances which had tended to break off the alliance thus announced now resumed the malignant old fiend his eyes glistening with demoniac spite as he glanced rapidly from josh pedler to tim the snammer and from tim the snammer to john jeffreysnow it is my intention to wound the heart of that hated earlthat detested nobleman through the medium of his best affections yesby torturing those ladies i shall torture him by subjecting them to frightful inflictions i shall punish him with awful severity for tomorrow night my good friends your occupation is chalked out for the night after the task will be to inveigle esther de medina to the house in earl street and on the night after that lady hatfield must also be enticed thither how these points are to be accomplished i will tell you when the time for action comes and what do you mean to do with the two ladies when you get them there demanded tim the snammer what will i do to them repeated old death his features animated with a malignity so horribleso reptilelike that he was at the moment a spectacle hideous to contemplate what will i do to them i will tell them all i have enduredall i have suffered at the hands of the hatedthe abhorred earl of ellinghamand you three will be at hand to hold them tightto bind themto gag themso that i with a wire heated red may what demanded jeffreys impatiently blind them returned old death sinking his voice to a whisper which sounded hollow and sepulchral the three villainsvillains as they werestarted at the frightful intention thus announced to them yesi will put out their beautiful eyes said benjamin bones clenching his fists with feverish excitement then i will leave them bound hand and foot in the house and will send a letter to the earl to tell him where he may seek for them will not such vengeance as this be sweet did you ever hear of a vengeance more complete the earl i leave unhurt save in mindand there he will be cruelly lacerated but he must have his eyes to see that those whom he loves are blindhe must be spared his powers of vision that he may read in the newspapers the account of those indignities which will have been shown to the corpse of his elder brother and as he feasted his imagination with these projects of diabolical vengeance the horrible old man chuckled in his usual styleas if it were a corpse that so chuckled the three miscreants whom he had taken into his service expressed their readiness to assist him in all his nefarious plans for the reward he had promised them was great and the earnest they had received was most exhilirating to their evil spirits the infernal project having been fully discussed and it having been agreed that tidmarsh should proceed with one of the three villains in the morning to saint lukes churchyard to point out the precise spot where the coffin bearing the name of thomas rainford had been interredall preliminaries in a word having been thus settled the old housekeeper was summoned to place the supper upon the table the meal was done hearty justice to and when the things were cleared away old death who was anxious to conciliate his friends as much as possible by a show of liberality commissioned john jeffreys to compound a mighty jorum of punch the ingredients for which were bountifully supplied from the cupboard the washhand basin serving as a bowl and now the four villainsfour villains as hardened and as ready for mischief as any to be found in all londondismissed from their minds every matter of business and set to work to do justice to the punch comewholl sing us a song exclaimed tim the snammer dont let us have any singing my dear friend said old death we shall alarm the neighboursand its better to be as quiet as possible well we must do something to amuse ourselves insisted timothy splint if we get talking it will only be on things of which we all have quite enough in our minds and so i vote that some one tells us a story im very fond of storiesparticklerly when theyre true ill tell you a true story if you like said jeffreys for i dont mind about smoking any more in fact ill give you my own historyand a precious curious one it is too do said josh pedler but mind and dont introduce no lies into itthats all every word is as true as gospel observed jeffreys the glasses were replenishedold death snuffed the candles with his withered trembling handand jeffreys then commenced his narrative which as in former instances we have modelled into a readable shape footnote changed the notes chapter lxxxv the history of a liveryservant my parents were very poor but very honest and i was their only child my father was a light porter in a warehouse earning fifteen shillings a week and my mother took in washing to obtain a few shillings more we lived in a court leading out of high holborn and occupied one room which was very decently furnished for people in my parents condition of life the things moreover being all their own my father had a good suit of clothes and my mother a nice gown bonnet and shawl for sundays and holidays and they also took care to keep me neat and decent in my dress neither of them ever went to the publichouse except just to fetch the beer for dinner and supper and they were always regular in their attendance at church in addition to all these proofs of good conduct and respectability they put by two or three shillings aweek as a provision against a rainy day and you may be sure that to be able to do this they lived very economically indeed in fact a more industrious couple did not exist than my father and mother and you will admit that they deserved to succeed in the world this much i have heard from people who knew them for they died when i was too young to be able to understand their ways or judge of their merits it seems that my mother was a very pretty young woman she had been a servant in the family of the merchant in whose warehouse my father was and an attachment springing up between them they married the merchant whose name was shawe had a sona dissipated young man addicted to gaming and bad company and consequently a source of great uneasiness to his parents who were highly respectable people during the time that my mother was in service at the merchants frederick shawe was on the continent his father having sent him to a commercial establishment at rotterdam in the hope that he would amend his ways when under the care of comparative strangers but this hope it appears was completely disappointed and the young man was after all sent back to his fathers house as irreclaimable at this time my parents had been married three years and i was two years old my mother was in the habit of taking my fathers dinner to him at the warehouse whenever his duties prevented him from running home to get it and on one of these occasions frederick shawe saw her as she was going out of the establishment he followed her made insulting proposals and behaved most grossly she had me with her and this circumstance rendered his conduct the more abominable if any thing was wanting to aggravate it indeed his persecution was carried to such an excess that she was obliged to take refuge in a shop where she went into hysterics through fright and indignation shawe sneaked away the moment he found that the master of the shop was disposed to take my mothers part against him and when she was a little recovered she was sent home in a hackneycoach on the return of my father in the evening she told him all that had occurred and it seems that she had scarcely made an end of her narrative when frederick shawe entered the room he declared that he had come to express his sincere penitence for what he had done and to implore that his father might not be made acquainted with his behaviour he seemed so earnest and so excessively sorry for his infamous conduct that my parents consented to look over it he thanked them over and over again and took his departure my father however desired his wife never to come to the warehouse to him any more as he was unwilling to expose her to even the chance of a repetition of the insult a few weeks after this occurrence frederick shawe one evening when under the influence of liquor called at our lodgings my father being absent and renewed his outrageous conduct towards my mother an alarm was created in the dwellinga constable was sent forand the young gentleman was taken off to the watchhouse of course the matter was now too serious to be hushed up and the elder mr shawe necessarily learnt all the particulars his son was fined and held to bail to keep the peace towards mrs jeffreys and my father obtained another situationfor though the old merchant knew that his son was alone to blame yet my father thought that he could not prudently remain in a place where he must daily meet a person who he felt convinced was now his sworn enemy and such indeed did frederick shawe prove to be for by misrepresentations and heaven only knows what other underhand means he so successfully avenged himself that my poor father soon lost his new situation and was totally unable to find another the most infamous reports were circulated concerning him and he took the cruel treatment he had received so much to heart that his spirit was completely brokenhe fell ill and died in a few weeks poverty and despair thus seized upon my mother at the same moment she saw all her happiness suddenly blasted by the agency of a reckless villain and to add to her afflictions the only friend who showed any compassion for her or who came forward to assist her in the midst of her wretchednessnamely the old merchantwas suddenly snatched away by the hand of death ten days after the earth had closed over my fathers remains the poor woman was unable to bear up against her sorrows she languished for a few months and then departed this life leaving me a friendless and unprotected orphan at the tender age of three years you may guess what then became of me i was taken to the workhouse i have sketched these circumstances just to show you how unfortunate i was in my earliest infancy my parents would have lived to thrive and prosper had it not been for the miscreant frederick shawe and under their protection i should have been happy however it was destined that my father and mother should be cut off thus early and their cruel fate threw me as a pauperchild upon the parish at the workhouse i remained until i was thirteen and it was from an elderly couple whom distress brought to the same place and who had known my parents well that i learnt all the particulars which i have related to you well at the age of thirteen i was transferred to the care of a surgeon and accoucheur who took me into his house to clean the boots and shoes run on errands and beat up drugs in the mortar finding me active and as he said a goodlooking ladfor i was not then seared with the smallpox as i am nowhe put me into the regular livery of a doctors boy after i had been with him a few months and i was then entrusted with the delivery of the medicine my master was an old man and his wife was a bustling active elderly lady in whom implicit confidence might be placed as long as she was well paid for her services and her secresy you will understand what i mean very shortly in fact one day i noticed a great deal of whispering between the doctor his wife and the housekeeper and their looks were mysterious and important certain preparations too commenced which showed me that a visitor was expected for i was a shrewd and observing boy for my age i was ordered to clean the windows in the spare bedroom and the wellfurnished little parlour communicating with it and while i was thus occupied the housekeeper put the two apartments into the nicest possible order i asked her if any one was coming to stay at the house and was desired to mind my own business i accordingly held my tongue but my curiosity was only the more excited in consequence of the answer i received and the mystery in which the motive of the preparations in progress was involved at an earlier hour than usual i was ordered to retire to my own room but as it commanded a view of the streetit was brook street holborni sate up watching at my windowfor i felt sure that i had not been dismissed to my attic without some good reason nor was i mistaken at about halfpast ten a hackneycoach drove up to the door two trunks were carried into the house and a lady muffled in a cloak was assisted to descend from the vehicle by the doctor and his wife who seemed to treat her with the greatest respect i was able to notice all that passed because the moon was bright and i was looking out of the open window the lady accompanied the doctor and his wife indoors and the coach drove away next morning i saw the housekeeper take up a breakfasttray to those rooms which i had now no doubt were occupied by the lady who had arrived the night before but i was cautious not to appear even to notice that any thing unusual was going on much less to ask questionsfor i remembered the rebuff i had already received in this latter respect the cook and housemaid were as mysteriously reserved as the housekeeper herself and i could not for the life of me make out what it all meant to be brief a month passed away and though i never saw the tenant of the sparerooms all the while yet i knew that a tenant those rooms had for the meals were regularly taken upthe doctor looked in there two or three times a dayand his wife passed hours together there at length the housemaid who was a pretty wickedlooking girl of about nineteen undertook to initiate me into the secret which so much puzzled me and taking advantage of a sunday evening when she and i were alone together the other servants having gone out she explained how some young lady who was not married was about to become a motherand how the sparerooms were always kept for lodgers of that kindhave you seen her i askedno she replied nor am i likely to see her i have been four years in this house and during that time there have been eight or ten ladies here in the same way but i never caught a glimpse of the face of any one of them they pay or their friends pay for them a good round sum to master for the accommodation and that is the manner in which he has made so much money for you can see that his regular practice is not very great but you must not tell any body that i have been talking to you in this style john or else i shall lose my placei promised her not to betray herhow old are you john she askedgoing on for fourteen i saidyou are a pretty boy she continued would you like to give me a kissyou would think me very rude i answeredno i shouldnt trybut i should feel so ashamed i saidthen you are a fool john exclaimed the pretty housemaid and she got into a pet which lasted all the rest of the evening i lay awake a long time that night thinking of what i had heard concerning the lady in the private apartments and i cant say how it wasbut i felt an extraordinary longing to catch a glimpse of her the more i reflected on this wish the stronger it grew and at last i determined to gratify it somehow or another having come to this resolution i fell asleep next morning the twopenny postman at eight oclock brought a letter directed to my master but in the corner were two or three initials which i could not quite make out i took it into the parlour where the doctor was seated alone at the time and when he had glanced at the address he said oh it is to go up stairs give it to the housekeeperand he went on reading his newspaper here was an opportunity which presented itself almost as soon as my desire to see the tenant of the sparerooms had been formed and without any hesitation i hurried upstairs i knocked at the door of the parlour communicating with the bedchamber and a sweet voice said come in i accordingly entered the room and beheld a beautiful creature of about seventeen or eighteen dressed in a morning wrapper all open at the bosom and reclining in an armchair she uttered an exclamation of surprise when she saw me and drew the wrapper completely over her breast it was evident that she had expected to see either the housekeeper or my mistress i handed her the note stammered out something about master having told me to bring it up and then retired awkward and embarrassed enough a few minutes afterwards the bell of the sparerooms was rung rather violently and the housekeeper went up she shortly came down again and went into the parlour to which i was presently summoned the doctor and his wife were seated at the breakfasttable looking as gloomy and solemn as possible and the housekeeper was standing in the middle of the room i suspected that a storm was brewing john said the doctor what induced you to take such a liberty as to enter the apartments of a lady who is lodging in my houseplease sir i answered as boldly as possible you told me to take up the letter and i did sothe doctor his wife and the housekeeper looked at each other by turns and then they all three looked very hard at me well said the doctor i suppose it was a misunderstanding on the boys partfor i did not blush nor seem at all confused while they were all staring at mebut you must not tell any one that you saw the lady up stairs john exclaimed my mistressi dont know a soul who would care about knowing such a simple thing maam i replied pretending to be very innocent indeed i was then told to withdraw and thus passed off this little affair illustration throughout that day i saw the pretty housemaid showing great anxiety to speak to me alone but circumstances so occurred that we had not an opportunity of exchanging a word in private together at halfpast nine i went to bed as usual an hour before the other servants and i soon fell asleep but i was awoke by some one shaking me gently and i was also startled by seeing a light in the room in another moment my fears subsided for my visitor was the pretty servantgirl in her nightgear she sate down on the edge of the bed and asked me what i was called into the parlour for in the morning i told her all that had occurred you are a dear boy she said not to have confessed that i had put you up to any thing for that was what i was afraid ofand she gave me two or three hearty kisses then she asked me a great number of questions about the lady i had seenwhat she was likehow oldthe colour of her hair and eyesand all sorts of queries of that kind i replied as well as i could and she seemed vastly to enjoy the idea of my cool impudence in taking up the letter just for the sake of getting a peep at the lady in fact she was so much pleased with me that she kept on kissing me and all this ended just as you might supposefor the pretty housemaid shared my bed during the remainder of the night this occurrence was most unfortunate to us both for we overslept ourselvesand the housekeeper doubtless having vainly searched for us down stairs came up to look after us we were discovered fast asleep in each others arms and a terrible scene ensued the housekeeper alarmed the doctor and his wife with her criesfor i suppose the old lady was quite scandalised though she herself had often chucked me under the chin in a tender manner the result was that the pretty housemaid was packed off without delay and i was stripped of my livery compelled to put on my workhouse clothes again and sent back to the parish officers at the very moment when i was conveyed into the presence of the overseers by the doctor a middleaged lady magnificently dressed was returning to her carriage which waited at the door she immediately recognised the doctor as an acquaintance and he addressed her by the name of mrs beaumont the exchange of a few remarks led the lady to observe that she had applied to the parish officers for a wellconducted genteellooking lad to take the place of a page in her household and as she spoke she eyed me very attentively the doctor informed her that i had been in his service and was a good boy in all respects save oneand he explained to her the indiscretion which had compelled him to part with me adding the lad was no doubt won over by the young woman herself but as my professional success depends on the reputation of my house i could not overlook this occurrencethe lady declared that she entertained great compassion for me and said what a pity it was that such a nice boy should be thrown back on the parish in a word the business ended by her agreeing to take me on trial and before the doctor left me he whispered in my ear you see john that i have not ruined your character as i might have done and therefore you must be a good lad and never mention to any one that you saw the lady who is now lodging at my househe then took his departure and mrs beaumont having arranged with the overseers relative to receiving me into her service desired that i might be sent to her abode in the evening the instructions were obeyed and i entered my new place the first appearances of which pleased me much mrs beaumont was a widowlady of about sixandforty and was still a very handsome woman considering her age her house was in russell square and she lived in an elgant stylekeeping a butler a footman and three female domestics she had a miss stacey residing with her as a companion and this lady was about five or sixandtwentysomewhat stoutand rather goodlooking the moment i entered my new place i was supplied with a pages livery and was informed that i was to consider myself at the orders of the butler i soon found that i had got into very comfortable quarters for the best of provisions were consumed in the kitchen as well as in the parlour and the butler who was fond of a glass of good liquor himself often treated me to some likewise mrs beaumont saw a great deal of company and there were dinnerparties or eveningparties at least three or four times every week i had not been many days in this place before i began to notice that both mrs beaumont and miss stacey treated me with much the same kind of innocent familiarity which the housekeeper at the doctors had shown towards me they would pat me on the cheek or chuck me under the chin and tell me i was nice boy but this they never did before each otheronly when i happened to be alone with either one of them indeed when they were together and i entered the room to answer the bell or for any other purpose connected with my duties they would both appear as indifferent towards me as if they had never shown any other feeling in my behalf of the two i liked miss stacey much the best because she was younger and i felt a strange excitement come over me whenever she began to toy about with me in the way i have described one day when i entered the drawing room where i found her alone at the time she said to me john you are a very nice boy and here is halfaguinea for you to buy what you like only dont let any one know that i gave you the moneycertainly not miss i repliedand now john she continued i want you to answer me a question which i am going to put to you will you tell me the truthi of course declared that i wouldthen tell me she said patting my face and looking full at me with her large blue eyes does mrs beaumont ever play about with you as i dooh never miss i answered immediately and without undergoing the least change of countenanceyou are a good boy john she said and pulling me towards her covered me with kisses a doubleknock at the frontdoor interrupted her amusement which as you may suppose i took in very good part and she hurried me out of the room enjoining me not to tell any one that she played about with me the next day mrs beaumont was rather indisposed and kept her own chamber until the evening when she descended to the drawingroom miss stacey had gone out to a party at a married sisters and the footman being absent likewise it devolved upon me to take up the teatray well john said my mistress are you comfortable in your present placequite thank you maam i repliedyou like it better than the doctors she continued smoothing down my hair and then passing her hand over my faceoh a great deal maambut do you not miss the pretty servantgirl john she asked with a sly look and a half smile why what a naughty boy you must be and at such an age tooit was all the young womans fault maam i said and i hope you do not think any the worse of me for itif i had i should not have taken you into my service john she answered and to show you that i am really attached to you and consider you to be a very good boy heres a sovereign for you it is not on account of your wages mind but a little gift you must not however tell any body that i gave it to you or else you will make the other servants jealousill be sure not to tell maam i said and i thank you very muchand now john continued mrs beaumont i have one question to put to you and you must tell me the truth does miss stacey ever speak kindly to you i mean does she ever do any thing to show you that she likes you better than the other servantsno maam i replied on the contrary i fancy she sometimes speaks sharp to meoh indeed said mrs beaumont and she then subjected me to the same kissing process that i had undergone on the part of miss staceyonly i did not like it quite so well the old lady hugged me very tight and seemed as if she wanted to say something but did not exactly like to do so at last she spoke out plainly enough though in a whispering tone john she said i just now gave you a sovereign because you are a good boy and i will give you another if you will do what i ask you and not tell any one about it should you like to have another sovereignvery much indeed maam i answeredwell then continued mrs beaumont you must come to my room tonight when the house is all quiet because i want to speak to you very particularly indeedbut i promised the servants maam to sit up to let miss stacey in i answeredso much the better observed mrs beaumont miss stacey has promised to be back by twelve at latest and as soon as you have let her in you can go up to your own room and then a few minutes afterwards come down to minei promised to do exactly as i was desired and having received a few more kisses and pawings about was suffered to return to the kitchen the footman came back at eleven and as mrs beaumont had already retired to her chamber all the servants except myself went off to theirs i then remained alone in the kitchen thinking of what had occurred between my mistress and myself and not half liking the idea of sleeping with herfor i knew very well what her object was in asking me to go to her room i wished it had been miss stacey who had made such an appointment with me for young as i was i was greatly smitten with that lady and i thought she had never looked so well as when i saw her that evening dressed for the party to which she had gone she had on a very low gown and her neck was so beautifully white and her naked arms seemed so plump that i was really quite in love with her it gave me great pleasure to think that i had been chosen to sit up for her and i longed for her return the clock struck twelve and a few minutes afterwards a vehicle stopped at the door i knew it must be miss stacey who had come back and i did not wait for the knock and ring but hurried to the hall to admit her she seemed pleased when she saw who it was that opened the door for her and i observed that her countenance was rather flushed as if she had been drinking an extra glass of champagne of which i knew she was very fond the moment i had closed and bolted the door she asked me in a low whisper whether any of the other servants were up i answered in the negativedoes your mistress know that you are sitting up for me she next inquiredno miss i unhesitatingly saidshe began to caress me and i found that she smelt rather strong of wine but she looked so nice that i did not care about that and i was so excited that i kissed her in returnlight me up stairs john she at length said and let us go as gently as possible so as not to make any noise on account of mrs beaumont who is unwelli led the way up stairs my heart beating violently for i more than half suspected that i should not keep my appointment with my mistress that night nor was i mistaken for on reaching the door of miss staceys chamber she took my hand drew me towards her and said in a low hurried whisper come down to my room in about a quarter of an hour i wish to speak to you very particularly indeedi promised to do so and hurried up to my own chamber miss stacey having previously lighted her candle and said good night john in a tolerably loud voice but making a sign to convince me that it was only a precaution on her part when i reached my room i sate down on the bed to think how i should act my inclination prompted me to keep the appointment with miss stacey my fears urged me to keep the one given me by mrs beaumont i cared nothing about the sovereign promised me by my mistress now that i had received such an invitation from her pretty companion and i thought that it would be very easy to excuse myself to mrs beaumont should she question me next day by saying that i fancied her to be only joking or perhaps trying me so at last i resolved to follow my inclinations and disregard my fears and i acted in pursuance of this determination i accordingly repaired to miss staceys room and was completely happy we had been an hour together when a knock at the door alarmed us who could it be what could it mean we remained silent as the dead the knock was repeated and was immediately followed by mrs beaumonts voice saying miss stacey dear miss staceygood god what can she want whispered miss stacey to me she is perhaps unwell and will come into the room to speak to me john my dear boy you must get under the bed and keep as quiet as a mousethis was done in a moment and miss stacey bundled my clothes under the bed after me she then opened the door and sure enough my mistress entered the room saying i am sorry to disturb you my dear but i am so unwell i cannot sleep i have got such nervous feelings that i am really afraid to be alonehad i not better call up one of the servants and send for the doctor my dear madam asked miss stacey her voice trembling i could well conjecture whyno thank you dear answered the lady if you have no objection i will pass the remainder of the night with youoh with pleasure maam exclaimed miss stacey i will accompany you to your room directlywe may as well remain here replied mrs beaumont and it struck me that there was something strange in the way that she spoke miss stacey urged that it was very injurious for persons in delicate health to change their beds but mrs beaumont declared it to be a mere prejudice miss stacey invented some other frivolous excuse and i suppose that this confirmed mrs beaumonts suspicions for she immediately exclaimed really one would suppose that you wished to get rid of me miss staceyto speak candidly my dear madam was the reply i cant bear sleeping with another personindeed said mrs beaumont hey day what shoes have we here why surely these cannot be yours my deari have noticed that the more spiteful ladies are together the more they dear each otherit must be some oversight on the part of one of the servants said miss stacey in a faint toneits very strange cried mrs beaumont and i heard her stoop down and take up the unfortunate shoes oh how i did shiver and tremble and how sincerely i wished both the amorous ladies at the devil at that moment but matters grew speedily much worse for in stooping down to pick up the shoes mrs beaumont had spied my trowsers and these she fished up in another moment miss stacey shrieked mrs beaumont raised the drapery hanging round the bed to the floorand behold by the light of the candle which had been left burning in the room she discovered unfortunate me i cannot tell you what a scene ensued mrs beaumont raved like a madwoman and miss stacey protested her innocence the house was alarmedthe other servants came down to the doorand mrs beaumonts reproaches and upbraidings levelled against miss stacey and myself made every thing known to them i scarcely know how i had pluck enough to play the part which i did play but it is notwithstanding a fact that i was resolved to screen miss stacey and throw all the scandal on mrs beaumont i accordingly begged to be allowed to explain and when i could obtain a hearing i swore that mrs beaumont had given me a sovereign and promised me another to sleep with herthat i had mistaken the roomand that the moment i had seen miss stacey enter and perceived my error i had managed to creep under the bed unnoticed by her mrs beaumont went into strong hysterics at this accusation and was conveyed away to her own apartment by the female servants while i hurried off to my own room you may suppose that i scarcely slept a wink all the remainder of the night i knew that i had lost both my place and my characterbut i felt satisfied in having done all i could to screen poor miss stacey though it did not strike me at the time that my version of the business could not possibly be taken as a very probable story next morning the butler came up to me very early and in a long humbugging speech assured me that out of good feeling towards me mrs beaumont had consented to keep me in her service and look over the affair if i would confess the truth i however persisted in my original statement and displayed the sovereign that mrs beaumont had given me the butler went away telling me not to leave my room until he came back half an hour passed before he returned and again he tried to argue me into his views but i was obstinate and the interview ended by his desiring me to pack up my things and leave the house directly this i very willingly agreed to and in a few minutes my preparations were complete where are you going to youngster asked the butler when he had paid me the amount of wages duei dont know was my replywell he said i should advise you to take a room at the family washerwomans she has got one to let i know and if you hold your tongue about what has occurred in this house i will try and get you another place i readily gave the required promise and also followed the advice relative to the lodging in which i was installed in another half hour in the evening the butler came to me and gave me the addresses of several families in whose service pages were wanted you will have to apply to the butlers at those houses he said and therefore you can refer them to me i will endeavour to make it all right for you as i should be sorry to see a promising young lad ruined for want of a character i thanked him very much pretending to see nothing but pure friendship in his conduct although i was quite enough experienced in the ways of the world to understand that mrs beaumont herself had instigated this lenient treatment as a means of sealing my lips i ventured to ask him about miss stacey and he at once told me that she had left the house at a very early hour in the morning i longed to enquire if he knew where she was gone but dared not on the following day i called at the various addresses which the butler had given me and was not considered suitable at any at one i was thought too youngat another too old here i was too shortthere i was too tall in fact the objections were trivial but fatal i was returning to my lodging along great russell street bloomsbury when i saw in a shop window a notice that a livery boy was wanted and that applications were to be made within i entered the shop and received the address of a house in the same street there i went and was shown into a small parlour where i was kept waiting for nearly a quarter of an hour at last a gentleman and ladyan elderly coupleentered the room and i was immediately subjected to no end of questions all of which i answered in the most satisfactory manner because i did not hesitate to say yes when an affirmation was required and no when a negative was necessary at last the gentleman said to the lady well my love what do you thinkwhat do you think my dear asked the ladyi think my dear began the gentlemanso do i mr turner exclaimed the lady without waiting to hear what her husband did think it however appeared that they perfectly well understood each other for the lady turning towards me said we will give you a trial if the butler at your last place speaks as well of you as you assure us he will but you will have to be very active here for i must tell you that this is a boardinghousea boardinghouse of the highest respectability interrupted the gentleman looking very solemn indeed as if he was afraid that i was going to say i didnt believe himand there are many ladies and gentlemen to wait upon continued mrs turner but we shall see i then withdrew mr turner went about my character in the evening and found every thing satisfactory and next day i entered my new place wondering what adventures would befal me here this boardinghouse proved to be the hardest place i ever was in i had to get up at five in the morning to clean six pairs of boots and ten pairs of ladies shoes if they did not shine well i was blown up on all sides and if i did make them shine well mrs turner blew me up for wasting the blacking then i had to beeswax heaven knows how many chairs and tables and to clean the windows from top to bottom at least twice aweek in the middle of my work i was constantly interrupted by knocks at the door or errands to run upon then at mealtimes something was always wantingsomething had always been forgotten the cleaning of knives and plated forks and spoons would have alone been a good four hours work for a strong man if i did them properly and devoted time to them i was scolded for being slow and lazy and if i knocked them off in a hurry they were sure to be found fault with sometimes the bells of half a dozen rooms would ring in the morning when the boarders were getting up all at the same instant and if i was long in taking up any particular gentlemans hot water to shave or any ladys shoes i was certain to hear of it when mrs turner came down into the kitchen in fact it was a hard life and an unthankful office for when i did my best i could not give satisfaction and yet the cook and housemaidthe only servants kept besides myselfwere candid enough to declare that i was the best lad that had ever been in the house during their time there was one elderly ladya miss marigoldwho seemed to have taken a particular hatred for me and only because when one day she began to caress me in the same way that mrs beaumont and miss stacey had done i laughed in her face and told her to keep her wrinkled old hands to herself from that minute she grew desperately malignant against me and was always finding fault i determined to have my revenge and waited patiently for the opportunity that occasion came at last one evening miss marigold retired earlier to bed than usual and mrs turner rang for me in the parlour i went up and found my mistress alone john she said go directly with this boxpointing to a round pasteboard one on the tableto the hairdressers and tell him that you will call for it at eight precisely tomorrow morning then in the morning when you come back with it send it up by the housemaid to miss marigolds roomi took the box which was tied round with string and was particularly light it immediately struck me that it must be miss marigolds wig for i was convinced she wore one accordingly as i went along the street i stepped up an alley and by the light coming from the window of a house unfastened the strings to peep inside sure enough it was miss marigolds wig it immediately struck me that her going to bed earlier than usual was only an excuse to be able to send her wig in time for the hairdresser to do it up that night and this circumstance joined to the fact that she wanted it the very next morning convinced me that miss marigold had but one wig belonging to her i therefore resolved that some accident should occur to the wig before it went back to her but in the meantime i took it to the hairdresser he seemed to understand what it was for without opening the box the strings of which i had carefully refastened he promised me that i should have the article when i came back in the morning shortly before eight i must now inform you that there was an elderly gentleman at the boardinghouse whose name was prosser captain prosser he was called and a jovial kind of old bird he was too he was amazingly fond of breaking out now and then staying away all night and coming home between six and seven in the morning so precious drunk that he could not see a hole through a ladder but he was always sensible enough to know that he must not make a noise and when i let him in on these occasions he would put his forefinger by the side of his nose in such a comical fashion as much as to say dont let any body know it that i could scarcely keep from laughing well on this very night when the affair of the wig occurred the captain went out for a spree and it happened that he came home rather later than usual the next morning i had just returned with the wigbox and had it still in my hand when the captains low sneaking knock at the door summoned me to open it he came in worse than i had ever seen him before he could scarcely keep upon his legs and his head rolled about on his shoulders just as if he had no bones in his neck at all his hat too was smashed completely in and his coat was slit completely up the back to the very collar such a comical figure i never saw in my life he staggered into the hall seeming quite to forget where he was or what he wanted there a thought struck me and i resolved to put it into execution he was so uncommonly drunk and yet so quiet and tractable that i saw i could do with him just as i liked so i led him into the parlour where the long table was laid for breakfast but no one had come down yet i seated him on the sofa in such a way that he could not fall off and in a few moment he was in a sound sleep i removed his hat took the wig from the box and fixed it all awry upon his head purposely tumbling all the curls so as to make it appear as if he had thus adorned himself with his own hand i then stole away from the room and having suffered about ten minutes to elapse so as to bring the time nearer to breakfast before the exposure should take place i went into the kitchen to tell the housemaid that there was a box in the parlour which she must presently take up to miss marigold but she not knowing what the box might contain waited a few minutes more to finish something that she was about and i did not choose to hurry her at last miss marigolds bell rang and i laughed in my sleeve to think that the poor lady would vainly wait for her wig the housemaid hastened to answer the summons and i followed her as far as the parlour under pretence of taking up some plates for the breakfasttable but just before we reached that room seven or eight of the boarders ladies and gentlemen alike came pouring down stairs to breakfast and the moment they entered the parlour such screams of amazement burst from the women and such roars of laughter from the men the housemaid hurried into the room and i behind her and almost immediately afterwards in came mr and mrs turner and all the rest of the boarders except poor miss marigold and what a sight burst upon their view the screams and the roars of laughter had awoke captain prosser and he was sitting propping himself up in the corner of the sofa and looking stupidly about him as if quite unconscious of where he was and certainly ignorant of the reason which drew all eyes upon him such a comical spectacle as he was with the wig perched all crooked upon his head at length the ladies began to give vent to their indignant feelings shameful said onewell i never cried anotherand this in a respectable boardinghouse exclaimed a thirdit all comes of having such a monster as the captain in the place observed a fourthbut whose wig is it cried one of the gentlemen a humorous fellow in his way and approaching the leather box he took it up miss marigold at length he exclaimed his eyes catching some writing in the insidemrs turner who had suspected the ownership of the wig declared that she should go into hysterics but her husband begged her not to do any thing of the kind and so she followed his advice of course no suspicion fell upon me when questioned i said that i had brought home the box without knowing its contents that i had put it on the sofa and that before i had gone down stairs to tell the housemaid to take it up to miss marigold i had opened the front door to let in the captain the thing was therefore clearthe captain had come in in a state for which he ought to be ashamed of himself and nothing would please him but he must decorate himself with poor miss marigolds wig such was the explanation agreed upon by all present and while two or three of the gentlemen conveyed the captain up to his own room the wig having been previously removed from his head mrs turner went up to break the fatal news to miss marigold to make an end of this part of my story i need only say that miss marigold left the house on the sly the moment her wig was done up again by the hairdresser and mrs turner easily persuaded the ladies to forgive the captain on condition that he would stand a dozen of winewhich he did several months passed away after this incident without any adventure worth relating it was a most unpleasant place but there was amusement in it and moreover there was a certain loveaffair in progress in which i felt interested and the end of which i was determined to wait and see not that i was an actor in it at all but only a gobetween the fact was that amongst the boarders there was a widowlady of about seven or eight and twentya very pretty woman whose name was percy there was also a young gentleman of very effeminate appearance but possessing a handsomeor rather a beautiful countenance and a very slight figure he was also shorta complete doll of a man for he was within four years as old as the widow his name was hulse this couple fell in love with each other or rather i think the love was all on the side of the young gentleman who possessed some little property and better prospects whereas the widow was notorious as a husbandhunter ever since she had been in the boardinghouse and was moreover very poor she was however sweetly pretty and she had such wicked eyes that it gave me strange sensations to meet her looks it was in this way that i came to know of the lovematter existing between mr hulse and mrs percy about the time when the adventure of the wig took place mr hulse one evening asked me to give a letter privately to the widowlady and he slipped halfacrown into my hands you may have already seen that i possessed no small degree of curiosity and i longed to know what that letter could possibly contain i took it up into my own room with me and tried to catch a glimpse at the writing inside but it was so carefully folded that i could not at last to my joy i perceived that the wax was stamped with a seal which was invariably left lying in the inkstand drawer in the parlour for the general use of the boarders i therefore hesitated no longer to open the letter breaking the wax as carefully as possible the letter was a declaration of love the writer stating that he had not courage to make the avowal in words and he implored a written answer observing that the lad john was to be trusted as he seemed a quiet steady youth i was much amused by the letter and early next morning i resealed it by means of the stamp in the inkstand drawer then watching the opportunity when mrs percy descended to breakfast i gave it to her as she was coming down stairs in the evening she put into my hands an answer accompanied by a shilling for myself and as she smiled significantly and showed her pretty white teeth i felt that i could do any thing to obtain a kiss from that sweet mouth fortunately this letter was also fastened with the houseseal and i was therefore able to read its contents it thanked mr hulse for the favourable opinion he had entertained of her and stated that she felt she could love him but that she required a more explicit avowal of his intentions this letter i resealed and gave to the young gentleman a reply was ready in the evening and another halfcrown was slipped into my hand this letter i likewise read and found that mr hulse professed the most honourable intentions but begged that their engagement should the correspondence have that result might be kept a secret as he had an uncle from whom he had considerable expectations to consult but who was at present abroad and would not be in england again for several months the ladys answer which also passed through my hands was quite satisfactory and in the course of a few days i saw that the tender pair exchanged significant looks when they thought themselves unperceived and that mr hulse was gradually losing much of his bashfulness nevertheless frequent notes passed between them and several presents were made to the lady by the young gentleman all of which went through my hands and were duly inspected by me it may seem strange that two people living in the same house should require the aid of a gobetween but such was the factfor i believe mr hulse to have been one of the very sentimental and romantic class of lovers who are fond of mystery and of tender correspondence this absurd courtship went on for several months and the lovers little suspected that i was as well acquainted with its progress as themselves at length i perceived by one of mr hulses letters that his uncle was expected home in a few days and he spoke of the necessity which would compel him to go on a visit to the old gentleman but also expressed his hopes that the result would be according to the wishes of the lady and himself and in less than a week he did depart on the proposed visit having previously exchanged most tender and affectionate letters with the widow the very next morning a new boarder arriveda gentleman who in every respect was quite different from mr hulse he was tall largelymade and wore a great deal of hair about his face without being handsome he was a very fine man and he talked away at a rapid rate getting on good terms with all the other boarders by the time breakfast was over and very intimate indeed before the cloth was removed after dinner he sate next to the widow to whom he paid great attention and she appeared very well satisfied with his civilities in fact in one single day he made more progress in thrusting himself into the good graces of mrs percy than mr hulse had done in a week the name which the gentleman bore at the house was jameson but i did not believe it to be his right one because his hat had the initials of f s in it the same letters were marked as i heard from the housemaid on all his linen and they were also described by means of brass nails on the lid of his trunk however a few days passed and i saw that mr jameson and mrs percy were becoming more and more intimate they sate together at mealsthey lounged together on the sofa in the drawingroomand as i watched them narrowly i saw that they exchanged glances which convinced me that mr hulse had been forgotten by the faithless lady somehow or another i took an immediate hatred to mr jameson the moment he set foot in the house and this feeling was increased by his harsh and commanding ways towards me i was moreover sorry for mr hulse who had been kind and generous in his behaviour to me and i longed to do jameson some evil turn the opportunity arrived sooner than i expected for one morningabout a fortnight after he had arrived at the establishmenti was accosted in the street when going on an errand by an illlooking fellow who was loitering about and who said he wanted to speak to me particularly i asked him his business but he would not exactly explain it he however said he was very anxious to learn some tidings of a certain gentleman and that he had received a hint of the person alluded to being at a boardinghouse in great russell street under a feigned name it instantly struck me that the gentleman thus enquired about was jameson and i was moreover convinced by the appearance of the enquirer that he had no good intentions towards the individual whom he was seeking i therefore readily gave such information as convinced the man that mr jameson was the person he was looking for and i then learnt to my astonishment that this mr jamesons real name was frederick shawe i now showed myself so much interested in the affair and expressed myself in so hostile a way relative to mr frederick shawe that the man at last admitted to me that he was a sheriffsofficers follower and had a writ against the man who i was convinced by all i now heard was the same that had treated my deceased parents in so scandalous a manner we did not part before we came to an understanding together and i returned to the boardinghouse overjoyed to think that the moment of vengeance was not very far distant the dinnerhour was five oclock and on the day of which i am speaking there was company present besides the boarders mr jameson as usual sate next to mrs percy and his attentions were of the most amiable description had mr hulse returned at the moment he would not have been very well pleased at the way in which she received them but a storm was brewing over the head of the successful rival and i was longing for it to burst towards the close of the meal jameson asked me for a glass of porter i pretended not to hear him and waited on some one else he called me again and when i at length drew near his chair to serve him he said in a harsh voice youre very neglectful john and i wonder how mrs turner can keep such a stupid boy in the housethen why dont you ask her to discharge me mr shawe i saidyou should have seen how he turnedfirst as white as a sheet and then as red as scarletmr jameson you mean john exclaimed mr turner call gentlemen by their proper names and dont be rude sir or you shall leave the house directlyi did call this gentleman by his proper name sir i answered and that name is shawethe poor boy is labouring under a mistake said shawe dreadfully confused and stammering as he spoke but dont be harsh with him he did not intend any harmi do not want you to speak in favour of me sir i exclaimed and perhaps youll guess why when you know that my name is jeffreysthe villains countenance now showed the most awful dismay and the scene produced great excitement amongst all present but at that moment a knock at the frontdoor was heard and i ran to answer it well knowing who were there how my heart beat with joy when i admitted the officer and his follower the man i had seen in the morning into the house and without caring how my master and mistress might take it on my part i threw open the diningroom door led the officers in and pointing to the person they wanted said this is mr frederick shawe the officers instantly arrested him and a scene of extraordinary confusion followed mrs turner fainted in right earnest and while several of the ladies flocked round her others began tittering and whispering and mr turner requested mr shawe to pay his bill before he went to prison but the conduct of mrs percy was the most extraordinary part of the whole performance it is however most probable that she acted in the way she did to conceal her vexation and annoyance for bursting out into a loud laugh and casting a look of contempt at the man with whom she was on such good terms a few minutes before she expressed her surprise that fellows of his stamp should dare to force their way into genteel societyto be brief mr turner could not get the amount of his claim on shawe whose trunks he accordingly detained and the scoundrel was conveyed away by the officers i followed the party to the streetdoor and took good care to let shawe know that it was i who had betrayed him the exposure of this person caused such a sensation in the house that my share in it created a feeling of curiosity and when questioned by mr turner before all the company i explained how he had treated my parents so that i was rather praised than blamed for what i had done but mrs percy applauded me the most and spoke warmly in my favourat which i was very much pleased two or three days after this occurrence mr hulse returnedbut only for a few hours and during that time he was alone with mrs percy in the parlour the nature of their interview was soon known throughout the house for it appeared that the news he had brought from his uncle were favourable and their engagement was now no longer kept secret it was fortunate for the widow that he did not remain in the boardinghouse until their marriage for if he had some kind friend would have been sure to tell him of the flirtation that had gone on between herself and the scoundrel shawe as it was every thing turned out well mr hulse took and furnished a nice house in bloomsburysquare and in a few weeks he and mrs percy were married my former services were not forgotten by either but on the contrary were rewarded on the weddingday by a guinea from the gentleman and half that sum from the lady i had thus seen the end of this very extraordinary courtship and being thoroughly tired of my place began to look out for another i accordingly made the usual enquiries and heard of several vacancies my very first application was successful and i was engaged by the honourable mr ilverton mr turner giving me a good character and expressing no dissatisfaction at my desire to better myself the honourable mr ilverton resided in st jamess square he was a gentleman of about forty years of age and was on the point of marriage with a lady much younger than himself and who was one of the numerous daughters of the marquis of mountcharlton but as mr ilverton was very rich and the marquis was but a poor peer the match was considered a very desirable one by the friends of lady hortensia stanhope i heard my fellowservants in my new place say that she was a very beautiful creature and i longed to see her but six weeks were yet to elapse before the celebration of the marriage the place was a very nice one and the establishment was on a large scale there were six female servants and four men besides the butler and coachman two of the footmen were constantly on duty in the hall that is they had nothing to do for the four hours that their turn lasted but to look out of the hallwindows and attend the frontdoor when their four hours expired the other two took their place for a like interval there was a great deal of aristocratic feeling amongst these servants the butler had his room and the housekeeper had her room and they took their meals apart from the rest the other servants were obliged to say sir to the butler and maam to the housekeeper the cook and the two housemaids were likewise above the kitchenmaids who said miss when addressing either one of them the footmen also considered themselves above the coachman but they allowed the latter to take his meals at their table as for myself i was looked upon as a mere child by the men and probably by the women toofor they were very much addicted to fondling me when i happened to be alone with either one of them well the six weeks passed away and the day came on which mr ilverton was to be married the ceremony was performed at st georges hanover square and the happy couple as the newspapers always call newmarried people started off for mr ilvertons countryseat a fortnight elapsed and then came the day when the townmansion was to receive its new mistress whom i had not yet seen i remember the profound curiosity which i felt on that occasion my fellowservants who had frequently beheld her having spoken so high of her beauty it was about six oclock in the evening when they were expected to arrive dinner having been provided for seven i stationed myself in the hall to obtain as early a view as possible of lady hortensia ilverton and shortly after six the carriage drove up to the door from the hallwindow i saw her ladyship alight but she had a veil over her face i was however enabled to admire the beauty of her figure which was very finely proportioned and i thought as she stepped from the vehicle that i had never before seen such a charming foot and ankle the loveliness of her form rendered me the more anxious to behold her face and this curiosity on my part was soon gratified for on entering the hall the lady threw back her veilbut no words can explain the full extent of my astonishment when i beheld the very same charming creature of whom i had once before caught a hasty glimpse at the doctors house in brook street a faint exclamation of surprise escaped my lips no one however heard itand i instantly mastered my feelings lady hortensia passed through the hall leaning on her husbands arm without looking either to the right or to the leftand as she did not therefore observe me i had no opportunity of knowing whether she would remember me or not it was a part of my duty to help to wait at table and i longed for the dinnerhour to arrive to clear up that point at length my doubts were set at restdinner was served upthe lady saw me and i felt convinced that she had completely forgotten my face i was not however quite a year older than when i saw her at the doctors and therefore not much changed nevertheless she evidently did not know me again i really felt relieved on her account for she was such a beautiful creature and seemed so amiable that i should have been sorry for her to have experienced any annoyance or vexation on my account during the whole of dinner i took my station near her chair and watched her attentively and though she conversed pleasantly enough with her husband when he started a subject or addressed himself to her yet it struck me that she was not altogether happyfor she seldom commenced a topic of her own accord but seemed rather to love silence and i now and then fancied that she sighed in a subdued manner i dont know when i ever felt a deeper interest in any one than i did in this lady and it seemed to me as if i could do any thing to serve her but i am afraid that i am tiring you with this long storyand jeffreys abruptly broke off not at all old fellow exclaimed tim the snammer its only just struck twelve by st georges and we dont mean to separate yet awhile nonot quite yet i should hope observed josh pedler besides im getting deucedly interested in that lady hortensia of yours i all along expected that the beautiful young creature at the doctors would turn up again somehow or another to be sure said old death it wouldnt be a regular romance if she didnt its all as true as gospel cried jeffreys do you think i could invent such a pack of curious adventures if you dont believe what ive told you already im sure you wont believe what there is to come and so id better hold my tongue now dont be angry my dear boy said old death i was but joking i like your story amazingly so pray finish it were in no hurry and theres plenty of drink jeffreys accordingly complied with the solicitations of his comrades and proceeded uninterruptedly to the end of his narrative chapter lxxxvi conclusion of the history of a liveryservant i am now going to take a leap of about six months in my story because during that time nothing of any importance occurred in the establishment of the honourable mr ilverton i may however observe that my suspicion relative to the unhappiness of his wife was confirmed the more i saw of her for she was often dull and melancholyand once or twice i saw that she had been shedding tears her husband was very kind and attentive to her but he was a great deal from home as he had large estates in the country which he was frequently obliged to visit and he was also canvassing a borough for the approaching elections her ladyship preferred remaining in town because she could then enjoy the society of her mother and sisters who were almost constantly with her well as i just now said six months had passed away without any adventure of importance and i was already wearied of the sameness of the life i was leading when something occurred which tended to excite my curiosity and interest it was about four oclock one summer afternoon that the little incident took place and this was it a letter came addressed to her ladyship and the hallporter gave it to me to take up into the drawingroom i went up stairs and my hand was on the drawingroom door when sounds of sobbing and low whispering coming from inside met my ears i stopped and listened my god you know that i love you herbert said the voice of lady hortensia who no longer spoke in a whisperthen another voice made some reply which i could not catch and several minutes passed in a whispered conversation not one single word of which did i overhear at last i could judge that the visitor was about to take his leave and i entered the room first making as much noise as i could with the handle of the door so as to warn those inside that some one was coming in but a single glance was enough to show me that lady hortensia was in great confusion while a tall handsome young gentleman who was with her turned aside and walked towards the window they were both standing when i went in but her ladyship seated herself the moment after i entered and passed her handkerchief rapidly over her charming face i endeavoured to appear as if i saw nothing to excite my curiosity handed my mistress the letter and retired i waited in the hall to catch another glimpse of the gentleman when he went out and in a few minutes he took his departure i asked the hallporter who he was i never saw him before was the answer but i heard him desire the footman to announce him by the name of mr herbert remingtonwell thought i to myself mr herbert remington is a very fortunate man to be loved by such a beautiful lady but i did not breathe to a soul what i had overheard nor any thing that i knew concerning my mistress illustration mr ilverton was in the country at this time and i now observed that mr remington called regularly every day at about four oclock the other servants did not appear to notice it as at all extraordinary but i had my own reasons for thinking a good deal on the subject several times on the occasion of these visits did i creep to the drawingroom door and listen and much of their conversation did i thus overhear from that i gleaned that mr remington and lady hortensia had been attached to each other for a long time but that their marriage had been rendered impossible by his poverty i also learnt enough to convince me that he was the father of a child of which she had been delivered at the doctors house but which had died a few hours after its birth i felt no small degree of importance in knowing myself to be acquainted with all their secrets and i considered myself not only bound to keep those secrets to myself but also to assist them in any way i could if an opportunity served to render my humble aid available and the time to put me to that test soon came mr ilverton returned home from the country much sooner than was expected and the servants when talking together in the kitchen said that he had come back in a very queer humour he was however more amiable than ever with her ladyship at dinner on the day of his return and i saw nothing to prove the truth of what i had heard down stairs lady hortensia retired early that evening saying she was unwell and her maid observed on returning to the servants hall after attending on her mistress in her bedchamber that her ladyship appeared very unhappy then for the first time did the servants speak of the constant visits of mr remington and as they talked on the subject suspicions seemed to spring up in their minds but the entrance of the housekeeper put an end to the gossip and soon afterwards the drawingroom bell rang i hastened up to answer the summons and found mr ilverton walking up and down the apartment in so excited a manner that he did not even notice my entrance at length he perceived me and throwing himself in a chair beckoned me towards him john said he laying his hand on my shoulder and speaking in a strange tone of voice i think you will tell me the truth if i ask you a few questionsi said that i wouldand will you keep to yourself whatever i am going to say to you he askedi will sir certainly was my answeri thought you were a good and discreet lad he continued putting a couple of sovereigns into my hand act as you ought towards me and you shall never want a friend now tell me my boy whether a gentleman named remington has called here every day during my absence this last timenot every day sir i should think was my reply for i saw that a storm was brewing and felt determined to screen my mistress as much as possibleyes but he has though returned mr ilverton sharply you may not however have observed it he added immediately afterwards in a milder tone now answer me truly my next question and dont be afraid that i shall be angry or shall say any thing about it if you reply in the affirmative do the servants talk amongst themselves of mr remingtons visitsi have never heard a word said on the subject sir was my answerthen i am not laughed at in that quarter he muttered to himself but i heard his words plain enough although he seemed to forget that he had spoken them a minute after they had left his lips john he continued his fingers actually griping my shoulder you can do me a great service if you will and i will reward you handsomelyit is my duty to do all i can for you sir i repliedyes he said but what i now require is something out of the way of your ordinary duties and is rather the part of a friend than a servant towards a masteri will do any thing i can sir to oblige you i exclaimedand you will swear solemnly not to breathe to a soul a word of all that now takes place between us or that you may have to do for me unless i call upon you to proclaim any thing in a court of justicei will obey you in all things sir i repliedyou are a good lad he said and i am not mistaken in you to tell you the truth he continued i have received an anonymous letter creating the most painful suspicions in my mind this letter assures me that a gentleman whom i do not know and whose name is remington is a too frequent visitor at this house but before i act i must be satisfied that his visits are injurious to my honour do you understand me my boy you see i am obliged to be open and candid with you as i require an important service at your handsi understand you perfectly sirwhat then do i meanwhy sir that my lady should not receive that gentlemans visits so often and while you are away i answered pretending first to reflect for a few momentsexactly so he cried and now i will explain what i require of you tomorrow at about halfpast three oclock he continued i will give you a letter addressed to some friend of mine at a little distance and you must tell the butler you are going to take it and that you shall be upwards of an hour away by these means you will not be missed by the servants but instead of leaving the house you must steal up to the drawingroom and conceal yourself under the sofa there must you lie as quiet as possible and listen to all that may take place between lady hortensia and mr remington who not knowing of my return will be sure to call at his wonted hourbut suppose sir i said that i should be discoveredthen leave it to me to extricate you from the difficulty which is not likely to arise answered mr ilvertonbut i again argued if her ladyship should happen to come down earlier to the drawingroom than usual how shall i be able to conceal myself beneath the sofashould this occur i will devise some means to induce lady hortensia to quit the room for at least a few minutes at about halfpast three be you on the watchi will sir was my answerand if you serve me faithfully john he added you will find a friend in me but if you disobey me in one single point i will find means to punish you somehow or anotheri of course made all the necessary promises and he dismissed me apparently well satisfied with my assurances of fidelity i slept but little all that night i saw that a dreadful storm hung over the head of my mistress and i lay awake planning a thousand schemes to avert it it was very easy for me to hide myself under the sofa and whatever i might overhear afterwards assure my master that not a word had been said which he could possibly be angry at but i was experienced and cunning enough to fear that mr ilverton wanted a witness and that though i might be listening under the sofa he would also be listening at the door and would burst into the room in case his suspicions respecting his wife should receive confirmation even if he should not adopt this plan but merely use me as a means of ascertaining whether his wife was faithful or not and take my word respecting the particulars of the anticipated interview between herself and mr remingtonnevertheless i saw the necessity of warning my mistress that such suspicions did exist concerning her and put her fully upon her guard this i resolved to do and at last i made up my mind to speak frankly to her next day but when that day came i saw no chance of having an opportunity of carrying my intention into effectfor her ladyship did not come down stairs to breakfast nor to luncheon she being still indisposed as i heard from her own maid i loitered upon the landing near the drawingroom as much as i dared and once or twice when my master went up or down stairs he nodded approvingly of my conduct thinking that i was there only to serve his interests at last just as the clock had struck three to my joy i saw lady hortensia descend from her own chamber and enter the drawingroom not a moment was to be lost i rushed in after her closed the door and said my lady listen to me for one instant i implore of you she looked at me with mingled surprise and anger for my manner must have appeared not only strange but also boisterously rude i am sure i do not recollect nowfor i did not remember ten minutes after this scene occurredwhat words i used or how i introduced the subject but it is very certain that i told her how i was the very lad who had seen her at the doctors how her husband had bribed me to watch her how i was determined to warn her of the plot in progress against her and how i would do any thing in the world i could to serve her she seemed perfectly astounded at all i told her she sank on the sofa turned red and white a dozen times in a minute and then burst into tears i dared not say a word the idea of a poor servant like me venturing to console a great lady like her was ridiculous but i was in a dreadful state of alarm lest mr ilverton should come injohn she said at last wiping away her tears if all you have told me is true you are one of the best lads that ever lived but how am i to know that this is as you represent iti understood what she meant she feared lest it was only a trap to ensnare her into something amounting to a confessionmy lady i answered if i wished to injure you could i not have at once revealed to mr ilverton all that took place at the doctors house in brook streettrue she said blushing scarlet yesyou are faithful and she put her purse into my hand i returned it to her declining to take any reward but she forced it upon me and i was compelled to accept it now retire she said hastily and follow your masters bidding in respect to concealing yourself i shall afford you an opportunity she added then turning away she again burst into tears i hastened from the room well pleased with the success of my interview with her ladyship and feeling myself so important a person that i scarcely knew whether i stood on my head or my heels the secrets of the family were in my keepingin the keeping of a boy not sixteen years old and it was enough to make me proud besides i felt so satisfied with my conduct in respect to her ladyship that it seemed to me as if i had done a great and a glorious deed well on quitting the drawingroom i went up to my own chamber to compose my feelings for i was really so much elated as to be quite unfit to meet my master for a few minutes but at the expiration of that time i hastened down stairs received the letter which he had in readiness for me and after looking in at the servants hall for a moment just to say i was going out on an errand stole up to the drawingroom where i found no one i therefore thrust myself under the sofa and awaited anxiously the termination of the adventure just as the timepiece on the mantel struck four her ladyship returned to the room and almost immediately afterwards mr remington was announced hasty whispers were exchanged between them in a languagemost likely frenchwhich i did not understand and then they seated themselves on chairs at some distance from each other lady hortensia having previously rung the bell i was surprised at this proceeding what could she possibly mean but i was more astonished still when on the entrance of one of the footmen she said ask your master if he will have the kindness to favour me with his company for a few minutes the servant retired to execute this command and i was now frightened lest her ladyship intended to accuse her husband of his stratagem and thereby expose my want of faith towards him but second thoughts convinced me that this was not the case because her ladyship must remember that it was in my power to ruin her effectually if she meditated any treachery towards me a few minutes elapsed during which mr remington and my mistress conversed on the most commonplace subjectssuch as the weather the new opera and so on and at length mr ilverton entered the room i am sorry to disturb you my dear said lady hortensia speaking in her most amiable manner since i know that you are so fully engaged with election matters and other important business but i have a favour to ask of you this gentleman is mr remington mr remington she added mr ilverton thus calmly and quietly introducing themi do not know how my master looked but i could fancy that he felt very queer at all events he said nothingmr remington my dear continued lady hortensia speaking with a tranquil affability that quite astonished me is a gentleman to whom our family are under the greatest obligations for it was he who saved my brother edwards life at oxford a few years agoi remember to have heard that your brother edward had a narrow escape from being drowned in the river on a boating excursion said mr ilverton but i was not until now acquainted with even the name of the gentleman who so generously risked his life to save himit was a deed which scarcely deserves such warm praise sir observed mr remingtonon the contrary mr remington exclaimed lady hortensia mr ilverton must as my husband experience the same gratitude which i feel towards you and ever shall for your noble conductcertainly most decidedly exclaimed my master who i could very well suppose was now feeling particularly sheepishand i am convinced my dear continued her ladyship addressing herself altogether to her husband now that you will approve of certain steps which i have taken in order to convince mr remington of the gratitude of the near relatives of him whom he saved from a premature death mr remington has a sister who has been left a widow and who is anxious to turn her accomplishments to a good account she is desirous of entering some family as a governess and i have supplied mr remington with letters of introduction on behalf of his sister to several of our friends and acquaintances he has this day called to inform me of his sisters success in obtaining the situation she requires by means of one of those lettersmr ilverton expressed his entire approval of this proceeding on the part of her ladyship and mr remington rose and took his leave in that formal manner which seemed to show that he did not even pretend to be considered in any other light than a mere acquaintance when he was gone lady hortensia said i am really glad that i have been able to serve that young mans sister for they are both very poor it seems and the service which he rendered our family in saving the life of my brother was not one that should have gone unrewardedoh decidedly not my love said mr ilverton but will you accompany me to the library now and see the new picture that i bought some weeks ago and which has been sent home this morning it was kept to be framedcertainly answered lady hortensia and she quitted the room with her husband i of course understood that he had purposely enticed her away to allow me an opportunity of leaving my hidingplace and i was very glad to get from under the sofa where i was most terribly cramped not having dared to move and scarcely able to breathe free through fear of being heard i was highly delighted at the clever manner in which lady hortensia had got herself out of the serious scrape that for a time seemed to threaten her with total ruin and i was heartily glad to think that her husband must be thoroughly ashamed of having exposed himself so completely to me at dinnertime lady hortensia gave me a glance which seemed to thank me again for the part i had acted towards her whereas mr ilverton never once looked me in the facenot even when i was close by his side and he ordered me to serve him with any thing shortly after dinner her ladyship retired to the drawingroom and the moment i was alone with my master he beckoned me to approach him and said in a low tone john what took place between your mistress and that gentleman before i came inmr remington said he came to thank her ladyship for her kindness towards his sister i answered taking my cue from what i had heard before and then her ladyship said that you was at home sir and she would introduce mr remington to youthen i have been altogether misled john he observed and mind that you never breathe a syllable of what has passed to a living soulcertainly not sir i replied he put a couple of sovereigns into my hand telling me i was a good boy and repeating his injunction of strict secresy i was now a very great favourite with both my master and mistress though in each others presence they neither showed any particular kindness towards me mr remington came no more to the house but her ladyship now and then gave me letters to put privately into the post for her and which were addressed to him thus three months more passed away and the general election came on mr ilverton went out of town and he had not left the house an hour before lady hortensia gave me a note to convey by hand to mr remingtons lodgings in sackville street with directions to wait for an answer mr remington seemed greatly delighted at the contents of the note and gave me the reply which in his hurry and joy he omitted to seal although he had lighted a taper on purpose i hastened away and went into a publichouse to read the letter to my surprise i found by its contents that an appointment had been made for the lover to pass the night with lady hortensia she having already admitted her maid into her confidence thereby arranging for his admission into the house at twelve oclock i was now dreadfully annoyed at being no longer treated as a confidant i who had done so much to protect them from exposure my interest in behalf of my mistress suddenly turned to hate and i thought seriously of revenging what i considered to be a slight i however ran back to mr remingtons lodgings and said to him sir you have not sealed this letter and i would rather not take it like this to her ladyship for fear she should think i had read it which i would not do for all the worldhe looked very hard at me and seemed dreadfully confused at his oversight but perceiving that i did not change colour and that i met his gaze steadily he was more satisfied having sealed the letter he returned it to me putting halfaguinea into my hand and i then hastened away with it to my mistress from whom i received double that sum but a wonderful change had come over my mind i saw that i was made a mere tool of whereas so long as i thought myself important as a confidant i was happy i had moreover hoarded near twenty pounds by means of the presents i had received and i thought how foolish i was not to turn my knowledge of certain secrets to account and extort a good round sum from her ladyship in a moment i grew avaricious and spiteful i know how it was while my vanity was flattered i was contented but the instant i saw that i was a tool and not a confidant i was mortified and therefore changed it did not strike me then that delicacy would of course prevent lady hortensia from making use of me to give admittance to her lover and i looked on myself as a person badly used i did nothing that day but i lay awake during the best part of the night settling in my mind how i should proceed thus while the lovers were in each others armsas i had no doubt they werea storm was brewing against them in a quarter from which they little expected it the very next day i went into the drawingroom when i knew that her ladyship was there alone and shutting the door advanced in a resolute manner towards her she seemed astonished and asked me what i wanted a hundred pounds i answered in a dogged styledo you mean to request that sum as a favour or to demand it as the price of the secrets you have promised to keep faithfully she said in a mild and reproachful way which made me more than half repent of my conduct but i had gone too far to retreatwhichever your ladyship likes i repliedi will give you two hundred if you will leave the house this minute and let me make what excuse i choose for sending you away she saidthe offer was too tempting to be rejected and i immediately accepted it two hundred pounds it was a fortune and i fancied that i should never be able to spend itpack up your boxes and prepare to depart said lady hortensia if the servants ask you any questions steadily refuse to answer them beyond merely stating that i have ordered you to leave immediately and if you will call on mr remington this evening at eight oclock he will give you two hundred pounds in goldi was overjoyed at this arrangement and gladly took my departure on such terms caring little what reason her ladyship might allege for the abruptness with which i left two hundred pounds to be received in a few hours oh how happy i wasand what castles did i build in the air i removed my trunk to a publichouse in st martins lane and having had a pint of wine to celebrate the occasion strolled out to purchase new clothesfor i had of course left my livery at mr ilvertons house and was not overwell dressed having bought all i required thereby making a considerable hole into the twentyfive pounds which with my hoardings and wages i had in my pocket when i came away i returned to the publichouse and put on my new things i then went out again to while away an hour till eight oclock it being now seven as i was going along piccadilly i saw an elegantly dressed lady step out of a carriage at a shopdoor and to my joy i recognised miss stacey she immediately knew me and seeing me so well attired did not hesitate to stop and speak to me we conversed together for a few minutes during which i told her that i was no longer under the necessity of working for my living as fortune had been kind to me she expressed her pleasure gave me her address and asked me to call upon her telling me however that i must be sure to come between two and seven and at no other time i promised to visit her for she looked sweetly pretty and very amorousand we parted precisely as the clock struck eight i knocked at mr remingtons doornone of your sneaking single knocks but a good loud double onefor i felt all the importance of a man who has two hundred pounds to receive mr remington was at home and i was shown up into his room he desired me to be seated but in a very cold tone and with a haughty manner i did not however care one fig for that the idea of the two hundred pounds rendered me as independent as possible when i sate down mr remington rose from his chair and advancing close up to me he said in a low savage tone you are a contemptible villiani did not come here to be abused i exclaimed insolently give me my money and let me be offyour money indeed he cried not one farthing will you receive of me or of lady hortensia ilverton now listen young man and be cautions how you act had you conducted yourself fairly you would always have found friends in me and her ladyship but you have shown yourself a villain and we are determined to crush you at once you think you have us in your power but you are mistaken her ladyship has already stated to her entire household that you were discharged suddenly for an atrocious attempt to extort money from her and say but one word of scandal utter one syllable against her and you will be handed over to justice begone sir and take care how you conduct yourself one word by the way before you leave meand that is a word of friendly warning the hallporter in st jamess square has instructions to give you over to the care of a constable if you present yourself again at that mansionyou cannot bully me i exclaimed i know too much every thing shall now be made known to mr ilvertonand he will not believe a word you utter answered remington this nights post bears to him a letter in which lady hortensia declares that you threatened to expose both him and her if she did not give you a sum of money and that you dared to assert that her husband had bribed you to conceal yourself under a sofa she of course pretends to think her husband incapable of such mean and cowardly conduct and he will be sure to deny it at the same time he will never forgive nor believe youbut there is the affair at the doctors house in brook street i criedthe doctor will deny that such a lady was ever there returned mr remington with a triumphant smileand the maid who knows that you passed an entire night with her mistress i said my courage sinking rapidlyyou had better ask her what she knows of the business now mark me young man every precaution is taken to put you to confusion you are forestalled in every possible way say what you will positive contradictions and denials will meet your assertions and the result will be to you transportation for life for attempting to extort money now then reflect well before you plunge yourself headlong into difficultiesbut i am thoroughly ruined i exclaimed tears starting into my eyes as i saw the truth of all he said i have lost my place and my characterit is your own fault replied mr remington at the same time he added after a few moments consideration i do not wish you to be crushed completely down to the very mire i will give you one chance sign a paper stating that all your accusations are so many falsehoods and that you make this acknowledgment to save yourself from being handed over to justice and i will then present you with fifty guineasthus speaking he took out a handful of notes and gold to tempt me to conclude the bargainbut every thing i can state is true i exclaimednever mind that he answered we can prove it to be all false so haste and decide my time is preciouswhat could i do i wanted money and i saw that he was determined to resist all attempts at positive extortion i therefore expressed my readiness to sign the paper which was already drawn up and having done so i received the fifty guineas promisednow said he triumphantly as he folded up the document and placed it in his pocketbook you know the consequence of a single slanderous whisperi took my departure terribly nettled but still somewhat consoled by the possession of the fifty guineas for i thought that one third of the sum at first expected was better than none at all i longed to be revenged on lady hortensia and mr remington but i knew not how i smarted dreadfully under the treatment i had receivedi uttered bitter words against my folly in consenting to leave the house before i had the money paid down and i pondered on a thousand different ways of venting my spite on my enemies for several days i rambled about by myself racking my brain with devices at last i resolved to abandon the idea at least for the present and then i set to work to enjoy myselfor rather to see how soon i could make away with my money a few weeks beheld the bottom of my purseand i was astonished to think that so many guineas should have disappeared in so short a time i was now seriously troubled what to do for a living because i had no character suddenly i bethought myself of miss staceys invitation and hastened to call on her it being then about three oclock in the day i found her living in elegant lodgings in maddox street and she received me most kindly i told her word for word all that had occurred to me since i last saw her and she was equally candid with me in fact she was then in keeping by one of the cabinet ministers who allowed her ten guineas a week paid her rent her milliners and her winemerchants bills and also the hire of her carriage we soon came to an understanding together she wanted a page or tiger just at that moment and i accepted the post the very next day i entered my new placethe most comfortable i had ever yet been in because i shared my mistresss bed nearly every night but i soon discovered that the cabinet minister and myself were not the only persons who enjoyed the favours of miss stacey several gentlemen called during those hours when she knew there was no chance of her friend making his appearance in fact the lady had become a regular wanton it was not however for me to make any observations on her conduct i was well satisfied with my placeand that was enough i learnt from her that mrs beaumont had died a few months previously having just before married her butler who came into possession of all her fortune and had set up as a gentleman driving his cab and finding plenty of people to honour his champagne parties with their presence miss stacey also gave me a little sketch of herself she had been seduced when only fifteen by the husband of a lady with whom she was placed as companion and she unhesitatingly admitted that in all the families where she had lived she had maintained an intrigue with some one either master manservant or page since she had left mrs beaumont she had been in keeping with the cabinet ministerbut she added with a smile you see that i am not particular where i take a fancy she was indeed a licentious woman but very goodnatured and possessing a temper that nothing could ruffle i had been with her about three months when i saw in the newspaper an account of the sudden death of the honourable mr ilverton mp who was found a corpse in his bed one night by the side of his wife there was a coroners inquest and the verdict was died of apoplexy i however had my suspicions that some foul play had been practised in a little less than a year afterwards i learnt by the same channel of intelligence that lady hortensia ilverton had become the wife of herbert remington esq about the same time i met mrs hulsethe pretty lady you remember who played such pranks with her two lovers at the boardinghouse she stopped and spoke to me i inquired after mr hulse and she said that he was quite well and that they lived very happy together i then asked her slyly if she had seen mr frederick shawe latelywhat she exclaimed do you not know all that happened to himi assured her i did nothe committed a forgery some months ago she replied and was hanged for it it was down in the country but i forget where the whole account was however in the papers at the timei was delighted to hear that the enemy of my parents had come to such a miserable end mrs hulse gave me halfasovereign and bade me good bye a short time after these little incidents and when i had been in miss staceys service nearly eighteen months the cabinet minister suddenly withdrew his protection from heri never heard why it is however more than probable that her numerous intrigues reached his ears the immediate result of the stoppage of funds in that quarter was a bolt from the lodgings my mistress being over head and ears in debt she removed to norfolk street strand and i accompanied her it was at this time that i was attacked by the smallpox and obliged to leave i went to the hospital where i remained dangerously ill for several weeks and when i did recover i was marked as you now see me i may therefore say without vanity that before this unfortunate occurrence i was a very goodlooking lad and it was no wonder that the women used to take a fancy to me well i left the hospital with only a few shillings in my pocket which i had about me when i went in and my first step was to enquire after my late mistress in norfolk street but there i learnt a sad tale she had been greatly reduced in circumstances and had made away with the things in her readyfurnished lodgings the landlady gave her into custody she was committed for trial and sentenced at the old bailey to transportation for seven years but this sentence was commuted to imprisonment for two years by an order from the home office although the judge who presided at the trial declared it to be a most aggravated offence i thought i could understand the secret of this leniency nor was i mistaken for on calling upon my poor mistress in newgate where she was imprisoned she told me that she had written to her late friend the cabinet minister who had procured the alteration in her sentence she was very happy and made me promise to call and see her again but i never had the opportunity for some member took up the case in the house of commons and asked the home secretary the reason why the original sentence was not carried out seeing that the jury had given no recommendation to mercy and that the judge had pronounced a strong opinion on the matter the affair made such a noise and the weekly dispatch took it up in such strong terms that the government was obliged to order the sentence of transportation to be put into immediate effect the consequence was that the poor lady was sent out of the country as soon as possible and i never saw her any more i felt for her deeply she had been kind to meand with all her faults there were many excellent points in her character but somehow or another i never did meet a woman who let her be ever so bad had not some redeeming qualities i have met hundreds of men so thoroughly bad that they had not a single thing to recommend them but it has not been so in my experience with the other sex i dont believe that any woman can become so utterly depraved as not to retain a little amount of good feeling about her i wish i could say as much for men but let me make haste and bring this story to an end i was now a miserable friendless wretch in the world and knew not what to do for a living i had no character and could not get a place at last when driven to desperation i resolved to call on the person whom mrs beaumont married and who was for many years her butler i accordingly went up to russell square and knocked at the wellknown door a servant in splendid livery answered the summons and i was shown into the hall where i was kept waiting for nearly two hours at last i was shown up into the drawingroom where the exbutler lay lounging on the sofa reading the morning post just sit down young man for a moment said he with an affected drawl although he was an old fellow of sixty while i finish the fashionable intelligence because you see im interested in itso i took a seat and was kept waiting for another halfhour at last the gentleman laid aside the paper and enquired my business i told him who i was and how distressed was my position he stared at me for a long time as if to make sure that i was really the john jeffreys whom he had once knownfor i was cruelly disfigured and when he was convinced that i was no impostor he gave me halfaguinea saying that he had been a looser by the late derby and had lent his friend lord mushroom so much money lately that he could do no more i thanked him very sincerely and went away i walked on to great russell street being in the neighbourhood and called at the turners boardinghouse but i learnt from the servant that mr turner was dead and mrs turner had declined business in consequence and would see nobody i went away with a heavy heart for i knew that the halfguinea would not last for ever at length i was so tired with walking about that i entered a publichouse to get some refreshment two men were sitting in the parlour drinking ale and their conversation singularly enough happened to turn on a friend of theirs who as i heard them say had just got a situation as footman in a good familybut how the devil did he manage though asked one since he only came out of quod for stealing that plate you know ten days agowhy he got a character of that chap who lives at the house with the balcony up in castle street portland place to be sure was the answeryou dont mean old griffiths do you said the otherof course i do replied his friend hes been in that line now for the last six months and makes an excellent thing by it ive recommended several poor devils of menservants to himthe deuce you have i exclaimed i wish to god you would recommend meare you out of place and got no character demanded the manjust so i answered and if i dont get a situation soon i shall starvehave you got any tin about you asked the manten shillings when ive paid for what ive had i repliedthatll just do the trick cried the man you must stand a pot to me and my friend here and youll have to pay sevenandsixpence entrance fee to old griffiths then youll have a trifle left to take you on till tomorrow i readily paid for a pot of the best ale and when we had disposed of it i received a note of recommendation to the mr griffiths spoken of he was an old respectablelooking man with a bold crown and grey hair at the back and sides of his head and he was sitting in a neat office with a large book before him he read the note which explained my business and then demanded the entrance fee this i paid and he put down my name in the book i will give you the addresses of several families who require a young liveryservant he said and you may refer them to captain elphinstone no mortimer street cavendish square you may say that you lived with that gentleman for three years and only left him on account of ill health and now i must tell you the nature of the bargain which exists between you and me you are sure to obtain a situation and when your first quarters wages are paid you must bring me a sovereign and a sovereign from second quarter you will then always have me as your friend and need never be afraid of remaining long out of place but if you do not keep faith with me i shall find means to make you repent iti assured the old gentleman i would do the thing that was right and took my leave of him rejoiced at the prospect of obtaining a situation next morning i made myself as tidy as i could and called at the places pointed out by mr griffiths i was soon successful and gave captain elphinstone as my reference the gentleman of the house said he would call on the captain in the course of the day and i was to return in the evening for the answer this i did and found that an unexceptionable character had been given of me i was therefore admitted into the gentlemans service at once it was a quiet place and a small establishment only consisting of myself and two female servantsa cook and housemaid for mr farmer our master was an elderly bachelor there i stayed for several years and was very happy and comfortable indeed but one day mr farmer took it into his head to marry the cook and as she could not bear to have in her house the same people who had known her as a fellowservant the housemaid and myself both got our discharge we however had good characters but we did not avail ourselves of themfor having each scraped up a little money we agreed to club our savings and open a shop in the chandlery line we had long been intimate enough to render the parsons services quite unnecessary in enabling us to live together and so we commenced business passing ourselves off as man and wife the thing did not however succeed and care drove me to the publichouse it was then that i met you mr bones and you suggested how much good might be done if i would go back into service and give you notice of any little things worth your knowing this i resolved to do and leaving my female companion to do what she liked with the shop i took leave of her we parted very good friends and by the aid of old griffiths i very soon obtained a place i need not say any moreunless it is that since then ive been in situations at many houses and have generally managed to do a pretty decent amount of business with mr bones jeffreys ceased speaking and his three companions expressed the amusement they had derived from his narrative a few more glasses of grog were drunk as well as a few more pipes smoked and it was not until past three in the morning that old deaths visitors left him we cannot close this chapter without a few observations relative to that large and important classdomestic servants and first of female servants it is said that great numbers of them are immodest and that from their ranks the class of unfortunate women or prostitutes is largely recruited we believe that the immorality of female servants is considerably exaggerated by these representations and that the cases of frailty are the exceptions and not the rule there are thousands and thousands of females amongst this class as respectable and well conducted as women ought to be and who take a pride not only in maintaining a spotless character but in so behaving themselves that there shall be no chance of its becoming tainted and this is the more creditable to themthe more to their honour inasmuch as the temptations to which they are exposed are very great sent out on errands at all hourscompelled to go to the publichouses to fetch the beer and spirits for the use of the familyconstantly placed in contact with the servingmen belonging to the familys tradesmenexposed to the chance of sustaining insulting liberties at the hands of the visitors to the houseand often persecuted by the lustful addresses of some male inmate of the establishment such as a brother or son of the master and perhaps the master himselfwhat strength of mindwhat moral courage must the servantmaid possess to resist these temptations and escape from so many perils we mean to say then that if she do fall there is far more scope for pity and a far greater amount of extenuation on her behalf than on that of the lady who surrenders herself unmarried to the embraces of her lover and in manytoo many instanceswhat a life of slavery is that of the female servantand how little enviable is the lot of the poor maidofallwork talk of the hard fate of the negressthink of the hard fate of the maidofallwork excellent saint of exeter hall you need not send your sympathies travelling some thousands of miles across the sea there is plenty of scope for their exercise at home if you be really sincerewhich we know you are not look to the maidofallworkup at five in the

sitting outside the windows which she is compelled to cleanand very frequently halfstarved by those whom she serves so assiduously and so faithfullywhat a life is hers female servants are treated with much greater kindness in france than in england in the former country they are considered rather in the light of humble friends of the family than as mere slaves which is the estimation in which they are usually held we are sorry to say in the british islands let them be treated with kindness and forbearance they have much to try their patience and sour their tempers by the very nature of their condition and the miscellaneous character of their avocations a man or a woman who is unkind to a servant is a wretch deserving obloquy and execration but a master or a mistress who through petty spite or sheer malignity refuses to give to a discharged servant the good character which such servant may in reality deserve is a very fiend unfit to remain in civilised society illustration before we take leave of this subject we cannot resist the opportunity of expressing our opinion relative to a practice adopted at court we mean the fact of the queen being waited upon in her private apartments by ladies of high rank and good family instead of by female servants who is queen victoria that a duchess must select her gown and a marchioness hook it is she a goddess that a countess must help her to put on her shoes and a baroness tie them must not royalty be touched by the hands of a female servant alas we strongly suspect that queen victoria is a woman made of the same flesh and blood as the most ordinary mortals and we feel confident that the practice of attaching ladies of rank and title to her august person is as pernicious to her as it is degrading to the ladies themselves and as flagrantly insulting to the entire class of wellconducted ladiesmaids but royalty in this country must be idolizeddeified no means must be left untried to convince the credulous public that royalty is something very different from commonalty this delusion shall however be dispelledthe people must be taught to look on victoria as nothing more than the chief magistrate of the country deriving her power from the nation at large and holding it only so long as the majority of the inhabitants of these realms may consider her worthy to retain it the contemptible farce of firing cannon to announce her movementsof illuminating dwellinghouses on her birthdayof cheering her whenever she appears in public just as if she cared two figs for the bawling idlers who gaze on majesty with awe and astonishmentall this miserable humbug should be abolished the more a sovereign is deified the more the people are abased instead of the nation being obliged to queen victoria for ruling over it queen victoria ought to be very much obliged to the nation for allowing her to occupy her high post for the only real sovereign power is that of the people and the individual who looks on royalty as something infallibledivinesupernally grand and aweinspiring is a drivelling narrowminded idiot unworthy of the enjoyment of political freedom and fit only to take his place amidst the herds of russian serfdom footnote this incident is founded on fact many of our readers will doubtless recollect the case of jnand her mother who were convicted of robbing readyfurnished lodgings about ten years ago miss jnhad been the mistress of a noble lord who was a cabinet minister at the time of the condemnation of her mother and herself and who is a cabinet minister at the present moment the affair created a great sensation at the time but the dispatch and other independent newspapers took it up not in order to persecute the unhappy women but on public grounds the result was that the original sentence passed upon them and which ministerial favouritism sought to commute to a much milder penalty was carried into force the entire business so far as the noble lord was concerned was vile and scandalous in the extreme footnote we avail ourselves of the opportunity afforded us by the glance which we are taking at this subject to recommend to perusal an admirable little work written by our esteemed and talented friend mr john taylor sinnett and entitled the servant girl in london it is published by hastings carey street lincolns inn fields and is a little book which should be found in all families as it contains sentiments and precepts useful alike to the employer and the employed in a work from which we have frequently quoted in the notes belonging to the present series of the mysteries of londonwe allude to poverty mendicity and crimewe find an important passage bearing strongly upon the subject of the text it runs as followswe must now direct attention to the class of female servants and they form no insignificant number from these the higher ranks of our prostitutes are recruited thirst for dress and finery which has crept on to such a degree that it is not a very rare sight to behold them waiting on their mistress in the morning bedecked in silks and ornaments equal to the young ladies themselves even where the ladies are of the highest class of the community great censure is due to ladies especially those who are mothers for not restraining their servants from squandering away the whole of their money loss of place ought to be the consequence of not laying by a small portion of wages to sustain themselves in the event of illness or other unforeseen calamity the dress of a female servant ought to be good but perfectly void of ridiculous ornament and frippery the ladies maids of our aristocracy are a race the most highly culpable of their sex aping all the pride and airs of their lady and desiring to appear abroad with equal clat to effect which the wardrobe of the mistress is not unfrequently resorted to and the purse not always held sacred or she becomes a prostitute whilst under the roof of her employer till descending from one false step to another she at length links her fate to some favourite of the swell mob to whom she at first listened as a suitor and ends in her being accessary to robbing the family which had fostered her it is ascertained beyond doubt that most of the houses that are robbed arises from the connexion and intimacy which the servant has contracted with some of the petty workmen who have been employed about the premises many of whom are thieves themselves or connected with some gang of villains who resort to that expedient to learn what property is kept on the premises and how it is disposed of at night a great deal of crime says mr nairn in his evidence is generated in consequence of the tradesmen who employ journeymen to work for them in gentlemens houses not taking care to inquire into their character by getting acquainted with servants they get a knowledge of those parts of the house where anything valuable is kept a number of men that were in the prison were painters plasterers and bricklayers they were in the practice of communicating with thieves and it is in that secret manner that they get information where property is keptvide j h nairn p nd report lords on state of gaols there is a most infamous conspiracy existing between the purveyors or housekeepers of the aristocracy and their tradespeople the latter paying the former a large per centage on the bills for the sake of gaining their custom twenty per cent is often given and it has been known to rise as high as fifty unfortunately the nobleman considers it as derogatory to his high rank to look into his pecuniary domestic affairs but taking it in a moral point of view it is his duty to do so for the sake of preventing this species of peculation which is an absolute theft and one of the steppingstones to crime generally as the money so attained is mostly as lightly spent and the servants out of place for a length of time the difficulty to procure the wherewithal to keep alive their former extravagance makes them not hesitate to become regular thieves the fine sense of honesty having been destroyed by the transaction with the tradesman who had not failed in his turn to make out a bill more than sufficiently long to cover merely his generosity in bestowing christmas boxes upon the domestics of his patron these tradesmen are a rank disgrace to their more honest fellow shopkeeper they are worse than fences and it is greatly to be regretted that a complete expose cannot take place and all such tradesmen dealt with according to their merit another evil in society that is pregnant with mischief is giving a false character to servants which ladies are constantly in the practice of doing to avoid being plagued or perhaps as they say insulted by the discarded servant whose character if correctly stated would not be such as easily to procure a new situation thus a pilferer having once had the luck to start off in a private family with a good name is from this shameful habit let loose upon the public to commit his depredations at leisure and convenience with the chance of blame falling upon an honest individual through the crafty machination of the wicked by making servants conscious that they would only procure such a character as they really deserve great good would accrue to the public generally and the servants themselves would be taught to curb their temper and other bad propensities by which they would become infinitely more contented and happy beings and valuable members of society it is too often the case that servants are looked upon as little better than slaves and so to treat them to say the least of such conduct it is unwise for in proportion to the kindness with which they are treated so will they study in return to make us enjoy numberless little comforts so delightful to experience and which it is in their power to give life to or destroy humanity ought to suggest that the situation in which these persons are placed witnessing nightly those scenes of pleasure without being permitted to join in them is sufficiently grating for they all have their feelings in common with the best of us and it ought to be one of the first cares of the heads of families to lighten as far as consistent with the rules and shades of society the state and labours of their dependants in france the servants are in an enviable condition compared with those of england and if the plan were followed in this country giving them their little pleasures many a one whose propensities were wavering would be confirmed in virtue and become a useful member instead of a disgrace to society chapter lxxxvii the blackamoor upon quitting old deaths abode tim the snammer and josh pedler proceeded together in the direction of blackfriars bridge while john jeffreys having wished those worthies good night pursued his way up horsemonger lane and plunged into the maze of narrow obscure streets lying at the back of the prison although he had said good night to his companions it was in reality morning for the clock of the gaol chimed a quarterpast three as jeffreys passed by that dismallooking establishment having reached the door of the house in which he lodged and which was in one of the streets above alluded to he drew a passkey from his pocket and was about to apply it to the lock when the sounds of footsteps close by fell upon his ears and almost at the same moment a heavy hand was laid upon his shoulder the conscience of mr john jeffreys was not quite so free from sources of alarm as to prevent him from being painfully startled by this occurrence and turning suddenly round towards the individual who had thus accosted him he found himself face to face with a blackamoor fear notno harm is intended you said the negro in a deep solemn and sonorous voice but without the least peculiarity of accent that is he added if you follow my directions and who are you demanded jeffreys reassured by the certainty that he was addressing no myrmidon of the law it is not for you to question but to answer said the black in a cool and authoritative manner which seemed to indicate the consciousness of possessing the power to enforce his will even against any resistance that might be offered but i have no time to waste in unnecessary discourse you must accompany me whither i shall lead you and if i refuse asked jeffreys trembling he scarcely knew why then i shall summon to my aid those who are ready at hand and who will carry you off by force calmly replied the black but if i raise an alarm said jeffreys gradually yielding to a sensation of awe in the presence of the mysterious stranger who spoke with the confidence of power and authority the neighbours will come to my rescue and a truce to this argument interrupted the black sternly if you accompany me of your own free will it will be to your advantage and no harm shall befall you but if you venture to resist me i shall unhesitatingly make you my prisoner by force and we shall then see what account john jeffreys can give of his long and intimate connexion with old death i will go with youi will do any thing you command said the villain trembling from head to foot only again i tell you that you have nothing to fear and much to gain observed the black and taking jeffreys arm he led him hastily back towards horsemonger lane neither of them uttering a word as they thus hurried along the nightor rather morning was dark and sombre and there were no lamps in the streets which they were threading thus although arminarm together jeffreys could obtain but a very imperfect view of his companions features nevertheless it struck him that though the strangers countenance was black as that of an african negro the facial outline was not characterised by the protuberant thickness of lips and hideous flatness of nose which usually belong to that race but jeffreys was too much alarmedtoo much bewildered by the sudden and mysterious adventures which had befallen him to be able to make any very steady reflections and whenever he threw a furtive glance towards his companions countenance he was instantly met by eyes the pupils of which seemed to glare upon him from their brilliant whites like those of a basilisk it was indeed an aweinspiring and most uncomfortable situation in which jeffreys found himself placed having numerous misdeeds upon his conscience he shuddered at the idea of coming in contact with the law and if he offered any resistance to his strange companion such contact was the alternative with which he was menaced but who was this strange companion who was this black that spoke with a tone of authority and acted in a manner denoting a consciousness of power for what purpose was he now hurrying jeffreys along through the darkness of the silent night and whither were they going even had the man been armed with conscious innocence his position was one calculated to engender acute suspense painful doubt and wild apprehensionbut knowing that he had been guilty of many deeds any one of which would be sufficient to involve him in serious trouble with regard to the law the miserable wretch had every thing to fear and scarcely any thing to hope it was true he had received assurances that no harm should befall him and that the incident would on the other hand prove advantageous to him but the influence of those assurances was completely absorbed in the vague and terrible alarms which the dread mystery of the adventure was so well calculated to excite conscious guilt made him a complete coward and his ideas became so confusedhis nervousness so greathis excitement so wild that he began to fancy he was in the power of some unearthly being of evil nature and design as this impression grew stronger in his attenuated mind he cast in his terror more frequent glances at his companionand now it seemed as if the black countenance were rapidly changingbecoming hideous to behold and lighted up with eyes that burnt in their sockets like red hot coals john jeffreys felt his legs failing beneath himhis brain whirlinghis reason goingand he was on the point of falling to the ground overcome by the terror that oppressed him when his companions voice suddenly broke upon his ear dispelling all the superstitious portion of his alarms and recalling him to his senses step in said the blackand jeffreys found himself by the side of a hackneycoach which was waiting beneath the wall of horsemonger lane gaol he obeyed the command issued in that authoritative tone which he dared not resist and the black followed him into the vehicle which immediately drove away i must now blindfold you observed the mysterious stranger and i warn you not to attempt to discover the road which we are about to pursue even in the darkness which prevails in this coach i shall be able to distinguish all your movements where are we goingwhat are you about to do with me asked jeffreys in an imploring voice if you are such a coward as you now seem to be you will prove of little service to me i am afraid said the black as he fastened a handkerchief over his prisoners eyes cheer up man he added in a tone not altogether free from contemptuous disgust if i meant to deliver you into the hands of justice for your numerous misdeeds i should not take this round about manner of accomplishing the task once more i tell you that the result of this adventure depends wholly and solely on yourself it may prove a fortunate occurrence for you if your conduct be such as to beget confidence and merit forbearance and protection then you wish me to do something for you said jeffreys considerably reassured by the words just addressed to him a great deal was the laconic answer but we will not continue the discourse at present if you please this intimation was followed by profound silence and the vehicle rolled along at a rapid rate jeffreys was now so far relieved of the oppressive fears which had recently paralysed his intellectual energies that he could even smile at the superstitious alarm which had seized upon him and he endeavoured to follow in imagination the route pursued by the coach but he soon became aware that it was taking such a circuitous and tortuous way as fully to destroy all possibility on his part of instituting any clue to its course and he at last threw himself back in the vehicle to give way to reflections on another subjectthus abandoning the idea of studying the direction in which he was being hurried along for an hour did the coach proceed making numerous turnings into fresh streets and often appearing to retrace the way it had previously pursued at length it stopped and one of the doors being immediately opened the black took jeffreys hand and assisted him to alight the mysterious guide then hurried his prisoner into a house up a flight of stairs and into a room where he conducted him to a seat remove the bandage from your eyes said the black this command was instantly and cheerfully obeyed and jeffreys casting a rapid glance around found himself to be in a wellfurnished apartment of which he and his mysterious guide were the only occupants the curtains were drawn completely over the windows and jeffreys had not the least idea of the locality to which he had been brought opposite to him but in such a manner that the light of the candles did not fall upon his countenance sate the black whose person jeffreys was now enabled to examine more narrowly than when they were walking arminarm in the neighbourhood of horsemonger lane gaol and that survey showed him a man of middle height wellbuilt and dressed in good but plain attire his features were too delicate to be of the negro cast he had no whiskers and his hair was of the glossiest jet and seemed to curl naturally on the table near him lay a pair of pistols and over the mantelpiece two swords hung crosswise beneath a formidable blunderbuss the black allowed jeffreys leisure to examine the apartment probably with the view of convincing him by the appearance of the weapons distributed about that he was in a place where treachery could be punished in a moment and that it would be prudent for him to resolve beforehand to accept any conditions that might be proposed to him after a short pause the black assumed an attitude significant of his intention to open the business of the mornings adventure john jeffreys he said in his calm but imposing manner i am well acquainted with all that concerns you and i know your readiness to serve those who pay you well now however well old death may have already paid or may promise to pay you for any thing you may have done or may have to do for him i will pay you better do you choose to enter my servicemy service exclusively remember because in serving me you can really serve none other you seem to know me well indeed master said jeffreys assuming a familiar tone now that he began to fancy the black to be no better than he should be dispense with jocularity sir exclaimed the other sternly and jeffreys shrank from the severe look fixed upon him and the haughty manner which accompanied the words just uttered look you continued the blacki may as well inform you at once that the companionship which you may expect to enjoy with me will not be of the kind to which you are accustomed with such men as those from whom you parted an hour ago if you serve me you must become my slave you must execute my bidding without even pausing to reflect on the motives which may instigate the commands i shall give you you must consent to become a mere automaton in my handsa machine that is to move only as i choose to direct there will be no familiarity between usno friendship all will be enveloped in the strictest mystery and you will often have to act without comprehending what you are doing or the objects you are destined to accomplish you will moreover be watched by invisible spiesat least by persons whose supervision you will not suspect so that the least attempt at treachery on your part will be sure to meet with instantaneous punishmentand that punishment is death i see nothing to object to sir in all that said jeffreys now speaking in a respectful tone providing the advantages are as great as they ought to be the advantages to you will be immense resumed the black and i will explain them in the first place there is nothing criminal in my servicenothing that can make you tremble when a stranger taps you on the shoulder on the contrary i will protect you even from the effects of the crimes which you have already committed should they transpire by accident or by the treachery of any of your former accomplices your salary shall be liberal and regularly paid and thus you will be freed from those vicissitudes which make such men as you rich today and poor tomorrow when the time shall comewhich it mustthat i no longer need your services i will settle on you an income for the remainder of your days these are the advantages which i offer you if you only fulfil one tenth part sir began jeffreys delighted at the prospects opening before him i am not in the habit of promising more than i can perform interrupted the black haughtily if my service suits you you enter it from this moment i accept the terms with joy and gratitude said jeffreys good exclaimed the black and tossing a wellfilled purse towards his new servant he said there are a hundred pounds to confirm the bargain one piece of advice i must give youindeed it involves a condition on which i must insist and this is that you do not through idle vanity display your gold to those persons who may be likely to suspect that you have not come honestly by it for you will not be able to give any satisfactory explanation and i do not choose you to get into any difficulty just that i may have the trouble of getting you out of it again why i say that you will be able to give no satisfactory explanation relative to the source of your prosperity is because you will not know who your master isnor where he livesnor any thing concerning him you will have no one to refer to in case you fall into difficulty at the same time i should hear of it and would hasten to assist you if you be worthy of my regardif you deserve that i should care for your welfare but how am i to receive your orders sir if i do not know where you live nor who you are inquired jeffreys his astonishment and awe increasing with every word that came from the lips of his new master shall not i know where you live said the black smiling for the first time since they had met and can i not come to you when i require your services will not the post convey my letters and have i not messengers to dispatch to you leave all those matters to me trouble not yourself relative to the means of communication between us and ask no questions which do not bear upon the mechanical and even blind service which you are to devote to me you will find me a good and liberal master if you prove faithful diligent and sincere but should you attempt to practise perfidy against meshould you deceive me in any one single thing however trifling i shall become a terrible and implacable enemy i can have no interest in deceiving you sir considering all the advantages your service holds out said jeffreys and yet i should like to know a little more of the nature of what you will require at my handswhat i shall have to do indeed noi will explain nothing returned the black i have already assured you that my service is safe so far as the laws of the country are concerned and that you will never be called upon to do a deed of which you need be ashamedsupposing that you have any shame in you i say this because i know that you have hitherto pursued evil coursesthat you have maintained a desperate connexion with benjamin bonesand that many robberies have taken place through your instrumentality if not actually perpetrated by your hands but if you remain in my service i hope to render you a better mani hope to see the day come when you will know what proper shame is and will blush at many of the actions of your earlier years of this enough however for the present i did not bring you hither to listen to moral lectures or sermons from my lips neither do i believe that precepts are of much benefit to a man who has pursued a long career of vice and error example does much morebut experience most of all when you shall have learnt the value of good conduct and the advantage of fidelity to him whom you serve you will see how far preferable it is to dwell without the fear of incurring the resentment of outraged laws than to lead an existence of harassing excitement produced by the perpetual dread of falling into the grasp of justice but again i say of this enough do you still adhere to your desire to enter my service i do sir was the answer delivered in a firm tone i must then warn you resumed the black that though i exact the most complete fidelity from youand though i should punish in a terrible manner the least perfidy on your partyet in respect to others you will often be compelled to exercise stratagem and practise plots which at first sight may appear treacherous you will have to wage war perhaps against some of your old companionsto defeat their projectseven to betray their schemes are you prepared to agree to all this i am prepared to obey your orders in all things was the reply without even questioning my motives that was a condition already imposed by you and agreed to by me and you will undertake never to breathe to a single soul a word relative to the secret service in which you are engaged remember added the black hastily i merely mention this as a warning because i should immediately detect any treachery on your part and should not hesitate to punish it terribly i wish you would at once put me to the test in some way or another sir said jeffreys you seem to know all about mebut in what way you got your information is of course a mystery to me however you do know me welland having that knowledge of me i can perfectly understand that you do not feel disposed to trust to my bare word in any thing now give me something to doput me on trial in some way or anotherand then judge whether i am the man to serve a good paymaster or not you speak to the pointand i will at once put you to the test you solicit returned the black and mind how you reply to my questionsbecause even were you to amuse me with deceptive answers now in a few hours i should discover the real truth and my vengeance would overtake youaye even in the midst of those companions whom i am about to ask you to betray in a word then what was the nature of the business which took you and two other men to old deaths lodgings last evening and detained you there a great portion of the night one word sir before i answer the question exclaimed jeffreys if i reveal to you every thing which took place between myself those two men and old death last night will you not think that in the same manner i shall betray to them what is now taking place between you and me i have already told you that the greatest proof of faithful service towards me is to betray others returned the black and i have given you ample assurance that if you attempt to betray me to others certain vengeance will overtake you then if you consider my treachery towards others as a proof of fidelity to you sir continued jeffreys i am content to be put to such a test you ask me what took place between old death tim the snammer josh pedler and myself last night and i will tell you word for word a few weeks ago one thomas rainford was hanged at horsemonger lane gaol and was buried in st lukes churchyard tonight old death means to have the coffin dug up and conveyed to the house of certain people named bunce in earl street seven dials to which house he himself will move today it seems that this rainford was the eldest brother of the earl of ellingham against whom old death has a dreadful spite and so he intends to have the body of tom rain taken out of the coffin a rope put round its neck and a placard on its breast stating that the famous highwayman was the earls brother the body is then to be conveyed to pall mall and placed on the steps of the noblemans house this is one part of the scheme concocted last night and which me and the two other men were engaged to execute go on said the black in a low tone the part thats to come is worse than what ive already told you sir observed jeffreys and i am afraid that if you know i consented to serve in the matter go ongo on exclaimed the black impatiently well sirsince i must i will tell you all continued jeffreys old death has found out that a lady named estherestheri forget never mind go on i say cried the black more impatiently than before i was saying that old death had found out that this lady was the mistress of tom rain the famous highwayman and that the earl has a great esteem for her he has also heard that the earl is goingor was goingto marry another lady named hatfield and he has made up his mind to have these two ladies carried off and conveyed to bunces house in seven dials when he has got them there sir he intendsbut i really go on man exclaimed the black what does he mean to do to put their eyes out replied jeffreys in a low tone and speaking with considerable hesitation the fiendthe monster ejaculated the black starting from his chair but instantly composing himself he resumed his seat saying was that the full extent of the atrocity planned and agreed upon last night that was the whole scheme sir answered jeffreys benjamin bones agreed to give us each a hundred pounds for serving him in those matters and he paid us each thirty on account show me your share said the black abruptly jeffreys hesitated and turned pale beware how you deceive metake care how you trifle with me exclaimed his master if you received those thirty pounds from old death you must have them about you now for i know he added emphatically and significantly that between the time you left his lodgings and stopped at your own door whither i followed you expressly to ascertain where you lived you entered no place at which you could have deposited the money jeffreys no longer dared to hesitate but taking a large roll of banknotes and a quantity of gold from his pocket he spread them upon the table saying the thirty pounds i received from old death last night are amongst this lot and whence did you obtain such a large sum demanded the black hastily glancing over the amount there are several hundreds of pounds here well sir said jeffreys completely overawed by the tone and manner of his new master as well as by the mystery which surrounded him i will tell you all about itand then you will be convinced that i am ready and anxious to secure your good opinion i was until very lately in the service of a mr torrens ah exclaimed the black starting as if with sudden surprise at the information he had just received then again composing himself he said in his usual calm but authoritative manner proceed this mr torrens was paid a sum of money a few days agoabout fifteen hundred pounds continued jeffreys and i put old death up to it benjamin bones againbenjamin bones at the bottom of every villainy cried the black in an excited manner well sirand so old death sent two menthe very same men who was with me at his lodgings last nightto rob mr torrens of the money they succeeded and old death changed the large notes into small ones and gold because large notes are useless to such men as tim the snammer and josh pedler if they attempted to change a fifty pound note they would get taken up in a moment whereas they can manage to smash small notes at the publichouses where they deal so old death had his share of the plunder and mine is part of that heap i have now told you every thing sir nonot every thing said the black in a more serious and solemn tone than he had yet adopted during his interview with jeffreys mr torrens is in newgatecharged with a fearful crime he continued and his daughter rosamond is in a state bordering on despair at the house of kind and generous people with whom i am acquainted good god who are you exclaimed jeffreys surveying his master in terror and amazement you know every thingevery body the least word that is uttered leads to a subject with which you are sure to be acquainted oh sirif you have had me brought here to do me a mischiefto get me into troubleto make me confess things fear not jeffreys interrupted the black in a reassuring tone i am acquainted with mr torrens version of the history of that murderand i know that suspicion rests not upon you but i now perceive clearly that the tale which mr torrens has told to his daughter and which his daughter has repeated to those friends of mine who have granted her an asylumi perceive that this tale is alas too true strange and incredible as it at first appeared yes mr torrens did not deceive his daughter the house was entered by two men and robbed as he described the occurrenceand those two men were the real murderers of sir henry courtenay jeffreys continued the black in a lower and more measured tone you are now completely in my power naystart notfear not it is far from my intention to harm you but it is as well for you to know that you are now bound to me in two ways first because i pay you for your servicessecondly because i will denounce you as an accomplice and an accessory before the fact in respect to that murder if you hesitate to fulfil my orders on the other hand if you remain faithfulif you serve me with that blind obedience and implicit zeal which i exact from you you have nothing to fear but every thing to hope before i was in your power i had made up my mind to serve you in the manner you state said jeffreys and now of course i am compelled to do so give me your orderswhat is there for me to undertake shall i inform against josh pedler and tim splint or shall i go and set the constables upon old death who was an accomplice in the robbery since he sent those two men to commit it silence jeffreys exclaimed the black imperiously it is not for you to suggest any thingbut to perform what is suggested by myself and rememberi will not allow you to take a single step in these matters unauthorised by me stir not of your own accordor you will only involve yourself in ruin see the position in which you are placed if the two men who murdered sir henry courtenay be surrendered up to justice they may confess alland their confession would implicate you and benjamin bones nevertheless an innocent victim shall not be sacrificed to the bloodthirsty law which authorises the punishment of death mr torrens must be saved this is an affair which demands the greatest caution and if you utter a word more than i direct you to speak or take a single step unknown to me you will be undone but time has passed rapidlymore rapidly than i had expected while we have been thus conversing together added the black looking at his watch it is now daylightand you cannot depart hence until the evening he knew by the hour that morning had dawned some time but the windowshutters were closed and the curtains were thick and ample so that not a gleam of sunshine penetrated into that apartment where the candles were still burning yesyou must remain here until the evening repeated the black at what time was it arranged that you should meet the other agents of old death in order to visit st lukes churchyard tonight at eleven answered jeffreys and the place of appointment is at the back of the burialground but do you intend sir that i should fulfil my agreement with benjamin bones ask me no questions cried his master evidently much excitedif not absolutely perplexed by the various ideas that were agitating in his brain i have not yet resolved how to act i must be alone for some hours to meditate in the meantime you no doubt stand in need of rest follow me with these words the black took up a candle and led the way into an adjoining room which was fitted up as a bedchamber there also the shutters were closed and the curtains drawn over the windows this will be your apartment until the evening said the black but as i am accustomed to adopt all proper precautions to ensure the complete carrying out of my views i shall be compelled to place some one with you and i most moreover request that those shutters remain closed throughout the day jeffreys new master rang a bell and in a few minutes a tall thin genteellooking lad but of a complexion as dark as his own answered the summons csar said the elder black addressing the lad you will stay in this room until i give you permission to leave it and you will see that jeffreys whom i have taken into my service he added significantly is supplied with every thing which he requires in the shape of refreshments yes sir replied the youth in a respectful manner the black then quitted the room and jeffreys remained with the lad who had been addressed by the name of csar chapter lxxxviii scenes at the blackamoors house when the black returned to the parlour where he had received from the lips of jeffreys revelations which had produced a strange effect upon his mind he threw himself upon the sofa and gave way to his reflections although he had been up all night yet he experienced no sensation of weariness he possessed a soul of such indomitable energy that by a natural kind of sympathy between mind and matter it sustained even the physical powers to a wondrous degree we must follow him in the train of meditations into which he was plunged for the affairs in which he suddenly found himself interested through the confessions of john jeffreys were of so complicated and so difficult a natureinvolving too so many delicate pointsthat to a mind endowed with one whit less of courage or with one gleam less of clearness those affairs would have appeared to be entangled beyond all possibility of a safe and prudent unravelling let the reader bear in mind that there were two distinct affairs in question although they might at a first glance be confounded because certain persons who were connected with one were also involved in the other the first of these affairs was the scheme of old death to avenge himself on the earl of ellinghama scheme involving many frightful details such as the exhumation of a coffin the capture of esther de medina and lady hatfield and the atrocity of blinding those fair and interesting creatures the other affair was the accusation of mr torrens of a crime which he had not committed and the necessity of proving his innocence if those miscreants tim the snammer and josh pedler be informed against reasoned the black within himself they will be certain that either benjamin bones or john jeffreys has betrayed them and they will accordingly give a full and complete explanation the result of which would be that the whole four would swing together but i am bound to save jeffreys from that terrible fate and god forbid that that i should be the means direct or indirect of sending benjamin bones to the scaffold and yet on the other hand knowing all that i have elicited from jeffreys and acting in the true spirit of that mission which i have voluntarily undertaken i dare not allow this innocent man torrens to be condemned by a frightful combination of circumstantial evidence when the utterance of a single word will prove him guiltless and fix the crime on those who really perpetrated it how stands the matter then torrens must be saved on the one hand but the real murderers must be allowed to escape on the other oh this is a fatal necessitya dreadful alternative and yet it is imperious the black rose and paced the room with slow and measured steps he reflected profoundly he separated all the details of the two complicated matters which occupied his thoughts and examined them one by one in respect to the vengeance of benjamin bonesit was thus that his musings were continued after a timethat scheme must be completely strangled at onceannihilated at its very commencement not for worlds must aught scandalous or degrading occur to arthur earl of ellinghamnot for worlds must the relationship subsisting between him and thomas rainford be published and proclaimed yesbenjamin bones must be rendered powerless for the futureand yet how can this be accomplished without permitting a legal tribunal to seize upon him the black continued to pace the room his sable countenance denoting by its workings the searching keenness with which his mind seized upon and examined each successive project that suggested itself as a means to accomplish all his objects and carry out all his aims in a manner certain to produce the results which he was anxious and resolved to bring about at length one particular scheme flashed to his mind and the smile which appeared on his countenance as his imagination seized on that project was an augury of its subsequent adoption he weighed it well in all its detailshe calculated its consequenceshe minutely examined all its certain resultsand he arrived at the conviction that though a large and even a dangerous measure it was the only one whereby all his designs could be effected having resolved to carry it into execution the black felt his mind relieved of a considerable loadand seating himself at the table he wrote the following letter the account which rosamond torrens received from her father relative to the assassination of sir henry courtenay and which that unfortunate girl recited to you is strictly and substantially correct accident has enabled me to discover the real perpetrators of the crime and mr torrens shall be saved you will know in what terms to convey this assurance to that poor suffering creature whom you have taken under your protection the black sealed this note and addressed it to miss esther de medina manor house finchley he then repaired to the room where he had left jeffreys and csar together and found that the former having partaken of some refreshments had thrown himself on the bed and fallen into a profound sleep csar said the black you must hasten to finchley with this letter take your horse and delay not on your return come back by way of grafton street and tell dr lascelles that i desire to see him as soon as he can possibly visit me csar immediately departed to execute these commissions and the black seated himself by the side of the bed on which jeffreys was sleeping nearly an hour passed and the man did not awake the black rang the bell and a domestic in plain clothes answered the summons wilton said his master remain here and keep watch upon this personpointing to the sleeper when he awakes ring the bell the servant bowed obedience to these instructions and the black left the room several hours had passed away and it was three oclock in the afternoon csar had returned with letters for his master who had scarcely made an end of their perusal when dr lascelles was announced well my dear friend said the physician what new scheme have you now in view in what new project do you require my assistance sit down doctor and listen to me attentively observed the black for many and strange incidents have occurred since i saw you last but perhaps you have been to finchley and in that case one of those circumstances to which i allude will have been made known to you no my dear friend replied dr lascelles depositing his hat and gloves on one chair and himself in another i have not had time to call upon the medinas since they removed to their country residence i have been experimentalising on a most splendid brain which the surgeon of st bartholomews hospital was kind enough to send me as a present but of what nature is the circumstance of which i should have heard at finchley had i called nothing disagreeable i hope i will explain it to you in as few words as possible answered the black seating himself opposite to the physician the day before yesterdayat about five oclock in the eveningmr de medina and esther were walking along the high road in the immediate vicinity of the manor to which they had removed as you are well aware in the morning when they saw a beautiful young creature sitting on the step of a stile and evidently a prey to the most heartrending anguish they accosted herspoke kindly to herand at length induced her to tell just so much of her sorrowful tale as to enlist their warmest sympathies in her behalf they took her to the manor but on their arrival the poor girl was so overcome by illness fatigue and distress of mind that esther insisted on her retiring to rest yesterday morning she was so far recovered as to render it unnecessary to send for you in your medical capacity and esther assured her that she might not only look upon the manor as her home but that she should be treated with all the kindness attention and respect due to her misfortunes it then appears that the poor creature made a confidant of esther and revealed her entire story which shows how deeply she is to be pitied and how cruel were the circumstances that had driven her from her home and made her resolve to fly from london as from a city of pestilence the entire details of that story i will give you presently yesterday afternoon i repaired to the manor and the particulars connected with the young lady were confidentially narrated to me by mr de medina last night the metropolis rang with the rumours of a dreadful murder having been discovered the assassination of sir henry courtenay remarked the physician and the murderer a gentleman named torrens is in newgate the alleged murderer you mean doctor said the black emphatically and now prepare yourself to hear an amazing revelationfor the young creature who found an asylum at finchley manor is the daughter of that alleged murderer and her name is rosamond but surely she could not have been in any way implicated patience doctorpatience said the black on hearing last night of the arrest of mr torrens i immediately dispatched csar to finchley with a note to mr de medina containing the sad intelligence and i find by letters which i have just received he added glancing towards the documents which lay open on the table that the news were broken as delicately as possible to the unhappy girl nevertheless she is as you may suppose a prey to the most lively grief and it has been with the greatest difficulty that mr de medina and esther have restrained her from flying to newgate to console her father let me now relate her history to you the black then detailed those incidents in connexion with rosamond which are already known to the readersave and except the dreadful fact that mr torrens had sold his daughters virtue to sir henry courtenay for though the unhappy girl had confessed the outrage which had been perpetrated on her she knew notas the reader will rememberthat her own father had been an accomplice in the fearful deed i have now some further explanations to give you doctor continued the black and then i shall have completed my long long preface to the business which induced me to request your presence here now in pursuance of that grand and difficult project the nature of which is so well known to you i resolved to enlist one of old deaths confederates or rather instruments in my own service accordingly last night as soon as i had dispatched csar to finchley with the note containing the intelligence of mr torrens arrest i went into the borough and watched in the neighbourhood of old deaths lodgings for i informed you a few days ago if you recollect that csar had succeeded in discovering the abode of that terrible man well i kept not my watch uselessly for i soon beheld three men enter the house in horsemonger lane individually and at short intervals two of them were unknown to mealthough i have since found that their names were by no means unfamiliar but the third was a fellow of whom i knew something this was john jeffreysonce a servant in the employ of sir christopher blunt now it immediately struck me that this was the very man who would suit my purposes for he is craftyintelligentand always ready to serve the best paymaster i accordingly resolved to enlist him in my employ and to this determination i was the more readily brought because i felt convinced that mischief was brewing under the auspices of old death the fact of the three men arriving so mysteriouslysingly and at short intervals on the same evening evidently by appointmentand the length of time they remained in the place were sufficient arguments to prove to a far less experienced person than myself that a council of desperate men was being held for no good purposes it was not until past three this morning that the villains separated i had already made up my mind how to act and a hackneycoach was ordered by me to wait beneath the wall of horsemonger lane i fancied that old deaths visitors would depart singly as they had arrived and my expectations were so far realised that jeffreys went off by himself i resolved to follow him home firstfor i suspected that he lived at no great distance because i thought that if i could not succeed in inducing him to accompany me i should at least know where to find him on another occasion at his own door i accosted him and by working on his fears by means of my mysterious behaviour as well as by holding out to him vague threats that i was prepared to carry him off by force if he should resist me i succeeded in bringing him blindfold to this house well done exclaimed the physician and so i presume you have regularly enlisted the respectable mr jeffreys into your servicethereby securing the aid of a spy in the enemys camp the very object aimed atthe very point gained cried the black jeffreys under the joint influence of bribery and menaces is completely mine and he gave me proofs of his fidelity by revealing to me many interesting matters indeed it was providentially fortunate that i got him into my power and service just at this particular time as you shall judge for yourself he then related the details of the damnable conspiracy planned by old death and to be executed by his myrmidons against the peace of the earl of ellingham and the happiness of lady hatfield and esther de medina this man is a perfect monster ejaculated dr lascelles indignantly how is it possible that you can have any forbearance my dear friend set your retainers to watch for himhave him capturedand lock him up for life in one of the dungeons which he himself doubtless rendered serviceable to his own purposes on more than one occasion patience doctor said the black nothing must be done rashly nor without due consideration besides you are well aware that my object is to endeavour to reform that bad man reform the devil cried the physician impatiently you know very well that i ridiculed the idea when you first started it and i intend to try the experiment doctor observed the black calmly but firmly in the meantime pray listen to me in the course of the conversation which i had with jeffreys this morning he mentioned the name of torrens and to my surprise i found that he had lately been in that gentlemans service when rosamond told her story to esther the poor girl alluded several times to her fathers manservant as i stated to you just now but as she did not happen to mention his nameor if she did it was not mentioned to mei was unaware of the identity of that domestic and jeffreys till the latter himself suffered the fact to transpire then was it that i also received a corroboration of the truth of the version which mr torrens had given his daughter of those circumstances that led to the death of sir henry courtenay for jeffreys instigated the robbery at torrens cottagebenjamin bones appointed two men to execute itand those men assassinated the baronet illustration you have thus become the depositor of a very agreeable secret my dear friend said the doctor somewhat ironically how do you intend to act for my part i consider the position to be embarrassing for if those two men are arrested they will perhaps inform against jeffreys and old deathand in this case you lose not only your new dependant but also the opportunity of trying your great moral theorywhich i call great moral nonsenseupon the respectable mr benjamin bones doctordoctor exclaimed the black in a reproachful tone is this your friendship for me is this the way in which you fulfil your promise of assistance pardon me my dear fellow cried the goodhearted physician wringing his companions hand violently if i talk to you in that fashion it is simply because i am deeply anxious for your welfare and thatin consequence of certain circumstances which we need not specifyi look upon you just as if you were my own son you know that i am ready to serve you by day and by nightthat you may command me at all times and my purse to its fullest extent a thousand thanks doctor for these proofs of generous friendship interrupted the black your assistance i indeed require on your purse thanks to the liberality of mr de medina and the earl of ellingham i shall not be compelled to make any inroad then in what way can i assist you demanded the physician i will explain myself continued the black but first i must tell you that the very two men who murdered sir henry courtenay are of the gang employed by old death to persecute the earl and the two ladies in whom we all feel an interesti mean georgiana hatfield and esther de medina this makes the business more complicated said the doctor because if those two men are arrested on the charge of murder they may perhaps confess not only that old death urged them to the robbery and that jeffreys was an accomplice in it but they may also state the services which benjamin bones hired them to perform respecting the earl and the two ladiesthereby at once publishing to the world that thomas rainford was indeed the elder brother of the earl and propagating the infamous scandal relative to esther de medina having been the said thomas rainfords mistress you embrace the whole difficultyor rather the greater portion of it at once my dear doctor exclaimed the black delighted to find that his friend entered so minutely and with such keen perception into the affair the business presses in every way in the first place it is necessary that an innocent man should be relieved as speedily as possible from the dreadful charge hanging over his head and secondly the exhumation of the coffin in saint lukes churchyard must be prevented this night certainly it must observed dr lascelles for if once old death knew that the coffin contained not the remains of thomas rainford the discovery might engender certain suspicions in the mind of such an astute old scoundrel as he in a word doctor torrens must be saved and yet the two men who rejoice in the names of joshua pedler and timothy splint must not be handed over to justice observed the black such ought to be the policy adopted said the physician and remember that though these two men are not to be rendered up to justice they must be taken such care of for the future as to commit no more murders and accept no more employ in the service of such miscreants as old death of that i shall indeed take good care said the black but how will it be possible to save torrens without handing splint and pedler over to justice in his place demanded the physician you will be a clever fellow if you accomplish that difficulty i am prepared to encounter it doctor returned the black and you must aid me in the business are you so intimately acquainted with any magistrate or justice of the peace that you could invite him to dinner what an extraordinary question cried dr lascelles laughing how will my asking a magistrate to dinner serve your purposes only thus far responded the black that you would have the kindness to walk a little way with him on his return home in the evening and that i should have you both very quietly kidnapped blindfolded and carried off to some place where you would both have to receive and witness the statements made by two men named joshua pedler and timothy splint whom i shall have safe in my own custody within a few hours i understand said the physician laughing heartily capital capital but by the byewhen i think of ityour old friend sir christopher blunt was gazetted two days ago to be one of his majestys justices of the peace for the county of middlesex would he not serve your purpose or do you think the physician paused and looked the black steadfastly and significantly in the face he will answer admirably exclaimed the latter after a few moments reflection yesbetter than any other all things considered i will undertake to get him into my power without giving you the trouble to ask him to dinner but i must request doctor that tomorrow night at eleven oclock you will take a lonely walk in some very retired spot and at a good distance off too so that you may lose all trace of the path pursued by your kidnappers you do not require two persons surely said lascelles yesit will be better responded the black a justice of the peace and a competent and credible witness do you happen to have any patient in the neighbourhood of bethlem for instance let me see said the doctor in a musing manner yes he cried an old lady whom i have not visited for some time very good observed the black then you can call on her tomorrow evening and between ten and eleven as you are returning on footon foot rememberyou will be set upon by half a dozen ruffians he continued laughing who will blindfold you shove you into a chaise and carry you offyou never will be able to say whither i understand you my dear friend said the physician laughing heartily also your scheme is admirable and certain of success thus far then the business is settled observed the black at that moment csar entered the room and informed his master that the man jeffreys had just awoke having slept uninterruptedly for many hours but you have not left him alone csar exclaimed the black no sirwilton is with him was the answer given by the youth good observed his master then turning towards the doctor he added if that fellow were to open the shutters and look out into the street he might recognise the locality and i intend to allow him no opportunity of playing me false you act wisely said the physician who then took his departure while the black repaired to the chamber where jeffreys was remaining the man rose and bowed respectfully on the entrance of his master who having dismissed wilton seated himself and proceeded to address his new dependant in the following manner i have resolved how to act in the emergencies which have arisen and to which i have devoted my best consideration you will not only be saved from the consequences of your connivance with the robbery which took place at torrens cottage and which ended in so tragic a manner but you will likewise be rendered secure from the possibility of being in any way implicated hereafter my promises will be faithfully kept if you prove faithful but if on the other hand you deceive me i will find you out wheresoever you may hide yourself and you shall assuredly perish on the scaffold for you cannot conceive the extent of my power to reward nor of my ability to punish i have seen enough sir to be convinced that you are some great person said jeffreys and i assure you that you will find me faithful and devoted act according to your words and you will bless the day when you first encountered me observed the black and now listen to my instructions soon after it is dark you will be conveyed away from this house and at the proper hour you will keep your appointment tonight with pedler and splint you say that you are to meet them behind st lukes church do you mean in the road which separates the two buryinggrounds from each other that is the place of meeting sir was the answer very well continued the black is there any chance of old death forming one of the party not the slightest sir he loves to plan and plot but he usually pays agents to execute i could have wished it had been otherwise however you will meet your two friends according to agreement and you will endeavour to keep them in conversation for a few minutes in the road between the two burialgrounds this will give my people time to surround them as it were for it is my intention to arrest those two men this very night jeffreys looked alarmed and said they will be sure to think that i have betrayed them sir leave all that to me returned the black i will take care that they shall never have the opportunity of injuring you wiltonthe servant who has just left this chamberwill conduct the expedition to night and he will allow you to escape you will then proceed as quickly as possible to seven dials where old death according to what you told me this morning must have already taken up his abodeand you will tell him that when it came to the last moment tim the snammer and josh pedler were afraid to undertake the business of digging up the coffin and resolved to have nothing more to do with him or his affairs but you will assure him that you remain faithful to him and that you can recommend two friends of your own who will be delighted to do all he requires for a quarter of the sum he agreed to pay pedler and splint if he accepts the service of your pretended friends you will make an appointment to meet him in some low neighbourhood the day after tomorrow in the evening let the time named be a late hour and should he wish you and your friends to call on him in earl street raise objections as it does not suit my purpose that the appointment should be there it must be a place of meeting from which he has to walk home afterwards i understand all your commands sir said jeffreys and you may depend upon them being faithfully executed i rely upon you observed the black and after a few moments consideration he added tomorrow evening at nine oclock punctually you must be in wilderness row beneath the wall of the charter house gardens and i shall send some one to receive an account of your proceedings with old death and give you further instructions but once more i say be faithfulbe prudentand avoid any vain or foolish display of your money i wish you would have more confidence in me sir exclaimed jeffreys then after a brief pause he said as an idea struck him i have a great deal of money about me sirand i wish you would take care of it for me now i am convinced of your honest intentions my good fellow said his master in a kinder tone than he had yet adopted towards the man if you propose to leave your money with me as a guarantee of your good faith i do not now require any such security but if your object be to place it in safety i will accept the trust well sirlet it be in the way you have just mentioned returned jeffreys here is a drawerlock up any thing you choose therein and take the key with you said the black jeffreys did as he was desired wilton was again summonedan excellent dinner was supplied the new dependant and the servant who was appointed to remain with himand the black retired to his own apartment soon after it was dark jeffreys was blindfolded and conducted to a private carriage which was waiting wilton accompanied him in the vehicle which after driving about for nearly an hour stopped at last and jeffreys on removing the bandage from his eyes and alighting found himself in an obscure street in the immediate vicinity of shoreditch church chapter lxxxix the surprisejeffreys and old death the deep tones of st lukes bell proclaiming the hour of eleven oscillated though the gusty air as tim the snammer entered the narrow road dividing the two burialgrounds belonging to the church john jeffreys was already at the place of appointment and not many moments had elapsed after those two met ere josh pedler joined them bringing with him the necessary implements for the work of resurrectionists and which he instantly threw over the wall what a windy night it is said tim the snammer and how precious dark all the better for our business observed josh pedler i should have been here a little earlier but i had such a cursed deal of trouble to get rid of that bothering wench tilda she wouldnt let me come out at first and swore that if i did shed foller me and did she follow you demanded jeffreys deuce a bit answered josh i was obliged to give her a good drubbing because she whimpered and then another to make her hold her tongue and afterwards we kissed and made it upand so she went quietly to bed what strange things women are to be sure if you beat em theyre sure to love you all the more well are we going to stand here talking all night cried tim the snammer who knows but what theres a watchman about here i know there isnt said jeffreys because i made the enquiry in a careless kind of way at a publichouse close by where i bought some brandy in a pint bottle thats capital cried tim give us a dram old feller i got it on purpose to keep the cold out and our spirits up said jeffreys playing his part admirably so as to gain time in obedience to the orders he had received from his master who was it that came with tidmarsh this morning to see the place where tom rain is buried i did answered tim the snammer smacking his lips in approval of the brandy and handing the bottle to josh pedler ah tom rain was a fine fellow said jeffreys i knew him well in fact i was with old sir christopher and frank curtis the night he robbed them what a bold dashing and yet coolheaded chap rainford was the finest highwayman that england ever had observed josh pedler returning the bottle to jeffreys beat your dick turpins and your jack sheppards all to nothink added tim the snammer i say josh let you and me take to the road when weve done old deaths business for him and sacked the blunt hes still got to pay us wellwell well see about it tim answered pedler buthush heres some one coming lets pretend to be walking on we havent time to jump over after the tools the three accordingly put themselves in motion but jeffreys knew pretty well that the critical moment was now at hand tim the snammer affected to whistle a tune in a careless way and josh pedler began talking loud on some indifferent subject meantime the footsteps advanced and it was evident that more than one person was approaching in fact there seemed to be three or four but josh pedler and tim splint had not the least suspicion of impending danger they thought that a party of jovial fellows were returning from the publichousean idea that was excited by the merry song which one of the persons now approaching was singing a few minutes brought the two parties within ten paces of each other when a sudden and suspicious noise was heard as of a rustling of clothes against the walls which bounded the road both tim the snammer and josh pedler stopped short alarmed and irresolute the next instant they as well as jeffreys were seized by two persons who leaped upon them from the walls and by those who had advanced along the road jeffreys was liberated the moment he mentioned his name and he hurried away as quickly as possible from the scene of the surprise and capturebut not before he had witnessed enough even in the obscurity of the night to convince him that josh pedler and tim the snammer were gagged and rendered powerless in the grasp of the agents of the mysterious blackamoor and such was indeed the fact before they were able to offer the slightest resistance or even utter a cry they were reduced to the condition just described their captors immediately divided into two parties each bearing off a prisoner so that the villains had not even the consolation of remaining together so well were all the arrangements made to ensure the complete success of the affair that a vehicle was waiting in the vicinity of each end of the road separating the burialgrounds and the moment the prisoners were thrust inside bandages were tied over their eyes tim the snammer was the first who arrived at the place of the villains destination at the expiration of an hour from the time of his capture the vehicle which had purposely driven about in a circuitous manner stopped at a house into which the prisoner was hurried up a flight of stairs he was then ledthrough several roomsand at length down a long spiral descent of stone steps a trap shutting with a crashing sound above and a huge door opening and closing with the din of massiveness belowthen along a place in which the rapid tread of the numerous feet echoed with a gloomy and hollow sound as if in a paved and vaulted passageand lastly into a dungeon where the wretched man was deposited unbound and left to himself the huge door closing upon himsuch was the hurried progress and ultimate destination of tim the snammer in the strange and unknown place to which his captors had borne him the treatment experienced by josh pedler was precisely the same save that he did not enter his prisonhouse until a good half hour after the arrival of his companion in iniquity in the meantime john jeffreys proceeded to seven dials and found old death seated with mrs bunce toby having been dismissedas was usual when mr bones had business to transact in earl streetto the publichouse to amuse himself with his pipe and his pint old death was surprised and alarmed when he beheld jeffreys make his appearance so early and unaccompanied by tim splint and josh pedler is any thing the matter enquired the ancient miscreant as mrs bunce carefully closed the room door no great harmonly something to delay your business replied jeffreys wellif its no worse there isnt much harm done said old death but where are the others its just on account of them that nothing has been done tonight answered jeffreys in two words they funked over the affair and have given it up what cried old death his countenance becoming grim and ghastly with rage and disappointment those scoundrels have received my moneymy good moneythirty pounds each in advanceand have given up the business you are joking jeffreysyou are bantering me why tim the snammer would go through fire and water for such a sum of money as i promised him and josh pedler would sell his skin for half the amount all i can say is this mr bones continued jeffreys that i was punctual at the place of meeting at five minutes to eleven and when tim splint and josh pedler made their appearance they said they had changed their minds and should not proceed farther in the business and that i might come and tell you so if i liked the villainsthe rascals growled old death clenching his fists and working his toothless jaws about horribly as he spoke i asked them what had made them come to such a resolution proceeded jeffreys and they said that on account of torrenss affair they had plenty of money and it was useless to risk transportation by turning resurrectionists at least before it was all spent i argued with thembut it was all in vain they went away to some publichouse and as i couldnt do the job myself i started off here to tell you what had occurred those men dont know me or they would not attempt to play their tricks in this fashion murmured old death then turning towards jeffreys he said in a louder tone and in a conciliating manner but you are a good fellowyou are faithful and true as i always found you and i am pleased with you the day will come when tim the snammer and josh pedler shall bitterly repent of their conduct but in the meantime i am not to be disappointed in my vengeancei will not be foiled i have set my mind on a particular courseand i will follow it there are other men in the world who can do all you require mr bones besides tim the snammer and josh pedler said jeffreys i wish you had spoken to me first of all why so demanded old death hastily because i could have got a couple of chaps to help me to do all the business and who would have been contented with a quarter of the money you promised those sneaking scoundrels splint and pedler answered jeffreys indeed cried old death eagerly you are a good fellow jeffreysan excellent fellow and you may always calculate upon having me as your friend but where are these people that you speak ofwho are they you dont know any thing of them i fancy was the reply they are like myselfservants out of place but they are a precious sight worse off than me in respect to moneymatters and would be glad to do any odd job for a tenpound note or so and when can you see them demanded old death when can i see them repeated jeffreys in a musing tone as if he were giving the matter his most serious consideration whyi might hunt them up tomorrow nightin fact im sure i could and you can make an appointment for me to see them the night after said olddeath with fiendish eagerness to consummate the atrocious vengeance which he had planned i will undertake to do that mr bones returned jeffreys shall i explain to them the nature of the business before they see you or not nolet me see them first said old death or stayyou may sound em about the resurrection businessbut mention no names at all dont tell them who has employed you to treat with them mr bones is a good judge of peoples faces observed mrs bunce and knows by their looks whether theyre to be trusted or not generally speaking i dogenerally speaking said old death now for instance he added staring from beneath his shaggy overhanging brows full upon the countenance of jeffreys i know that youre faithfuland i can trust you the man to whom these words were addressed met the searching look fixed upon him with an unchanging cheek and eyes that quailed not although for a moment he feared lest old death had suddenly entertained some suspicion concerning him but it seemed that the ancient miscreant with all his boasted skill in reading the human physiognomy was on this occasion completely at fault to tell you the truth jeffreys he continued i never liked the looks of the snammer but i thought that good pay would make him faithful however he will yet repent his conduct towards meand so shall josh pedler if it wasnt for their infernal treachery my vengeance would be by this time in a fair way towards prompt and speedy gratification for if that earl was allowed to go scotfreeif i didnt punish himaye and fearfully toofor all the injuries he has done to me i should go mad my property all destroyedmy riches taken from methe very house that was so useful to me dont take on so mr bones interrupted mrs bunce in a coaxing manner comeshall i put a leetle brandy on the table nogin ejaculated old death savagely then turning towards jeffreys he said you wont bring those friends of yours here mind the night after tomorrow it will be quite time to let them know where i live and where business will afterwards lead them to meet me when i have satisfied myself that they are of the right sort you dont think i would ask you to employ any one that i wasnt sure of exclaimed jeffreys affecting an angry tone nono my good fellow hastily responded old death but experienceexperience teaches us much and my experience is greater than yours cometake a glass of ginandwater and dont be annoyed i didnt mean to vex you say no more about it then observed jeffreys where shall we meet the night after tomorrow let me see mused benjamin bones aloud i have an appointment for that evening in the actual neighbourhood of st lukes church and theres a flash ken in helmet row called the stout house we will meet there between ten and eleven agreed said jeffreys have you any farther instructions nonenone my good fellow answered old death only dont promise your two friends too much for the services required of them you see how i have lost already by those scoundrels pedler and splint but i will be even with themi will the two persons i shall introduce to you will do your work well and cheap mr bones replied jeffreys and i am sure you will be satisfied i shall now be offbecause i may perhaps find them tonight at all events we meet at the stout house helmet row the night after next exactly said old death by the way if you run against tim the snammer or josh pedler just try and find out where they are to be met with and let me know ill bear it in mind answered jeffreys he then took his departure well pleased at the success which had hitherto attended his proceedings in working out the designs and fulfilling the instructions of his master but who was that masterand where dwelt the mysterious personage ah these were points which defied all conjecture on the following evening shortly before nine oclock jeffreys was pacing wilderness row in obedience to the appointment arranged by his employer he was not kept waiting many minutes ere the youth csar accosted him our master said the lad has sent me to inquire of you the result of your interview with old death and he desires me to assure you that he is well satisfied with your conduct of last night inasmuch as you effectually amused your companions until their captors came up but what of old death he has completely fallen into the snare laid for him answered jeffreys and will meet me and my two friends he added significantly at the stout house helmet row tomorrow night between ten and eleven good observed csar wilton and another of our masters retainers both dressed in a suitable manner will meet you at that place tomorrow night shortly before ten so that you may have time to arrange the plan of proceeding together before old death makes his appearance i shall not fail to be there at a quarter to ten answered jeffreys have you any further orders for me yes replied csar listen tomorrow you must endeavour to find out the abode of one tidmarsh a friend of old deaths that will be easily accomplished tomorrow night when i meet benjamin bones said jeffreys you are aware that the object of my appointment with him is to introduce to him two friends of mine who will undertake to dig up the remains of tom rainford the famous highwayman yesyes said csar hastily well continued jeffreys i am supposed to be the leader of the party by whom that task is to be performed and i shall tell old death that he must send tidmarsh with me in the morning to point out the place where rainford is buried he will then let me know where tidmarsh lives or else will at once make him write a note to that person to arrange an appointment i understand said csar but suppose that old death will do neither alleging that he will call himself on tidmarsh and send him to meet you on the following morning at some place named in this case all will be wrong because old death is to be captured tomorrow night on his way home had you not better call in seven dials tomorrow morning tell old death that you have found your friends and made the appointment with them for the evening and then ask him to let tidmarsh at once afford you the clue you will require totothe grave of rainford asked the lad his voice trembling and hesitating slightly as he uttered the concluding words of his question i understand you perfectly csar replied jeffreys leave it to me to manage as our master desires i will undertake to be able to give wilton good news of tidmarsh tomorrow night our master will rely upon you said the youth meantime farewelland he hurried rapidly away jeffreys not offering to follow him chapter xc the new justice of the peace sir christopher blunt was seated in his library on the same evening which saw the interview between csar and jeffreys and his countenance was animated with a glow of indescribable delight as he glanced his eyes over several letters which he opened one after another he was dressed in a very elegant manner though he had somewhat punished his corns by persisting to wear tight boots in order to make his feet look small and he might have felt a trifle or so easier at the waist if he had not tied his waistcoat strings so tight but if sir christopher blunt chose to enhance the fascinations of his appearance by converting himself into a voluntary victim of that allpowerful inquisition called fashionif sir christopher blunt like a great many other silly old gentlemen of this age smiled at his selfmartyrdom with the equanimity of a saint broiling on a gridironit is no business of any body save the sir christopher blunt aforesaid in spite of the pinching boots end the excruciating tightness of the figured silk waistcoat the worthy knight was in a most glorious humour it was not because fortune had favoured him with great wealth he was so accustomed to riches by this time that a little poverty might have proved an agreeable variation if only for the excitement of the thing neither was it the pleasing fact that his dear spouse had been in such a hurry to present him with a son and heir that she could not wait longer than three months after their marriagefor sir christopher was already accustomed to the cries of the child and somehow or another was growing less and less proud of his paternal honours every day the reasoning of dr wagtail relative to the premature birth appearing more and more illogical each time he sate himself down to reflect upon it then what was the cause of the worthy knights joyousness and good humour on the evening in question demands the impatient reader to which query we hasten to replysir christopher blunt had just been placed in the commission of the peace and congratulatory letters from his friends were pouring in on all sides well upon my word this is very pleasant said sir christopher to himself i should not have thought that i was so beloved not a man in england has such a host of dear disinterested friends as i seem to possess scarcely does my name appear in the gazette whenwhisk in come the letters by twopenny post and generalby hand and by conveyance and some too are from people that really had no particular cause to be so devoted to mepeople that i never spoke to six times in my life but lets seewhat have we here a sheet of foolscap completely coveredand crossed in some parts god bless me what a letter why it must have taken the man an hour to write it and i am sure it will take me two to read it but who does it come from henry atkins henry atkinswho the deuce is he oh i rememberthe gentleman who allowed me a seat in his pew at hackney when i went to lodge there four years ago for the benefit of my health well its very kind of him to write me this long letter of congratulationfor i never exchanged ten words with him in my life but lets see what he says my dear blunt very friendly indeed it was with indescribable delight and supreme satisfaction that i heard of your appointment to a position which no man in europe can fill with more suitable dignity than yourself well comethats a good beginning your business habits your high standing in society your great name your unblemished character your brilliant talents and your immense benevolence render you most eligible to fill that office and most competent to discharge its functions upon my honour its very prettily wordedquite sonorous it reads admirably and this sincere and heartfelt congratulation is from a man whom i scarcely know but he seems to know me well enough however in these times of agricultural distress and commercial embarrassmentin this age when englands heaven is overcast with lowering clouds and the storms of anarchy and discontent menace us imminentlyit is delightful to reflect that authority is so judiciously entrusted as in your case thats the best rounded period i ever met with in my life what a clever farseeing shrewd man this atkins must be and what an idiot i have been not to cultivate the acquaintance of such a sincere friend but it is chiefly your benevolenceit is principally your boundless charity which is the theme of all praise which is chanted by all tongues and which is hymned beneath every roof throughout the length and breadth of the land well i could not have believed that i was so famousparticularly on that score however it must be so since atkins says it is yes my dear bluntvery friendly indeedit is your boundless charity your anxiety to do good to deserving persons that will hand your name down to posterity and send it floating like an eternal bark over the waves of time egad thats splendid milton never wrote any thing finer i have never read milton it is true but i am sure atkins can beat him let us see how it goes on it is under these impressions and acting in obedience to these convictions that i have ventured to address you and i am very glad he has ill write to him presently and tell him i shall always be delighted to hear from him lets seewhere was i ohventured to address you for the purpose of soliciting your aid under very peculiar circumstances hem i dont like that sentence so much as the others i am a man possessing a large family and very limited means and business having been lately indifferent i have fallen into sad arrears with my landlord the style gets worsethats clear at this present moment i have an execution in my house for forty pounds and when i look around me i behold a distracted wife on one side and a grim bailiff in possession on the other this is the least interesting part of his letter that period was not at all well turned milton beats him hollow thereif then my dear bluntdamned familiar though with his dear blunt upon my honourif then my dear blunt you would favour me with the loan of fifty pounds for three monthsconfound his impudence ejaculated the knight throwing the letter into the wastepaper basket a man i know nothing ofwho knows nothing of mewho never saw me ten times in his lifeto ask me for fifty pounds it is absurdpreposterous and the knights countenance underwent a complete change which lasted for several minutes until its joyous expression was gradually recalled by the perusal of letters which contained congratulations only without soliciting favours presently a servant entered the room and stated that a gentleman named lykspittal requested an interview with sir christopher blunt show him upshow him up immediately exclaimed the knight i have been expecting the gentleman this last halfhour he added looking at his watch it is now nineand he was to have been here soon after eight the domestic withdrew and speedily returned ushering in a thin pale elderly sneakinglooking man dressed in a suit of black which would not bear too close an inspection in the daytime but passed off well enough by candlelight sit down mr lykspittalpray sit down said the knight looking in contrast with the visitor just like a wax figure recently added to madame tussauds exhibition so bright was the red of his animated cheeks so glossy his coat and trowsers and so stiff and starch his attitude you have been well recommended to me mr lykspittal by a friend to whom your literary labours have given complete satisfaction and who speaks highly of you as a man in whom implicit confidence may be placed i am very much obliged to you sir christopher for the kind opinion you have formed of me answered the visitor in a tone of the deepest veneration and respect and appearing by his manner as if he did not dare to say that his soul was his own allow me to congratulate you sir christopher on your appointment as one of his majestys justices of the peace i am convinced a worthier selection could not have been made well youre very kind mr lykspittal returned the knight all my friends seem to agree that the lord chancellor acted in a wise and prudent manner in placing my name before his most gracious majesty for the purpose and it will be my endeavour mr lykspittal added sir christopher pompously to discharge the duties of my office with credit to myself and benefit to my country it is not every one who possesses your advantages sir christopher observed his visitor in a cringing tone and with a sycophantic manner which would have disgusted any person endowed with good sense and proper feeling but which were particularly pleasing to the shallowpated selfsufficient old beau at the same time said sir christopher whatever advantages i may possesswhatever be those merits which have placed me in thisthis enviable and responsible suggested mr lykspittal meekly enviable and responsible position continued the knight adopting the epithets as coolly and quietly as if they were prompted by his own imaginationat the same time he said it will not be amiss if certain measures be adopted toto enhance the popularity of your name observed mr lykspittal in the same low cringing and meek tone as before just so exclaimed the knight in fact i mean to take a high stand in the countyto put myself more forward than i have hitherto doneto attend public meetings and public dinners suggested mr lykspittal exactly said sir christopher in a word i want toto become a public man added the readywitted gentleman whose business it was to furnish ideas to those who furnished him with cash in return you understand me as well as i understand myself mr lykspittal observed the knight its my business sir was the answer besides you are so enlightened and enlightening a man sir christopher that you may be regarded as a lamp constantly diffusing its lustre even upon the darkest and most chaotic ideas pardon me sir christopher for being so bold as to express my opinion but it is the truthand i never flatter i am convinced you speak with sincerity my dear sir said the new justice of the peace playing with his eyeglass well then mr lykspittalto go back to our original subjectthe subject of this interviewi think you fully comprehend me indeed i know that you do it is my object and my determination to take a high position in the countyso that i may in a short time reckon upon the honour of being one of its representatives in parliament very easily managed sir christopher said mr lykspittal the electors would be proud of such a man as yourselfpardon me for making the observationbut i never flatter in the first instance however it is necessary that they should know you well now we are coming to the point my dear sir exclaimed the knight will you permit me to offer my suggestions asked mr lykspittal in a tone of insinuating meekness certainlyby all means proceed well sir christopher in the first place i should propose that a pamphlet be written on some taking subject and addressed to your worship continued mr lykspittal suppose we say the corn lawsor prison disciplineor catholic emancipationor church extensionor parliamentary reformor labour in factories all good subjects mr lykspittalall good subjects observed the knight but i do not mind telling you in private that i know nothing about any one of them of course not sir christopher exclaimed mr lykspittal it is not to be expected that a man of your standing will trouble himself about the details of such trivial matters but which side will you takethe liberal or the tory oh the tory by all means cried sir christopher very good my dear sir said mr lykspittal it is all the same to mei can write on one side as well as on the other suppose then we take up the subject of catholic emancipation which begins to make a great noise a pamphlet must be got up supposed to be written by a friend to the established church and it must be in the shape of a letter addressed to yourself i should begin by sayingsirthe interest which you are known to take in this great and important questionthe perseverance you have manifested in making yourself acquainted with all the bearings of the case its certain results and its inevitable influencesthe stanch and longtried ardour which you have evinced in maintaining and upholding the institutions of the established churchthe numerous proofs which you have given of your attachment to the protestant faithand the fact that the eyes of the whole country are upon you as a man resolved at any personal sacrifice and at all individual risks to oppose all dangerous innovations and resist all perilous changesthese motives sir have induced me to address the following pages to you nothing can be better mr lykspittal exclaimed the knight i should however be glad if you will in the course of the pamphlet allude especiallyand more than once tooto the fact that i have been the artificer of my own fortunethat i raised myself from nothingand that the greatest mistake the liverymen of portsoken ever made was to reject me as a candidate for the aldermanic gown of that ward i shall not forget sir christopher observed mr lykspittal and you may add my dear sir continued the knight pompously that you are well aware that circumstances have since occurred to make me rejoice at that rejection i will declare it to be a well known fact amongst all your friends said the accommodating literary gentleman and you may touch upon the zealthe abilityand the efficiency with which i performed the duties of the shrievaltythe very arduous duties of that office observed the new justice of the peace i shall certainly do so sir christopher replied mr lykspittal and it will only be telling the exact truth you may likewise touch upon the reward which it graciously pleased the illustrious prince to confer upon me continued the magistrate i meanthe honour of knighthood as a matter of course my dear sir and never was that title bestowed upon a gentleman better calculated to wear it worthily i thank you mr lykspittal returned sir christopher for your very flattering opinion of me when can the pamphlet be got ready i shall set about it immediately sir was the answer the moment it is published you must seize upon some point which i shall purposely leave open for discussion and write a letter to a morning newspaper declaring that you agree with the general tenour of the work but that you totally dissent from that particular doctrine decidedly said sir christopher you will then write a reply through the same channel and signed a friend of the established church that is my intention we shall thus excite an interest relative to the pamphlet and your name sir christopher will be kept before the public the discussion may lead to a second pamphlet stay exclaimed the knight smiling with the brightness of the idea which had just struck him we will manage better than all that you shall write a pamphlet which you must address to me in the terms just now specified by you but the work must contain throughout opinions totally opposed to mine and the object of the pamphlet must seem to be my conversion to your particular way of thinking then i must write another pamphlet in answeror rather you must write it for me and you must cut up hip and thigh and completely refute all the doctrines set forth in the first pamphlet in fact you must start a theory in that first pamphlet and knock it down altogether in the second which must be supposed to come from me a very ingenious idea my dear sir said mr lykspittal and just such an one as i should have expected from a man of your enlightened mind i admire the plan amazingly and will set to work at once very good exclaimed sir christopher i will write you a cheque for thirty guineas on account you will of course make all the necessary arrangements with the printer and stationer and you may apply to me for money as you require it i shall do the thing handsomely and spend fifty pounds at least in advertising each pamphlet mr lykspittal coincided altogether in the propriety of these intentionsindeed he never was known to differ from a patron in the whole course of his life and having received the cheque he took his leave walking backwards to the door in homage to the great man who had just been placed in the commission of the peace almost immediately after the departure of mr lykspitttal a servant entered announcing captain oblunderbuss footnote the reader will observe that this was said in the year before the emancipation of the catholics took place illustration chapter xci captain oblunderbuss againanother strange visitor sir christopher blunt was a man having many antipathies since his rejection for portsoken he had disliked all aldermen individually and collectively and since his union with the present lady blunt he had conceived a violent aversion for all ladysmaids he abominated italian organplayers and hated mendicants many other dislikes had sir christopher bluntbut of the whole batch none was more settled more genuine and more sincere than his antipathy for irishmen generally and captain oblunderbuss in particular his interview with mr lykspittal had left complacent smiles upon his countenancebut these suddenly yielded to clouds of the darkest description when the domestic announced the name of that dreadful and dreaded man be the powers and how is your worrrship roared captain oblunderbuss at the top of his stentorian voice rattling the r most awfully as he strode towards the knight with outstretched hand tip us your fin my heartyand allow me to congratulate ye on your appintment to the commission of the pace thus speaking the captain shook with such exceeding violence the member which he metaphorically designated as a fin that the wretched sir christopher groaned aloud while tears started into his eyes be jasus and its proud i am to own ye as my frind sir christopher continued the gallant officer not observing the pain which his proof of extreme cordiality inflicted upon the worthy knight then throwing himself into a chair he exclaimed that rascal of a lacquey of yours told me you was out but i wasnt to be desayved in such a gross fashion any how so i just tould him my mind and what was that captain asked the knight in a half terrifiedhalf sulky tone that he was an insolent blackguard sir christopher returned oblunderbuss emphatically and be jasus i was just on the point of taching him how to behave towards his superiors when i saw the gentleman who was last with ye coming out and he tould me that your worrrship was at home but ii am very particularly engaged captain said the knight and if you would excuse me nowanother time i shall be happywhen you are passing this way be the holy poker and theres no time like the prisint interrupted the captain and as i want just to have a little cozie chat with you my dear frind may be yell orther up the whiskey at once and so save us the throuble of talking drylipped really captain oblunderbuss stammered the knight as a gentlemanas aahema person being in the commission of the peaceimust protest againstthisthis intrusion inthrusion do ye call it vociferated the captain then after a few moments pause during which he surveyed sir christopher in a most ferocious manner he suddenly assumed a milder demeanour and coolly ringing the bell said be jasus ill save ye the throuble of giving any orthers at all my frind captain oblunderbuss cried sir christopher plucking up a spirit i will not be treated in this manner one would think that i am not master in my own house i have already told you that i am very particularly occupied with businessin consequence of my recent appointment to to the commission of the pace added the captain well my frindand we are going to dhrink success to the commission and the pace and all the rist of it my good fellow he continued addressing himself to the footman who now entered the room bring up the whiskey and hot wather with the sugar and a lemondye hear dont do any such thing exclaimed sir christopher now in a furious passion who are you sir that thus dares to give orders in the house ofof an exsheriff and an actual magistrate demanded the knight in a stern and pompous tone for the presence of the servant seemed to be a kind of protection beneath the shield of which the old gentleman grew every moment more valourous be the powers and that same is soon answered said the captain rising from his chair and drawing himself up to his full height is it myself that ye are afther enquiring about sir christopher be jasus thenits capthain obluntherbuss i amof bluntherbuss park connemara and its a pair of pisthols ive got for any man who dares to insulth that same capthain obluntherbuss so if youre for warrr sir christopherrr roared the gallant gentleman it shall be warrr and if yere for pace let it be paceand potheen the captain looked so very terriblegrew so awfully red in the faceseemed to swell out so tremendously at the chestand raised his voice to such a thundering tone as he enunciated his name and that of his imaginary estate that sir christophers valour like the courage of bob acres oozed rapidly away and the servant drew back as near the door as possible so as to be able to beat a retreat in case of need without any assistance from the warlike irishmans foot is it warrr or pace demanded the captain seeing that the enemy was discomfited peacepeace captainby all means returned the knight in a tremulous voice youll alarm lady bluntandand make the dear baby cry its paceand potheen sirrah said the military gentleman addressing himself in a tone of stern determination to the domestic who instantly disappeared now my dear frind yere too impatient be half continued the captain resuming his chair and again speaking to the knight you dont give me time to explain to ye the nature of my business and the rayson of me calling for sure and it was to tell ye how plazed your nevvy misther frank curtis is to think that yere put in the commission of the paceand how sorry he is to think that ye should have lost any thing by that scounthrel howardand how plazed he is to learn that your son and heir is flourishing just like a green bayleafand how sorry he is to think that your frind torrens should have got himself into such a tirrible potherand how plazed he is to be able to send ye back the thrifling amount of five hunthred pounds which ye was kind enough to advance him tother day oh he has done that has he said sir christopher rubbing his hands and evidently getting into a better humour well i am glad he has fulfilled the little engagement at all events and i shall not hesitate to receive it becausebecause i am sure he would not have sent it if he couldnt have spared it your nevvy my dear sir is a man of honourrlike myself cried the captain striking his breast very hard so that it gave forth a hollow rumbling sound as if he had a small drum buttoned inside his frockcoat but be the powers heres the potheen and its over the glass that well settle the little business of the five hunthred pounds the servant placed the tray upon the table and withdrew sir christopher then with the politeness of a man who is about to receive the payment of money which he had never expected did the honours in a most affable manner and only seemed contented when the captain having poured half a tumbler of scalding hot toddy down his throat declared that it was excellent and now for the little business resumed the gallant gentleman and he forthwith began to fumble in his pockets producing various pieces of paper and discarding them one after the other as soon as he consecutively glanced at their contents thats not it be the powers he said laying down a piece of a playbilland thats not it be the holy poker he added throwing aside an old account of his washerwomans nor yet that be jasus he continued similarly disposing of a tailors bill whywhat the blazes could i have done with the note dear me captain observed sir christopher in a tone of gentle remonstrance it is very imprudent of you to carry notes about loose in that way so it is my dear frind returned the gallant gentleman but its a fashion i have dye seeand its hard to break oneself of habits of the kind be the powers and here it is at last all rightall right said sir christopher rubbing his hands ye can give me change out of a thousand pounds cant ye my dear frind demanded the captain crunching a bit of paper in his hand as he spoke oh i can write a cheque for the difference you know returned the knight i presume its a note for a thousand pounds just so responded the captain and as good as a bank of england note be the powersalthough tisnt quite payable at sight not payable at sight exclaimed sir christopher in astonishment whyi never heard of the bank of england issuing notes that werent payable on demand egad nor i said captain oblunderbuss but sure it isnt a bank of england note at all at all its just my own acceptance your acceptance groaned the knight his countenance becoming suddenly blank yesbe jasus and here it is my dear frind returned oblunderbuss thrusting the rumpled slip of paper into sir christophers hand its as dacent a note for a promissory one as ever youd wish to see and as good as any of the palthry flimsy stuff that the bank of england ever issuedor the bank of ould ireland either and thats not even saying enough for it sir christopherlooking indeed like a knight of the rueful countenanceturned the document over and over in his hands having glanced impatiently at its contents which were drawn out in the usual style of a bill of exchange captain oblunderbuss having accepted it in favour of frank curtis for the amount of one thousand pounds and at three months after date well sir christopher and what dye say to that my old buck cried the captain apparently surprised that the knight had not already expressed his admiration at the whole proceeding whatwhat would you have me do with this asked sir christopher in a hesitating manner for the fact is he could not think well of it and he dared not speak ill of it is it what you should do with it vociferated the captain arrah and be jasus man pay yourself out of it and write me a cheque for the balance but captainii am no discounter remonstrated the knight this little slip of paper is no use to me why sirrah and just now you was prepared to pay me the difference if it had been a banknote cried oblunderbuss dye suspict the thing my frind for if you mane to infer that it isnt as good as a banknote its a direct insult to myself and be the lord harry its me thatll resint it with these words the captain assumed a most menacing attitude and sir christopher was already in a dreadful fright lest he should be compelled to submit to this new demand on the part of the extortioner when the footman entered to announce that a gentleman was waiting in the parlour down stairs to speak to him upon very particular and urgent business you must excuse me for a few minutes captain oblunderbuss said the knight rising to quit the apartment by all manes cried that gentleman we can finish the little matther prisintly and during your absence ill pay my respicts to the potheen sir christopher accordingly repaired to the groundfloor parlour where he beheld a venerable old man who rose from the sofa whereon he was seated to greet him the strangers aspect was indeed most imposing and respectable from beneath a black silk skullcap flowed hair as white as silver and his form seemed bowed by the weight of years he was dressed in a complete suit of black having kneebreeches silk stockings and shoes with large silver buckles he supported himself by means of a stick and appeared to walk with considerable difficulty pray be seated sir exclaimed the knight already prepossessed in favour of his venerablelooking visitor who resumed his place on the sofa in such a manner that the light of the lamp should not fall upon his countenance which however appeared to be very pale and drawn up about the mouth with the wrinkles of age sir christopher blunt said the old gentleman in a tremulous voice i have ventured to intrude myself upon you for the purpose of soliciting a very great favour it is not of the ordinary nature of boonsit involves nothing of a pecuniary kind for thank heaven i am placed far above the necessity of requiring such succour indeed i may say that i enjoy affluence be assured my dear sir returned the knight whose respect for his visitor was amazingly enhanced by this announcementbe assured that if i can serve you in any waycompatible with my honour as a man and with my position as an individual in the commission of the peace it is just because you are a magistrate sir christopher interrupted the old gentleman his tone becoming slightly less tremulous as he continued that i have now visited you not that any other magistrate would have failed to answer my purpose but i have heard so much in your favourthe admirable manner in which you filled the office of sheriffthe becoming way in which you presented the address to his present majesty when prince regent and which was so very properly rewarded by the honour of knighthoodthe dignified manner in which you left the ungrateful liverymen of portsoken to ruminate over their folly in bestowing their votes on your unworthy rival in that grand contestin a word sir christopher the whole tenour of your life from the period when you were poor and friendless until now that you are a rich esteemed and influential member of society my dear sirmy dear sir cried sir christopher absolutely whimpering for joy at hearing his praises thus chanted by a gentleman of so venerable and saintlike an appearance i really must know you betteriiam quite at a loss to express my thanksmy no thanks are required by one who proclaims the truth said the stranger shaking his respectable old head in a solemn and imposing manner you will yet be a greata very great man sir christopher or my experience which is of fourscore winters is miserablymiserably deceived do you really think so my dear sir exclaimed sir christopher well i suppose you knowor perhaps you may notthat i am a very stanch and sincere friend to the established churchthat i am entirely opposed to catholic emancipationthat i have made the subject a profound study and have devotedi wish to god lykspittal was here to prompt me he muttered in an undertone to himself i was not exactly aware of all that my goodmy worthy sir christopher blunt responded the old gentleman but i respect you all the more now that i am acquainted with those facts indeed i am proud and delighted to have the honour of your acquaintancean honour for which i have long craved urgently but let me return to the subject of my visit i was saying that you could render me a greata very great favour and at the same time convince the world how zealous how active and how worthy a magistrate you are my dear sir i shall be quite delighted to serve you cried sir christopher catching also at the idea of serving himself by performing some duty which would put him in such a comfortable and desirable light before the world the fact is most estimable man continued the stranger his voice again becoming very tremulous as if with deep emotion so that sir christopher was positively affected in no ordinary degree two men stained with a dreadful crime and now in a position which precludes the possibility of their appearing before a magistrate are anxious to confess their enormity to some competent authority and i have selected you for the reasons which i mentioned just now you have done me infinite honour my dear sir cried the knight i presume that this confession will be published to the world decidedly so interrupted the venerable stranger and your name will go forth as that of the zealous trustworthy and highly respectable magistrate who was selected under such peculiar circumstances to receive the confession really this is no favour which you ask of me my venerable friend exclaimed sir christopher rejoiced at the lucky chance which thus gave promise of publishing his name in so remarkable a manner i shall be delighted to serve you in that or any other way when do you require me to visit these unhappy men immediatelyat once answered the old gentleman my own carriage is at the door and we can proceed to the place of destination with a privacy which the nature of the circumstances renders imperative sir christopher rose and signified his readiness to accompany his venerable visitor the joy which he experienced entirely obliterating in his mind all remembrance of the fact that he had left captain oblunderbuss in his library giving his arm to his new friend who walked with considerable difficulty sir christopher led him into the hall where the knight only stopped for a moment to take down his hat from a peg they then issued forth together and sir christopher assisted the old gentleman to ascend the steps of the vehicle which was waiting he then leapt in himself and the footman belonging to the carriage had just closed the door when captain oblunderbuss rushed from the house exclaiming be the powers and this is the greatest insulth twas ever my misfortune to mate with in all my life oh the dreadful man murmured the knight throwing himself back in the carriage in a state of despair sir christopherrr cried the captain thrusting his head in at the carriage window sir christopherrr he repeated with a terrible rattling of the r is this the way ye mane for to trate a gintleman now be the holy poker if ye dont come forth and finish the little business at this moment the captain was abruptly stopped short in a most unexpected manner for the old gentleman growing impatient of the delay and perceiving that sir christopher was cruelly annoyed by the presence of the irishman suddenly dealt so well applied and vigorous a blow at the gallant officer that his countenance disappeared in an instant from the window and he rolled back upon the pavement exclaiming blood and thunther in a tone of mingled rage and astonishment at the same moment the coachman whipped his horses and the vehicle rolled away with extraordinary rapidity while a merry laugh burst from the lips of the venerable old gentleman who had so successfully discomfited the warlike captain as soon as sir christopher blunt had recovered from the alarm and excitement which the conduct of captain oblunderbuss had caused him he was seized with a strange surprise not altogether unaccompanied by vague fear at the sudden demonstration of vigour and strength made by his companion this feeling was enhanced by the youthful tones of the merry laugh which lasted long after the performance of the pleasant feat and the knight began to tremble with apprehension when that same mysterious companion hastily drew up the windows and the wooden blinds of the carriage the interior thus being thrown into a state of utter darkness my dear sir christopher blunt said a voice now tremulous no more but still evidently disguised you will pardon me for having practised upon you a slight deception which would indeed have been sustained until the end of the present adventure had not the chastisement which i was tempted to administer to that bullying fellow convinced you that i cannot be an old gentleman of fourscore in all other respects no duplicity was practised upon you for i am a great admirer of your characterthe object i have in view is precisely the one i named to youand i selected you to receive the confessions of the two men because i knew no magistrate better qualified to answer the purpose in every way a faint degree of irony marked the manner in which these last words were uttered but sir christopher blunt observed it notfor he was now a prey to oppressive fears and vague apprehensions do not alarm yourself my dear sir resumed the stranger i pledge you my most solemn word of honour that no harm shall befall you circumstances which i cannot disclose render it necessary to observe all possible mystery in respect to the present transaction to you the results will be just as i ere now promised you will receive and attest the confession of two criminals and in fortyeight hours the contents of that confession coupled with an account of how you became possessed of it will appear in every london newspaper thence the whole transaction will be transferred to the provincial press and in less than a week the name of sir christopher blunt knight and justice of the peace will be published and proclaimed throughout these islands and you really mean me no harm said sir christopher considerably reassured as well as consoled by this intelligence give me your hand my dear sir exclaimed his companion there and now i swear that as there is a god above us you hold the hand of friendship in yours and may that hand wither if i forfeit my word or do you harm i believe you siri believe you said the knight pressing the hand which he held with convulsive ardour but who are you that act thus mysteriously what is your name where do you live and whither are we going not one of those questions can i answer was the reply and it is expressly to prevent you from ascertaining the route which we are pursuing that i have drawn up the wooden blinds i must also inform you that ere we alight at the place where you will have to receive the confession of the two men i must bind a handkerchief over your eyes so that you may obtain no clue to the point of our present destination recollect the event of this evening will give you an immense popularity you will become the hero of one of the most romanticone of the most extraordinaryone of the most unheardof adventures that have ever occurred or will again occur in this metropolis you will be courted by all the rank beauty and fashion of the west end to learn the narrative from your own lips and if you write a novel founded upon the occurrence added the stranger again in a slight tone of unperceived irony you will instantaneously become the most popular author of the day upon my honourmy dear sir said sir christopher rubbing his hands i am not altogether sorry thatthatahemthat you should have pitched upon me to become the hero of this adventure at the same time you must confess that never was a hero placed in a position so well calculated to alarm him the character of a hero is not to be bought cheaply in the world observed the knights companion to become such a character one must necessarily pass through extraordinary circumstances and extraordinary circumstances are never without their degree of excitement very true my dear sirvery true said sir christopher but i dont care how extraordinary the circumstances may be so long as i run no risk its the riskthe danger i care about and i shall be very happy indeed if i can become a heroas you are pleased to call itwithout undergoing any such peril you shall become a hero sir christopher without having undergone the slightest danger returned his companion and thats even more than can be said by people who go up in balloons or by men who put their heads into lions mouths in menageries upon my honour your observations are most truemost just exclaimed the knight now finding himself almost completely at his ease i suppose that if i do get my friend lykspittal to write mei mean if i do write a novel founded on the occurrences of this night you will have no objection to my putting in all our present conversation oh not the least cried the stranger it is however a great pity that the night is calm serene and beautiful why so enquired sir christopher in a tone of profound astonishment simply because it would be such scope for a splendid opening if there were a fearful storm with all the usual accessories of thunder and lightning observed the stranger in a cool quiet but dry way only fancy now something like thisit was on a dark and tempestuous nightthe wind blew in fitful guststhe artillery of heaven roared awfullythe gleaming shafts of electric fluid shot in eccentric motion across the skyand so on upon my honour that commencement would be truly grand cried the knight altogether enraptured by the turn which his companion had given to the discourse and after all as it would be a novel i might easily begin with the storm let me seei must recollect that sentence which you composed so glibly how did it run oh i recollectit was on a dark and tempestiferous nightthe wind roaredthe artillery blew in fitting guststhe streaming shafts of electricity shot across the eccentric sky eh that will do i think exclaimed sir christopher rubbing his hands joyously you see i have not got such a very bad memory my dear sir not at all answered the stranger and i should certainly advise you sir christopher not to lose sight of the novel if you publish it by subscription you may put down my name for half a dozen copies but i dont know your name cried the knight and yet he added after a moments pause i suppose you must have one i believe that i have responded the stranger in a tone suddenly becoming solemneven mournful and it struck sir christopher that his ear caught the sound of a halfstifled sigh but he had not many instants to reflect upon this occurrencenor even to continue the discourse upon the topic which had so much interested him for the carriage suddenly stopped and his companion immediately said now sir christopher you must permit me to blindfold you the operation was speedily completed and the stranger led the knight from the vehicle into a house the door of which immediately closed behind them up a flight of stairs they then proceeded and entered a room where the stranger desired sir christopher to remove the bandage as soon as this was done and the knight had recovered his powers of vision he found himself in a wellfurnished room with the shutters closed the curtains drawn and a lamp standing in the middle of a table spread with wine and refreshments of a luxurious description his companion still retained the garb and disguise but no longer affected the decrepitude of old age and seating himself with his back to the light he invited sir christopher to take wine with him they then sate chatting for upwards of half an hour when the sound of several footsteps ascending the stairs fell upon their ears the door openedand two men entered leading between them a gentleman with a bandage over his eyes the two men retiredand the stranger desired the gentleman to remove the bandage adding dr lascelles you will pardon this apparent outrage the motives of which have doubtless been explained to you by my dependants i am led to believe that my presence is required to witness the confession of two criminals said the physician affecting complete ignorance alike of the mysterious master of the house and his affairs and if no treachery be intended towards me i do not feel inclined to complain much of the treatment i have already received i am delighted to hear you express yourself in these moderate terms observed the prime mover of those widely ramified schemes which are now occupying the readers attention allow me to introduce you to a gentleman whose name is doubtless familiar to yousir christopher blunt then turning towards the knight he added sir christopher this is dr lascelles the eminent physician i think i have had the honour to meet sir christopher blunt on a former occasionat lady hatfields said the doctor offering the knight his hand it is therefore a strange coincidence which has thus brought you together again under such circumstances as the present observed the stranger but you are both no doubt anxious to depart hence as speedily as possible and i will not detain you longer than is absolutely necessary he then rang a bell and in a few minutes four of his dependants entered the room leading in tim the snammer and josh pedler both strongly bound with cords and having handkerchiefs over their eyes these bandages were removedthe two villains cast rapid and searching glances around themthe stranger ordered them to be seated and his dependants to retireand the business of that memorable night commenced chapter xcii the confession sir christopher blunt said the stranger in your capacity of one of his majestys justices of the peace you will have the kindness to receive the confession of the two men now before you and you dr lascelles as a gentleman of the highest respectability will witness the present proceedings thus speaking he drew a writingtable close up to the place where sir christopher blunt was sitting and the knight inflated with the pride of his official station and conscious of the importance of the part which he was now enacting assumed as dignified and solemn a deportment as possible a bible was produced and he directed the two prisoners to be sworn the stranger administering the oath now my men said the justice of the peace it is my duty to hear and receive any confession which you may have to make to me but i give you due warning that it is to be published and from what i have already been told will be used elsewhere remember also that you are now upon your oaths and you must consider yourselves in just the same position as if you were in a regular policecourt under usual circumstances having thus delivered himself of what he believed to be an admirable prelude to the proceedings sir christopher glanced complacently towards dr lascelles as much as to say that was rather good i flatter myself and the physician responded with a sign of approval the knight then fixed his eyes in a searching manner upon the two prisoners who however appeared to be much less in awe of the magisterial dignity than of the presence of the mysterious stranger at whom they from time to time cast furtive looks of terror and supplication sir christopher blunt said that individual who throughout the proceedings spoke in a feigned tone and sate in such a manner that the light never once fell fully upon his countenance it is now necessary to remind you that a gentleman with whom you are well acquainted and whose name is torrens is now in a criminal gaol charged with the murder of sir henry courtenay i heard the news with grief and indeed with incredulity as to the truth of the accusation observed the knight ask those men sir said the stranger in a low and impressive voice what they know of that foul assassination god bless me exclaimed sir christopher much agitated surely these men now before me are not thethe the real murderers of sir henry courtenay added the stranger solemnly is this possible cried the justice of the peace surveying the prisoners with apprehension and horror thats the confession we have to make your worship said tim the snammer in a dogged tone dreadful dreadful murmured the knight then somewhat mastering his emotions he asked what is your name timothy splint your worship was the reply and yours demanded sir christopher making notes as he proceeded joshua pedler your worship where do you liveand what are you were the next questions where we did live your worship means said tim the snammer but it doesnt much signify answering that querysince we dont live now where we used to do and as for what we are your worship can pretty well guess now that weve confessed having murdered sir henry courtenaywhich was all through a mistake a mistake repeated sir christopher yes sir continued the snammer and ill tell you all about it speak slowvery slow said the knight because i shall commit to paper every word you utter remember well sir resumed timothy splint it happened in this way me and my companion here joshua pedler took it into our heads to break into torrens cottage for no good purpose as you may suppose to rob the houseeh said sir christopher just so your worship well we reached the cottage between twelve and one oclock at nightor nearer one i should thinkand looking through the chinks of the shutters for there was a light in the parlour we saw a pile of gold and a heap of notes on the table and a gentleman asleep on the sofa you follow this man dr lascelles said sir christopher turning towards the physician word for word was the reply go on then exclaimed the knight we opened the frontdoor in a jiffey your worship and without making any noise continued splint and we went into the parlour josh pedler secured the notes and gold and i held my claspknife close to the throat of the gentleman sleeping on the sofa did you know who he was demanded the knight not a bit of it your worship we took him for mr torrens as a matter of course continued the snammer josh pedler went to ransack the sideboard and upset a sugarbasin or some such thing in the drawer the gentleman awoke and was just on the point of crying out when i drew the claspknife across his throat merciful goodness exclaimed sir christopher shuddering from head to foot and glancing uneasily around him shocking shocking said the doctor with unfeigned emotion the very knife that i did it with was in my pocket observed tim the snammer when we was made prisoners and brought here the stranger who had remained silent for some time now rose from his seat and took from the mantel the fatal weapon which he laid upon the table before sir christopher saying this is collateral evidence of the truth of the deposition now made well upon my honour observed the knight recoiling from the ominouslooking instrument i have commenced my magisterial functions in an extraordinaryi may say unheardof manner but let the prisoner proceed with his confession ive very little more to say your worship answered the snammer as soon as the deed was done i could have wished it to be undone and i know that my companion in trouble here wished the same we didnt go with the intention of doing it it come upon us by itself likeand i hope mercy will be showed us he added with a significant glance of appeal towards the mysterious individual of whom he seemed to be so much in awe you and your comrade then left the house immediately i suppose said sir christopher interrogatively exactly so your worship replied timothy splint and do you continued the knight addressing himself to joshua pedler admit the truth of all that your companion now states every word of it your worship answered the man we must therefore suppose observed dr lascelles that mr torrens upon discovering the dreadful deed feared lest suspicion should fall upon himself and buried the corpse in the garden where it was found true said sir christopher and now joshua pedler you will inform me what you did with the money which you took away with you i divided it sir and the big notes was changed into small ones was the answer when me and my companion here was made prisoners we had ever so much of the money about us and it was took from us the stranger produced from his pocket a small parcel which he handed to sir christopher saying there is the amount taken from the two prisoners very good said sir christopher then after a few moments profound reflection he turned towards dr lascelles in whose ear he whispered these words to me it is very clear that those men have confessed the truth and that they are the dreadful villains they represent themselves to be but as this statement is to be published in connexion with our names we must render the evidence against those fellows as complete and satisfactory as possible i am perfectly of your way of thinking sir christopher returned the doctor also speaking in a low whisper since we are here on such an unpleasant business we must do our duty effectually then those men should be examined separately in respect to the very minutest details of their selfaccusing evidence said the knight still addressing himself in an undertone to the physician or else the world will immediately declare that the whole thing was a mere farce contrived by some of torrens friends to save him and of which you and i were the dupes and the instruments a very just fear on your part sir christopher observed the doctor who from the little he knew of the knight would not have given him credit for so much penetration and forethought butbut said sir christopher i hardly like to propose it to the gentleman who had us brought here oh i will take that duty upon myself interrupted dr lascelles and immediately turning towards the strangerwho was however no stranger to himhe said in a loud and firm tone we wish to examine these men separately certainly was the reply and the mysterious master of the house forthwith rang the bell wilton answered the summons and was ordered to conduct joshua pedler into an adjoining room when this command was obeyed and the domestic had led the prisoner away sir christopher proceeded to question timothy splint again you said just now that when you looked through the window you saw a gentleman sleeping on the sofa now did your companion also peep through the crevices in the shutters he did your worship was the answer and which way was the gentleman lying with his feet towards the window and his head on that end of the sofa which was nearest to the door and when you both went into the house who entered first myself your worship and when you went away again who departed first i think josh pedler was in advancein fact im sure he was because i remember shutting the frontdoor behind me which side of the table were the pile of gold and the heap of notes on inquired sir christopher racking his brain for as many minute questions as possible the money was all lying on a large book at that end of the table next to the window your worship responded tim the snammer the knight put several other queries of the same trivial but really important nature and splint was then removed from the room joshua pedler being led back again to his place precisely the same questions which had been asked of the snammer were now put to the other villain and the answers corresponded in the minutest particulars there is no possibility of doubt as to the genuine character of the present scene whispered the knight to dr lascelles i have been all along of that way of thinking replied the physician at the same time i admire the precautions you have adopted sir christopher and the skilful manner in which you have examined and crossexamined these selfinculpatory scoundrels you really are of opinion that i have done the thing welleh doctor said the justice of the peace with a complacent smile welli am rejoiced to perceive that i have given you satisfaction our unknown friend there may now have the other villain brought back again so that the two partners in crime may sign these depositions dr lascelles intimated the knights desire to the stranger who forthwith caused tim the snammer to be reconducted to his place in the room where this extraordinary scene was enacted sir christopher then read over in a slow and measured tone the whole of his notescontaining the voluntary confession of the miscreants and the subsequent examination you timothy splint and you joshua pedler he said when that task was accomplished will now sign or otherwise attest this document the unknown rang the bell twice and the four dependants who had conducted the two prisoners into the room in the first instance immediately reappeared and on a signal from their master they loosened the cords which confined the hands of the villains in such a way that the latter were enabled to affix their signatures to the depositions dr lascelles acting as the witness you may now remove those men altogether said the unknown the four dependants immediately blindfolded them and led them away from the apartment carefully closing the door behind them i presume that sir christopher blunt and myself are now at liberty to depart said the doctor not before you have each given me a solemn pledge that you will not publish nor even hint at the occurrences of this night until twentyfour hours shall have elapsed returned the stranger for my part i dont at all object to give the promise required exclaimed the knight hastily for the mystery of the whole proceeding had imbued him with the utmost awe in respect to the unknown and i will as readily pledge my solemn word of honour to maintain that condition observed the doctor in that case gentlemen said the stranger you shall be conveyed hence without delay i need hardly enjoin you to use that confession which you will take away with you in the manner alone calculated to save the life of mr torrens and relieve him from the dreadful charge hanging over his head rest assured that all shall be done which the emergency of the case requires and which we have now the means to effect said sir christopher and now with your permission i shall take a draught of wine and waterfor i feel somewhat exhausted with these proceedings while sir christopher was helping himself at the table dr lascelles stepped up to the individual whom circumstances compel us to denominate the stranger or the unknown and said in a low and hasty whisper what is the reason of this delay of twentyfour hours in respect to the proclamation of torrens innocence because old death and others must be in my power ere the occurrences of this might be published was the answer likewise spoken in a hurried whisper or else they will suspect where these scenes have been enacted but are you sure of capturing them demanded lascelles confident was the brief but emphatic reply the unknown then rang the bell and significantly intimated to wilton who answered the summons that his guests were ready to depart the domestic bowed and withdrew but in a few minutes he returned accompanied by another dependant and the two domestics proceeded to blindfold both the doctor and the knight the unknown apologising for the necessity of renewing this process he himself then conducted them to the carriage which wilton had ordered round to the door and into which the stranger followed them it then drove away at a rapid rate and after taking sundry windings stopped at the expiration of an hour opposite st jamess church piccadilly just as the clock struck two in the morning the knight and the doctor descended having already bade farewell to the mysterious individual whom they left inside and the carriage instantaneously drove off chapter xciii newgate yestwas two oclock in the morning and the hour was proclaimed by the iron tongues of time from the thousand steeples of the mighty metropolis how solemnly does the sound of those deep sonorous metallic notes break upon the dead silence of that period when darkness spreads its sable wing over an entire hemisphere and though tis the time for rest yet repose and slumber are not the companions of every couch crime sickness and sorrow close not their lids in balmy sleep weighed down with weariness though they be too much happiness has likewise an excitement hostile to the serenity of the pillow for sleep is a fickle goddess who succumbs not to every ones wooing at the hour when her yielding is most desired now coy and coquettish she hovers around yet approaches not quite closenow sternly and inexorably obstinate she keeps herself at a great distance in sullen mood and when the iron tongues of time proclaimed the hour of two were the eyes of the wretched torrens or his miserable guilty wife closed in slumber nono beneath the same roof though in compartments far asunder they writhed and tossed upon their hard pallets in feverish excitementcraving longing for sleep to visit themand sleep would not in those hours of wakefulness and amidst the solemn stillness and utter darkness of the night how terrible are the trains of thought which pass in rapid procession through the guilty mindas if imagination itself were being hurried along an endless avenue of horrorsgrim spectres hideous phantoms and appalling sights on the one hand and on the other then with what tremendous speed does memory travel back through the vista of a mispent life all the foul deeds of which become personified in frightful shapes and muster themselves in terrible array on either side illustration in his narrow stonecell the wretched torrens felt as if he were in a coffin suffocated hemmed in aroundand yet his imagination possessed boundless space wherein to raise up the awful shapes that haunted his pillow was it possible that he was therein newgate did he dreamwas he the sport of a hideous phantasy could it be true that he was dragged away from his comfortable homesnatched as it were suddenly from the world itselfand flung into a felons dungeon nono it was impossibleabsurd ha ha the folly of the idea was enough to make one laugh butoh merciful heavenshe extended his arms and his hands touched the coldruggeduneven wall thence they wandered to the iron of the bedsteadand came in contact with the coarse horsecloth which covered his burning feverish limbs then a dreadful groan burst from hima groan which even were he ten thousand thousand times more guilty than he really was would have been lamentable heartrending to heara groan of such ineffable anguish that satan himself might have said this man hath suffered enough sufferedholy god how deeplydeeply has he suffered since the massive door of that mighty stone sepulchre first closed upon himappearing to shut out the pure air of heaven the golden light of day and to mark a point where even human sympathies could follow no farther sufferedthe wretched felon whose foot is upon the first step of the scaffold never suffered more than the crushed ruined accused torrensfor all his guilt had arisen from the lack of moral courage to meet misfortune face to face and now that misfortune had thrust itself upon him and compelled him to gaze on its pale and deathlike countenance he was completely weighed down his infamy in respect to rosamond lay as heavily upon his conscience as would have lain the crime of murder had he really perpetrated it and he suffered more on account of the deed which he had committed but for which the law had not touched him than on account of the charge of which he was innocent but for which the law had seized upon him miserablemiserable man darknesssilenceand sleeplessness were indeed terrible to himso terrible that as he lay tossing upon his feverish pallet he wished that he was deadyet had he possessed the means of inflicting selfdestruction he would have been afraid to die he was not placed in a ward along with other prisoners because the charge against him was so black and terriblethe charge of murderthat he was lodged in a dungeon by himselfa cell that had seen many many previous occupants most of whom had gone forth to the scaffold for in newgate the possession of a room to oneselfif a room such a coffin of masonry can be calledis the horrible privilege of him who is accused of murder and those whose alleged offences are of a less deep dye herd together in common wards where a fetid atmosphere is the medium of communicating the foulest ideas that words can convey or ears receive oh what a plaguespot is that horrible gaolthat pandemonium of newgateupon the civilisation of the metropolis of these realms shameshame that it should be allowed to exist under the management of an incapable ignorant and monstrously corrupt bodythe aldermen of londonshame shame that it should be permitted to remain as a frightful abuse of local jurisdiction just because no statesman has yet been found bold enough to wrest a barbarian charter from an overgrown bloated and despicable corporation the wifethe newly married wife of mr torrensthat woman so well known to our readers by the name of martha slingsbywas not lodged by herselfbeing accused of a crime one degree less heinous than that of murder she was placed in a ward with several other females and she also heard the iron tongue of time proclaim the hour of two in the morningand she also tossed upon a hard sleepless and feverish pallet for she had not even the solace of conscious innocence as an anodyne for her lacerated heart and wounded spirit she knew that she was guilty of the crime imputed to herand that knowledge lay upon her soul like a weight of lead ando horror she was well aware that the black deed of forgery would be indubitably fixed upon her and the penalty of that deed wasdeath yesdeath by the hand of the common executioneran ignominious death upon the scaffold she knew that almost her very minutes were now numberedthat as the clock struck eight on some monday morning not very far distant she must be led forth to diethat after her trial which was sure to end in her condemnation she should be consigned to the condemned cellthat from this cell she must proceed through several dark and dismal passages to that door upon whose very threshold would appear the gibbet black and sinisterthat she would have to ascend or perhaps be carried up the steps to the platform of the horrible machinethat she should see myriads and myriads of human beings crowding around to behold her dying agoniesthat she would be placed upon a drop soon to glide away from beneath her feet and leave her suspended in the airthat the few minutes during which she must stand upon that drop while the chaplain said the parting prayer would comprise whole years aye centuries of the bitterest bitterest anguishthat her attentive ear would catch even the sound caused by the finger of the executioner when he touched the bolt of the drop an instant before he pulled it backand that her soul would be yielded up in the agonies of strangulation thusthus in spite of herself did the wretched womans imagination picture in frightful detail the whole of the dreadful ceremony of a violent death thusthus did she shadow forth in imagination every featureevery minute particular of the appalling ordealand in imagination also did she now pass through it all as vainly she craved for sleep in the silence and the darkness of the prisonward the dread routine of the whole ceremony assumed an historical exactitude a palpable shape and a frightful reality in her mind terribleterrible was it for her to think upon what she now was and upon what she might have been not a hope was left to her in this world she must be cut off in the meridian of her yearsshe must bid adieu for ever to all the pleasures the enjoyments the delights of society and of life oh for the poweroh for the means to avert her maddening harrowing thoughts from the prophetic contemplation of that fatal morning when she must walk forth to the scaffoldwhen the close air of that prison would suddenly change to the fresh breeze of heaven as she stepped forth from the low dark door which the passerby outside ever beholds with a shudderand when she should raise her eyes to that black and ominous framework with the chain hanging from the crossbeam and her own coffin beneath the drop all this was horriblehorriblesufficient to deprive the strongest mind of its reasoning faculties and to paralyse the boldest with excess of terror for oh the reward of crime is dispensed in two ways upon earthby the law and by the criminals own thoughtsand farfar more dreadful is the punishment inflicted by the guilty conscience than by the vengeance of outraged justice even the horrors of the scaffold immensetremendous though they must be in the reality are magnified a hundredfold by the terrorstricken imagination from the examples of the wretched man and the guilty woman of whom we have been speaking and on whose heads afflictions and miseries fell with such frightful rapidity and crushing weightfrom their examples let the reader judge of the follysetting aside the wickednessof crime golddeceitful goldwas the willothewisp which led them on through the devious ways of iniquity until they suddenly found themselves in newgate for the woman forged for goldand the man sold his daughters virtue for gold and from the moment when torrens consented to that vile deed every thing went worse with himnothing was betteredand the circumstances resulting from that one act combined to overwhelm him with afflictions and even to fix upon him a horrible charge of which he was really innocent to err then is to be foolish as well as wickedand this grand truth has doubtless been felt and acknowledged when too late by many and many a wretched being within those very walls and that sombre enclosure of newgate newgatewhat numberless ties have been severed on its thresholdand what countless thousands of individuals on entering that dread portal one by one have gnashed their teeth with rage at the folly even though they have felt no compunction for the guilt of the career which they pursued and which had its natural ending there it was ten oclock in the morning when a hackneycoach stopped at the door of the governors house which stands in the centre of the front part of newgate and a fine tall handsome young man having leapt forth assisted a closely veiled lady to alight from the vehicle they were almost immediately admitted into the office of the governor the young lady clinging to her companions arm for support for she was labouring under the most dreadful mental anguish these persons were clarence villiers and his beauteous bride adelais returning from devonshire whither they had been to pass the honeymoon they heard on the road ere they reached the metropolis the astounding intelligence that the aunt of the one had been committed to newgate on a charge of forgery and that the father of the other was consigned to the same place under an accusation of the murder of sir henry courtenay they also learnt at the same moment and for the first time that the wretched pair had only just been united in matrimonial bonds when this fearful fate overtook them but they were too much shocked by the more grave and serious portion of the tidings which thus burst upon them to give themselves even leisure to express their surprise at the less important incident of the marriage of mr torrens and mrs slingsby they had arrived in london on the preceding evening and had repaired direct to torrens cottage hopingand indeed expecting as a matter of courseto find rosamond there but they were disappointedcruelly disappointed that anticipation the female servant and the lad were however still at the cottage and from the former they learnt tidings which enhanced if possible the grief that already rent the heart of adelais and which excited vague but terrible suspicions in the mind of clarence for the servant informed them that miss rosamond went to stay with mrs slingsby almost immediately after the weddingthat she remained there almost ten days and came home the very night when the murder was committed and seemed dreadfully unhappy during the short time that she did remain at the cottageand that she departed no one knew whither the second day after her return leaving a note for her father while adelais sate weeping at these tidings to her so completely inexplicable a torrent of suspicions and terrible ideas rolled through the mind of her husband clarence for he knewas the reader will rememberthat sir henry courtenay was not only the paramour of his aunt but that he had likewise cast lustful looks upon rosamond and he was equally aware that the young girls imagination had been excited and inflamed by the false representations his aunt had made in respect to the character of the baronet then that second visit of rosamond to old burlington streether unhappiness on returning homethe assassination of sir henry courtenay at torrens cottagethe sudden marriage of two persons who were almost entire strangers to each otherand the contemporaneous flight of rosamond from her homeall these incidents seemed of so suspicious and terribly mysterious a nature as to strike clarence with dismay the version which mr torrens had given rosamond of the particulars of the murderand which as the reader is aware was the true one so far as the actual perpetration of the deed itself was concernedwas unknown to clarence inasmuch as it had not been published in the newspapersfor when arrested by dykes and bingham mr torrens had immediately sent for able counsel to whom he told his story previously to the examination before the magistrate and by the advice of his legal assistant the prisoner had contented himself by simply declaring his innocence stating that he should reserve for his defence the explanations whereon that assertion was founded thus clarence villiers could not help believing that torrens was really guilty of the murder and he shuddered at the idea which forced itself upon him that his aunt was an accomplice in the crime in fact it naturally appeared as if that woman and that man had suddenly blended their congenial spirits for the purpose of working out deeds of the blackest dye and he dreaded lest the honour of rosamond had been wrecked in the frightful convulsion produced by that association but none of his awful misgivings did he impart to adelais on the contrary he strove to console her by assurances of his hope that her father must be the victim of a terrible junction of adverse circumstances and that his innocence would yet transpire such ideas he was in reality very far from entertainingbut it cut him to the quick to behold the anguish of his young wifeand he uttered every thing of a consolatory nature which his imagination was likely in such a case to suggest as a means of imparting hope and affording comfort they remained at the cottage that night and on the ensuing morning repaired to newgate as we have already stated the governor upon learning the degree of relationship in which mrs villiers stood towards mr torrens expressed himself in terms of the kindest sympathy and offered to proceed in the first instance to the prisoners cell to prepare him for the meeting with his daughter and soninlaw this proposal was thankfully accepted and the governor after remaining absent for about ten minutes returned to conduct the young couple into the presence of the prisoner with whom he left them adelais threw herself into her fathers arms embraced him with a fondness that was almost wild and frantic and sobbed bitterly upon his breastwhile clarence villiers stood a deeply affected spectator of the sadthe touching scene my childmy dear child exclaimed the father more moved by paternal tenderness than he ever yet had beeni am innocenti am innocent almighty god be thanked for that assurance murmured adelais as she fell upon her knees and bent her burning face over her fathers emaciated handsfor mr torrens had become frightfully thinalteredand carewornand his entire appearance denoted how acute his mental sufferings had been clarence he cried after a few moments pause during which he raised his daughter and placed her upon a seatclarence did you hear my declaration i am innocent i heard itand i rejoice unfeignedlyoh most unfeignedly returned the young man not knowing what to think but speaking thus to console his heartwrung wife but whether i can prove my innocencewhether i can triumph over the awful weight of circumstantial evidence which has accumulated against me continued mr torrens is a point which god alone can determine an ejaculation of despair burst from the lips of adelais for heavens sake compose yourself dearest said villiers you have heard your father declare his innocence yesyes she cried but if the world will not believe him it is not sufficient that we should be convinced of that innocence oh my godwherefore has this terrible affliction fallen upon usthen suddenly struck by another idea she exclaimed and rosamond dear fatherwhat has become of my sister rosamond mr torrens turned away and burst into tearsfor that question revived a thousand agonising reminiscences in his mind my father heremy sister gone mused adelais her manner suddenly becoming strangely subdued and the wild intensity of her earnest eyes changing in a moment to an expression of idiotic vacancyand clarencewhere is he methought he was with me just now merciful god her senses are leaving her exclaimed villiers in a frantic tone then throwing his arms around her he said adelaismy beloved adelaisclarence is hereby your side oh look not at me so strangely adelaisdo you not know mespeakspeaki am clarenceyour husbandhe who loves who adores you my god she does not recognise me and the young man started back dashing his right hand with the violence of despair against his forehead while adelais remained motionless in the chair gazing on him with a kind of vacant wondermentand the miserable father staggered against the wall for support murmuring in a tone of ineffable emotion great god where will all this end but at that moment the heavy bolts were drawn backthe door openedadelais uttered a scream of mingled amazement and delightand in an instant rosamond was clasped in her arms long and fervent was that embrace on the part of the sisters nor were torrens and clarence villiers alone the witnesses thereoffor the heavy door of the stone cell had ere it closed again given admittance to esther de medina fortunate for adelais was it that rosamond appeared at such a momenta moment when the reason of the young bride was rocking on its throne and the weight of an idea no heavier than a hair would decide whether it were to be reestablished on its seat or overturned for ever faint and overcome by the sudden revulsion of feeling produced by this sudden meeting with her sister adelais slowly disengaged herself from rosamonds arms and falling back in the chair beckoned clarence towards her saying my dearest husbandkeep near mestay with mefor i know not what dreadful ideas have been passing in my mindand it seemed to me for a time that i was in utter darknessor that i was buried in a profound sleep but you are better now dearest exclaimed clarence overjoyed at this sudden return of her senses yesi am better now said adelais and falling upon her husbands neck she burst into a flood of tears meantime rosamond was weeping also in her fathers arms and the eyes of the generousheartedthe amiable esther de medina were overflowing at the contemplation of this mournful and touching scene fatherfather murmured rosamond her voice almost suffocated with the sobs which agitated her bosomthere is hopeevery hope hope ejaculated mr torrens catching at the word as if the halter were already round his neck and the cry of a reprieve had fallen on his ears hope did you say exclaimed adelais now so completely relieved by the issue her pentup anguish and shocked feelings had found in copious weeping that all the clearness of her intellect had returned hushrosamond said miss de medina advancing towards the group hushmy dear madam she added turning hastily towards adelais that word must not be breathed here aloud yet nevertheless it is true that there is hopeand every hopenay even certainty great god i thank thee cried adelais clasping her hands together in fervent gratitude while mr torrens was so overcome by emotions of joy and amazement that he sank upon that prisonpallet whereon he had passed a night of such horrible watchfulness i implore you to restrain your feelings as much as possible said esther speaking in a low and mysterious tone which made torrens clarence and adelais suddenly become all attention and breathless suspense the proofs of your innocence sir she added looking at the prisoner have been obtained naygive utterance to no ejaculationbut hear me in silence within twentyfour hours from this time your guiltlessness will be proclaimed to the world already are the proofs in the hands of a magistrate but circumstances with which i am not myself altogether acquainted render that delay imperiously necessary it would however have been cruel to have left you in ignorance of this important circumstance and and this admirable young lady at whose fathers house i found a home hastily added rosamond would not refuse me the joythe indescribable joy of being the bearer of these tidings naymore she offered to accompany me god will reward you for all your kindness to my sister dear lady said adelais embracing esther with heartfelt gratitude and affection you are doubtless anxious to learn how the proofs of mr torrens innocence have been obtained resumed esther after a pause but my explanation must be very brief suffice it to say that in this mighty metropolis which contains so much evil there is a man bent only on doing good accident revealed to him certain particulars which convinced him of your innocence sir continued the beautiful jewess addressing herself now especially to mr torrens upon the information which he thus received he actedand he has succeeded in obtaining and placing in the hands of a justice of the peace the confession of the real perpetrators of the awful deed then the murderers are in custody doubtless exclaimed clarence astonished and delighted at all he heard they are not in the grasp of justice answered esther but on this head you must ask me no questions rest satisfied with the assurance that the innocence of mr torrens will completely and unquestionably transpirethat he will soon be restored to you alland that his secret friend watches over him even from a distance who that individual is you cannot knowand perhaps never may all the recompense he demands at your hands is the subduing in your minds of every sentiment of curiosity that may prompt you to pierce the mystery which shrouds his actions and remember also that every syllable i have now uttered is to remain a secret profoundly locked up in your own breasts until the proclamation of innocence shall be made from that quarter to which the solemn duty of publishing it has been entrusted we should be wanting in common gratitude indeed to him who has thus interested himself in behalf of the innocent were we to act in opposition to those injunctions said clarence villiers but through you lady do we each and all convey our heartfelt thanks for that generous intervention which is to produce so vitally important a result yesand to you also dearest miss de medina is our eternal gratitude due exclaimed rosamondan assurance that was immediately and sincerely echoed by adelais clarence and mr torrens hope had now returned to that prisoncellhope in all her radiance and her glorywith her smiling countenance and her cheering influence the name of mrs torrenslate mrs slingsbywas not mentioned by a soul during this meeting her husband uttered it notclarence through motives of delicacy remained silent likewise in that respectand the sisters had too much to occupy their thoughts relative to their fathers position and the hope of his speedy release to devote a moments attention to that woman for the interview was necessarily short in consequence of the severity of the prison regulations but when mr torrens was again alone in his cell he could scarcely believe that so sudden a change had taken place in his prospects on leaving the gaol after having taken a tender and affectionate leave of their father the sisters looked inquiringly at each other as if to ask whither each was going we have taken up our abode at the cottage said adelais breaking silence where we shall remain doubtless she added glancing towards her husband until our father shall be restored to us clarence signified his assent i should be grieved to separate you from your sister immediately after your unexpected meeting today said esther addressing herself to adelais but if rosamond will continue to make our house her home yesyes my dear friend exclaimed rosamond hastily i will intrude a little longer upon your hospitalityfor i feel that my nerves have been too much shaken by recent occurrences to allow me to return to the cottage at least for the present the reader need scarcely be informed that the young lady desired to avoid the painful prospect of being alone with her sister and clarence for what explanation could she give of her flight from homean explanation which she knew would naturally be required of her adelais indeed felt somewhat hurt at the decision which her sister had made in respect to remaining with miss de medina but she concealed her vexation and they parted with an affectionate embrace thus clarence and adelais proceeded to torrens cottage while esther and rosamond returned in mr de medinas carriage to finchley manor during their ride home in the hackneycoach villiers and his wife discussed all the incidents which had just occurred but during a pause in the conversation adelais bethought herself for the first time that day of her motherinlaw clarence she said laying her hand upon her husbands arm we have been sadly culpable i know to what you would allude dearest interrupted villiers tomorrow i shall call upon my wretched aunt but it is by no means necessary for you to accompany me your father did not once mention her name during the interview we will not seek to penetrate his motives for that silencebut we will endeavour to imitate him in that respect as much as possible i do not clearly understand you clarence said adelais gazing at him enquiringly i mean that the less we speak concerning my aunt the more prudent it will be my love responded villiers for i fear that she will not prove to be innocent of the crime imputed to herand under all circumstances you can owe her no sympathy nor respect either as my relative or your motherinlaw adelais made no answer and clarence immediately changed the conversation chapter xciv the stout house london is a wondrous city for the success with which the most flagrant quackery is accomplished things not only improbable but absolutely impossible are puffed off with matchless impudence and what is more extraordinary still they obtain an infinite number of believers thus we have snuffs which will cure blindness when the most skilful oculists are at faultoils and pomatums that will make the hair grow in spite of natures denialcosmetics that will render every skin though tawny as a gipseys white as a circassianspills so happily compounded as to be an universal panacea annihilating diseases of even the most opposite characters and effecting for thirteenpence halfpenny what all the college of physicians could not accomplish for millionslozenges by which a voice cracked like a tintrumpet may become melodious as a silver bellointments that will cure in a week ulcers and sores which have baffled all the experience of famous hospitalsurgeons for a quarter of a centurydecoctions prepared on purpose to prolong life although the elixir vit of the alchemists has long been regarded as an absurd fableboluses competent to restore to all their pristine vigour constitutions shattered by years and years of dissipation and dissolute habitspulmonic wafers efficient to wrestle against the very last stage of consumption and restore lungs entirely eaten awaytonics so wonderful that they will even give new coats to the stomach though the old ones have been destroyed by ardent spiritsand heaven only knows how many more blessings of the same kind seriously speaking it is deplorable to perceive how tremendously the millions are gulled by all these details of an impudent and most dishonest quackery the coiner who passes off a base shilling representing it to be a good one is punished as a felon and stigmatised as a villain but the quack who sells articles which he announces to be capable of performing physical impossibilities is not tangible by the law nor does he become branded in the opinion of the world such are the conventional differences existing in civilised society of all the demoralising species of quackery practised nowadays certain medical works are decidedly the worst we allude to those beastly things which are constantly announced in the advertisementdepartment of newspapers but which with a scintillation of good taste on the side of the printers are invariably huddled together in the most obscure nook it is evident that newspaperproprietors are ashamed of the filthy advertisements although they cannot very well refuse to insert them but we warn all our readers against suffering themselves to put the least confidence in the representations set forth in the announcements alluded to the works thus puffed off are contemptible as regards medical information demoralising in their very nature and delusive in all their promises an amusing species of quackery exists with repect to many publichouses passing along a thoroughfare or visiting some fresh neighbourhood springing up in the outskirts of the metropolis you will probably see a new building destined for the public line and with the wordsnoted stout housepainted on a board or cut in the masonry the cool impudence of proclaiming an establishment to be famous for a particular article before it is even finished is too ludicrous to provoke serious vituperation the merit of the place is agreed upon beforehand between the architect and the proprietor never mind how worthless the beer to be retailed there may eventually prove it is a noted stout house all the same but so accustomed are the inhabitants of london to behold such things that the springing up of such a structure causes no sensation in its neighbourhood good easy people that we are nowadayswe take every thing for granted and as a matter of course the noted stout house in helmet row st lukescalled by its patrons for abbreviations sake the stout housewas one of those flash boozingkens which are to be found in low neighbourhoods and noted it indeed wasnot on account of its beer unless the fame thereof consisted in its execrable naturebut by reason of the characters frequenting it the parlour was large low and dark and in the evening it was invariably filled with a miscellaneous company of both sexes prostitutes and thievesold procuresses and housebreakersdissolute married women and notorious coinersthese were the principal supporters of the stout house had machiavelli once passed an evening there he would not have declared as a rule that language was given to man for the purpose of disguising his thoughts inasmuch as no attempt at any such disguise at all was made in that place every one spoke his mind in the most free and open manner possiblecalling things by their right namesand expressing the filthiest ideas in the plainest phraseology if foul words were capable of impregnating the air the atmosphere of the stout house parlour would have engendered a pestilence at about halfpast nine in the evening john jeffreys sauntered into the establishment took a seat at the table and gave his orders to the waiter for the beverage which he fancied at the moment whenever a newcomer appears in a public room of this kind the company invariably leave off talking for a minute or so to enjoy a good stare at him and they measure him from head to footturn him inside out as it wereand form their rapid and silent conjectures regarding him just as a broker takes stock in his mind with a hasty survey around on putting an execution for taxes or rates into a defaulters house we cannot exactly say what opinion the company present on this occasion at the stout house formed of john jeffreys but we are able to assure our readers that much as he had seen of london and well as he was acquainted with its vile dens and low places of resort he thought to himself as he glanced about him that he had never before set eyes on such a dissipatedlooking set of women or such a repulsive assemblage of men well and so mother olivers place is broke up at last observed one of the females addressing herself to another woman and evidently taking up the thread of a conversation which the entrance of jeffreys had for a few moments interrupted yesand the poor old creature has been sent to quod by the beaks at hickss hall till she finds sureties for her good behaviour in future was the reply whatis that the mother oliver you mean as kept the brothel in little sutton street tother side of the goswell road there demanded a man desisting from his occupation of smoking for a few moments while he asked the question to be sure it is returned the female who had previously spoken and a bad thing it is for me i can tell you i was servant thereand a good living it were but ill tell you how it all come about it was a matter of six or seven weeks ago that a young feller came to the house quite on his own accord as you may suppose and he stayed there three whole days for he was quite struck as one may say with a fairhaired gal which had been lodging with us for some time well he orders every thing of the best promising to pay all in a lump and so mother oliver gives him tick like a fool as she was but at last she wanted to see the colour of his money and then he bullied and swore and kicked up a row and went away without paying a mag well the debt was given up as a bad job and we thought no more about it till we heard a few days afterwards that the house was to be indicted so off mother oliver goes to the clerk of the peace but lo and behold ye the young gentleman was a clerk in his office and not content with reglarly robbing the poor old ooman he must try and ruin her into the bargain mother oliver got to see the clerk of the peace and began to tell him all about the trick his young man had played her but he said he knowed every thing already that she had enticed the young feller into her house and that was the reason she was to be indicted so the thing come on yesterday before the middlesex magistrates at hickss hall and mother oliver was sent to gaol theres been a reglar rooting out of them kind of cribs all over the parish observed one of the company and its the same in a many other parishes yes but ill tell you what it is exclaimed the woman who had related the above particulars its only against the poor sort of houses that these prosecutions is ever got up lord bless you before i went to mother olivers i was servant in a flash brothel at the westenda reglar slapup placebeautifully furnished and frequented by all the first folks it was keptand still is keptby a frenchwoman i was there as underhousemaid for a matter of seven year and should have been there till now only i was too fond of taking a drop the first thing in the morning to keep the dust out in summer and the cold out in winter ahi des say you was always a lushing jade sally observed an individual in his shirtsleeves and who seemed to know the woman well well old fellerand what then cried she for a moment manifesting a strong inclination to draw her fingernails down the cheeks of her acquaintance but calming her anger she said it dont matter what comes from your lipsso i shant be perwoked by you howsomever as i was telling you i was servant in the flash house at the westend for upward of seven years and such scenes as i saw the old frenchwoman used to entice the most respectable gals there by means of advertisements for governesses ladiesmaids and so on and they was kept prisoners till they either agreed to what she proposed or was forced into it by the noblemen and gentlemen frequenting the place and all this occurred i can assure you in one of the fashionablest streets in london but there was never no notice taken by the parishauthorities and as for the societywhats its name againthat prosecutes bad houses it didnt seem to know there was such a brothel in existence and ill tell you how that was too the frenchwoman gave such general satisfaction to her customers and was always treating them to such novelties in the shape of gals that she was protected by all the gay noblemen and gentlemen at the westend lord bless you some of her best customers was the middlesex magistrates themselves and two or three of the noblemen and gentlemen that i spoke of was members of the committee of that very society which prosecutes brothels so it wasnt likely that the house would ever be interfered with i recollect the old frenchwoman used to laugh and joke with the great lords and the members of the commons that patronised her about the way they talked in the parliament houses and the bother they made about the better observance of the sabbath and so on it used to be rare fun to hear the old lady in her broken english repeating to them some of their fine speeches which shed read in the newspapers and how the gals used to laugh with them to be sure you dont mean to say that them lords and members which is always agoing on about the sabbath used to frequent the brothel you speak of exclaimed a man dont i though cried the woman in a tone of indignation at the bare suspicion against her veracity implied by the question i do indeed my man and i should think you ought to know the world better than to be astonished at it it was through having the patronage of all them great people that the old frenchwoman never got into trouble but none of the fine brothels at the westend are ever prosecuted no one would think of such a thing its only the low ones in the poor neighbourhoods well i always heard say that poverty is the greatest possible crime in this country observed the man who had recently spoken and now im convinced on it i never had any doubt about it said another a rich man or a rich woman may do anythink but the poordeuce a bit thats quite another thing why look at all these bishops and great lords and members of the commons which are constantly raving about sunday travelling dont they go about in their carriages and aint hyde park always more filled with splendid vehicles on a sunday than on any other day the very bishops which would put down coaches on a sabbath goes in their carriages to the cathedrals where they preach by all i can hear or learn observed another individual present theres a precious sight more religious gammon in the parliament houses than anywheres else i should think there is too exclaimed the woman who had told the tale relative to the brothelkeepers some of them noblemen and gentlemen that i spoke of was the most terrible fellows after the young women that i ever see in all my life and they was always a bothering the frenchwoman to send over to france or down into the country to entice more gals to the house the frenchwoman used to send out agents to entrap innocent creatures wherever she couldfarmers and clergymens daughters and such like i remember what a spree we had with one of the religious members of the commons one night he had been bringing in a bill or whatever you call it to protect young females from seduction and had drawed such a frightful picture of the whole business that he made all the other members shed tears well as soon as hed done he came straight off to our place and asked the old frenchwoman if she had got any thing new in the house that very day a sweet young gala poor marine officers daughter who wanted to be a governesshad been enticed to the brothel and the member that im speaking of gave the old frenchwoman fifty guineas for the purchase of that poor creatur the woman was entering into farther details when wilton and another of the retainers of jeffreys mysterious master entered the parlour of the stout house both disguised as servants out of place the place was too much crowded to enable them to converse at their ease they accordingly all three repaired to a private room jeffreys having left at the bar a suitable message to be delivered to old death who was well known at that establishment wilton ordered up glasses of spiritsandwater and when the waiter had retired after supplying the liquor jeffreys proceeded to acquaint his colleagues with the promised tidings relative to tidmarsh i called at the bunces house in earl street seven dials this morning he said and saw old death who was quite delighted when i assured him that i had already found the two friends of whom i had spoken to him and that that they would be here punctual this evening at halfpast ten i then told him that as the resurrection affair in st lukes churchyard would most likely come off tomorrow night and as i should be engaged the best part of tomorrow on my own business he had better let tidmarsh go with me at once and show me the exact spot where tom rain was buried the old man bit directly and said well jeffreys youre a faithful and good fellow and can be trusted tidmarsh lives here now and is up stairs at this momentso tidmarsh was sent for and away him and me went together to st lukes in the course of conversation i found out that tidmarsh bunce and mrs bunce were to go out with old death on some business this evening and that while old death came here to meet me the other three were to wait for him at another flash house in mitchell street close by this is admirable said wilton we have now the whole gang completely in our power fortunately i have several of our masters people in the neighbourhood and i will go at once and give them the necessary instructions wait here jeffreys with harding he added indicating his colleague with a look until i return my absence will not be long wilton left the room jeffreys and harding remaining alone together in a quarter of an hour the blacks trusty dependant returned all my arrangements are now complete he said resuming his seat and the entire gang must inevitably fall into our hands jeffreys then acquainted wilton and harding with the exact nature of the proposal which would be made to them by old death and scarcely were these preliminaries accomplished when the ancient miscreant made his appearance this is businesslike indeedvery businesslike my good fellow said old death taking a chair and addressing himself to jeffreys while he spoke and these i suppose he continued fixing a scrutinizing glance upon the others are the friends you spoke of just so replied jeffreys this is bill jones he added laying his hands on wiltons shoulder and theres no mistake about him tother is named ned thompson and knows a thing or two i rather suspect all rightall right chuckled old death rubbing his hands joyfully together im glad to make your acquaintance mr jonesand yours too mr thompson and were not sorry to form yours mr bones said wilton affecting a manner and tone suitable to the part he was playing our pal jeffreys here has told us quite enough to make us anxious to know more of you and so you shall my dear friends exclaimed old death i can always find business for faithful agentsand i can pay them well likewise jeffreys has told us that observed wilton and ive also explained to them what you want done tomorrow night mr bones said jeffreys good ejaculated old death wellis it to be done theres no manner of difficulty that i can see said harding and as for any riskwhy if the rewards at all decent the reward shall be liberalvery liberal interrupted old death hastily whatwhat should you say to a tenpound note apiece deuce take it cried wilton thinking it would look better to haggle at the bargain remember theres the chance of transportationand my friend and i are not so desperate hard up nonoi understand observed old death fearful that his meanness had disgusted his new acquaintances and that he should lose their services unless he immediately manifested a more liberal disposition i meant ten pounds each on account and ten pounds more for each when the job is done besides he added theres other business to follow on this is only the first scene in the play that im going to get up and in which you must be prominent characters and the aged miscreant chuckled at his attempt at humour what you have now said observed wilton quite alters the case twenty pounds each and the chance of more work is a proposal that we can accept what say you thompson i say what you say jones replied harding now then we understand each other my friends continued old death and i will at once give you the earnestmoney thus speaking he drew forth a greasy purse and presented the two men each with ten sovereigns which they appeared to snatch up with much avidity i have now nothing more to say to you resumed benjamin bones his fierce eyes sparkling beneath his overhanging brows with the hope of speedy vengeance on the earl of ellingham you must place yourselves at the disposal of your friend jeffreys here who will inform you how to act and show you precisely in what way my wishes are to be executed i must now leave you but tomorrow evening he added in a tone of savage meaning i shall see you in earl street with the coffin you may rely upon us mr bones replied wilton but wont you stay and take a glass with us demanded jeffreys not to nightnot to night was the answer i took something short at the bar as i passed by but tomorrow night my friendstomorrow night he exclaimed emphatically you shall find a good supper ready for you in earl street when you come and a drop of the right sort so much the better said jeffreys i like a good supper but whats your hurry at present mr bones to tell you the truth my dear boy answered the old man i have got three friends waiting for me at a ken in mitchell street and i promised not to keep them longer than i could help so you must excuse me on this occasion and therefore good bye old death shook hands with the three men and took his departurechuckling to himself at the idea of having secured the services of jeffreys friends at so cheap a rate inasmuch as he would cheerfully have given them griping and avaricious as he was three or four times the sum stipulated in order to secure their services in the scheme of carrying out his atrocious plans of vengeance illustration but for once old death the laugh was against yourselfas you speedily discovered to your cost we must not however anticipate the moment the old man had left the room wilton harding and jeffreys exchanged glances of satisfaction and triumph bunce tidmarsh and bunces wife are all three at the flash house in mitchell streetthat is quite clear said jeffreys yes observed wilton and the moment for action is now at hand let us depart the three men accordingly left the tavern and hastened in the direction which they knew old death must pursue in order to reach mitchell street as they passed by another publichouse in helmet row wilton bade them pause for a moment while he went in to give the necessary instructions to the persons who were associated with him in the expedition of this night and whom he had ordered to remain there until his return he speedily rejoined jeffreys and harding and all three were once more on the track of old death at the same time halfadozen men dressed as labourers issued from the publichouse at which wilton had called and dispersing themselves hurried singly by different ways towards the road separating the two burialgrounds precisely at the corner where mitchell street joins helmet row and just as he was in the act of turning into the former thoroughfare old death was suddenly seized by three men and gagged before he had time to utter a single exclamation the moon shone brightly and his eyes flashed the fires of savage rage and wild amazement as their glances fell upon the countenances of wilton harding and jeffreys he stamped his feet in a paroxysm of fury and then struggled desperately to release himself but his efforts were altogether unavailingthough he exerted a strength which could scarcely have been expected on the part of so old and feeble a man he was borne off to the blacks carriage which was waiting close by and being thrust in was immediately bound and blindfolded by two persons who were already seated inside the vehicle which drove away at a rapid rate this important feat being accomplished wilton desired jeffreys to proceed to the flashhouse in mitchell street and induce tidmarsh and the bunces to accompany him into the ambush prepared for them jeffreys accordingly repaired to the boozingken alluded to where he found the objects of his search seated at a table and occupied in the discussion of bread and cheese and porter sorry to interrupt you my friends said jeffreys but you must come away with me directly mr bones has sent me to fetch you is anything the matter asked mrs bunce in a low but agitated voice as she glanced towards the strangers present in the room i cant say whats the matter replied jeffreys because i dont know but mr bones seems much excitedand hes walking up and down the road between the buryinggrounds he told me to desire you to come to him directly is he alone there inquired toby bunce looking particularly frightened yesquite alone theres no danger of any thing if thats what you mean but i think mr bones has met with some annoyance come on tidmarsh and the bunces accordingly rose paid for what they had ordered but which they had not time to finish and repaired with jeffreys to the place mentioned by him where is mr bones demanded mrs bunce in her querulous voice but ere jeffreys had time to give any answer his three companions were set upon and made prisoners by the blacks retainers it is only necessary to state in a few words that they were gagged blindfolded thrust into a second vehicle which was in attendance and conveyed to the same place whither tim the snammer josh pedler and old death had preceded them wilton having superintended this last transaction remained behind along with jeffreys to whom he addressed himself in the following manner as soon as the carriage had departed i am commissioned by my master who is also yours to state to you his entire approval of your conduct measures have been taken to save mr torrens in a manner which cannot implicate you keep your own counsel be prudent and steadyand you may not only atone for past errors but become a respected and worthy member of society for a few days it will be necessary for you to remain as quiet as possible at your own lodgings and whatever extraordinary reports you may hear concerning the affairs of mr torrenshowever wonderful the means adopted to proclaim his innocence of the crime of murder may bekeep a still tongue in your head so much depends upon your implicit secrecy that you would not be now left at large did not our master entertain a high opinion of your fidelity but beware how you act you have had ample proofs not only of his power but likewise of his matchless boldness and unflinching determination in working out his aims for my own sake mr wilton said jeffreys i shall follow all your advice and you will live to bless the hour when you first encountered our master was the answer it is not probable that your services will be required again for some days but should it be otherwise a letter or a messenger will be dispatched to your abode our master retains in his hands the money that you left with him and the next time he has occasion to see you he will advise you in what manner to lay it out to your best advantage in the meantime he has sent you a moderate sumnot from your own funds but from his pursefor your present wants and so long as you remain in his service your wages will be liberal but paid in comparatively small and frequent sums so that the possession of a large amount may not lead you into follies by this course he will train your mind to recognise the true value of money honourably obtained and fit you for the position in which the funds he holds of yours may shortly place you jeffreys and wilton then separated the former more astonished than ever at the bold and yet skilfully executed proceedings set on foot by his mysterious master chapter xcv clarence villiers and his aunt the church of saint sepulchre on snow hill was proclaiming the hour of nine on the following morning when clarence villiers again entered the office of the governor of newgate and solicited permission to see mrs torrens representing the degree of relationship in which he stood with regard to that unhappy woman we have before stated that mrs torrens had been placed in a ward where there were several other prisoners of her own sex and the governor animated by a proper feeling of delicacy and supposing that the interview of relatives under such circumstances was likely to be of a nature which it would be cruel to submit to the gaze of curious strangers immediately conducted clarence into his own parlour whither the guilty aunt was speedily conducted when they were alone together clarence endeavoured to find utterance for a few kind words but his tongue clave to the roof of his mouthand he burst into tears mrs torrens threw herself into a chair covered her face with her hands and expressed the anguish of her soul in deep and convulsing moans oh my dear aunt exclaimed clarence at length in what a frightful position do i find you what terrible changes have a few short days effected do not reproach me clarenceoh do not reproach me said the wretched woman extending her arms in an imploring manner towards him i am miserable enough as it is my god i can well believe you cried villiers speaking in a tone of profound commiseration and forgetting for a moment the iniquity of which his aunt had been guilty for she was frightfully alteredher plumpness was goneher cheeks were thin and paleand she even stooped as if with premature old age oh yesi am indeed very very miserable she repeated in a tone of intense bitterness and clasping her hands together in the excess of her mental agony such nights as i have passed since i first set foot in this dreadful place no human tongue can tell the amount of wretchedness which i endure in the daytime tis too horribleoh far too horrible to think of but at nightwhen all is dark and silent and when my very thoughtsmy very ideas seem to spring into life and assume ghastly shapes oh my dear aunt do not allow your imagination thus to obtain dominion over you interrupted clarence endeavour to compose yourself a littleif only a littlefor it does me harm to see you thus besides i have so much to say to youso many questions to ask youso much advice to give you alas the only counsel you can give me clarence said the wretched woman shaking with a cold shudder though the perspiration stood in big drops upon her browthe only counsel you can give me clarence is to bid me prepare for another world is it possible cried villiers shocked by the appalling significance of these words have you no hopeno chance would you believe me were i to assure you that i am not guilty of the crime imputed to methe forgery of a draft upon the bankers of the late sir henry courtenay demanded mrs torrens fixing her sunken lustreless eyes upon her nephew nono you are convinced that i am guiltyand a jury will pronounce me to be so think not that i blind myself against all the horrors of my position i know my fatei know that i must die eventually by the hand of the executioner god have mercy upon you exclaimed villiers pressing his hand to his brow as if to calm the dreadful thoughts which his aunts language excited in his brain yes clarencethat must be my fate she continued unless i obtain a short respiteof a few monthsby confessing confessing what cried clarence impatiently oh nonot to you can i make that avowal she exclaimed in a shrieking tone but i understand you yesa light breaks in upon meand do not spurn me altogether clarence said the wretched woman throwing herself upon her knees before him and grasping one of his hands with convulsive tightness in both her own oh i know what you would reproach me with if not for my own sakeyet for that of the unborn child which i bear in my bosom i should have avoided this awful riskrecoiled from that fatal crime but i was so confident of successso certain of avoiding exposureand my affairs too were so desperatewithout resourcessir henry courtenay having disappeared in such a mysterious manner aunt interrupted clarence in a firm and solemn tone as he raised her from her suppliant posture and placed her in a chairanswer me as if you were questioned by your god are your hands unstained with the blood holy heavens would you believe me capable of murder cried mrs torrens in a penetrating thrilling tone of deep anguish listen clarence she continued her voice suddenly becoming low and hollow as she rose also from her seat and laid her emaciated hand upon his armlisten clarence for a few moments i have been of all hypocrites the most vilei have led a dissolute life the profligacy of which has been concealed beneath the mask of religioni have subsisted upon the wages paid to me by a paramour for the use of my personi have forgedi have become the accomplice of the ravisher of innocencebut a murderessnonevernever god be thanked for that assurance which i now sincerely believe exclaimed clarence but you speak of being the accomplice of the ravisher of innocence is it possibleanswer me quicklythat rosamondmy sisterinlaw oh kill mekill me clarence cried the miserable woman again throwing herself at his feet in the anguish of her soul kill me i sayfor that was the blackest crime which one woman ever perpetrated towards another then all my worst fears are confirmed groaned clarence and turning abruptly away from her in sudden loathing and horror he broke forth into violent ejaculations of rage but in less than a minute the sounds of grief more bitter than his fury was terrible forced themselves on his ears and glancing round he beheld his aunt lying prostrate on the floor her face buried in the carpet and her whole frame convulsed with an anguish which in a moment renewed all the feelings of commiseration in his really generous heart springing towards the spot where she had fallen when he burst so rudely away from her he raised the wretched creature in his arms conveyed her once more to a seat and endeavoured to address her in terms of consolation and kindness he even implored her pardon for what he termed his brutality towards her oh you have no forgiveness to ask of me clarence she murmured in a faint and halfsuffocating tone your indignation is most naturaland i am the vilest being in female shape that ever cursed the earth with a baleful presence or brought dishonour on a glorious sex my god when i look back and survey all my crimesall my misdeeds i despair of pardon in another world and now you add another wickedness to those of which you spoke exclaimed clarence for the mercy of god is infinite it must be soit would be an awful sin a monstrous impiety to believe otherwise a great and good being possessing omnipotent power and a will which there is none to question can have no pleasure in casting your soulpoor frail crusheddown womaninto a lake of eternal fires oh believe methere is hope even for greater criminals than yourself but every atonement which it is possible for you to make upon earth must be made and whatever be your fate amongst beings who forgive nothing you will experience the blessings of salvation at the hands of a being who forgives every thing i am penitentoh believe me clarence i am very penitent exclaimed his aunt would to god that i could live the last twenty years of my life over again not an errorno not even a frailty should stain my soul but these thoughts come upon us when it is too late to take them as the guides of our conduct alas such is indeed the case said clarence mournfully and now aunt i am about to ask you to perform a duty which will perhaps lacerate your bosomrevive a thousand bitter reflections i understand you clarence interrupted mrs torrens subduing her emotions as much as possible and speaking in a comparatively tranquil tone you require from my lips a true and faithful narrative of all that has occurred since you left london with your beautiful bride wellthat narrative shall be given sit down by meand listen but in so listening you will only receive fresh proofs of my black turpitude for systematically and coollynot in the excitement of moments when evil passions were more powerful than reasonhave i perpetrated those crimes which now weigh so heavily upon my soul clarence took a chair by his aunts side and prepared to hear her story with an earnest but mournful attention his aunt then related to him the particulars of the dreadful conspiracy which had been devised by herself the late sir henry courtenay and mr torrens against the honour of rosamond and clarence now learnt for the first time that mr torrens had only consented to his marriage with adelais in order to get them both out of the way so that the younger sister might be completely in the power of those who had thus leagued against her happiness and her virtue although i deplore that such motives should have been the favouring circumstances which led to my union with adelais said clarence yet i rejoice that my charming and adored wife is safely removed by the fact of that marriage from the power of such a monster of a parent mrs torrens sighed profoundly and then entered upon those details which explained to her nephew how she became acquainted with mr torrensthe whole particulars of the murder of sir henry courtenay as she herself had heard them from the lips of mr torrensthe forgery of the cheque to which crime that individual was privythe way in which she had compelled him to marry herand the flight of howard the attorney with the produce of the crime for which she was now in a felons gaol and you believe that mr torrens is really innocent of the black deed imputed to him said clarence inquiringlyfor he was now anxious to ascertain whether the tale which he had just heard in explanation of that mysterious event would correspond with the proclamation of mr torrens innocence which was to be that day made to the world according to the assurances given on the preceding morning by esther de medina i am confident that the account given by mr torrens and which i have now related to you is correct answered mrs torrens for she added after a few moments hesitation when once we understood each otherwhen once our hands were unitedthere was no necessity to maintain any secrets from each other we plunged headlong into crime handinhandand felt no shame in each others presence besides he had no motive to perpetrate such a deed on the contrary he deprived himself of a friend whose purse was most useful to him true observed clarence struck by the truth of this reasoning in respect to myself resumed the unhappy woman i have made up my mind how to act i shall not aggravate my enormity by denial i shall plead guilty to the charge of forgeryand without implicating that wretched man on whom the charge of murder now presses with such a fearful weight of circumstantial evidence noi shall not mention him in connexion with that deed of mine so that if he escape from the cruel difficulty in which he is now placed no other accusations beyond those of his own conscience may injure his peace you have determined to adopt the course which i should have counselled said clarence it would be useless to attempt the defence of that which is so clearly apparent the forged signature had not the baronets private mark attached to it but the clerk who cashed it for you did not think of scrutinising it so closely at the moment as you were well known to him a subsequent examination of it proved the forgery stands not the case so at least it was thus reported in the newspapers the statement is correct answered mrs torrens mournfully and i feel convinced that i shall possess a greater chance of obtaining the royal mercy by pleading guilty at once and confessing my error oh to escape deatha premature deatha horrible death she cried suddenly becoming nervously excited again compose yourself auntcompose yourself exclaimed clarence for you have an act of justice to do towards an innocent man in a word i wish you to sign the account of the murder of sir henry courtenay as you received it from the lips of mr torrens and as you have now related it to me i will draw it up briefly and no one can tell of what benefit the existence of such a document may prove to your unhappy husband clarence hastened to procure writing materials from the governors office and on his return to the parlour he drew up the statement combining it with a confession of the forgery though not mentioning the name of mr torrens in connexion with that latter crime the penitent woman then signed the paper in a firm handwriting and it immediately appeared as if a load were taken from her mind villiers now informed her that rosamond had found an asylum with some kind friends of the jewish persuasion but faithful to his promise to esther de medina he did not drop even so much as a hint of the hopes which that admirable young lady had held out with regard to the expected proclamation and existing proofs of mr torrens innocence it struck him however that the paper which he had that moment received from his aunt might assist the steps that were in such mysterious progress elsewhere to remove from the head of his fatherinlaw the dreadful charge which rested upon it i must now leave you aunt said the young man rising from his seat shall you visit mr torrens she inquired in a hesitating manner not today was the answer the prison regulations do not permit visitors to call on the same inmate of this gaol two days consecutively in factfor i abhor every thing savouring of duplicityi will candidly inform you that adelais myself rosamond and the young lady with whom that poor girl is staying saw mr torrens yesterday you visited him first murmured the wretched woman but i do not blame youi cannot reproach you clarence she added hastily it was natural that your wife should wish to see her fatherand equally natural that you should accompany her besides i know that it must have cost you a painful effort to enter the presence of one so stained with crimeso pollutedso infamous as i your contrition has obliterated from my mind all feelings save those of regret and commiseration returned clarence warmly would that justice could so easily forget the past as i oh i thank you for those generous assurances exclaimed mrs torrens bursting into tears for sympathy in such a place as this is dearer to the soul than all the enjoyments which the great world outside could possibly bestow the kind wordaye and what is more the word of forgivenessis the holy dew of heaven for years and years clarence was i a vile hypocrite and such sentences as those flowed glibly from my tonguebecause they were the means whereby i deceived the world but nowoh now i feel all i say and whatever may be my doom i shall at last appreciate the sublime truths of that religion which i so long used as a mask clarence she added in a more measured tone always suspect the individual who makes a display of his religion be assured that true religious feelings do not obtrude themselves in all unseasonable moments upon society the man or the woman who enacts the part of a saint is nothing more nor less than a despicable hypocrite and i believe that more profligacy is concealed beneath such a mask as i so long wore than can possibly exist amongst those who make no outward display of religion but i will not detain you longer i know that adelais must be cruelly shocked by all that has lately happened one word however before we partyou will notyou can not acquaint her withwith with the ruin of rosamond cried clarence seeing that his aunt hesitated oh nono it would kill my poor wife not for worlds would i allow her to learn that dreadful secret and now i understand full well wherefore rosamond preferred to remain with her new friends rather than accompany her sister and myself mrs torrens and clarence embraced and separated the former returning to her ward in company with the matron who had waited in an adjacent room during this interviewand the latter repairing to the office of the governor to whom he handed the document which his aunt had signed the young man then proceeded to the house of some friends dwelling in the city and with whom he had left adelais during his visit to newgate we should observe that he was fully enabled thus to dispose of his time according to his own will he having obtained six weeks leave of absence from the government office to which he belonged in the course of the morning he called at the lodgings which he had occupied in bridge street blackfriars previously to his marriage with adelais to see if there were any letters lying there for him there was only one and the contents of that ran as follow pall mall west the earl of ellingham presents his compliments to mr villiers and requests that mr villiers will on his return to town favour the earl with an interview relative to private business of some importance there must assuredly be some mistake in this observed clarence as he showed the letter to adelais for i am totally unacquainted with this nobleman and cannot understand what private business he can possibly have to transact with me however i will call tomorrow or next day and ascertain the point when the excitement connected with your fathers situation shall have somewhat subsided by the declaration of his innocence we need hardly say that clarence had communicated to his beloved wife the fact that his aunt had narrated to him the particulars of the manner in which sir henry courtenay came by his death and that he had drawn up the narrative which upon being signed by her had been deposited in the hands of the governor of newgate chapter xcvi sir christopher blunt a hero it was about midday when an extraordinary rumour began to spread like wildfire throughout the metropolis the report was that between ten and eleven oclock that morning sir christopher blunt and dr lascelles had presented themselves to the sitting magistrate at bow street and had not only communicated to that functionary a surprising account of certain adventures which had happened to themselves but had likewise placed in his hands a document which proclaimed the innocence of mr torrens who was lying in newgate under an accusation of murder the adventures alluded to were of such an amazing character that had they been related by persons of a less honourable reputation than sir christopher blunt and dr lascelles they would have been treated as a pure invention on the part either of maniacs or unprincipled friends of the accused but the known integrity of those two gentlemen gave no scope for even the slightest breath of suspicion and their tale though wonderful was so consistent in all its parts that it was received as one of those truths which are stranger than fiction the entire metropolis was in amazement two respectable gentlemenan eminent physician and a wealthy justice of the peacehad been conducted blindfolded to a house where they had received the depositions of two men who confessed themselves to be the murderers of the late sir henry courtenay there was no appearance of fraud in that confession the men had been crossexamined apart and had agreed in the minutest details every one therefore believed that mr torrens was indeed innocent and the sitting magistrate at bow street expressed the same opinion but who was the individual that had caused sir christopher blunt and dr lascelles to be thus made the recipients of the confession of the murderers where was the house to which those gentlemen had been taken what motive was there for screening the assassins why was so much mystery observed in the entire transaction and wherefore had sir christopher and the physician been enjoined to withhold the publication of the matter for twentyfour hours after its occurrence these questions were in every bodys mouth but no one could suggest any thing resembling even the shadow of a satisfactory solution the weapon with which the crime had been perpetrated and a portion of the proceeds of the robbery effected at torrens cottage at the same time accompanied the depositions placed by sir christopher blunt in the hands of the magistrate and a surgeon on examining the corpse which had been removed to the deceaseds house previous to receiving the rites of christian burial declared that the throat must have been cut by such an instrument as the one thus produced but this was not all the moment the rumour of what had occurred at bow street reached the prison of newgate the governor hastened to the policeoffice and submitted to the magistrate the confession made that morning by mrs torrens this confession not only admitted her guilt in respect to the forgerybut gave such a version of the murder as completely tallied with the depositions made by timothy splint and joshua pedler looking at the entire case as it thus stood there was no doubt of the innocence of mr torrens and all that gentlemans friendswho by the bye had hitherto kept aloof from himcrowded to newgate to congratulate him on the facts which had transpired the sensation created by the affair throughout the capital was tremendous and when the evening papers were published the copies were greedily caught up in all directions it was a fine harvest for those journals and their sale that day was prodigious an individual often spoken of but never yet seennamely the oldest inhabitant in the metropoliswas duly mentioned on the occasion never said each of the evening papersas if the reporters had all been suddenly struck by the same ideanever within the memory of the oldest inhabitant of the metropolis has so extraordinary a case transpired and certainly no event for many years had produced such a powerful excitement animating even the most callous and indifferent dispositions with a desire to know more and setting athinking many who had quite enough in their own affairs to occupy all their thoughts the taverns publichouses and coffeeshops became the scenes of loud and interesting discussions but even the knowingones found no opportunity of displaying their sagacity for the mystery of the whole affair positively defied conjecture but who can the man be that is at the bottom of all this and where can his residence be situated were the questions which every tongue uttered and to which no one could reply that such an extraordinary incident could occur in the metropolis without leaving the faintest trace or the smallest clue to the elucidation of the enigma appeared almost incredible as for sir christopher blunthe certainly did not appear to know whether he stood upon his head or his heels the home secretary sent for him in the course of the afternoon and received from his lips a full and complete statement of the whole occurrence for the government was naturally indignant that any individual should unwarrantably usurp the functions of the proper authorities by holding murderers in his own custody and adopting his own course to prove the innocence of a man in the grasp of justice sir christopher was however unable to afford the slightest information which was likely to lead to the discovery of that individual or of his place of abode on his return to his own house in jermyn street sir christopher found several noblemen and influential gentlemen including three or four members of parliament waiting to see him and he instantly became the lion of the company no pen can describe the immense pomposity with which he repeated his narrative of the mysterious transaction no words can convey an idea of the immeasurable conceit and selfsufficiency with which he described the crossexamination of the murderers in fact the knight made himself so busy in the matterwas so accessible to all visitors who were anxious to gratify their curiosity by asking a thousand questionsand was so ready to afford the newspaperreporters all the information which he had to impart respecting the incident that no one thought of applying to dr lascelles in a similar manner this circumstance was the more agreeable to the physician inasmuch as he not only disliked wasting his time in gossip but was well pleased at escaping the necessity of giving vague answers or positive denials in an affair the details of which were in reality no mystery to him to all his visitors sir christopher blunt took care to speak in the following termsyou see the individual who is the prime mover in this most extraordinary proceeding required the assistance of no ordinary magistrate he wanted a man of keen penetrationthe most perfect businesshabitsand of the highest charactera man in a word who would probe the very souls of the two miscreants to be placed before him and on whose report the world could implicitly rely that was the reason wherefore i was pitched upon as the justice of the peace best qualified to undertake so difficult a business sir christopher became a perfect hero as the mysterious stranger had predicted and during the remainder of that memorable day on which the innocence of mr torrens was proclaimed jermyn street was literally lined with carriages the common destination being the knights abodeso that a stranger in the metropolis would have supposed that such a scene of animation and excitement could only be occasioned by the arrival of some great foreign prince or that the prime minister lived in that house and was holding a leve when all sir christophers visitors had retired and he found himself alone in his drawingroom at about halfpast ten that evening he threw himself on a sofa exclaiming aloud egad that old fellow who knocked down the irish captain and afterwards turned out to be a young man was quite right i am a heroa regular hero this popularity is truly delightful i really do not envy the duke of wellington his having won the battle of waterloo no indeednot i sir christopher blunt is a greater man than his grace although only a knight scarcely had the worthy gentleman arrived at this very satisfactory conclusion when mr lykspittal entered the room holding his portfolio in his hand and bowing so low at every third step which he took in advancing towards the knight that it really seemed as if he were anxious to ascertain how close to the floor he could put his nose without rolling completely over like the clown at astleys my revered patron began mr lykspittal i have taken the liberty of bringing the first half dozen pages of the manuscript of the pamphlet the deuce take the pamphlet mr lykspittal shouted sir christopher leaping from the sofa and in the exuberance of his joy kicking the portfolio from the literary gentlemans hands up to the ceiling so that the papers all showered down upon the head of their author who stood amazed and aghast at this singular reception but in the next moment it struck the discomfited mr lykspittal that sir christopher blunt had suddenly taken leave of his sensesor in other words had gone raving mad and he rushed to the door stopstop cried sir christopher darting after him what the deuce is the matter with the man nodontdont injure me roared mr lykspittal falling upon his knees as the knight caught him by the arm injure you my good fellow exclaimed sir christopher surveying him with the utmost amazement what could possibly put such a thing into your head i am not angry with you im only mad i know you are cried mr lykspittal in a tone of horror while his countenance expressed the most ludicrous alarm yesmadliterally madinsanemy dear fellow vociferated sir christopher quitting his hold upon the literary gentleman and absolutely dancing round him o lord o lord groaned mr lykspittal still upon his knees and nailed by terror to the spot insanemad with joy cried the knight but get upand dont be frightened i am not angry with you but i suppose that the idea of entering the presence of a man like me is too much for you my poor fellow added sir christopher stopping short in the midst of his capering antics and surveying the literary gentleman with immense commiseration oh only madwith joy murmured mr lykspittal considerably relieved by the assurance and starting to his feet then dexterously catching at the suspicion which sir christopher in his boundless selfconceit had expressed the literary gentleman suddenly resumed his usual cringing manner and said in a tone of deep veneration pardon me my excellent patron iffor a moment overcome by your presencethe presence of a man whose name is upon every tongue say no more about it my good fellow cried the knight with all the bland condescension of a patron to tell you the truth i am quite beside myself with joy but i should not expose myself thus to any one save yourself you are however a privileged personbehind the scenes as it were and you know how necessary popularity is to me egad mr lykspittal i little thought when i began life as a poor boy that i should one day become a great a very great meekly suggested the sycophant a very great man added sir christopher emphatically as he surveyed himself in a neighbouring mirror i tell you what mr lykspittalthose vulgar citizens of portsoken must now be ready to cut their throats a person did expire in that ward very suddenly today sir christopher observed the literary gentleman drawing upon his imagination for this little incident which he knew would prove most welcome to the knights vanity and theres every reason to suppose that his death was caused by vexation no doubt of it exclaimed the justice of the peace playing with his shirtfrill dont you see that there will be now no necessity for the pamphlets here mr lykspittals countenance fell but you shall write instead continued the knight a complete narrative of my most romantic and extraordinary adventures here mr lykspittals countenance brightened up again noyou shant though cried his patron an idea striking him again the sycophants brow became overcast you shall write the history of my life added sir christopher and again the literary gentlemans brow expanded yesthe life and times suggested mr lykspittal the life and times of sir christopher blunt exclaimed the knight triumphantly in three volumes large octavo with portraits added the sycophant egad thats a capital suggestion of yoursthe portraits i mean said sir christopher but you must show that although i began the world with nothing yet i am of an ancient and highly respectable family certainly my dear sir there was no doubt a blunt at crecy or agincourt observed mr lykspittal at all events it is easy to say there was and in a note put see mss british museum that is the way we always manage in such cases my dear sir christopher the british museum is a most convenient place whatto write in asked the justice of the peace no sirto furnish pedigrees for those who havent got any ah i understand cried sir christopher chuckling capital capital well my good fellow set about the life and times directly but by the bye i wish the work to begin something in this wayit was on a dark and tempestiferous nightthe wind roaredthe artillery flew in fitting guststhe streaming shafts of electricity shot across the eccentric skyand so on thats a pretty sentence you perceive and being entirely my own compositionstriking me in fact at the momentand not suggested by any other person it does you infinite credit sir christopher interrupted mr lykspittal with an obsequious bow and with a leetle correction oh of course you will use your discretion well now we understand each other mr lykspittal and you will begin the work immediately of course you must introduce a great quantity of correspondence between myself and the leading men of this age but who are now all dead have you any such letters by you sir enquired the literary gentleman not i ejaculated sir christopher blunt speaking bluntly indeed oh thats no matteri can easily invent some observed mr lykspittal i thank you most sincerely for your kindyour generous patronage my dear sir christopher in fact i can never forget itii and mr lykspittal by way of working his sycophancy up to the highest possible pitchor shall we not say down to the lowest degree of selfabasementaffected to burst into tears and rushed from the room poor fellow hes quite overcome by his feelings murmured sir christopher to himself thats what i call real gratitude now and having mused upon this and divers other matters for some few minutes the worthy knight went up stairs to see his affectionate spouse and the baby ere he retired to his own apartment chapter xcvii carlton house we are now about to relate an incident which at present may appear to have little to do with the thread of our narrative but which we can assure our readers will hereafter prove of immense importance in the development of the tale on the evening of that day when the innocence of mr torrens was proclaimed as related in the preceding chapter king george iv gave a grand entertainment at carlton house this splendid mansion was that monarchs favourite residencenot only when he was prince of wales and regent but likewise while he wore on his unworthy brow the british diadem execrable as the character of this unprincipled voluptuary and disgusting debauchee notoriously was he unquestionably possessed good taste in choosing the decorations of a drawingroom selecting a paper of a suitable pattern to match particular furniture and superintending the fittings of a banquettinghall carlton house was accordingly rendered a perfect gem of a palace under his auspices and there the king loved to dwell passing his evenings in elegant orgies and his nights in lascivious enjoyment the interior of carlton house was indeed most sumptuous in all its arrangements the stateapartments were fitted up with a grandeur properly chastened by elegance and convenience and comfort were studied as much as magnificence the entrancehall was paved with veined marble the roof being supported by ionic columns from the quarries of sienna the west anteroom contained many fine portraits by sir joshua reynolds but the most splendid of all the apartments was the crimson drawingroom which was decorated in the richest and yet most tasteful manner the rich draperies the architectural embellishments the immense pierglasses the chandeliers of cut glass and the massive furniture all richly gilt evinced the state of perfection which the arts and manufactures have attained in this country adjoining the crimson drawingroom was the rotunda the architecture of which was of the ionic order every part having been selected from the finest specimens of ancient greece the ceiling was painted to represent the sky and was in the shape of a hemisphere another beautiful apartment was the rose satin drawingroom fitted up after the chinese fashion and in the middle of which stood a circular table of sevres porcelain the gift of louis xviii to the king many pictures by the old masters likewise embellished that room we must also mention the blue velvet room remarkable for the refined taste displayed in its decorationsand the library golden drawingroom gothic diningroom bow room conservatory armoury vestibule and throne room the last of which was fitted up with crimson velvet and produced when illuminated a superb effect this rapid glance at the interior of carlton house may serve to afford the reader a general idea of the splendour of that palacea splendour almost dazzling to contemplate if we consider it for a few moments in juxtaposition with the deplorable misery of thousands and thousands of cottages huts and hovels in which so large a number of the working population are forced to dwell but kings and queens care nothing for the condition of their people so long as their selfish desires can be gratified and all their childish whims or extravagant caprices can be fulfilled the industrious millions may rot in their miserable hovels crushed by the weight of that taxation which is so largely augmented by the wants of royalty it is absurd to venerate and adore royalty for royalty is either despicably frivolous or vilely arbitraryand he who admires or adores it is an enemy to his own interests let us however return to the subject of this chapter it was ten at night and carriage after carriage in rapid succession set down the noble and beauteous guests at the entrance of carlton house the palace itself was a blaze of light and the brilliant lustre shed throughout the spacious rooms by the magnificent chandeliers was reflected on the numerous pierglasses and enhanced by the splendour of the diamonds worn by the ladies upwards of four hundred guestsconstituting the lite of the fashionable worldwere there assembled and amongst them moved the king himselfundoubtedly a polished gentleman although the fewthe very few qualifications which he did possess have been greatly exaggerated by writers of the lykspittal school it was a reunion of beauty rank and fashion of the most brilliant description though on a limited scale a full band was in attendance and dancing commenced in the drawingrooms shortly after ten oclock amongst the guests was the earl of ellinghamconspicuous by his fine form and handsome countenance and more deserving of respect on account of his noble nature than by reason of his noble name for a title is a thing which any monarch can bestowbut god alone can create the generous heart and the glorious intellect lady hatfield was likewise there for averse as she was to the assemblies of fashion yet having received a card of invitation to this reunion she could not refuse to obey the royal commands and beautiful she appeared toowith diamonds sparkling on her hair and in a dress which enhanced the loveliness of her complexion and set off her graceful figure and rounded bust to their utmost advantage she had accompanied the ladies of a noble family with whom she was intimately acquainted and when the party was presented to the king he contemplated lady hatfield with an admiration which he did not attempt to conceal indeed he addressed himself particularly to her during the few minutes that he remained in conversation with the party to which she belonged but other guests speedily demanded his attention and he moved away not however without bestowing another long and even amorous look upon georgiana who felt relieved when the monarch was no longer near illustration the earl was speedily by lady hatfields side as soon as she was seated and after a few cursory observations upon the entertainment she said to him have you lately visited mr de medina not for the last two or three days he replied i have been kept much at home by the necessity of preparing materials for the speech which i shall have to make on monday evening next on moving according to the notice which i have already given in the house of lords for certain papers calculated to throw some light on the state of the industrious classes you at last intend to shine as a great statesman arthur said lady hatfield with a smile i intend to apply myself to the grand subject of proposing those measures which may ameliorate the condition of millions of human beings answered the earl do you not remember georgiana that i told you how one whose name i need not mention adjured me to do my duty as a british legislator and have you forgotten that i explained to you the deep impression which his language on that occasion made upon me i have forgotten nothing that you ever told me answered lady hatfield and i am rejoiced to hear that you are now seriously resolved to apply your great talents to so useful a purpose you must give the necessary orders to enable me to obtain admittance to the house of lords on monday evening next for i would not for worlds be disappointed in hearing your sentiments upon so grand and important a question if we were not in the light of sister and brother to each other georgiana i should say that i am flattered by your words remarked the earl but as it is i can only assure you that i receive the expression of your desire to be present in the house of lords next monday as a mark of that sincere attachmentthat profound friendship which you bear towards me and which is so entirely reciprocated and have you reflected upon the conversation which occurred between us the other day relative to miss esther de medina enquired georgiana i have was the answer but as yet i have arrived at no decision the next time you call upon me then said lady hatfield smiling and yet subduing a sigh at the same moment i shall repeat to you all the arguments in that respect which i used on the former occasion now give me your arm and we will walk into the next room through the open foldingdoors of which i catch a glimpse of some fine paintings to the adjacent apartment they accordingly proceeded and inspected several fine pictures some by the old masters and others by the most celebrated professors in modern art while they were thus engaged the king approached them greeted the earl with urbane cordiality and proceeded to point out to lady hatfield the best compositions amongst the works which she was admiring the monarch then proposed that she should visit the armoury and as when he had first approached she had through deference to royalty relinquished the arm of the earl of ellingham she was now compelled to accept that of the king his majesty however implied by his manner that arthur was to accompany them and the young nobleman accordingly followed the monarch and georgiana to the armoury as they passed through the rooms leading thither many an envious glance was bent upon lady hatfield by the wives and daughters of aristocracy each of whom would have given ten years of her life to obtain so much favour in the eyes of royalty although the king was at this period upwards of sixtyfour years of age there was nevertheless nothing in lady hatfields manner which indicated a consciousness of triumph her deportment was modest yet dignifiedand manifesting that ease and selfpossession which constitute such important proofs of good breeding this is the first time that i have seen your ladyship at carlton house remarked the king as they passed slowly on towards the armoury i have never had the honour of visiting your majestys palace until the present occasion was the reply you must not be forgotten in future said the king then slightly sinking his voice he added a palace is the fitting region to be adorned by beauty such as yours lady hatfield affected not to hear the observation and the earl of ellingham actually did not i am an enthusiastic admirer of female loveliness continued the king and i envy those who possess the talent of pourtraying upon canvas the features which are most dear to them by the way added his majesty as if a sudden idea had just struck him i intend to have a diana painted for my library beautiful lady hatfield you must be the original of my diana grant me that favouri shall esteem it highly and tomorrow sir thomas lawrence shall call upon your ladyship to receive your commands relative to the first sitting your majesty will deign to excuse me said georgiana in a cold but profoundly respectful tone indeed i shall receive no apology observed the king laughing but here we are in the armoury and it will give me infinite pleasure to direct your attention to those curiosities which are the worthiest of notice george the fourth then pointed out to lady hatfield and the earl of ellingham the swords which had belonged respectively to the chevalier bayard the great duke of marlborough louis xiv that glorious patriot hampden would that we had such a man at the present time general moreau marshal luckner and other heroes there was also a hunting knife which had belonged to charles xii of sweden and in addition to these curiosities there were many military antiquities especially in costume all of which the king explained to the lady and the earl from time to time it struck lady hatfield that her royal companion pressed her arm gently in his own and not in an accidental way as he addressed himself to her and he also looked at her more than once in a very peculiar manner had he been of a less exalted rank she would have instantaneously quitted him but she reflected that it would be an evidence of insane vanity and conceit on her part were she to interpret in a particular way attentions which after all might have nothing more than a common significancy she however remained cold but respectful and if the king really meant any thing more than the usual courtesy which a gentleman naturally pays to a lady he received not the slightest encouragement ellingham he said turning abruptly towards the earl do you carry a snuffbox i do not sire was the answer that is provoking i left mine on the porcelain table in the chinese drawing room the young nobleman understood the hint bowed and departed to fetch the boxnot however for a moment suspecting that the king had any sinister motive in sending him away from the armoury where his majesty and georgiana now remained alone together for that museum had not been thrown open for the inspection of the guests generally beautiful lady hatfield said george the fourth the moment the foldingdoors had closed of their own accord behind the earl you will consent to allow lawrence to copy your sweet countenance for my diana your majesty will deign to excuse me was the cold and now reserved answer for georgianas suspicions previously excited in a faint degree had gathered strength from the fact of her royal companion having got rid of the earl in the manner already described noi will not excuse you beautiful lady exclaimed the king enthusiasticallyor with affected enthusiasm yours is a countenance which being seen once leaves behind a desire to behold it again and as i shall have no chance of often viewing the original i must content myself with the contemplation of the picture your majesty is pleased to compliment me thus said georgiana more coldly than before and your majesty is of course privileged but such words coming from a less exalted quarter would be deemed offensive i am unfortunate in not being able to render myself agreeable to lady hatfield observed george the fourth drawing himself proudly up to his full heightfor he was really piqued by the ladys mannerhe who never sued in vain for a beauteous womans smiles but probably reflecting that his haughtiness was little suited either to his previous conduct towards georgiana or to his aims with regard to her he immediately unbent again saying in his blandest and most amiable tones not for worlds would i offend you charming lady on the contrary i would give worlds did i possess them to be able to win a single smile from those sweet lips georgiana withdrew her hand from the kings arm and became red with indignation forgive mepardon me said the monarch hastily i perceive that you are vexed with meand i am very unfortunate in having offended you thus speaking he again proffered his arm which lady hatfield took saying would your majesty deign to conduct me back to the company at this moment the earl of ellingham returned to the armoury and handed the king his snuffbox the party then retraced their way to the splendid saloons the monarch conversing the while in a manner which seemed to indicate that lady hatfield had no ground to fear his recurrence to subjects that were disagreeable to her at length he resigned her to the care of lord ellingham but ere he turned away he gave her a rapid and significant look as much as to say i throw myself upon your generosity not to mention my conduct towards you the king now withdrew from the apartments thrown open for the reception of the company and remained absent for nearly an hour when he returned his countenance was much flushed and it was evident that he had been enjoying a glass or two of his favourite curaoapunch in company with a few booncompanions who had been summoned to attend him in a private room remote from the statesaloons one of the booncompanions just alluded to was a certain sir phillip warrenan old courtier who was supposed to enjoy the confidence of the king and who it was rumoured had been the means of extricating his royal master when prince of wales from many a difficulty in financial matters as well as from the danger of exposure in divers amatory intrigues without any defined official position about the person of the king sir phillip was nevertheless a very important individual in the royal householdone of those useful but mysterious agents who while enjoying the reputation of men of honour are in reality the means by which the dirtywork of palaces is accomplished in appearance sir phillip warren was a stout redfaced goodhumouredlooking man and not the least of those qualifications which rendered him so especial a favourite with the king was the aristocratic faculty that he possessed of taking his three bottles after dinner without seeming to have imbibed any thing stronger than water such was the courtier who accosting the earl of ellingham shortly after the kings return to the drawingrooms drew that nobleman aside with an intimation that he wished to say a few words to him in private taking the earls arm sir phillip warren led him away from the brilliantly lighted saloons and introduced the nobleman into the blue velvet closeta small but elegantly decorated room where a single lamp was burning upon the table his majesty has been speaking to me concerning your lordship said sir phillip warren when arthur and himself were seated alone together in the closet indeed our royal master has been graciously pleased to intimate that he is much prepossessed in your favour the earl bowed a cold recognition of the complimentfor he was far too enlightened a man not to feel disgust at the sycophantic language in which that compliment was conveyedand he was likewise convinced that there was some ulterior object in view a young nobleman such as your lordship may rise to the highest offices in the state by means of the royal favour continued sir phillip your talents are known to be greatand your influence in the house of lords is consequently extensive but his majesty regrets to learn that your lordship seems inclined to proclaim opinions so far in advance of the spirit of the age as to be dangerous to the institutions of the countrythose institutions which the wisdom of our ancestors devised and which the experience of ages has consecrated really sir phillip warren said the earl unfeignedly surprised at this address i am at a loss to conceive wherefore you should seek to lead me into a political discussion on such an occasion as the present i will explain myself returned the courtier his majesty retired just now with a few of his faithful servants amongst whom i have the honour to be included to partake of a little refreshment and while we were thus engaged his majesty made an observation highly in favour of yourself a nobleman present thereupon informed his majesty that your lordship had placed a certain notice upon the books of the house of which your lordship is so distinguished an ornament the nature of that notice is displeasing to his majesty who is graciously pleased to think that the common people already consider themselves of far greater importance than they really are if sir by the contemptuous phrase the common people you mean that enlightened and respectable bodythe working classes exclaimed the earl indignantly i must beg to declare that i differ totally from the opinion which his majesty has expressed concerning them wellwell my dear earl said sir phillip in a conciliatory tone every one has a right to his own opinionwe are aware of that fact but permit me to represent to you that you will gain no personal advantage by espousing the cause of the masses i seek no personal advantage cried arthur with an impatient gesture indicative of his desire to terminate the interview at once i am not putting myself forward as a factious demagoguei seek not the honours of a democratic championship but this i intend and contemplate sir phillip warrento exert all my energies use all the little influence i may possess and devote any amount of talent which god has given me for the purpose of directing the attention of the legislature to the neglected oppressed and impoverished condition of that fine english people which constitutes the pillar of the state by adopting such a course my lord remonstrated sir phillip you will offend his majesty who is now so well disposed towards you that were you inclined to enter his service in the sphere of diplomacy your wishes might be complied with at once indeed the post of envoy plenipotentiary to the important grand duchy of castelcicala is at this moment vacant and if your lordship in one word sir phillip warren interrupted the earl of ellingham rising from his seat you are desirous to tempt me into a compromise wherefore do you not frankly explain yourself at once and say withdraw your notice from the books of the house of lords and depart as ambassador to the court of angelo grand duke of castelcicala to which i should immediately reply no possible reward which an earthly monarch can give should induce me to abandon that task which a sense of duty has imposed upon me sir phillip warren was astonished at the firmness and boldness with which the earl spoke for such manly independence was quite unusual in the atmosphere of a corrupt court and venal political world the fact was that sir phillip had undertaken the task of effecting the desired compromise with the earl the king had specially entrusted the matter to himand the courtier trembled at the idea of being compelled to report the total failure of the negotiation to his royal master he was therefore cruelly embarrassed and knew not what course to adopt but suddenly an idea struck himfor he perceived that the earl was not a man to be tempted by reward but he thought that the nobleman might perhaps be overcome by the powers of eloquent reasoning my dear earl he accordingly said you are too honourable and too highlyprincipled a statesman not to yield to conviction grant me in common justice one favour i ask it in the name of his majesty speak exclaimed arthur resuming his chair to show that he was prepared to listen with courteous attention the prime minister is present at the reunion this evening said sir phillip will you hear any argument which he may address to you upon the subject of your notice for next monday night and consider whatever may pass between you to be strictly confidential i should be unreasonable to refuse to listen to any observations which so high a functionary as the prime minister may address to me answered the earl and i shall consider our interview to be private and confidential on condition that no insult be offered to me in the shape of temptation or promise of reward if it can be shown by fair argument that i am wrong in pursuing the course which i have adopted i will yield to conviction but i shall spurn with contempt and indignation any other means that may be adopted to induce me to withdraw my notice from the books of the house the interview shall take place upon the condition your lordship has stipulated be kind enough to await my return with the prime minister sir phillip warren then withdrew closing the door behind him but scarcely had he left the blue velvet closet when the lamp upon the table suddenly grew dim and in a few moments the light expired altogether doubtless through lack of oilleaving the room in total darkness the earl was uncertain how to act and while he was still deliberating with himself whether to leave the closet in search of a servant to procure another light or await the return of sir phillip warren the door opened this room is in darkness sire immediately said a female voice which the earl of ellingham recognised to be that of lady hatfield i pledge you my royal word that i was ignorant of the fact when i conducted you hither returned the king but pray enter beauteous lady we may at all events converse at our ease for a few minutes and to the amazement of the earl georgiana complied with the kings request accompanying his majesty into that dark room the door of which was immediately closed indeed so astoundedso shocked was arthur by this incident that he sate motionless and speechless in his chair at the further extremity of the apartment my dearest lady hatfield said the king i thank you most sincerely for having thrown aside that chillingfreezing manner which you maintained in the early part of the evening when i sought to make you understand the profound admiration with which your beauty has inspired me how unfortunate are princes they cannot obey the dictates of their heartsthey dare not bestow their hand where their affections are engaged but society is justly lenient in their behalf and thus the lady who becomes a monarchs favourite is regarded with envy and respect and not with contumely or reproach but no lady who entertains the slightest feeling of selfrespect observed lady hatfield in a low and tremulous tone will abandon herself in a moment even to a monarch there must be proofs of real attachment on his side granted beauteous georgiana interrupted the king impatiently show me how i can demonstrate my affection towards yourselfask me any boon which i have the power to grant and which i dare accord oh if your majesty would only fulfil this pledge exclaimed lady hatfield joyfully do you doubt me demanded george the fourth put me to the test i sayand you shall be convinced of my readiness my anxiety to prove how deeply i am attached to you although the impression made on my heart be so sudden sire resumed lady hatfield i shall be so bold as to take your majesty at your word tomorrow your majesty will receive a certain paper and i warn your majesty beforehand that its contents will be most singular i shall ask no farther explanations than you may choose to give beauteous georgiana observed the king but when i receive the paper what next do you require that your majesty shall affix to it your royal signature and likewise direct your majestys secretary of state for the home department to countersign it responded lady hatfield this being done the document must be returned to me all that you have stipulated shall be carried into effect said the king then sinking his voice and assuming a tender tone he added but will there be room for me to hope sweet lady your majesty must remember the observation i made ere now interrupted georgiana before a woman whose affection is really worthy of being possessed can consent to surrender herself entirely even to one so highly placed as you sire her heart must be won by kindnesses shownby proofs of attachment given i accept the condition implied charming georgiana exclaimed the king you imagine that i am now influenced by a sudden capricethat the love which i bear for you is the phantasy of a moment welli will convince you to the contrary and when i shall have proved to you that my passion survives the passing hourthenthen sweet lady you will not suffer me to hope in vain comelet us return to the drawingroom and believe me when i declare that you have made me supremely happy but ere we again seek that society where a cold ceremony must keep us under a rigid restraint allow me to seal upon your lips that pledge for which i have already given my royal word no sirenot nownot yet cried lady hatfield in a tone which showed that she felt herself to be in a position to dictate to her regal admirer cruel charmer said the king but i suppose you must be permitted to have your own way send me the paper tomorrowlet it be addressed to me under cover to sir phillip warrenand you shall see by the haste with which it will be returned to you that i shall count every minute an hour and reckon every day to be a year until that happy moment comes when you will be wholly and solely mine george the fourth then opened the door and led georgiana away from the room in which this singular scene had taken place but what of the earl of ellingham so completely stunned and stupified was he by all that had occurred that he never moved a muscle and retained his very breath suspended while his ears drank in every word that passed between the king and lady hatfield thus did he become an unwilling and unintentional listener to a discourse which created the most painful emotions in his breast was it possible that the lady hatfield whom he looked upon as the very personification of virtue in spite of the terrible misfortune which had deprived her of her chastitywas it possible that she whose soul he had imagined to be so pure though dwelling in a body polluted by the ravisherwas it possible that she had already suffered herself to be dazzled by the delusive overtures of royalty and was she seriously about to resign herself to the kings armsto become the mistress of that regal debauchee of sixtyfour my god thought the earl i who had such an exalted opinion of female virtue then he remembered that portion of the conversation which had turned upon the document lady hatfield was to send to the king for his royal signature and which she had prepared him to find of a most singular character of what nature could that document be conjecture was vain and useless the first impulse of the earl was to inform lady hatfield that he had overheard her conversation with the king and conjure her to reflect seriously ere she committed a fatal step of which she would assuredly have to repent for the remainder of her life but second thoughts convinced him that he must retain profoundly secret the fact of his acquaintance with the understanding existing between georgiana and the monarch for in confessing himself to have been an eavesdropper he should have to blush in the presence of one whom he was to take to task he saw it would be difficult to make the lady believe that he himself was so stupified by her conduct as to be totally unable to declare his presence in a room where a private conversation was in progress and she would naturally upbraid him he thought for what might be looked upon as a proof of mean and contemptible curiosity on his partalthough as the reader is aware he was indeed animated by no such vile sentiment moreover in resigning all claim to her handor rather in recognising the impossibility of contracting an alliance with a woman whom his brother had ravishedthe earl had ceased to enjoy any right to advise or control her in respect to her moral conductand it now struck him that painfully situated as she wasunable to become the wife of any honourable and confiding manshe had accepted overtures which would render her a monarchs mistress in a word he conceived that he should best consult her happiness as matters stood by affecting a complete ignorance of the understanding so suddenly established between herself and george the fourth having come to this determination he quitted the blue velvet closet and was retracing his way to the scene of brilliant gaiety when he encountered sir phillip warren in the corridor i searched every where for the minister and was unable to find him said the courtier at last upon making enquiries i learnt that he had taken his departure i am not sorry that it is so returned the earl of ellingham for i feel convinced that no argument although i should have listened to it as a matter of courtesy could deter me from advocating the cause of the working classes with these words the nobleman bowed coldly to sir phillip warren and passed on to the stateapartments in one of which he found lady hatfield seated with the friends in whose company she had arrived at the entertainment her manner was calm and collected and if there were any change it was in the slightthe very slight smile of triumph which played upon her lipat least it struck the earl that such an expression her rosy mouth wore as he approached her but it disappeared as she began to converse with him and he so subdued his own feelings that she did not observe any thing to lead her to suppose that he was aware of her understanding with the king precisely at midnight the supperrooms were thrown open and a magnificent banquet was served up we need scarcely say that the most costly wines the most expensive luxuries and every delicacy that gold could procure appeared upon the board which absolutely groaned beneath the weight of massive plate superb porcelain and brilliant crystal the festivity was kept up until a late hour indeed it was past two in the morning before the company began to separate but when the earl of ellingham was once more at home and had retired to his chamber sleep would not visit his eyes fatigued though he werethe scene which had occurred in the blue velvet closet was so impressed upon his mind that he could not divert his thoughts into another channel it was not that he was jealous of lady hatfieldnocircumstances had changed his love for her into a sincere and deeplyrooted friendship but he felt disappointedhe felt deceived in the estimate he had formed of her character he had believed her to be possessed of a mind too strong to be dazzled by the splendours of royalty and to yield herself up to a man whom it was impossible for her to love merely for the sake of becoming a kings mistress had george the fourth been estimable on account of character amiable in disposition and worthy of admiration as a sovereign the earl thought that there would in this case have been a shadowbut even then only a shadowof an excuse for the conduct of georgiana the reverse was however the precise factfor the king was notoriously a hardened profligatea confirmed debaucheea disgusting voluptuaryand an unprincipled monarchin a word such a man as a refined and strongminded woman would look upon with abhorrence so thought lord ellinghamand when he recalled to memory the frightful behaviour of george the fourth towards the unhappy caroline against whom his vile agents trumped up the most unfounded accusations and who was hunted to death by the bloodthirsty instruments of a hellish system of persecutionwhen the earl reflected upon all this his amazement at the conduct of lady hatfield increased almost to horror at length his thoughts wandered to esther de medinaor rather the beautiful jewess became mixed up with them for it was impossible that the scene in the blue velvet closet could be entirely banished from his mindand as he pondered upon her innocenceher artlessnessher amiable qualities his confidence in woman revived and he exclaimed aloud as he lay in his sumptuous couch oh wherefore do i delay securing to myself the possession of such a treasure yes estherdearest estherthou shalt be mine footnote it is contrary to court etiquette for a lady and gentleman to remain arminarm when conversing with a royal personage chapter xcviii an acquittal and a sentence the blackamoor in his mysterious abode beheld the successful progress of his grand schemes and while all london was busy with conjectures relative to the daring unknown who seemed to have constituted himself the instrument of justice and the champion of innocence wrongly accused the object of this general interest and curiosity remained in impervious concealment the secretary of state offered a reward of two hundred pounds to any one that should give such information as to lead to the discovery of the person who had enticed sir christopher blunt to his unknown abode and who had caused dr lascelles to be conveyed thither by force and the most astute bow street agents were employed in instituting enquiries in every part of the metropolis with a view to find out the dwelling of the individual in question the newspapers teemed with the most absurd and contradictory reports on the subject and a thousand wild rumours were constantly circulating throughout the metropolis the result of all this was that those who were employed in the enquiries above alluded to were so mystified and bewildered that they worked like drunken men in the darktaking up and following any ridiculous information which they obtained either from wags or from persons who wished to appear more knowing than their neighboursand pursuing what at first might seem to be a clue but which invariably led to nothing satisfactory at last the blackamoors own retainers who were all faithful to their master augmented this confusion of rumours and ideas by mingling amongst the gossips in places of public resort and gravely propagating reports which were sure to direct the attention of the bow street runners from the very point where its object lay and all that dr lascelles had been known to hazard in the shape of conjecture in the matter was a hint that to the best of his belief the carriage in which he had been borne away on the memorable night of the confession had eventually stopped in one of the most easterly suburbs of the metropolis the consequence of this suggestion was that wapping whitechapel bethnal green and globe town were regularly explored by the bow street officialsbut entirely without success although the innocence of mr torrens was universally believed yet as he had been committed for trial it was necessary that he should undergo the ordeal this ceremony took place a few days after the publication of the confession of the real murderersindeed on the very monday following the grand entertainment at carlton house the prisoner was arraigned on the charge of having assassinated sir henry courtenay and the recorder of london presided on the bench the counsel for the prosecution merely stated the particulars of the discovery of the corpse of the deceased baronet and the circumstances which had led to the prisoners committal but he did not for a moment insist that those circumstances were conclusive against him sir christopher blunt then detailed in evidence all that he had given in narrative at bow street and dr lascelles corroborated his statement the confession signed by joshua pedler and timothy splint and likewise the one in which martha torrens had attested to certain facts in favour of the prisoner were read by the clerk of arraigns and the counsel for the defence was about to address the court when the jury declared that their minds were already made up the acquittal of the prisoner immediately followed and the first person who shook hands with him as he was released from the dock was sir christopher blunt mr torrens accepted a seat in the knights carriage and repaired to a friends house in the neighbourhood where clarence villiers adelais rosamond and esther de medina were assembled to welcome his acquittal relative to which none of them had felt at all uneasy but it was evident that although thus relieved from the dreadful charge and appalling danger which had recently hung over him mr torrens was an altered man he had received a blow which had shaken his constitution to its very basishis mental energies were impairedand instead of a hale man of between fiftyfive and fiftysix which was his actual age he seemed to be a feeble tottering octogenarian when the excitement produced by the meeting with his family after his release had somewhat subsided mr torrens said with nervous impatience rosamond my dear child i shall leave england this very day will you accompany your father leave us the moment you are restored to us exclaimed adelais bursting into tears yesyes returned the unhappy man i cannotdare not remain in england though released from a criminal gaol yet i am in danger of being plunged into a debtors prison for i am ruined as you all knowtotally irredeemably ruined besidesnever never again could i dwell in that house where so many frightful things have occurred yes he repeated i must leave england at once and you my poor rosamond he added with tears trickling down his sunken cheeks will have to support your father by means of your accomplishments in a foreign land nothat must not be said esther de medina passing a handkerchief rapidly over her eyes rosamond has friends to whom although they have known her but for so short a period her welfare is dear foreseeing some such decision as that to which you have now come relative to leaving england my father has desired me to place a thousand pounds at your daughters disposal continued the beautiful jewess addressing herself to the wondering torrens and at the same time placing a sealed packet in rosamonds hands oh my generousmy excellenthearted friend exclaimed rosamond embracing the jewess tenderly how is it possible that i could have merited this kindnessthis extraordinary bounty at your hands we are fellowcreatures though of a different creed said esther modestlybut she was compelled to receive the thanks of the astonished torrens and of the admiring clarence and adelais villiers now drew his fatherinlaw aside and spoke to him concerning mrs torrens i cannot see her clarencei cannot meet her again he replied besides an interview would be useless our marriage was not one of affection as you are well aware and moreoverbut he added suddenly interrupting himself and looking tremblingly in the young mans face while his voice sank to a low hollow whispershe has doubtless told you alland then he glanced toward rosamond who was conversing with esther de medina and adelais at the farther end of the room yesi know all returned villiers and the words seemed to convulse his wretched listener with horror but it is too late to amend the pastand it is not for me to reproach you now your own conscience mr torrens will prove a sufficient punishment for the frightful wrong you have done to that poor girl and fear not that i shall impart the sickening truth to my wife who is already too deeply affected by all that has lately occurred thank you clarencethank you at least for that assurance said the old man his voice almost suffocated with terrible emotions you perceive how impossible it is that i should remain in englandwith so many dreadful reminiscences to make me ashamed to look those who know me in the face this very instant will rosamond and myself set out on our way to a foreign land you will be kind enough to send my trunks after me to dover i do not attempt to dissuade you from this step observed villiers because i can see no more agreeable alternative mr torrens decision was then communicated to the three ladies and the farewell scene between the sisters was affecting in the extreme nor less did adelais deplore the necessity which compelled her to separate from her father but she at least had a consolation in the midst of her griefa solace in the possession of a husband who loved her devotedly and whom she adored a postchaise was speedily in attendance and mr torrens took his departure from the english capital in company with his younger daughter esther de medina did not take leave of clarence and adelais before she had made them promise to pay her an early visit at finchley manor and the young couple returned to torrens cottage more than ever prepossessed in favour of the beautiful jewess who seemed to delight only in doing good on the ensuing day martha torrens was placed in the dock before the recorder of london charged with the crime of forgery the court of the old bailey was crowded with persons belonging to those religious associations of which the prisoner had lately been so conspicuous a member there was mr jonathan pugwash president of the south sea islands biblecirculating society not only with a face indicative of its owners attachment to brandy but also with a breath smelling very strongly of that special liquor there also was the reverend malachi sawkins looking so awfully miserable at the scandal brought by the prisoners conduct on the religious world that a stranger would have supposed him to be at least her brother if not her husbandand there likewise was the reverend mr sheepshanks who having made his peace with the members of the abovementioned society had latterly come out much stronger than ever in the shape of a saint many other sleek and oily or thin and pale religious gentlemen were present on this occasion and in the gallery were numerous old ladies all belonging to the ultraevangelical school and who appeared to divide their attention between the task of wiping their eyes with white cambric handkerchiefs and strengthening their nerves by means of frequent applications to little flasks or bottles which they took from their pockets or muffs mrs torrens was supported into the dock by two turnkeys of newgate for she was overcome with shame and grief at the position in which her crime had placed her she was indeed a pitiable object and it was evident that whatever penalty the bench might award her punishment in this world had already begun the indictment being read she pleaded guilty in a faint voice and the prosecutors strongly recommended her to mercy the recorder put on the black cap and proceeded to address the prisoner in a most feeling manner his lordship said that the law left him no alternative but to pronounce sentence of death he however observed that considering the contrition manifested by the plea of guilty and the intercession of the bankers who had been defrauded of their money by the forgery he should recommend the prisoner to the mercy of the crown his lordship concluded by an intimation that she must make up her mind to pass the remainder of her days as an exile in the penal settlements but that her life would be spared she was conveyed in a fainting state away from the dock and the religious gentlemen present gave so awful and simultaneous a groan that the judge was quite startled upon the bench and the jury were horrified in their box footnote at the period of which we are writing this high civic functionary tried cases involving capital penalties as well as those of a less serious nature since the establishment of the central criminal court the great judges of the kingdom preside at the old bailey to try prisoners charged with grave offences chapter xcvix the condition of the working classes in the afternoon of that same monday on which mr torrens was acquitted and his wife condemned vast crowds collected in the vicinity of the houses of parliament the multitude consisted chiefly of members of the industrious classes many individuals being accompanied by their wives and children they were attired in the best raiment that they possessed and their conduct was most orderly and creditable at about a quarter to five oclock the carriages began to arrive and set down at the respective entrances the members of the two houses of parliament some however proceeded thither on horseback and others on foot the crowds neither cheered the popular nor hissed the unpopular legislators who thus passed through the mass which had divided to make way for them until at last one long hearty and glorious outburst welcomed the appearance of the earl of ellingham as he proceeded on horseback attended by his groom to st stephens the young nobleman acknowledged this outpouring of a peoples gratitudenot with a patronising condescension but with an affability which seemed to say i am one of yourselveswere all equaland i am proud of being considered your friend long after he had entered the portals of the house of lords and was lost to the public view did the cheering continue outside for the multitudes appreciated all that was great and generous in the task which a member of a proud aristocracy had undertaken to perform that day in their behalf there was a full attendance of peers temporal and spiritual and the strangers galleries overlooking the throne and the woolsack were crowded with fashionable gentlemen and elegantly dressed ladies amongst the audience there assembled were lady hatfield mr de medina and esther georgiana was not however seated near the jew and his daughter she being unacquainted with them otherwise than by name as the reader is already aware soon after five oclock the earl of ellingham rose from his seat advanced towards the table and proceeded to address the house on the motion of which he had given notice illustration he began by expressing a regret that so important a subject as that which he proposed for discussionnamely the condition of the industrious populationshould not have been taken up by some noble lord more competent than himself to do it adequate justice and he declared most solemnly that no selfish idea of obtaining popularity had influenced him in the course which he was pursuing he then proceeded to expatiate upon the state of the working classes and to urge upon the house the necessity of adopting measures to ameliorate their lamentable condition it was too frequently alleged he observed that those classes were thoughtless improvident ungrateful and intellectually dull but this assertion he emphatically denied despair produced by their unhappy condition naturally led to dissipation in many instances but were the workingman placed in a position so that his livelihood should be rendered less precarious than it now waswere his labour adequately remuneratedwere he more fairly paid by the representatives of propertywere a scale of wages established having a fixed minimum but no fixed maximum the increased comfort thus ensured to him would naturally remove from his mind those cares which drove him to the publichouse his lordship would have no fixed maximum of wages because wages ought always to be increased in proportion to the value of productive labour to employers but he would have a minimum established to obviate the cruel and disastrous effects of those periods when labour exceeded the demand in the market this could not be considered unfair towards employers because when the markets were brisk and trade was flourishing they the employers reaped the greatest benefit from that activity and enriched themselves in a very short time therefore when markets were dull and trade was stagnant they should still be compelled to pay such wages as would enable their employed to live comfortably the profits gained during prosperous seasons not only enabled employers to enjoy handsome incomes but also to accumulate considerable savings and as the best wages scarcely enabled the employed to make any thing like an adequate provision for periods of distress it was not fair that the representatives of property should use the labour of the working classes just when it suited them and discard it or only use it on a miserable recompense when it did not so well suit them for the labour of the employed not only made annual incomes for the employers but also permanent fortunes and the value of that labour should not be calculated as lasting only just as long as it was available for the purpose of producing large profits labour was the working mans capital and should have constant interest as well as money placed in the fundsthat interest of course increasing in proportion to the briskness of markets but never depreciating below a standard valuemuch less being discarded as valueless altogether in times of depression a thousand pounds would always obtain three per cent interest under any circumstances and at particular periods might be worth six or seven per cent labour should be considered in the same light stagnant markets diminished the profits of employers but did not ruin them if they did not obtain profit enough to live upon they had the accumulations of good seasons to fall back upon but how different was the case with the employed to them stagnation of business was ruinstarvationdeaththe breaking up of their little homesthe sudden check of their childrens educationthe cause of demoralisation and degradationand the terrible necessity of applying to the parish the supply and demand of labour were necessarily unequal at many times and in many districts and the government should therefore adopt measures to prevent those frightful fluctuations in wages which carried desolation into the homes of thousands of hardworking industrious and deserving families in fact a law should be passed to ensure the workingman against the casualty of being employed at a price below remuneration in england the poor were not allowed to have a stake in the countrythere were no small propertiesthe land was in the possession of a few individuals comparatively and thus the landed interest constituted a tremendous monopoly most unjust and oppressive to the industrious classes the only way to remove this evil influence and ameliorate the condition of the working populationthe only way to countervail the disastrous effect of that monopoly short of a revolution which would treble or quadruple the number of landed proprietorswas to compel property to maintain labour as long as labour sought for employment and occupation the noble earl then proceeded to state that if the workingclasses were thus treated they would not be driven by their cares and troubles to the excessive use of alcoholic liquors they would not become demoralised by being compelled to migrate from place to place in search of employmentgoing upon the tramp sleeping in hideous dens of vice where numbers were forced to herd together without reference to age or sex they would not be unsettled in all their little arrangements to bring up their children creditably and with due reference to instructionthey would not be made discontented anxious for any change no matter what vindictive towards that society which thus rendered them outcasts and sullen or reckless in their general conduct but as things now were the industrious man never felt settled he knew that the hut which he called his home was held on the most precarious tenurehe felt the sickening conviction that if he had bread and meat today he might have only bread tomorrow and no food at all the day after it was positively frightful to contemplate the condition of mental uncertainty anxiety and apprehension in which millions of persons were thus existing and those who reproached them with recklessness or sullenness should blame themselves as the causes of all that they vituperated lord ellingham next proceeded to show that although there had been a vast increase of wealth and comfort amongst the middle and upper classes yet the condition of the industrious millions was not only unimproved but had positively deteriorated the population was increasing at the rate of souls a dayand pauperism was keeping pace with that increase unrepresented in parliamentwithout any means of making their voice heardpositively incapacitated from having a stake in the country the industrious millions were the mere slaves and tools of the wealthy classes thus an immense mass of persons was kept in bondagein absolute serfdom by an oligarchy was such a state of things just was it rational was it even humane the millions were ground down by indirect taxes in which shape they actually contributed more to the revenue in proportion to their means than the rich the only luxuries which the poor enjoyed and which had become as it were necessariesnamely tea sugar tobacco beer and spiritswere the most productive sources of revenue if noble lords reproached the poor for dirty habits as he well knew that it was their custom to do he would ask them why soap was made an article subject to so heavy a tax it was a contemptible fallacy to suppose that because the poor contributed little or nothing in the shape of direct taxation to the revenue they were positively untaxed he would again declare that the poor paid more in indirect taxes than the rich did in both direct and indirect ways when the relative means of the two parties were taken into consideration from these subjects the earl passed to the consideration of the inequality of the laws and the incongruity severity and injustice of their administration towards the poor every advantage was given to the rich in the way of procuring bail in those cases where security for personal appearance was required but no poor man could possibly give such security he must go to prison and there herd with felons of the blackest dye perhaps on trial his innocence would transpire and then what recompense had he for his long incarcerationhis home broken up during his absenceand his ruined family it was possiblenay it often happened that a man would lie thus in prison for four or five months previously to trial and during that period it would be strange indeed if he escaped gaol contamination then again there were offences of a comparatively venial kind and for which penalties might be inflicted in the shape of fines the alternative being imprisonment these fines were insignificant trifles in the estimation of a rich man but the smallest of them was quite a fortune in the eyes of the poor even a person with a hundred ayear would pay a fine of five pounds rather than go to prison for a month or six weeks but a labouring man earning ten or twelve shillings a week could no more satisfy the demand thus made upon him than he could influence the motion of the earthunless indeed he pawned and pledged every little article belonging to him and the infliction thereby became a blow which he never afterwards recovered did a poor man offend a clergyman he was forthwith put into the spiritual court as the common saying was and the expensive proceedings which he could not stay involved him in utter ruin when a poor man was oppressed by a rich one it was vain and ludicrous to assert that the courts of law were open to him law was a luxury in which only those who possessed ample means could indulge in a case where some grievous injury was sustained by a poor manthe seduction of his wife or daughter for instanceredress or recompense was impossible unless some attorney took up the case on speculation and this was a practice most demoralising and pernicious but if left entirely unassisted in that respect the poor man could no more go to westminster hall than he could afford to dine at longs hotel with regard to the subject of education the noble earl declared that it was positively shocking to think that such care should be taken to convert negroes to christianity thousands of miles off while the most deplorable ignorance prevailed at home the church enjoyed revenues the amount of which actually brought the ministers of the gospel into discredit as evidencing their avaricious and grasping dispositionwhile the people remained as uneducated as if not a single shilling were devoted to spiritual pastors or lay instructors he boldly accused both houses of parliament and the upper classes generally of being anxious to keep the masses in a state of ignorance where instruction was imparted gratuitously it was entirely of a sectarian nature just as if men required to study grammar history arithmetic or astronomy on church of england principles the whole land was overrun by clergymen who lived upon the fat of ituniversities and public schools had been richly endowed for the purpose of propagating knowledge and encouraging learningand yet the people were lamentably ignorant it was a wicked and impudent falsehood to declare that they were intellectually dull or averse to mental improvement common sensethat best of sensewas the special characteristic of the working classes and those who could read were absolutely greedy in their anxiety to procure books newspapers and cheap publications for perusal the fact was that the mind of the industrious population was a rich soil wherein all good seed would speedily take root shoot up and bring forth fruit to perfection but the apprehensions or narrow prejudices of the upper classesthe oligarchywould not permit the seed to be sown now as the soil must naturally produce something even of its own accord it too often gave birth to rank weeds and this was made a matter of scorn reviling and reproach but the real objects of that scornthat revilingand that reproach were those who obstinately and wickedly neglected to put the good soil to the full test of fertilization lastly the earl of ellingham directed attention to the state of the criminal laws these were only calculated to produce widely spread demoralizationto propagate viceto render crime terribly prolific a manno matter what his offence might have beenshould be deemed innocent and untainted again when he had paid the penalty of his misdeed because to brand a human being eternally was to fly in the face of the almighty and assert that there should be no such thing as forgiveness and was no such thing as repentance but the nature of punishments in this country was so to brand the individual and so to dare the majesty of heaven for the gaols were perfect nests of infamysinks of iniquity imprisonment in which necessarily fastened an indelible stigma upon the individual he either came forth tainted or else it was supposed that he must be so under these circumstances he vainly endeavoured to obtain employment and utterly failing in his attempt to earn an honest livelihood he was compelled perforce to relapse into habits of crime and lawlessness this fact accounted for an immense amount of the demoralization which the bishops so much deplored but the true causes of which they obstinately refused to acknowledge the criminal gaols were moral pesthouses in which no cures were effected but where the contagious malady became more virulent society should not immure offenders solely for the sake of punishmentbut with a view to reformation of character the noble earl then summed up his arguments by stating that he was anxious to see measures adopted for a minimum rate of wages to prevent the sudden fluctuation of wages and to compel property to give constant employment to labourhe was desirous that indirect taxes upon the necessaries of life should be abolishedhe wished the laws and their administration to be more equitably proportioned to the relative conditions of the rich and the poorhe insisted upon the want of a general system of national education to be intrusted to laymen and to be totally distinct from religious instruction and sectarian tenetshe desired a complete reformation in the system of prison discipline and explained the paramount necessity of founding establishments for the purpose of affording work to persons upon leaving criminal gaols as a means of their obtaining an honest livelihood and retrieving their characters prior to seeking employment for themselvesand he hoped that the franchise would be so extended as to give every man who earned his own bread by the sweat of his brow a stake and interest in the countrys welfare the noble earl wound up with an eloquent peroration in which he vindicated the industrious millions from the aspersions misrepresentations and calumnies which it seemed to be the fashion for the upper classes to indulge in against them and he concluded by moving a number of resolutions in accordance with the heads of his oration the earls speech was received with very partial cheering by the assembled lords to whom its tenor was most unpalatable but such was its effect upon the auditors in the strangers galleries that contrary to the established etiquette it was loudly applauded by them the lord chancellor immediately called to order and in a few minutes a dead silence reigned throughout the house the leading minister present then rose to answer the earls oration which he did in the usual style adopted by official men under such circumstances entirely blinking all the main arguments he declaimed loudly in favour of the prosperity of the countrydwelt upon the happiness of english cottagerslauded the wisdom of our ancestorsuttered the invariable cant about our glorious institutionsspoke of church and state as if they were siamese twins whom it would be death to severand after calling upon the house to resist the earl of ellinghams motion sate down several noble lords and right reverend fathers in god took part in the discussion and at length the house divided when the earls motion was of course lost by an overwhelming majority against it arthur was by no means disappointed he had foreseen this resultbut he had made up his mind to renew the subject as often as he could in the full hope that a steady perseverance would ultimately be crowned with success the house adjournedthe strangers galleries were speedily clearedand the lords spiritual and temporal rolled home in their carriages the multitudes who still remained assembled in the vicinity of st stephens preserving a profound silence until the earl of ellingham was observed to issue forth by those persons who were nearest to the lords entrance then arose a shout more loudmore hearty even than that which had greeted his arrival a few hours previously it was the voice of a generous and grateful people expressing the sincerest thanks for the efforts which the noble patriot had exerted in their cause chapter c the earl of ellingham and esther de medina it was about two oclock in the afternoon of the day following the scene just described that the earl of ellingham and esther de medina were walking in the gardens attached to finchley manor the beautiful jewess leant upon the arm of that fine young nobleman who had suddenly appeared before the world in the light of the champion of the industrious classes never had esther seemed so ravishingly lovely as on this occasiona rich carnation hue tinged her cheeks beneath the clear transparent olive of her complexion and her fine large black eyes mirrored the enthusiasm of her soul as she listened to her companion who was expatiating upon the wrongs and sufferings endured by the sons and daughters of toil her generous heart beat in entire sympathy with his own in this respect until the previous evening she had known little more of the condition of the people than is generally gleaned by young ladies of good education from the works which they peruse but the earls lucid and convincing exposure had shed a marvellous light upon her soul she comprehended how much the industrious millions were neglected by the governmenthow sorely they were oppressed by a selfish grasping greedy oligarchyhow noble a task it was which the earl had imposed upon himself his brilliant eloquencehis logical reasoningthe tone of deep conviction in which he had spokenthe conscientious earnestness of his mannerand the honest fervour that animated him when having disposed of the more argumentative portion of his speech he burst forth in his impassioned perorationall this had made a profound impression upon esther de medina for hitherto her gentle heart had loved him for all those qualities of person and of mind which usually engender tender feelings in the maidens bosom but now she felt that she could adore himthat she could worship him as a hero who had stood forth in honest championship of a cause which it was so glorious to undertake therefore was it that her cheeks were tinged with the carnation glow of youthful enthusiasm therefore was it that her fine dark eyes flashed with the fires of so generous a fervour as she now dwelt upon every word that the nobleman was uttering in reiteration of those sentiments which he had so boldly enunciated the night before but by degrees the conversation took a different and more tender turn and as they entered an avenue of trees verdant with the foliage of an early spring the nobleman found himself speaking in obedience to those feelings of admiration which he experienced towards the beautiful jewess it was not to treat you with a political disquisition miss de medina said the earl that i came hither today i had another and very different object in view for i am about to ask you to bestow upon me a boon which if accorded shall everever be most highly prized estherdearest esther added the nobleman sinking his voice to a tender whisper and gazing upon her affectionately it is this fair hand which i solicit oh my lord murmured esther casting down her swimming eyes while she felt that her cheeks were burning with blushes you have not well considered the step which you are now taking i have reflected deeply upon the course which i am adopting answered the nobleman and i am convinced that my happiness depends upon your reply tell me esther dearestcan you love me will you accept me as your husband did i consult only my own heart my lord replied the beautiful jewess her countenance still suffused in virgin blushes and her voice tremulously melodious i should not hesitate how to replyoh how could i but i cannot forget my lord that i am the daughter of a despiseda persecuteda much maligned racethat the prejudices of your country and your creed are hostile to such an alliance as this the proposal of which has done me so much honour you are well aware my beloved esther said the earl that i have none of those absurd prejudices the proudest christian who wears a crown might glory in being the soninlaw of such a man as mr de medina and even were he otherwise than what he is it were a worthy aim of ambition to become the husband of his daughter esther i am well aware my lord resumed esther that your heart harbours every noble and ennobling sentimentthat you are all that is great and liberal and good proud and happy then must that woman esteem herself who shall be destined to bear your name but not for me my lordnot for the despised jewess must that supreme honour be reserved no she continued her voice faltering and her bosom heaving convulsivelyno my lordit may not be esther exclaimed the earl of ellingham in an impassioned tone tell mei conjure youis this the only motive which induces you to hesitate is it simply on account of those absurd prejudices which my illiberal fellowcountrymen entertain in reference to your race is it solely on this account that you deny me the boon i demand that reasonand another murmured the lovely jewess in a lowhesitatingand tremulous tone ah that otheri can divine it cried the young nobleman you know that i was engaged to lady hatfieldbut that engagement exists no longerhas ceased to exist for some time i will not attempt to persuade you dearest esther that i did not love georgianabut i now feel that my passion in respect to her was very different from the affection which i entertain for you georgiana was the idol of my imaginationyou are the mistress of my soul my attachment to her was wild and passionateto you it is tender and profound dazzled by her splendid beauty i was bewilderedcaptivatedheld in thraldom but such a love as that contained not those elements which might render it durable your modest and retiring charms sweet estheryour amiabilityyour gentlenessyour goodness all combine to render my love permanent and impossible to undergo diminution or change moreover circumstances which i need notcannot explain to you suddenly transpired to alter my sentiments in respect to lady hatfieldto make me look upon her as a sister and never more in any other light but if you will give me your love my esther you shall experience all the happiness which can arise from an alliance with one who will make your welfare the study of his life indeed if you still hesitate on the score of those prejudices to which we just now alludedthensooner than resign my hope of possessing this fair hand of yours i will renounce the society in which i have been accustomed to movei will dwell with you when heavens blessing shall have united us in some charming seclusion where we shall be all in all to each otheri will devote myself entirely to you and to that task which i have taken upon myself in respect to the industrious classesthat fine english people in whom my sympathies are so deeply interested oh my lord murmured esther in a joyous though subdued tone how have i merited all the proofs of attachment which you now lavish upon mehow can the obscure jewess flatter herself that she is worthy of becoming the bride of one of englands mightiest nobles then you do consent to become mine esther cried the handsome young peer and reading her answer in her eloquent eyes he caught her in his armshe pressed her to his heartand on her virgin lips he imprinted the first kiss which esther had ever received from mortal man save her own father a few minutes elapsed in profound silencea few minutes during which the happy pair exchanged glances of sincere and pure and hallowed love suddenly the sound of footsteps drawing near fell upon their ears they turned and beheld mr de medina approaching down the avenue of trees then the earl of ellingham taking esthers hand advanced towards the jew and said in a firm and manly tone mr de medina i am glad that you have come hither at this moment for i have a great boon to beg of youa precious gift to solicitand he glanced tenderly towards the blushing maiden who stood by his side i understand you my dear arthur returned mr de medina smiling but i presume that the whole business is already settled and arranged between you he added looking slily and benignantly at his daughter miss de medina has consented to bestow her hand upon me my dear sir answered the nobleman and i scarcely dread a refusal on your part a refusal ejaculated mr de medina the tears of joy and gratitude starting to his eyes there is indeed no danger of that on whom would i consent to bestow my jewel my pride if not upon youyou my dear arthur who are all that an englishman ought to be yesi give you my daughter and may god ensure your happiness the venerable jew embraced the earl and esther and the happiness of those three deserving and admirable persons was complete the earl of ellingham passed the remainder of that day at finchley manor and it was past eleven oclock in the evening when he alighted from his carriage at the door of his own abode on the ensuing morning clarence villiers called upon the nobleman by whom he was most courteously received and the earl proceeded to explain to him the nature of the business which had induced him to request the favour of that interview mr villiers said arthur it will be sufficient for me to inform you that i had reasons for experiencing a more than common interest in behalf of thomas rainford with whom you were somewhat intimately acquainted what those precise reasons were you as a gentleman will not enquire but i believe that you have in your possession a particular letter which thomas rainford entrusted to you and circumstances now render it necessary that this document should pass from your hands into mine the high character of your lordship commands immediate compliance on my part said villiers producing the letter from his pocketbook and tendering it to the earl i thank you for this proof of confidence mr villiers observed the nobleman but to set your mind completely at rest i can show you a written authorization signed by thomas rainford to enable me to receive the paper from you it is not at all necessary my lord answered clarence rising to take his departure one moment said the earl much struck by the frank candid and gentlemanly demeanour of villiers any one who felt an interest in thomas rainfordespecially one in whom he reposed sufficient confidence to entrust with that letterhas a claim on my friendship i should therefore be delighted to serve you mr villiers and let this assurance tend to convince you that i am animated by no idle curiosity in enquiring relative to your position in life i believe you hold a situation in somerset house villiers answered in an affirmative and the salary you at present receive is only ninety or a hundred pounds ayear continued the earl you see that thomas rainford made me acquainted with your circumstances and that i have not forgotten them indeed he requested me to exert myself in your behalf and i am anxious to fulfil his desire i called at your lodgings in bridge street and learnt that you had been very recently married now ninety or a hundred pounds ayear continued the earl with a smile are little enough to enable you to support your changed condition in comfort and the state of political parties forbids me to ask any favours of the men in power i will make you a proposal which you may take time to reflect upon i require a private secretary and that post i offer to you the emoluments are four hundred ayear and a house rentfree the dwelling is a beautiful cottage belonging to me and situate at brompton moreover i will give you three hundred guineas for your outfit and furniture clarence villiers was astonishednay perfectly astounded by the liberality of this offer and unable to utter a word he gazed upon the earl with eyes expressive of the most sincere gratitude mingled with admiration at his generous behaviour i know resumed the earl that a government situation is a certainty and that you have every chance of rising in your present sphere think not therefore that i now offer you a precarious employment nowhether i continue in that activity of political existence on which i have just enteredor whether i be compelled by circumstances to renounce ityou shall be duly cared for my lord i accept your generous proposal exclaimed clarence at length recovering the power of speech and i shall exert myself unweariedly to deserve your lordships good opinion of me the bargain is therefore concluded said the nobleman i will give you a note to my solicitor who will immediately put you in possession of the lease of the house at brompton the earl seated himself at a writingtable and penned the letter to his professional agent he also wrote a cheque on his bankers for three hundred guineas and the two documents he handed to clarence villiers who took his leave of the kindhearted nobleman his soul overflowing with emotions of gratitude and admiration how joyousoh how joyous a thing it is to carry glad tidings to the beloved of ones bosomto hasten home to a fond confiding adoring wife and be able to exclaim to her the smiles with which thou greetest me dearest will not be chased away from thy sweet lips by the news which i have in store for thee for god is good to us my angeland happiness prosperity and buoyant hopes are ours from comparative poverty we are suddenly elevated to the possession of affluence and we enjoy the protection of one who will never desert us so long as we pursue the paths of rectitude and honour oh to be enabled to say this to a loved and loving creature is happiness ineffable and that felicity was now experienced by clarence villiers and shared by his charming wife wealth in the hands of such a man as the earl of ellingham was like anodynes in the professional knowledge of the physician who attends the poor gratuitouslythe power to do good is the choicest of the unbought luxuries of life and far more delicious than all the blandishments that gold can procure from the midst of a selfish and bloated aristocracy how resplendently did the earl of ellingham stand forth as a glorious example of generosity manliness and moral worth he was the true type of a sterling english gentlemanan englishman of education enlightened soul and liberal sentimentsnot one of those narrowminded beings who believe that birth and wealth are the only aristocracy and whose ideas are limited as the confines of the land to which they belong your prejudiced englishman is a most contemptible characterborrowing so much as he does from foreign nationseven to the very fashion of his coat and hat or his wifes gownhe boasts in his absurd and pompous pride that england is all and every thing in itself britain is indeed a wonderful country but britain is not the whole world after all in all that is useful as far as the solid comforts of life are concerned she stands at the head of civilisation but she cannot compete with france in the refinements and elegancies of existence nor in the progress of purely democratic principles if great britain be a wonderful country the french are a wonderfulaye and a mighty and noble nation likewise and in france at least the principles of equality are well understood and the battering ram of two revolutions has knocked down hereditary peerageclass distinctionsreligious intoleranceand that vile prestige which makes narrowminded englishmen quote the wisdom of their ancestors as a reason for perpetuating the most monstrous abuses but let us return to the earl of ellingham who having terminated his interview with clarence villiers repaired to the dwelling of lady hatfield georgiana was at home and arthur was immediately admitted to the drawingroom where she was seated he had not now the same feelings of pleasure which had lately animated him when entering the presence of one whom he had sought to love as a sister the scene at carlton house haunted him like an evil dreamand as he contemplated the calm and tranquil demeanour of georgiana he felt grieved at the idea that beneath this composure must necessarily reign the excitement experienced by a woman who had resolved on becoming the kings mistress nevertheless in pursuance of the resolutions already established in his mind he conqueredor rather concealed his sentiments and though a bad hand at any thing resembling duplicity of conduct he managed to greet her without exhibiting any thing peculiar in his manner i have two important communications to make to you georgiana he said as he seated himself opposite to her the first relates to a delicate subject which we will dispose of as soon as possible in a word i have this morning seen mr villiers and he has given me this paper lady hatfield eagerly received the document from the hands of the nobleman and ran her eyes rapidly over it her countenance grew deadly pale and tears trickled down her cheeks as she murmured in a tone of subdued anguish my god they were in wantthey were starvingthat woman and my childand i then stopping suddenly short she threw herself back upon the sofa covered her face with her hands and no longer sought to repress the outpourings of her grief the earl interrupted her not he understood the nature of those emotions which constituted a subject of selfreproach on the part of the unhappy lady who was so deeply to be commiserated and he thought within himself she possesses a kinda feeling heart at length georgiana broke the long silence which prevailed yesthere can be no doubt she exclaimed that boy is my childand he is now with his father may heaven bless him rest assured that he is with one who will treat him kindly although some weeks must elapse ere he can learn who the boy really is observed the earl of ellingham and now for the second communication which i have to make to you georgiana continued the nobleman desirous to change the topic as speedily as possible i have taken your advicei have followed your counsel and esther de medina is to become the countess of ellingham said lady hatfield in a low and mournful tone of voice esther has consented to be mine added the earl and her father has expressed his joy and delight at the contemplated alliance for a few moments georgiana turned aside her head and appeared to struggle violently and painfully with the emotions which filled her bosom arthur she said at last evidently scarcely able to stem the flood of her agitated feelings i am happy to learn these tidings you will be blessed in the possession of one who has been represented to me in such an amiablesuch an estimable light i congratulate youand her likewise you deserve all the felicity which this world can give and she who is destined to beyour bride added georgiana tremulously must feel proud of you yes arthuryour high characteryour talentsyour generous dispositionyour noble nature she could say no more in summing up all his good qualities she seemed to be reminded how much she had lostand she burst into tears arthur was painfully affected he had not expected such a scene as this was it possible that a woman who either yielding to the cravings of a voluptuous disposition or dazzled by an ignoble and false ambition had consented to become the mistress of a kingwas it possible that such a woman could manifest so much true and profound feeling on learning that he whom she had once loved was about to wed another she herself having counselled the alliance was it possible that he was still so dear to her and that her own generous nature had suggested that union through a conscientious belief that it would result in his happiness though she herself sacrificed all her tenderest feelings in urging him to adopt a course which must necessarily interfere even with the friendship which had conventionally succeeded their love he had indeed in the first instance fancied that the advice which georgiana had given him arose from the best and kindest motives but the scene at carlton house had made him mistrustful of her now then all his good opinion of her revived in its pristine strengthand yet he was bewildered when he thought that one who was susceptible of such noble conduct could have become so suddenly depraved as to consent in a single hour to resign all the purity of her soul in homage to the advances of a royal voluptuary but georgiana understood not what was passing in his mind and she supposed by his embarrassed manner and air of profound thought that he felt only for her in regard to the position in which they had been formerly placed let no thought for me mar your happiness arthurdear arthur she said in a voice of solemn mournfulness believe me i have your welfare sincerelydeeply at heartfar more than perhaps you imagine she added with strange yet unaccountable emphasis at the same time i am but a poor weak woman and cannot altogether restrain my feelings i rejoice that you are about to form an alliance with an amiable and beautiful young lady who is so well deserving of your love at the same time my memoryoh too faithful memorycarries me back to those daysindeed to only a few months ago when my hopes were exalted and my prospects of happiness bright indeed however she added hastily let me not dwell upon that topicand pardon my momentary weakness arthur may god bless you with these words lady hatfield hurried from the room and the earl of ellingham took his departure grieved and bewildered by all that had just occurred if georgiana be really serious in resigning herself to king george the fourth thought arthur as he returned in his carriage to pall mall she sacrifices the purity of the most generousthe tenderestthe noblest heart with which woman ever was endowedsave and excepting my own wellbeloved esther chapter ci the blackamoors strange adventure it was about nine oclock in the evening of the same day on which the aboverecorded interview took place between the earl of ellingham and lady hatfield that the blackamoor clad in a very plainalmost a mean attire sauntered along pall mall west and stopped for a few moments in front of the noblemans house he gazed wistfully at the windowsmurmured something to himselfuttered a sighand passed on his appearance attracted the notice of two gentlemen who were walking arminarm in the same direction and as they examined him more closely by the light of an adjacent lamp one said to the other since his majesty has taken it into his head to have a black servant i really think that the very man to suit the purpose is now before us he is a wellmade goodlooking fellow my dear warren said the gentleman thus addressed you are positively absurd with your notions that you have only to ask in a kings name in order to have how do you know that this man wants a situation he looks as if he did harral replied sir phillip warren seehe lounges along as if he had no fixed object in viewhis clothes do not appear to be any of the bestand his whole demeanour gives me the idea of a lacquey out of place my dear friend whispered sir randolph harralwho like his companion was one of the kings courtiers you are really wrong that man is something far superior to what you conceive him to be there is even an air of subdued gentility about him pooh pooh harral interrupted sir phillip warren you do not understand these matters so well as i do at all events there is no harm in questioning that fellowfor i should rejoice to be able to fulfil tonight a whim which our royal master only expressed this afternoon when he saw the french ambassadors splendid black chasseur well as you please warren observed sir randolph harral but as i do not wish to get myself knocked down for insulting a person of a superior class to what you imagine i shall leave you to pursue the adventure alone this conversation had been carried on so close to the blackamoor that although the two courtiers had spoken in a very low voice and had not of course intended that their remarks should be overheard yet scarcely a word had escaped his ears affecting however all the time to continue his lounging listless walk he took no apparent notice of the gentlemen behind him and even pretended to start with surprise when sir phillip warrensir randolph harral having reentered carlton housetapped him on the shoulder my good man said the courtier in a patronising fashion i wish to have a few moments conversation with you certainly sir exclaimed the blackamoor touching his hat just like a lacquey and assuming the tone and manner of one i thought soi knew i was right exclaimed sir phillip rubbing his hands in proof of his satisfaction then attentively scanning the black from head to foot by the aid of the lamp at the door of a neighbouring mansion he said in a less excited tone i suspect you my good fellow to be a person in search of employment yessir interrupted the blackamoor now enjoying the farce that he was playing i should very much like to obtain a good situation and can obtain a firstrate character from my late master the very thing cried sir phillip warren hugely delighted at the opportunity of crowing over his friend sir randolph harral then once more addressing himself to the black he said now what should you think if i proposed to you to enter the household of his most gracious majesty i should be afraid that the offer was too good to be realized sir was the answer delivered in a tone of deep respect although the blackamoor was laughing in his sleeve the whole time it all depends upon me my good fellow said sir phillip and if i am satisfied with you the matter is settled immediately but we cannot continue to talk in the open street so follow me to my own apartments in the palace thus speaking the courtier led the way to carlton house the blackamoor following at a respectful distance and saying to himself what object i propose to myself in embracing this adventure i know not it however tickles my fancy and i will go on with it besides having an hour to spare i may as well divert myself in this way as any other accordingly he followed sir phillip warren into the royal dwelling and in strict silence did they proceed until they reached an anteroom leading to a suite of apartments which were occupied by the old courtier in that anteroom they stopped for sir phillip was immediately accosted by his valet who starting from a seat in which he had been dozing said if you please sir his majesty has sent twice during the last halfhour to desire your presence very good gregory exclaimed sir phillip i will attend to the royal command this moment and do you take the present of hothouse fruit at once to my sister lady maltoun her ladyship requires it for her grand supper tonight tell her that i am enabled to send it through the goodness of my royal master yes sir answered the valet and instantly took his departure my good fellow said sir phillip warren turning towards the blackamoor you perceive that it is impossible for me to speak to you at present you must sit down and wait patiently until my return i shall not be very long away but in any case wait sir phillip warren having issued these injunctions hastened into the inner apartments to amend his toilette after his evenings stroll and in a short time he came forth again with kneebreeches and silk stockings all ready to attend upon the king in passing through the antechamber he repeated his command that the black should await his return and the latter promised to obey when left alone this individual seated himself and gave way to his reflections forgetting for a time where he was at length he started up looked at his watch and found that upwards of halfanhour had elapsed since the old courtier had left him he was already wearied of waiting but a natural love of adventure and of the excitement of novelty induced him to remain a little longer to see the issue of the affair which had led him thither he accordingly whiled away another half hour with a newspaper which lay on the table and that interval having passed he began to think of taking his departure without farther delay issuing from the anteroom he proceeded along a welllighted corridor from the extremity of which branched off two smaller passages one to the right and the other to the left the blackamoor was now at a loss which path to pursue for he could not for the life of him remember by which passage the old courtier had led him on his arrival an hour previously he was not however a man at all capable of hesitating to explore even a royal palace in order to find a mode of egress when it did not suit him to wait for the return of his guide and taking the passage to the right he hastened on until he reached a pair of colossal folding doors perfectly recollecting to have passed through those doors on his arrivalor at all events through foldingdoors exactly like themhe pushed them open and entered a large anteroom well lighted and containing four marble statues as large as life now thought the blackamoor i am mistaken for i do not remember to have seen those statues as i followed the old gentleman into the palace just now and yet i might have passed through this room without noticing them at all events i well recollect those large and splendid foldingdoors and so i must be right it happened however that he was altogether wrong in the path which he had pursued in order to find an egress from the palace and he was deceived by the fact that at each end of the long passage from the middle of which the corridor branched off there were foldingdoors of an uniform shape size and appearance but conceiving himself to be in the right road he crossed the anteroom and pushing open a door at the farther extremity found himself in a magnificent apartment the furniture of which was of the french fashion of king louis the fifteenths time the hangings and drapery were of crimson velvet of which material the cushions of the chairs and the sofas were also made several fine pictures by old masters and vast mirrors with elaborately decorated frames graced the walls and the whole was displayed by a rich subdued golden lustre diffused throughout the room by lamps the globes of which were of very thick ground glass it was a mellow light sufficient yet without glaremisty without being positively dimand calculated to produce a lulling sensation of voluptuous indolence rather than to dazzle the eyes with a wakeful brilliancy in fact there was altogether something ineffably luxurious in the general appearance of this apartment which was magnificent without being spacious and the perfumed atmosphere of which stole like a delicious languor on the senses the blackamoor forgot for a few moments that he was an intruderor if he remembered the fact he was indifferent to it and though the instant he entered this apartment he saw that he had indeed taken a wrong path yet he could not help advancing farther into it to admire its sumptuous elegance and fine pictures he was thus gratifying his curiosity when he heard voices in the anteroom through which he had just passed and obeying a natural impulse he slipped behind the rich velvet curtains drawn over the immense window near which he happened to be standing at the moment the door opened and two persons entered the apartment i will await her here warren said one in a commanding and triumphant tone and see that during our interview we are secured against interruption of any kind your majesty shall be obeyed answered sir phillip have you any farther orders sire none my faithful friend returned the king stayhave i the document i gave it to your majesty ere now after having myself fetched it from the home office said the courtier true i have it safe said george the fourth and now hasten to receive the fair one warren it is past ten oclock and i am impatient to behold her charming countenance again sir phillip departed and the king throwing himself upon one of the voluptuous ottomans exclaimed aloud now for a new pleasure i know not how it was but i never before took so sudden and ardent a fancy for any woman as for this georgiana hatfield there is something truly bewitchingineffably captivating in her sweet countenance and the calm repose which characterises the general expression of that face has for me an influence profoundly voluptuous then her bustoh her bustthat is charming indeedso fullso richly proportionedand yet evidently so firm she has never been married and warren says that her reputation is untarnished it will be a luxury of paradise to revel in her virgin charms and yet somehow or other the joys of love are not generally unknown to ladies in the fashionable world who have reached the age of four or five and twenty no matter be she virgin or not she is an adorable woman and i am madly impatient for her coming the king rose from the ottoman and walked slowly across the apartment stopping opposite a mirror in which he surveyed himself his admirably fashioned wig was entirely to his taste there was not a curl nor a wave which he could have wished otherwise than it was his false teeth were white fixed firmly in his mouth and had a perfectly natural appearance the tie of his cravatborrowed from the fashion set by his once allpowerful favourite beau brummellwas unexceptionable the white waistcoat had not a crease so perfectly did it fit the portly form of the royal voluptuary the abovementioned beau brummell could not even in his ire against the king have found the shadow of an excuse for a cavil against the black dresscoat so artistically was it made no tailor in the famous city of paris could have achieved a greater triumph in respect to the pantaloons and as for the polished dressbootso immortal hoby well satisfied with the result of his survey george the fourth returned to the ottoman and relapsed into a train of voluptuous imagings with respect to lady hatfield this current of thought whereby in his emasculated old age he endeavoured to invigorate his physical powers through the medium of an excited and heated imagination led him to reflect upon all the beauteous womenand their name was legionwho had ever surrendered themselves to his embraces and his ideas naturally wandered to the enjoyments luxuries and pleasures which his exalted rank and immense resources enabled him to procure then he chuckled with triumphant delight at the egregious folly of the great and powerful english people tolerating a king at all but he likewise knew that his own conduct and example had done more harm to the cause of monarchy than all the republic pamphlets or democratic disquisitions ever published he was well aware that without intending to be so he was the most effectual means of opening the eyes of the civilised world to the insanity and madness of maintaining monarchical institutions and though he foresaw that the industrious millions of this realm must inevitably sooner or later overthrow monarchy and establish a pure democracy yet he consoled himself in his revolting selfishness with the conviction that the throne would last during his time at all events illustration it was about halfpast ten when the door opened and the blackamoor peeping from behind the curtains beheld a lady closely veiled enter the room the door immediately closing behind her adorable georgiana exclaimed the king hastening forward to receive her and then conducting her to a seat i am rejoiced that you have thus yielded to my wishesthat you have come to me this evening but wherefore sire did you insist upon this visit asked lady hatfield in a low and tremulous tone our compact stipulated that i was first to receive a certain document as a proof of your majestys sincerity dearest georgiana raise that odious veillay aside that invidious bonnet which conceals your charming countenance exclaimed the monarch in an impassioned voice oh sire i have taken a step at which i tremble said lady hatfield raising her veil but retaining her bonnet on my way through the corridors guided by sir phillip warren i met two or three of your majestys retainers and if they recognised mein spite of the thick veil fear not on that account interrupted the king i admit our compact was as you just now stated it to be and that the paper should have been forwarded to you but i was so anxious to see you soon again that i could not resist the temptation of that idea which suggested to me how much better it would be to solicit you to come hither this evening and receive from my hands the document which you so much desire here it is beloved georgianasigned by myself and countersigned by the secretary of state the king presented the paper to lady hatfield who received it with joy flashing from her eyes and she immediately secured it about her person my curiosity prompts me to ask an explanation of the extraordinary contents of that document said the monarch but on the other hand delicacy forbids and i thank you for this delicacy sire exclaimed lady hatfield with earnest sincerity it were a long tale to telland an useless one yesuseless indeed when we have a far more interesting topic for our discourse interrupted george the fourth throwing one of his arms round the ladys neck sire cried georgiana in a reproachful tone as she hastily withdrew herself from that halfembrace and retreated to the further end of the ottoman oh wherefore play the coy and the cruel exclaimed the king have i not given you a signal proof of my attachment by affixing my signature to a paper the contents of which i scarcely understand and by ordering the minister to legalize it with his name and think you sweet lady that it was an easy task to induce that responsible functionary to obey me in this respect but i menaced and coaxed by turns and all this for your sake do i not therefore deserve the reward of your smilesthe recompense of your caresses i recognise all that is generous in the conduct of your majesty towards me in respect to this document said lady hatfield but were i to succumb to you now sire i should loathe myselfi should become degraded in my own estimationi should feel that i had been purchased by a bribe nosire i cannot renounce every consideration of purityevery sentiment of propriety in a single moment what further proof do you require of my attachment demanded the king in a tone of vexation which he could not altogether subdue no other proof save your forbearance on this occasion answered georgiana remember sire what i told you the other night i am not a woman of impure imaginationnonor of depraved character and i cannot consent to become your mistress without a mental effort on my partwithout wooing on yours in yielding myself to your majesty it will be as a wife who is forced to dispense with the ceremony which alone can make her one in reality and if your majesty deem me worth the winning let me be won by means of those delicate attentions which would be shown in honourable courtship perdition ejaculated the king who was as much unaccustomed to hear such language as he was to sue at the feet of beauty how long will you keep me in this suspense fair ladyhow long must i endure the tortures of deferred hope consideri love you madly you are so beautifulso sweetly beautiful oh to press you in my arms pardon me sire for daring to interrupt you said georgiana but if there be nothing save the impulse of the senses in this liaison of ours your majesty will soon become wearied of meand i shrink in horror from the idea of becoming the castoff mistress of even royalty itself let me seek to engage your affections as you must endeavour to enchain mine so that our connexion may be based upon the sentiments and feelings of the heart but i already love you sincerelydevotedly cruel georgiana cried the king his eyes greedily running over the outlines of the exquisitely proportioned form of the lady and the rapid survey exciting his desire almost beyond endurance not with a love calculated to be permanent said georgiana quietly and unless i become the object of such an affection nevernever shall i so far forget myself this is cruelthis is maddening exclaimed the king and he extended his arms towards lady hatfield sire do not treat me with outrage she said rising from the ottoman and speaking in a dignified manner if your majesty supposed that your sovereign rank would so far dazzle my imagination as to make me throw myself into your arms at the very first words of encouragement which fell from your lips your majesty has sadly misunderstood the character of georgiana hatfield be not angry with me adorable creature exclaimed the king i love you too much to risk the chance of losing you by any misconduct on my part name therefore your own terms or rather let me ask whether you will consent to visit me every evening for an hour and allow us an opportunity to become better acquainted with each other now your majesty speaks in a manner calculated to win my esteem observed lady hatfield avoiding a direct reply to the question put to her and when the esteem of a woman is once secured i understand you interrupted george the fourth hastily her love speedily follows be it as you say sweet lady he continued in a slower tone and let us secure each others affections you shall find me docile and obedient to your willand this is much for me to promise but let me hope that the period of probation will not be longthat the hour of recompense is not far distant hush sire exclaimed georgiana in a reproachful voice this is the language of sensewhereas you must secure my affections by the language of sentiment if you treat me as a woman who is to be purchased as your mistress let our connexion cease this moment but if you will woo me as a wife should be wonalthough i am well aware that your majestys wife i can never be would that i could marry you this moment cried the king fixing his eyes upon her beauteous countenance for you are ravishingly lovely i would give a year of my life to obtain all i crave this night oh georgiana be not so coy and cruel with mefor you madden memy veins seem to run with molten lead be mine at onceand render my happiness complete behold that small low door in yonder corner it opens into a room which may serve as our nuptial chamber come then dearest georgianalet me lead you thithernot cold hesitating and resistingbut warm and impassioned and prepared to revel in the delights of love our privacy will be complete no intruder need we fearand the world will never know that you have become mine sire this language on your partin spite of all the arguments and remonstrances which i have used exclaimed lady hatfield is unworthy of a great king and a polished gentleman the madness of love knows nothing of regal rank nor the shackles of etiquette said the monarch speaking in a tone of great excitement and in spite of the promises which i just now so rashly made i cannot endure delay nosweetest ladyyou must be mine at onceand he wound his arms around georgianas form the fury of his desires animating him with a strength against which she could not long have resisted but at that moment succour was at hand forth from his place of concealment sprang the blackamoor and an ejaculation of surprise and rage burst from the lips of the king while a cry of joy emanated from those of lady hatfield who are you and what signifies this intrusion demanded george the fourth instantly releasing his intended victim at this sudden apparition but without answering the monarch the blackamoor hastily led the halffainting lady hatfield to the dooropened it to allow her to pass out of the roomand closing it behind her placed his back against itthe whole being effected with such speed that georgiana had disappeared before the king could recover from the astonishment into which the very first step of the bold proceeding had thrown him villainous negro cried the disappointed monarch at length recovering the power of speech do you know who i am that you have thus dared to outrage me i know full well who you are sireand i am grieved to the very soul at the idea of being compelled to acknowledge you as my king returned the black in a calmcollectedand somewhat mournful tone this insolence to me ejaculated george the fourth becoming purple with rage make way sirrah for me to pass hence not until i have allowed lady hatfield sufficient time to escape from this house which the country has given as a palace for your majesty but which seems to be used for purposes too vile to contemplate without horror was the firm reply the king fell back a few paces in speechless astonishment never before had he been thus beardedbut in that momentary interval of silence a crowd of recollections rushed to his mind warning him that the individual who thus seemed to defy his rank and power had been present during the whole of the interview with lady hatfieldand that this individual had learnt how the royal and ministerial signatures had been given as a means of propitiating a coy beauty without any reference to the interests of the statewhen the king remembered all this he was alarmed at the serious manner in which he suddenly found himself compromised for that blackamoor could make revelations of a nature to arouse against him the indignation of the whole kingdom and reckless as george the fourth was of public opinion he trembled at the idea of exciting public resentment thus did a few moments of reflection show him the precipice on which he stood and carry to his mind a conviction of the necessity of making terms with the sable stranger who had obtained such a dangerous power over him but the mere thought of such a compromise was sorely repugnant to the haughty spirit of george the fourth and yet there was no alternative he accordingly addressed himself with the best grace he could assume to the task of conciliation my good sir he said approaching the black i seek not to deal harshly with you and yet you owe me an explanation of the motives which induced you to penetrate into the palace and the means by which you gained access to my private apartments i feel bound to answer your majesty with candour and frankness in order to clear myself from any injurious suspicion which my concealment in this room might naturally engender was the reply the explanation sire is briefly giveni was accosted by an elderly gentleman in pall mall and asked if i required a situation in truth i do not but it being intimated to me that the proffered place was in the royal household curiosity prompted me to follow the gentleman into the palace he left me alone in his anteroom for upwards of an hour and growing weary of waiting i sought a means of egress but losing my way i found myself at length in this room and almost immediately afterwards your majesty entered with the very gentleman i am speaking of and whose name i learnt to be warren i concealed myself behind the curtainswith no bad intention and indeed i was about to come forth and explain the reasons of my presence to your majesty when certain words which fell from your majestys lips made me acquainted with the fact that lady hatfield was expected here every moment that name nailed me to the spotand i was prompted by an uncontrollable curiosity to wait and satisfy myself whether lady hatfield could have become so depraved as to surrender herself to your arms you are acquainted with her then exclaimed the king and yet he added a moment afterwards she did not appear to recognise you no sireshe did not recognise me returned the black but you must know her well since the mere mention of her name rendered you thus anxious to see the issue of our interview said the king impatiently i know her well sire was the guarded response and yet she knew not me who are you then demanded george the fourth fixing a searching look upon the stranger you certainly are not what sir phillip warren took you for i must firmly though respectfully decline to give any account of myself said the blackamoor your majesty will now permit me to withdraw one moment cried the king how stand we in respect to each other do you constitute yourself the enemy of your sovereignwill you publish your knowledge of all that has transpired here this eveningor can i offer you some earnest that i myself am not offended by the manner in which you ere now thought fit to address me i have no interest in making known to the public those secrets which have so accidentally been revealed to me answered the blackamoor it is never a pleasing task to an honest man to publish the frailties or failings of a fellowcreaturemuch less when that fellowcreature is placed at the head of the nation as for any rewardor rather bribe to induce me to remain silent none is necessary at the same time he added hastily correcting himself as a second thought struck him it may be as well that i should avail myself of your majestys offer for it might so fall out that the privilege of claiming a boon at your royal hands may prove serviceable to you some day or anothereh added the king impatiently wellbe it so and stranger though you be to me i rely in confidence upon your solemn pledge to place a seal on your lips relative to the incidents of this night thus speaking the monarch seated himself at the nearest table and opening a drawer took forth writing materials then with a haste which showed his desire to put an end to a painful interview he penned the following lines on a slip of paper we acknowledge a sense of deep obligation to the bearer of this memorandum the said bearer having rendered us especial service and we hold ourselves bound to grant him any boon which he may demand at our hands so that it be not inconsistent with our royal honour nor prejudicial to the interests of the state given this rd of march in the year george rex ls the king lighted a taper and affixed his royal seal to this document which he then handed to the blackamoor saying you perceive what confidence i place in you see that the good name of lady hatfield on the one side and your sovereigns honour on the other be not compromised by any indiscreet revelations on your part your majesty may rest assured that i shall maintain the incidents of this evening a profound secret and that i shall not abuse the privilege conferred upon me by this paper which bears your royal signature the blackamoor bowed and retired from the presence of king george the fourth whom he left in no very pleasant humour at the turn which his meditated attack upon the virtue of lady hatfield had taken on this occasion the black had no difficulty in finding the way to the private staircase up which sir phillip warren had originally introduced him and he was about to issue forth from carlton house when he suddenly encountered that old courtier and sir randolph harral in the hall these gentlemen were disputing in a loud tone but the moment the blackamoor appeared sir phillip warren sprang towards him exclaiming why where have you possibly been but no matter he added in a triumphant tone since you are here at length to settle the question between me and my friend the fact is my good sir said sir randolph i have laid sir phillip warren twenty guineas yestwenty guineas interrupted sir phillip hastily that you are that you are not cried sir randolph i say that you are exclaimed sir phillip and i say that you are not vociferated sir randolph gentlemen pray explain yourselves said the blackamoor welli say that you are a lacquey out of place observed sir phillip warren and i say that you are not cried sir randolph harral in his turn whereupon we have bet twenty guineas and you must decide who has won added sir phillip then gentlemen said the blackamoor in a merry tone i can soon set the matter at rest so far from being a lacquey out of place i have upwards of a dozen dependants of my own i wish you a very good night whyi am robbed as if it were on the highway exclaimed sir phillip warren his countenance suddenly becoming as awful and blank as such a portwine visage could possibly be ha ha chuckled sir randolph robbed or notplease to hand me over twenty good guineas and the cachinnation of the winning courtier was echoed by the merry laugh of the blackamoor as this individual issued forth from carlton house again as he passed along pall mall did the black pause for a few moments opposite the splendid mansion of the earl of ellingham and gaze at it with the attention of no common observer he was about to continue his way when two men belonging to the working class stopped likewise for an instant in front of the house and one said to the other that is where the earl lives god bless him yesgod bless him repeated his companion with the emphasis of unfeigned sincerity for he is the peoples friend the two men then passed on who dares to say that the industrious millions have no gratitude murmured the blackamoor to himself as he also pursued his way o arthur you are now indeed worthy of the proud name which you bear and i likewise exclaim from the very bottom of my heart may god bless you chapter cii a state of siege return we now to frank curtis his excellent wife and captain oblunderbuss who were living in a complete state of siege at the house in baker street the captain was the commandant of the garrison and superintended all the manuvres and the devices which it was necessary to adopt to keep out the enemy the frontdoor was constantly chained inside and every time there was a knock or a ring john the footman reconnoitred from the area whenever any one was compelled to go out to order in provisions the captain stood at the door armed with the kitchen poker and looking so grim and terrible that the officers who were prowling about in different disguises dared not hazard an encounter with the warlike gentleman the grocer the butcher and the baker lowered their respective commodities down the area by means of a rope and basket provided for the purpose but they all took very good care to receive the cash first the milkman and potboy were enabled to supply their articles through the opening afforded by the door with the chain up inside and they likewise strenuously advocated the readymoney principle this condition of siege was a source of great delight to captain oblunderbuss he was completely in his element little cared he for the opinion of neighbours his feelings were by no means concerned the house from the first moment he set foot in it was in a state of perpetual excitement he was constantly ordering the servants to do something or another a dozen times aday did he perform what he called going his rounds armed with the poker in case a bailiff should have crept into the place through some unguarded avenueand it was indeed with the greatest difficulty that mrs curtis could divert him from a plan which he had conceived and which he declared to be necessarynamely the drilling of all the inmates of the house male and female including the five children for an hour daily in the yard as it was he compelled john the footman to mount sentry in the yard aforesaid every morning while the housemaid was dusting her carpets and so forthindeed during the whole time that the domestic duties rendered it necessary to have the backdoor open if john remonstrated the captain would threaten with terrible oaths to try him by a courtmartial and once when the poor fellow respectfully solicited his wages and his discharge the formidable officer would certainly have inflicted on him the catoninetails if the cook had not begged him offshe being the footmans sweetheart mrs curtis took a great fancy to the captain and allowed him to do pretty well as he chose she considered him to be the politest genteelest bravest and most amusing gentleman she had ever known and it soon struck her that his various qualifications threw her husband considerably into the shade whenever she felt lowspirited he had a ready remedy for her if it were in the forenoon he would exclaim arrah and be jasus mim its no wonther yere dull with the inimy besaging us in this way and its a nice mutton chop and a glass of portwine thatll be afther sitting ye to rights mim then forthwith he would ring the bell and order three chops so that himself and frank might keep the dear lady company if it were in the evening that mrs curtis was attacked by those unwelcome visitors termed blue devils the captain would recommend a leetle dhrop of the potheen brewed afther the fashion in ould ireland and while he exhausted all his powers of eloquence in assurances that it should be as wake as wather and not too swate he would mix the respectable lady such a stinger that her eyes would fill with tears every time she put the glass near her lips sometimes he would undertake to amuse the children up in the nursery by going on all fours and allowing them to play at horsesoldiers by riding on his back and then what with his shouting and bawling and their laughing and screaming it was enough to alarm the whole neighbourhoodand very frequently did all these little attentions on the part of the captain either to herself or her children gave mrs curtis an admirable opinion of him and he rose rapidly in her favour his success in obtaining the five hundred pounds from sir christopher blunt was considered by her as sublime a stroke of mingled policy and daring as ever was accomplished and his tactics in opposing a successful foil to all the stratagems devised by the sheriffsofficers to obtain admission into the dwelling made her declare more than once that had he commanded the allied army at waterloo it would have been all up with the french in halfanhour the female servants in the house did not altogether admire the position in which they were placed but they were so dreadfully frightened at the captain that they never uttered a murmur in his hearing they moreover had their little consolations for sir christophers five hundred pounds enabled the besieged to live as the captain declared like fightingcocksso that the kitchen was as luxuriously supplied with provender as the parlour and no account was taken of the quantity of wine and spirits consumed in the establishment we have before hinted that the house was a perfect nuisance in baker street and no wonder indeed that it should have been so considered for it seemed to be the main source whence emanated all the frightful noises that could possibly alarm nervous old ladies or irritate gouty old gentlemen no sooner did the day dawn than captain oblunderbuss would fling up the window of his bedroom which was at the back of the house with a crashing violence that made people think he was mad and thrusting forth his head with a white nightcap upon it he would roar outjohn john to arms as lustily as he could bawl this was not only to save himself the trouble of repairing to the footmans chamber to summon him but also for the purpose of letting the sheriffsofficers if any were in the neighbourhood know that he was on the alert then john would poke his head out of another window and answer the captains call and a few minutes afterwards the backdoor would open and shut with a terrific bang and john would be seen to sally forth to mount sentry in the yard with shouldered poker then an hours interval of comparative silence would prevail while the captain turned in again to take another nap but at length up would go the window againout would come the headand john hot wather would roll in awful reverberation throughout the entire neighbourhood the confusion and dismay produced by these alarms were terrific and the neighbours all threatened their landlords to give warning on the next quarter for it was not only in the morning that the noise prevailed but throughout the entire dayaye and the best part of the night also sometimes the captain would take it into his head to discharge his pistols in the yard or else he would have a fencingmatch with frank curtis the weapons being pokers which made a hideous clang then there were the rows in the nursery which were truly awful and by way of a variety captain oblunderbuss would occasionally show himself at the drawingroom windows and vociferate the most appalling abuse at any suspicious characters whom he might happen to behold prowling about these exhibitions frequently collected crowds in front of the house and the captain would harangue them with as much earnestness as if he were a candidate at a general election on one of these occasions the parishbeadle made his appearance and from the pavement remonstrated with the gallant officer who kept him in parlance until frank curtis had time to empty a pitcher of water over the enraged functionary from the front bedroom window but the worst part of the whole business consisted in the goingson at nighttime just when sedate and quiet people were getting cozily into their first sleep at about eleven oclock mr frank curtis was getting uncommonly drunk and though the captain seemed proof against the effects of alcohol no matter in what quantity imbibed he nevertheless grew trebly and quadruply uproarious when under the influence of poteen thus from eleven to twelve the shouts of laughterthe yells of delightthe cries of mirthand the vociferations of boisterous hilarity which came from the front parlour made night perfectly hideous but no amount of human patience ever possessed by good and forgiving neighbours could possibly tolerate the din and disturbance which prevailed during the small hours then would the captain and his friend curtis rush like madmen into the yard shoutingroaringand bawling like demons so that the residents in the adjacent houses leapt from their beds and threw up their windows in horror and alarm expecting to find the whole street in a blaze these performances on the part of frank and oblunderbuss were intended to show the officers that they were upon the alert and they not only had the desired effect but accomplished far moreinasmuch as they produced an absolute panic throughout an entire neighbourhood thus it was that mr curtiss abodelately so serene and quiet in the time of mrs goldberrybecame a perfect nuisance and a scandal and had bedlam in its very worst days been located there the noise and alarm could not have been greater it will be remembered that the captains plan when first he took up his residence in baker street was to get mr and mrs curtis and the children away on a sunday night and sell off all the furniture on the monday morning but this scheme was postponed at first for one weekthen for another because the officers kept such a constant lookout that the captain saw the necessity of standing the siege until the creditors should be completely wearied of paying those disagreeable spies to watch the premises this determination was the more readily come to inasmuch as the five hundred pounds obtained from sir christopher blunt supplied sinews to carry on the war in grand style when the captain paid the second financial visit to the worthy knight with a view to the effecting of a further loan on the assignat which himself and frank curtis had resolved to issue it was not because money was scarce in baker street but simply because the captain admired the fun of the thing and also considered it prudent to raise as ample a supply of bullion as possible the rage which he experienced at his discomfiture on this occasion can be better conceived than described and firmly believing that it was sir christopher himself who had dealt him from the carriage window the tremendous blow which sent him sprawling on the pavement in a most ignominious manner he vowed the most deadly vengeance against the new justice of the peace picking himself up as well as he couldfor the gallant gentleman was sorely bruisedhe repaired to the nearest publichouse to cool himself as he said in his own mind with a tumbler of the invariable poteen and having reflected upon the insult which he had received he thought it best not to communicate his dishonour and discomfiture on his return to baker street accordingly having returned to the garrison into which he effected an easy entryfor no one dared approach the door when it opened to give him egress or ingresshe assured mr and mrs curtis that the knight was out of town and would not be back for a week however in a couple of days the wonderful adventures of sir christopher blunt and dr lascelles burst upon the metropolis like a tempest and as the morning newspapers were duly dropped down the area of the besieged dwelling in baker street the entire report was read aloud by frank curtis at the breakfast table it therefore being evident that sir christopher was not only in town at that moment but was likewise in london when the captain had called upon him the gallant gentleman affected to fly into a violent rage swearing that the knight was denied to him on purpose and vowing to make him repint of his ungintlemanly conduct oblunderbuss did not however in his heart mean to do any such thing as call again in jermyn street for he had despaired of inducing the knight either by threatenings or coaxings to advance a further supply and now that the worthy gentleman was a justice of the peace the captain thought that it would be somewhat imprudent to visit him for the mere sake of committing an assault and battery he accordingly invented divers excuses day after day for remaining in the garrison and as funds were abundant no one urged him to undertake another financial mission to sir christopher blunt the reader must remember that messrs mac grab and proggs were very roughly handled by captain oblunderbuss when they visited the house in baker street for the purpose of arresting mr frank curtis and the honour of a sheriffsofficer being particularly dear to its possessor those worthies considered theirs to be at stake unless they fully vindicated it by capturing the aforesaid mr curtis in the long run they therefore had recourse to all kinds of devices to obtain an entry into the house being armed not only with a writ against that gentlemans person on behalf of mr beeswing but also with an execution against the furniture at the instigation of another of mrs curtiss creditors the tricks practised by these worthies to obtain an entry into the besieged domicile were as varied as they were ludicrous on one occasion mr proggs dressed for the nonce as a butcher and carrying a leg of mutton in a tray on his shoulder hurried up to the door gave the loud sharp single knock peculiar to the trade and shouted tcher in the most approved style but the parlour window was thrown up and out popped the head of the ferocious oblunderbuss the countenance as red as a turkeycock and the mouth vomiting forth a torrent of abuse so that the discomfited mr proggs was compelled to retreat with all the ignominy of a baffled strategist on another occasion mr mac grab attired as a general postman rushed along the street stopped at the door of the besieged house gave the two clear rapid strokes with the knocker and immediately began to look over a bundle of letters with all the feverish haste of the functionary whose semblance he had assumed but john came forth from the area and again was the sheriffsofficers object completely frustrated next day however two sweeps appeared in the street as black as if they had never known soapandwater and were accustomed to lodge eat and sleep in chimneys as well as cleanse them but upon arriving opposite the parlourwindows they beheld the captain and frank curtis taking sights at them the two gentlemen having twigged the traps without much difficulty thus defeated in all their endeavours to accomplish their aims by cunning messrs mac grab and proggs worked themselves up to the desperate resolution of using force and they accordingly took their post at the frontdoor of curtiss house with the apparent determination to rush in the first time it should be opened but when it was opened as far as the chain inside would permit and they beheld to their horror and dismay the terrible captain wielding the poker they exhibited that better part of valour which is denominated discretion at last however they could no longer endure the jeerings of their friends exercising the same agreeable and lucrative profession and moreover the attorneys who employed them in the baker street affair spoke out pretty plainly about gentlemen bribing bailiffs not to execute writs and so forth all these circumstances induced mr mac grab and his man proggs to hold a council of war over two fourpennorths of rumandwater and the result was a determination that as the various devices and stratagems they had practised to enter the dwelling had failed and as they feared to carry it by storm the stronghold must be reduced by a surprise it was on the very evening when the blackamoor experienced so strange an adventure at carlton house that the following scene took place in baker street the clock had struck ten and supper being disposed of the whiskey hot water glasses and et ceteras were placed upon the table at which frank curtis his amiable wife and captain oblunderbuss were seatedas comfortable a trio as you could wish or expect to see especially under such adverse circumstances john vociferated the captain as the domestic was about to leave the room stop a moment you rogue and answer me this is the area all safe yes sir was the ready response and the kitchenwindowsand the backdoorand the yarrd gateall right ehjohn all right captain ive just been the rounds and all the provisions in the garrison johnplenty of potheen demanded oblunderbuss plenty sir therell be no more going out again tonight thats a blissing exclaimed the gallant captain john yessir take a glass of whiskey mateand slape with the kitchen pokerr under your pillow my frind enjoined the officer we must be arrmed at all pints be jasus i shant forget sir said john and having tossed off the spirit he quitted the room now then to make ourselves cozie observed the captain drawing his chair a little closer to mrs curtis pray mim how dye feel your dear self this eveningis it in good spirits ye are mim thank you captain returned mrs curtis i am quite wellbut the least least thing nervous this strange kind of life were leading strange mim ejaculated the captain its glorrious glorious indeed cried frank i only wish the marquis of shoreditch was here along with ushow he would enjoy himself you will permit me mim said the captain grasping the bottle of whiskey and addressing the lady in an insinuating manner now really captainif i must take a very leetle drop began mrs curtis with a simper well my dear madam it shall be the leetlest dhrop in the worrld and so wake that a baby of a month old might dhrink it and niver so much as thrip up as it walked across the room exclaimed oblunderbuss whose knowledge of the physical capacities of infants was evidently somewhat vague and limited there mim he added placing before the lady a large tumbler the contents of which were equal portions of spirit and water you may tell me im a dutchman and unworrthy of ould ireland if that isnt the purtiest dhrink iver brewed for one of the fair six youre very kind captain said mrs curtis in a mincingsimpering manner its you thats kind to say so mim remarked the captain placing his foot close to that of the lady and ascertaining by the readiness with which she returned the pedal pressure that the tender intimation he wished thereby to convey was by no means unwelcome frank did not of course notice what was going on under the table and the conversation progressed in the usual mannerthe captain and frank vieing with each other in telling the most monstrous lies and the silent interchange of loves tokens continuing with increasing warmth between the gallant gentleman and the stout lady mrs curtiss spirits however seemed to require a more than ordinary amount of stimulant on this occasion she declared herself to be very low although she contrived to laugh a great deal at the captains lively sallies and marvellous storiesbut as the clock struck midnight and she rose to retire to her chamber she found that the three glasses of toddy which she had been persuaded to imbibe had somewhat unsettled the gravity of her equilibrium the captain sprang from his seat to open the parlourdoor for her and as he bade her good night she pressed his hand with a degree of tenderness which as novelwriters say spoke volumes curthis my frind said the captain as he returned to his seat be the holy pokerr you possess a rale jewel of a wife shes the most amiable lady i ever knew and takes her potheen without any nonsense be jove shes an ornamint in a jintlemans household and well dhrink her health in a bumper with all my heart exclaimed frank already more than halfseas over but i say captaindo you know that im getting very tired of the life were leading i wish we could put an end to it somehow or another be the powerrs and thats the very thing i was going to recommend to ye frank cried the captain who was more affected by liquor on this particular night than ever he had been before since the first moment he had taken up his abode in baker street buthow can it be done hiccoughed curtis is it how the things to be done cried oblunderbuss cant ye now bolt off to france tomorrow night and lave me in charge of the house ill manage to sell every stick to a broker and then its myself thatll bring over the wife the children and the money to ye as safe as if they were all my own i dont like the idea of going away alone captain observed frank as he refilled his tumbler but suppose we talk the matter over tomorrowwhen weve slept off the effects of the toddy be jasus the toddy has no effects upon me exclaimed oblunderbuss who nevertheless sate very unsteadily in his chair his body swaying to and fro in spite of all his efforts to the contrary the conversation now languished but the drinking was maintained until frank curtis suddenly fell from his seat in a vain attempt which he made to reach the whiskeybottle the captain burst out into a roar of laughter and while endeavouring to pick up his companion rolled completely over him he however managed by means of many desperate efforts to place the young gentleman upon the sofa where he left him to repose in peace and taking up a candle he staggered out of the room muttering to himself be the powerrs if i didnt knowhicthat it was impossossiblehici should say that ihicwasdhrunk this was a conclusion which the captain was by no means willing to admit and in order to convince himself that he was perfectly sober and knew what he was about he proceeded to examine the frontdoor according to his invariable custom ere retiring to rest well be the powerrs he murmured as he stood contemplating the door with all the vacancy of inebriation its john thats a clever fellowhicafther allhic be jasus and its two chains hes put upand two bolts at the tophicand two bolts at the bottomhicand be the holy pokerr exclaimed the captain aloud his face expanding with an expresion of stupid joy the house is safe enoughhicfor theres two doors supremely happy at having made this discovery and moreover fancying himself to be lighted by two candlesin a word seeing double in every respectthe gallant officer staggered along the passage and commenced the ascent of the staircase which appeared to have become wondrously steep ricketty and uneven stumbling at every step and muttering awful imprecations against the thunthering fool of a carpenter that had built such a divil of a lather captain oblunderbuss contrived to reach the first landing in safety but his foot tripping over the carpet he fell flat down extinguishing the light of the candle though at the same time giving his head such a knock against the balustrades that a million meteoric sparks flashed across his visual organs blood and hounds growled the gallant gentleman there must either be an airthquakehicor else be the powerrs imhicralyhicdhrunk picking himself up the captain groped about for the staircase and finding it with some little trouble he continued his ascent in a pleasing state of uncertainty as to whether he were walking on his head or on his feet but with the deeply settled conviction that he was spinning round at a most terrific rate capthain obluntherbuss he said apostrophising himself as he staggered along is this raly you or another person if its yourself it ishiciim ashamed of ye be the holy pokerr and ive a precious good mindhicto give ye a dacent dhrubbing captainhicohicbluntherbuss thus soliloquising the martial gentleman reached the second landing but here he paused for a few minutes in a state of awful doubt as to which way he should turn in order to reach his own room he knew that his door must be somewhere close at hand though whether to the right or to the left he could not for the life of him remember at length he began to grope about at a venture and having encountered the handle of a door he hesitated no longer but entered the chamber with which the said door communicated chapter ciii the surprisea change of scene it was about halfpast three oclock in the morning and profound silence reigned in baker street when four men bearing a ladder upon their shoulders passed like phantoms through the obscurity of the thoroughfare and halted in front of mr curtiss house where their operations so far from being at all ghostlike assumed very much the appearance of those proceedings which are carried on by creatures of flesh and blood thieves however they were not but sheriffsofficers they werebeing our old friends mac grab and proggs assisted by two other queerlooking fellows of the species which chiefly abounds in the taprooms and parlours of publichouses in chancery lane mr mac grab having satisfied himself by a close scrutiny of the number on the frontdoor that they had pitched upon the right house the ladder was forthwith placed against the little iron railings forming the balcony at the drawingroom window and mr proggs was ordered to mount first but mr proggs having perhaps recently studied some book upon etiquette would not think of preceding his master and mr mac grab was doubtless too meek a man to take upon himself the post of honour as for the two underlings they very bluntly assured mr mac grab that they would see him unpleasantly condemned before they would venture first and thus the entire project was threatened with discomfiture when proggs overcoming his fears consented to lead the way up the ladder did this hero accordingly drag himself and had he lost his life in the desperate deed the epic muse would have been compelled to deplore the death of the last of the famous house of proggs but fortune beamed upon proggs though the moon did not and he reached the balcony in safety mac grab ascended nextand the two subordinates followedby which time the intrepid proggs had obtained admission into the house by the simple process of cutting out a pane with a glaziers diamond and thrusting in his hand to undo the fastening of the window and now behold the four men safe in the drawingroomin actual possession of the placefour heroes who had just carried a strongly fortified castleby surprise a lanthorn which mr proggs took from his pocket was lighted and a flask of rum which mr mac grab took from his pocket was drunk the heroes then stole gently from the apartmentdescended the stairsopened the frontdoorand laid down the ladder along the area railings so that the watchman on going his rounds might not raise an alarm of thieves this being accomplished they reentered the house and fastened the streetdoor the key of which mr mac grab secured about his own person the officers next entered the parlour on the ground floor where they found frank curtis lying asleep upon the sofa thats our chap said mac grab in a tone of deep satisfaction as he threw the light of his lanthorn full upon the young gentlemans countenance i shall take him off at once with one of the men and you proggs will remain in possession along with tother two on us isnt enow to keep possession agin that devil of an irisher exclaimed proggs bluntly and the loudness with which he spoke disturbed mr curtis starting up frank rubbed his eyesthen stared around him with the stupid vacancy of one who had only half slept off the fumes of whiskeyand at last as the truth gradually glimmered upon him he said in a hoarse thick tone wellwho the devil are all you fellows youll know soon enow who we be growled mac grab comeget up young genelman and dont sit there astaring at us as if you was a stuck pig and we was ghostesses so youve got in at lasthave you old fellow said frank with an awful yawn but i feel precious seedy though cant you let me sleep a little longer you wont sleep no more till you gets to chancery lane returned mac grab and then you can have a turnin if you like what oclock is it demanded frank his teeth chattering and his whole frame shivering alike with the cold and the unpleasant petition to which he had been awakened its getting on for a quarter to four or thereabouts said mac grab consulting a huge silver watch of the turnip species then i must have been asleep here for some time mused frank aloud and glancing at the table he added oh i rememberi was precious drunk last night well im blest if i didnt think you was said proggs expressing his opinion with more bluntness than politeness youll find a many lushing coven over in spike island spike island ejaculated frank then as a light broke in upon him through the mist and fumes of whiskey he added oh i understandthe bench eh wellnever say die my boys as my friend the crown prince of holland used to observe if it must be the bench it must but youll let me tell my wife whats happened we wont let you rouse that irisher young gentleman said mac grab let us get you safe off and then he may wake up and be damned to him i pledge you my word i will not attempt to rouse the captain exclaimed curtis but i must speak to my wife illustration well thats only fair and reasonable said mac grab although you dont deserve no good treatment at our hands seeing how we was served by that owdacious irish friend of yourn howsomever you shall speak to your good lady but mind i aint going to lose sight on you you can come with me as far as the bedchamber door observed frank and i shant keep you many minutes proggs youll come along with me said mac grab and now mind mr curtis what youre up to weve got pistols with us and blowed if we dont use em in selfdefence if that irish friend of yours happens to wake up and tries it on again with any of his nonsense it wasnt my fault that he acted as he did the last time you was here returned frank but come along you twoif you must go with me curtis lighted a candle and led the way gently up stairs mac grab and proggs following close at his heels they reached the second landing where frank stopped at a door which he was about to open when the firstmentioned officer said in a low tone now mindno nonsensewe wont be done a second time remember i assure you this is my wifes room returned curtis also speaking in a whisper and he entered the chamber the two bailiffs remaining at the door which was left ajar frank carrying the light in his hand approached the bed and was just on the point of saying my dearmy dearwhen he stopped shortaghaststupefiedhis mouth wide openand every faculty which he possessed save that of sight entirely suspended for thereby the side of his wifelay captain oblunderbuss both were fast asleep and the countenance of the gallant officer seemed absolutely on fire so red was it in contrast with the white pillow by jovethis is too bad exclaimed curtis at length recovering the powers of speech and movement and influenced only by the sudden rage which took possession of him and which rendered him bold and courageous for the instant he seized a waterjug from the washingstand and dashed the contents completely over captain oblunderbuss blood and thunther roared the man of war starting up in a towering passionand springing from the bed he was about to inflict summary chastisement on his friend when a shriek issued from the couchand the captain stopping short and looking around him ascertained where he was the cause of franks conduct towards him was instantly apparent and subduing his anger he exclaimed be jasus and it was all a mistake me boy i dhrank too much of the potheen the irishman by goles growled a hoarse voice in the landing outside wellnever mind proggs cried another voice if he touches us well fire holloa you fellows down therecome upcome up roared mac grab and now the whole house was in confusion mrs curtis lay screaming and shrieking in bedthe captain rushed upon the landing with nothing on save his shirt and looking as if he had just sprung out of a waterbuttcurtis followed sulky and not half satisfied with the apology he had received relative to the presence of the officer in his wifes chamberthe two men who had been left down stairs were running up as hard as they couldand the servants were calling from the garrets to know what was the matter but rather suspecting something very much like the real truth in respect to the invasion of the bailiffs downdown with ye wild bastes that ye are vociferated the captain as the light which curtis still carried showed the gallant officer the well known faces of mac grab and proggs but the two men who had worked their courage up to the sticking point produced each a heavy horsepistol at the appearance of which formidable weapons the captain hung back and curtis shouted out in alarm no violence ill keep my word and go off with you quiet enough be jasus and you shant though my dear frind cried oblunderbuss looking rapidly round in search of some object which he might use as an offensive weapon against the invaders but the two men from down stairs now made their appearance and curtis put an end to all further hostilities by surrendering himself to them without any more ado frank frank shrieked his wife from the bedroom curthis my frinddont be a fool roared the captain well bate em yet the young gentleman however took no notice either of his wifes appeal or his friends adjuration and rapidly descended the stairs followed by the sheriffsofficers he was not only afraid of the pistols but he was likewise too much annoyed at the bedchamber scene to care about remaining in the house any longer not having courage enough to resent the wrong which he conceived to have been done him he was nevertheless unable to endure it passively and here signed himself moodily and sulkily to the lot which circumstances had shaped for him mac grab and one of the subordinates accordingly departed with their prisoner to the spunginghouse in chancery lane while proggs and the other man remained in possession of the dwelling in baker street it was about halfpast four oclock on that dark and chilly morning when frank curtis entered the lockup establishment owned by mr mac grab the sheriffsofficer a racking headache the result of the preceding nights debaucha cold nervousness amounting almost to a continuous shiverand thoughts of by no means a pleasant nature all combined to depress the young mans spirits to a very painful degree and as the door of the spunginghouse closed behind him he murmured to himself oh what a fool i have been fortunately he had plenty of ready money in his pocket and putting a guinea into mac grabs hand he said let me have a private room and have a fire lighted directly please to sit down for a few minutes in the office here observed the bailiff pocketing the coin while i call up the servant in the meantime the subordinate had lighted a lamp in the little dirty coldlooking place dignified by the name of the office and while mac grab went to summon the domestic curtis who was a prey to that fidgety sensation which seems the forerunner of something dreadful endeavoured to divert his thoughts from gloomy topics by scrutinizing the objects around him a sorry desk much hacked about with a penknife and stained all over with inka small shelf containing a few old law booksa lawalmanack with thick black lines in the calender denoting termtimesa list of the sheriffs and undersheriffs of england and walesprinted papers showing the arrangements of the courts for the sittings in and after termtwo or three crazy chairsand a dutch clock which ticked with a monotony calculated to drive a nervous person out of his sensesthese were the objects which met his view every thing appeared musty and wormeatenthe office looked as if it never were swept outand there was an earthly smell of a peculiarly unpleasant nature in this miserable placeso cold and cheerlessfrank curtis was kept waiting for nearly halfanhour while the man who remained with him sate dozing in a chair and every now and then awaking with a sudden dive down and bob up of the head which painfully augmented the nervousness of the prisoner at last mr mac grab returned smelling very strong of rum and followed by a dirtylooking old woman who seemed to have huddled on her clothes anyhow and to be in a particularly illhumour at being disturbed so early in the morning now then she said in a short sulky tone addressing herself to curtis without however looking at him this way frank followed her into a short passage and then up a narrow staircase the miserable candle which she held in one hand and shaded with the other on account of the draught affording only just sufficient light to render apparent the cheerless aspect of the premises it was not that there was any thing mean or poor in the interior of the dwelling the office excepted but there was an air of deep gloom and also of dirt and neglect which struck even so superficial an observer as mr frank curtis the old woman led the way into a moderatesized front room on the second floor where she lighted two candles and then set to work to persuade a few damp sticks smothered with small coal to burn up in the grate the apartment was fitted up as a sittingroom but had a bed in it the walls were hung with numerous pictures the frames of which were an inch thick in dust and cobwebs and there was a sideboard covered with oldfashioned cut glass the carpet was worn out in many places and was also much soiled with grease and beer the tablecover was likewise stained with liquor and spotted with ink the curtains which were of good material were completely disguised in dust and the windows were so dirty that at midday they formed a pleasantly subdued medium for the sunlight altogether there was an air of expense mingled with the most cheerless discomfortan appearance of liberal outlay altogether neutralized by neglect and habits of wanton slovenliness the fire burnt feeblythe old woman slunk sulkily awayand frank curtis threw himself upon the bed he was thoroughly wretched and would have given all the money he had left in his pocket for a few hours tranquil repose but sleep would not visit his eyes and after tossing about for some time in painful restlessness he got up as the clock struck eight his burning feverish countenance craved the contact of cold water and the idea of a refreshing toilette rendered him almost cheerful but the jug was empty and there were no towels he rang the bell five minutes elapsedand no one came he rang again and at last another five minutes having gone tediously by the old woman made her appearance his wishes were expressed and the harridan took away the jug a third interval of five minutes passed ere she returned then she had forgotten the towels and now a quarter of an hour dragged its slow length along before she came back bringing with her a miserably thin rag of about a foot square she was about to leave the room again when curtis discovered that there was no soap and ten minutes more were required for the provoking old wretch to produce a small sample of that very necessary article yet for all this discomfort the prisoner had paid a guinea in advance pray let me have some breakfast us soon as you can my good woman said frank humiliated and miserable as soon as the kittle biles down stairs answered the servant in a surly tone as she turned to leave the room and how long will that be demanded curtis dont know the kitchen fire aint alight yetand she hobbled away in a fit of desperation the prisoner addressed himself to his toilette but the feeling of utter discomfort still clung to him the water seemed thick and clammy instead of cool and refreshing and the towel was so small that it became saturated in a few moments and he was compelled to dry his face with a corner of one of the sheets having no nail brush he could not cleanse his hands properly and the want of a comb left his hair matted and disordered in fact he positively felt more uncomfortable and dirty after his ablutions than he did before he began them and that disagreeable sensation kept him dispirited and wretched he walked about the room examining all the pictures one after the other until he became as thoroughly acquainted with their subjects as if he had lived for years in that room he then posted himself at one of the windows and watched the people passing up and down the street it was now nine oclock and the lawclerks were proceeding to their respective offices seedylooking men were hurrying along with mysterious slips of paper in their hands and now and then a betterattired person in a suit of black would be seen wending his way towards the chancery court carrying the blue bag of his master a barrister small parties of threes or fours would likewise pass up the lane affording to the initiated the irresistible ideawhich was also the true oneof tipstaves conducting insolvents to the court in portugal street at the public house opposite the barred window from which curtis was gazing a small knot of very shabby men had collected and it required but little knowledge of the specimens of animated nature in chancery lane to recognise their especial calling in fact they were individuals who belonged to the outworks of the strong entrenchments of the lawprocessservers sheriffsofficers assistants and men who hired themselves out to be left in possession at dwellings where executions were levied when not actively engaged they regularly haunted the publichouses of which they seemed the very doorposts and if they stepped inside to take something which was very often indeed they appeared on intimate terms with the landlord said miss to the bargirl and called the waiter by his christian name they had a dirty seedy mean and cringing look about them and yet if not adequately recompensed by the unfortunate victims of the law with whom they had to deal they would become doggedly insolent and grossly abusive halfanhour passed away and chancery lane grew more attractive a few barristers in all the imposing dignity of the black gown and the awful wisdom of the wig were seen moving along to the rolls court welldressed attorneys alighted from their gigs cabs or phaetons at the doors of their officesand articled clerks having thrown away their cigars when within view of the windows of their places of business made up for lost time by cutting briskly over the pavement flourishing short sticks and complacently surveying their polished boots tightfitting trousers and flash waistcoats frank curtis sighed as he beheld so many many persons in the enjoyment of freedombut his mournful reverie was at length broken by the entrance of the old woman with the breakfasttray his throat was parched and he had been unable to drink the water he now therefore eagerly applied himself to the tea but it was wretched stuff and even extreme thirst could not render it palatable he tried to eat a piece of toast but the butter was so rank that his heart heaved against it he broke open an egg it however tasted of straw and nearly made him sick having forced himself to swallow a couple of cups of tea frank rang the bell and ordered the woman to bring him a sheet of paper this command was complied with after a long delay and by the aid of a worn down stump of a pen and ink which flowed like soot and water frank managed to pen a brief note to a lawyer whom he knew and who dwelt in carey street hard by after a great deal of trouble a messenger was found who for the moderate reward of eighteen pence undertook to convey the note to its place of destinationjust fifty yards distant and in the course of half an hour mr pepperton the legal limb alluded to made his appearance in the shape of a short thin sallowfaced man with small piercing eyes and very compressed lips well mr curtis said the lawyer as he entered the room got into a messeh rather so replied the young man but i dont care so much about that as on account of being locked up in this cursed place the fact is i must go over to the bench and i dare say sir christopher wont let me lie very long there you require a habeas you know observed the lawyer but are you sure that youre sued in the court of queens bench because if it is in the common pleas or exchequer you will have to go to the fleet the devil ejaculated frank but heres a paper which mac grab gave me ah thats right said mr pepperton examining the document placed in his hands yesits in the bench safe enough holloa he exclaimed suddenly after a few moments silence heres an error in the description your name is francis and not frank just so cried the prisoner his heart fluttering with the vague hope which his legal advisers words and manner had encouraged welli thinkmind i think that it is highly probable we may set the caption aside continued pepperton at all events it would be worth the trying but i must apply to the judge in chambers this afternoon and if we do happen to failmind i say if we dowhy then you can pass over to the bench tomorrow somehow or another persons locked up in spunginghouses always feel confident of getting out on the slightest legal quibble that their ingenious attorneys may suggest they do not apprehend the chance of failure and of disbursing two or three guineas which they can so ill afford for nothing the process of applying to a judge in chambers seems so certain of a triumphant issue and there is such a spell in the bare idea that the door of freedom appears already opening to the touch frank curtis was not an exception to the general rule which we have mentioned and he forthwith desired mr pepperton to adopt the necessary steps although this gentleman assured him that nothing could be done until the after part of the day poor deluded captive little did he think mr pepperton was well aware beforehand that there was not the shadow of the ghost of a chance of success but that his only motive in suggesting these proceedings was to make as much out of his client as possible when pepperton had left the room frank curtis began to pace it as if he were a wandering jew confined to a very miniature world and he examined the pictures over and over again until they seemed the most familiar friends of the kind he had ever known then he returned to the window and beheld mr mac grab and one of his men just starting in a queerlooking gig upon a suburban expedition and having watched the equipage until it was no longer visible he bethought himself of asking for a newspaper he accordingly rang the bell and intimated his wishes to the old woman who after keeping him in suspense as usual for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour returned with a weekly dispatch a fortnight old and a times of ten days back curtis could scarcely control his indignation and tossing a shilling to the harridan he desired her to send out and buy him a morning paper she departed accordingly and in halfanhour returned with that days times whereby mr frank curtis was enabled to divert himself until two oclock when he partook of an execrable chop nearly raw a potato that seemed as if it were iced and a pint of wine which appeared to have been warmed then how heavily heavily did the weary hours pass away and curtis more than half regretted that his friend oblunderbuss did not call upon him he felt that for the pleasure of his society he would overlook and forget the treatment he had received at his hands but the gallant officer came not and what with another examination of the pictures a complete spell of the advertisements the news being already disposed of in the times and a cigar or two frank managed to dispose of the time though miserably enough until five oclock mr pepperton then came back and frank awaited the report in excruciating suspense well my dear fellow said the lawyer flinging himself in a chair as if regularly worn out by hard work we have lost the point but we have this consolation what demanded curtis in the anxious hope of seeing another loophole promising emancipation whythat we as nearly gained it as possible returned pepperton it was old justice foozlehem that was at chambers today and when i argued the point he rubbed his nose with the featherend of the penhe always does that when the thing is very ticklish damn judge foozlehem emphatically cried mr frank curtis a miss is as good as a mile and that was what the prince of malabar said when my bullet whistled close by his ear at that duel which him and me fought at boulogne three years ago but to speak seriously of businessi suppose that theres nothing left for me to do save to pay the debt or go to the bench added the lawyer putting the alternatives in as nutshell a compass as possible wellthe bench it must be then ejaculated frank i will take out the habeas tomorrow observed mr pepperton and at about five oclock in the afternoon the tipstaff will be at serjeants inn waiting for youor may be youll have to go over to him at the publichouse opposite curtis invited the lawyer to pass the evening with him but mr pepperton was engaged elsewhere and the prisoner was therefore compelled to drink and smoke in solitude occasionally varying the occupation by another spell at the timesanother long gaze of envy from the windowand another scrutiny of the pictures at last when ten oclock struck mr curtis was thoroughly worn out by feverish excitement suspense and annoyances of all kinds and he retired to rest with the fervent hope of enjoying an uninterrupted slumber till morning but scarcely had he begun to get drowsy when a tickling sensation commenced in a thousand parts of his body and limbs and to his dismay he found himself assailed by a perfect legion of those abominable little torturers termed bugs now mr curtis was most peculiarly sensitive in this respect and if there were ever a flea or a bug in a bed it was certain to find him outaye and feast upon him too but never in the whole course of his life had he experienced such an attack as on the present occasion never till now had he known bugs so numerous nor bites so pungent at length he jumped up in rage and agony and lighted a candle but vain was all search not a bug could he find the legion appeared to have suddenly disappeared like destiny they were always to be felt but never seen he could not sleep with a light in the room so having extinguished it he laid himself down once more for a few minutes he was suffered to remain quiet enough but at last back came his tormentors by slow degrees and scarcely had he torn the skin off one part of his body than he was compelled to flay another in this manner hour after hour passed and when he did at length fall asleep between one and two in the morning he was pursued by a legion of bugs and sheriffsofficers in his dreams chapter civ the visitthe habeas corpus frank awoke at seven oclock depressed in spirits and unrefreshed in body his head still ached and he was sore all over through having nearly torn himself to pieces on account of the bugs his face betrayed marks of the ravages committed upon him by his little tormentors and his eyes were swollen from the same cause he had not even the comfort of copious ablutions for the process of the toilette was not more satisfactory on this occasion than it had been on the previous day thus all circumstances conspired to make him wretched before he sate down to breakfast he despatched a messenger to baker street for a few necessaries which he required and as he did not choose to write to his wife and knew not whether oblunderbuss might still be there he sent a verbal intimation of his wishes the breakfast of this morning was no improvement on its predecessor indeed it struck curtis that he had got from bad to worse by trying the desperate experiment of ordering coffee instead of tea he however knew that it was useless to grumble and so having disposed of the meal as best he could he sent for the morning paper with which he whiled away an hour and a half until the return of his messenger who came laden with a portmanteau well who did you see in baker street demanded frank please sir i see mr proggs and tother man which is in possession was the answer and who else enquired curtis please sir i see a stout lady as give me a glass of gin and a tall genelman as give me a rap over the head returned the man and what did he do that for cried frank laughing in spite of himself cos he said sir that i didnt speak in a speckful way to him but heres a note as the genelman give me to give to you sir curtis tore open a curiously folded letter which the messenger handed to him and the contents of which ran as follow be jasus my frind and its myself that has a right to complain of unfrindly tratement here have i been waiting to resave a bit of a note from ye and divil a line or a word at all at all your poor wifes distracted and has lost her appetite and all because of your injurious suspicions but i do all i can to consoul her if you come to reflict upon the matther frank ye must admit that though appayrances was against me yet it isnt capthain oblunderbuss that would wrong ye for be the powers and its mistaken in the bed i waswhat with botheration and potheen and the candles going out and divil a hayporth did i drame where i was till ye powred the wather all over me so shake hands me boy and let us be frinds again and sure its myself that will bring mrs curtis down to dine with ye at two oclock this afthernoon and well send in the dinner and the potheen first proggs and his man are in possission and i feel like a defated ginral but theyre on their best behaviour and so i have not been forced to give either of them a taste of the shillaylee im sadly afraid that the chap you have sent up is a fool so if he should forget to give you this letter mind you ask him for it your wife sends you a million kisses through me and believe me my frind to remain ever yours gorman oblunderbuss very good said frank curtis as he brought the perusal of this curious epistle to an end and having paid and dismissed the messenger he sate himself down to reflect upon the manner in which he ought to receive his wife and the gallant gentleman on the one hand was the sense of the injury he had received or fancied he had received for he could not well embrace the double conviction that mrs curtis was not faithless and that the captain was not treacherous on the other hand were numerous motives persuasive of an amicable coursethe want of society the shame of declaring himself to be a cuckoldand last though not least the infinite terror in which he stood of gorman oblunderbuss these reasons were weighty and powerful and they grew stronger and stronger as the dinnerhour advanceduntil they became completely triumphant when a hamper was sent up containing cold fowls ham wine dessert whiskey and cigars no longer hesitating what course to pursue frank superintended the laying of the cloth and the arrangement of the provisions upon the table he decanted the winetasted itand found it excellentand those little proceedings having put him into a thorough good humour he received his wife and the captain when they made their appearance as if nothing had occurred to ruffle his mind with regard to them mrs curtis thought it necessary to go into hysterics at the sight of her beloved husband in a spunginghouse but she speedily recovered upon the said beloved husbands kindly recommending her not to make a fool of herselfand the trio sate down to dinner at which they made themselves very comfortable indeed the captain proposed that as the wineglasses were particularly small they should drink their sherry from tumblers and the motion was adopted after a feeble opposition on the part of the lady well currtis me boy exclaimed the gallant gentleman when they had made an end of eating having done immense justice to the viands provided what are ye afther now it isnt staying here all your life that you can be thinking of nor do i intend to stop in this cursed hole many hours longer interrupted frank i expect to go over to the bench at five oclock the binch cried the captain overjoyed at the plan chalked out be jasus and its the wisest thing ye can be afther my frind the binch is a glorrious placeand yell be as comfortable there as at home the porther is the best in all london and its worth while to be in the binch for the pleasure of dhrinking it not that im a great admirer of malt mim he added turning politely towards mrs curtis but the porther of the binch is second best to rale potheen then the amusements of the binch mim are delightful theres the parade to walk uponand theres the racquet ground when yere tired of the paradeand theres the dolphinpumpand the coffeehouse a riglar tavernin fact exclaimed the gallant gentleman quite lost in admiration of all the beautiful views and scenes he was so enthusiastically depicting the binch is a perfect palace of a prison and i only wish i was there myself im sure i should be most happy to change places with you captain observed frank curtis drily i wouldnt deprive ye of the pleasure me boy for all the worrld cried oblunderbuss in a tone of the utmost sincerity but whats to be done next those bastes of the earth are in possession of the garrison and every stick will be sould up by themthe ragamuffin scamps that they are the wife and children must take a lodging over the water close by the bench said curtis and if sir christopher wont come forward to assist me i must either get the rules or go through the insolvents courti dont care much which my friend the earl of billingsgate did both be the holy pokerr and its myself that will call on sir christopherr in such a strait as this vociferated the captain and although he did knock me down from the carriage window the last time what ejaculated frank as much amused as astonished at the information which the gallant officer had so inadvertently let slip sir christopher knocked you down blood and thunther roared the captain becoming as red as scarlet and was it afther making a fool of myself that i was for sure and it was sir christopher that was knocked downand i didnt like to tell ye about it before seeing that hes your own natral uncle but its myself that will call upon him and offer the most abject apology and ill skin him alive if he dont come forard as he ought to do and pay all your debts my dear boy so you persave that theres some use in having such a frind as gorman obluntherbuss of bluntherbuss park connemarrra irrreland added the martial gentleman with an awful rattling of the rs the sooner i move over to the neighbourhood of the bench the better said mrs curtis for i am sick and tired of living in baker street just now when i came out it seemed to me that all the people i met laughed in my face as if they knew our circumstances i wish i had seen them darr to laugh cried captain oblunderbuss lifting up an empty bottle and flourishing it over his head id have sent them slap into the middle of next week so that they should miss resayving their money next saturday night in such pleasant chat as this did the trio while away the time until about a quarter to five when mr pepperton made his appearance to announce that the office had been searched that three detainers had been found and that the habeas corpus was all in applepie order frank curtis accordingly rang the bell and ordered his bill in about a quarter of an hour it was broughtand thus it ran mr curtiss account s d room breakfast eggs messenger to carey street reading newspapers dinner porter gin and cigars bread and cheese for supper porter room breakfast eggs messenger to baker street use of tablecloth knives and forks c gentleman providing his own dinner extras why my good woman exclaimed frank curtis amazed as such a terrific attempt at imposition this account is absurd besides there are two things in it that i paid for myselfi mean the messenger yesterday and today master says its all right sir observed the harridan and then you charge a shilling for reading two newspapers a fortnight old cried frank more and more bewildered as he studied the items of the bill and five shillings for extras whywhat the devil are the extras since it seems to me that you have taken precious good care to omit nothing the extras is soap and candles and so on said the woman growing impatient then be jasus and just let me soap over mr mac grab with a shillaleh ejaculated captain oblunderbuss starting from his seat its afther robbing my frind ye areye bastes of the earth mr pepperton however interfered and represented to the two gentlemen that there was no possibility of obtaining redressthat sheriffsofficers might charge exactly what they likedand that it would be much better to pay the bill without any haggling the amount was accordingly liquidated and the old woman received halfacrown as a gratuity which she took in a manner most unequivocally denoting that she had expected at least four times as much well exclaimed frank curtis as soon as she had left the room of all infernal impositions this is the greatest supposing i was a poor devil then you would have been bundled straight off to whitecross street at once observed pepperton lord bless you my dear sirtheres an aristocracy amongst debtors as well as in every thing else in this country i always thought the law was the same for rich or poor said curtis you never were under a greater mistake in your life returned the solicitor money is allpowerful in england and makes the gentleman and gentlemen are treated quite differently from common people such establishments as the bench and the fleet are for those who can afford to pay for a habeas while those who cannot must go to the county gaol these spunginghouses too are places of accommodation for the use of which people must pay liberally or rather be robbed vilely said frank but never mindit cant be helped when shall i have to go over to the bench the tipstaff is no doubt already waiting at the publichouse opposite replied the lawyer then ill be off at once exclaimed curtis rising from his chair be the powerrs but well see ye safe over to the binch cried captain oblunderbuss for it may be that i shall have to thrash the marshal or skin a turrnkey to renther the people dacently civil in that iligant istablishment yesyou come with me captain said frank who had been thinking of some means to separate his amiable wife and his devoted friend you can put mrs c into a hackneycoach and tomorrow morning my dear he added turning towards his spouse you can look out for a lodging somewhere in the neighbourhood of the prison but you dont mean me to remain all alone tonight in baker street with those odious officers in the house exclaimed mrs curtis not admiring the proposed arrangement it would not be proper for the captain to stay in the house now that i am away said frank hastily and without daring to look at his gallant friend indeed scarcely were the words out of his mouth when he was surprised at his courage in having dared to utter them fortunately the captain took the observation in good part and even expressed his approval of it for it struck the martial gentleman that he should stand a much better chance of amusing himself with frank curtis in the bench with the interior arrangements of which he was pretty well acquainted from old experience than in the society of mrs curtis in baker street the lady could not therefore offer any farther opposition to the arrangement proposed but she darted an angry look upon the captain who responded by one of earnest appeal to her mercy she now took leave of her husband and was escorted by captain oblunderbuss to the nearest coachstand and as some time elapsed ere he returned to the spunginghouse it is presumable that he had a little difficulty in making his peace with her at length however he did reappear and the messenger having conveyed the portmanteau over to the publichouse opposite for which he only charged a shilling the prisoner proceeded thither in company with mr macgrab and captain oblunderbuss pepperton bidding them farewell at the door in a little front parlour on the first floor of the publichouse alluded to sate halfadozen seedylooking men who were delectably occupied in smoking cigars and drinking hot ginandwater their conversation was doubtless very amusing to themselves but it would have been very boring to strangersfor the topic seemed entirely limited to what had taken place that day at the insolvent debtors court or at the judges chambers there in that same room were those men accustomed to meet every afternoon sunday excepted at about the same hour and their discourse was invariably on the same subjects they were tipstaffsor more properly speaking perhaps tipstaves they lived in the atmosphere of debtors prisons and lawcourtsand all their information was circumscribed to the transactions thereof when they were not hovering about the lobbies of the fleet or the bench they were down at westminster or up at portugal street and if not in any of those placeswhy then they were at the publichouse it was to one of these worthies that macgrab introduced mr francis curtis and as the tipstaff thus particularised had not finished his cigar nor his ginandwater mr frank curtis and captain oblunderbuss sate down to keep him company till he had half an hour afterwards a hackneycoach was sent for and the prisoner his gallant friend and the officer were speedily on their road to the kings bench prison curtis spoke but little during the transit he felt nervous at the idea of going to his new home but the captain rattled away as if he were determined to speak for himself and his friend both and the tipstaff was still in a state of uncertainty as to whether he should set the gallant gentleman down as a very extraordinary personage or as a most wondrous liar when the vehicle stopped at a little low door in a gloomy brick wall be jasus and heres the binch already exclaimed captain oblunderbuss thrusting his head out of the coachwindow that house there with the trees before it frank is the marshalsand a very dacent berth hes got of it i shouldnt mind standing in his shoes at all at all but come along me dear frind thus speaking the captain leapt from the vehicle followed by frank curtis and the tipstaff and having traversed an enclosure formed by the gloomylooking wall above alluded to and the high spiketopped boundary of the prison itself the trio ascended a few steps which led them into the upper lobby of the kings bench footnote within the last few years the fleet has been suppressed and the bench under the general name of the queens prison has become the receptacle for all metropolitan debtors who are enabled to purchase the luxury of a habeas corpus chapter cv the kings bench prison the upper lobby was a small dirty and sombrelooking outwork of the vast establishment a huge clock hung against one of the wallsa roasting fire burnt in the grateand a stout elderly turnkey who spoke with a provincial accent was seated on a high stool near the inner door watching the persons who came out of the prison and on whose countenance the glare of a powerful light was thrown by a tin reflector grouped near him were several charwomen and messengers engaged in the double occupation of discussing a pot of the best ale and the scandal of the bench while another turnkeya short active bustling little fellow who rejoiced in the nickname of bufferwas seated inside a small enclosure formed by woodwork breasthigh examining a greasy and wellthumbed book containing sundry hieroglyphics which were supposed to be entries of the prisoners names to mr buffer was mr frank curtis duly introduced by the tipstaff and the young gentlemans appellations were forthwith inscribed in the greasy book he was then desired to pay his gatefees which he accordingly did and these little matters being settled mr buffer politely informed him that he might go inside the head turnkeywho was the stout elderly man above alluded tothereupon opened the door at which he was seated and captain oblunderbuss led the way first across a small yard next through the lower lobbyand thence into the grand enclosure of the kings bench itself captain oblunderbuss turned sharp round to the left and stopped in admiration before a low building with a roof slanting down from the high wall against which it stood there cried the gallant officer in an ecstacy of enthusiasm what place should you be afther taking that to be whyi should say it was the scullery or the coalcellars replied frank be jasus me dear frindand youre insulthing the finest fature in this fine prison exclaimed the captain its the coffeehouse mr curtis did not like to say how deeply he was disappointed at the unpromising exterior of an establishment which his companion seemed so especially to admire and he therefore silently followed his guide into the coffeeroom which was just large enough to contain four very little tables and yield accommodation to about a dozen people at a time there was nearly that number present when captain oblunderbuss and frank curtis entered the place and as there were not two seats disengaged the gallant officer put his arms akimbo fixed his eyes sternly on a stout inoffensivelooking old gentleman and without positively addressing his words to him exclaimed be the holy pokerr and i should advise some one to be afther making room on a binch for my frind and myselfor ill know the rayson why the inoffensivelooking gentleman shrank dismayed into a corner and two or three others pressing closer together sufficient space was obtained to afford captain oblunderbuss and mr frank curtis seats and the former as he took his place at a table cast a particularly ferocious glance around on the assembled company as much as to say be the powerrs and yed betther not be afther having any of your nonsense with me but as no one at the moment seemed at all inclined to make even an attempt to interfere with the gallant gentleman his countenance gradually lost its menacing aspect and he ordered the waitera slipshod dirty boyto bring a bottle of wine spirits not being allowed the company presented to the view of mr frank curtis rather a motley aspect there was a sample of nearly all kinds of social distinctionsa sprig of the aristocracya brokendown sporting gentlemana decayed tradesmana bankrupt merchantan insolvent parsona ruined gamestera prizefightera horsechaunteran attorney who had overreached himselfa poor authorand one or two others who bore the vague and much misappropriated denomination of gentleman all these were herding together in a glorious state of democratic equality for a debtors prison goes far to level distinctions the lordling being very often glad to obtain a draught of ale from the pewterpot of a butcher the entrance of captain oblunderbuss and frank curtis both of whom were taken for new prisoners and stared at accordingly seemed to have interrupted a conversation that was previously going onand for a few minutes a dead silence prevailed but at last when the wine which the captain had ordered was brought in and that gallant gentleman and curtis gave evident proofs of an inclination to enjoy themselves by enquiring likewise for cigars the company recovered the feeling of hilarity on which the awful appearance of oblunderbuss had seemed for a few minutes to throw a complete damper well how did jackson get on today at portugal street enquired a rakish dissipated looking young gentleman who was smoking a cigar and drinking a pint of portwine he got sent back for six months answered the person to whom the question was put and who was a stout big man in very seedy attire it seems that his schedule was made up of accommodation bills and the opposition was desperate you talk of accommodation bills muggles observed the young gentleman why all my debts are in paper of that kind theres seventeen thousand pounds against me at the gate and id take my affidavit that i never had more than three thousand in actual value so i suppose i shall get it from the old commissioner no you wont pettifer my boy cried a short elderly dapperlooking man putting down a quart pot in which his countenance had been buried for upwards of a minute before he began to speak your fathers a lordand thats enough he added looking mysteriously around well so he is said the honourable mr pettifer lolling back in a very aristocratic manner and speaking for the behoof of captain oblunderbuss and frank curtis its true that my father is lord cobbleton and that im his second son but after allwhats a noblemans second son be jasus and what indeed cried the captain why my grandfather was archbishop of dublinand my father was his sonand im my fathers sonand yet be the powerrs im only a capthain now but if i hadnt half a million or some thrifle of the kind locked up in chancery i should be afther rowlling in my carriagealthough i do keep a buggy and a dogcart as it isand my frind curthis here jintlemen wouldnt be in the binch for two hunthred thousand pounds as he is and bad luck to it wellbut you know captain said frank who was determined not to be behind his gallant companion in the art of lying and who therefore very readily took up the cue prepared for himyou know captain that the moment my godfather the duke comes home i shall be all right rightright as a thrivet me boy vociferated oblunderbuss and then well carry on the warrr with a vengeance these remarks on the part of the captain and frank curtis produced a deep impression upon the greater portion of the company present but two or three of the oldest prisoners tipped each other the wink slyly as much as to say aint they coming it strongalthough they did not dare provoke the ire of the ferocious hibernian by any overt display of their scepticism speaking of chancery said an old miserablelooking man in a wretchedly threadbare suit of black and whose careworn countenance showed an intimate acquaintance with sorrowspeaking of chancery he repeated leaning forward from the corner in which he had hitherto remained silent and almost unobservedyou cant know chancery sirbegging your pardonbetter or more bitterly than i do illustration ah tell the gentlemen your story prout exclaimed one of the company pon my soul tis a hard case and a stain upon a civilised country a stain ejaculated the old man whose name appeared to be prouta stain he cried in a tone of painful ironyit is a horroran abominationan atrocity that demands vengeance on those legislators who know that such abuses exist and who will not remedy them chancellorsvicechancellorsjudgeslawlordsmembers of parliamentattorneygeneralssolicitorgeneralsall all for the last twoandtwenty years so help me god have been familiar with my caseand yet the court of chancery remains as it is the most tremendous abusethe most damnable inquisitionthe most grinding soulcrushing heartbreaking engine of torture that the ingenuity of man ever yet invented yesall thatand moremore if i could find stronger language to express myself inis that earthly reflection of hellthe court of chancery the old man had spoken with a volubility which had increased in quickness and in emphasis until it positively grew painful to hearand his countenance became flushed with a hectic unhealthy redand his eyes usually leaden and dull were fired with an unnatural lustreand his chest heaved convulsivelyand his lips quivered with the dreadful excitement produced in his attenuated and wornout frame by the remembrance of his wrongs remembranceas if he ever forgot them nothe chancery court was the subject of his thoughts by day and his dreams by night every thing he heard or saw or read was so tortured by his morbid imagination as to bear some analogy remote or near to the proceedings of the chancery courtwhen he had a meal he wondered that the chancery court had left it to himand when he had none he said that the chancery court made him starveif he felt in tolerably good health it was because he heard of some case in chancery even more flagrant than his ownand that was a consolation to his diseased mind and if he felt ill which was nearly always the case he declared that the chancery court made him soin fact he was truly a victim in every sense and way of that tremendous tribunal which has instruments of torture far more terrible for the feelings than those which the inquisition of spain ever invented for the body yes exclaimed prout after a few moments pause and all that diabolical tyranny is carried on under the semblance and with the solemn forms of justice you go into a fine court where you see a man of splendid intellect fine education and profound knowledge seated in a chair with the wig and gown and before him are rows of barristers almost as learned as himself wellwould you not think that you were in a tribunal worthy of the civilisation of this country yetbetter were it if savages from the south sea islands became your judges better to die upon the threshold of that court than enter its walls it is a damnable and a cursed tyranny i repeat and the english are a weaka pusillanimousa spaniellike race that they do not rise in rebellion against that monstrous tribunal again he paused overpowered by excitementbut there was something terribly real and awfully sincereaye and sternly truein that mans denunciations yesi say he resumed after having refreshed himself from a pewterpot near himthough there had been a time when he was accustomed to drink winethe english people are a nation of paltry cowards for allowing this hideous chancery court to uprear its head amongst them did not the french destroy their bastilleand was the bastille ever half so bad in one way as this chancery court is in another it is all useless for two or three people to declaim or two or three authors to write against such a flagrant abuse tis a public grievance and must be put down by the public hand the whole body of lawyers are against lawreformand the profession of the law has vast influence upon both houses of parliament from the houses of parliament then we have no hope the strong hand of the people must do it you might as well ask the lords to abolish hereditary aristocracy or the king to dethrone himself as expect the houses of parliament to sweep away the chancery court but could we do without it enquired an attentive listener do without it exclaimed prout indignantlyalmost contemptuously at the nature of the question certainly we can france does without itholland does without itprussia does without itswitzerland does without itand the united states do without itand where is the law of property better administered than in those countries there the transfer of land or the bequeathing of other property is as simple as that of merchandize or stock but herehere in england which vaunts its freedom and its civilization the process is encumbered with forms and deeds which leave the whole arrangement liable to flaws difficulties and endless embarrassments talk of equity indeed tis the most shameless mockery of justice ever known even amongst barbarians but let me tell you an anecdote in a suit was commenced in chancery relative to some lawful property on which there was a windmill the cause was not referred to the master till thirtythree years having elapsed and the lawyers who had grown old during the proceedings not having been idle in the masters office did the case remain till though the new lawyers who had succeeded the old batch that had died off in the meantime were as active as the matter would allow them to be wellin the master began to look into the business but behold the windmill had disappearedit had tumbled downit had wasted away into dustnot a trace of it remained actually shrieked out the old man in the excitement of his story thus the affair was fiftytwo years in chancery and was knocked on the head after all observed one of the company present while law slept time was awake and busy you see said prout with a bitter irony which actually chilled the hearts of his auditors but i can give you plenty of examples of the infernalheartbreaking delays of chanceryand my own amongst the rest presently he continued there is the case of bute versus stuart it began in and in a step was made in the cause then again you have the case of the attorneygeneral versus trevelyan it commenced in and is an affair involving an endowment for a grammarschool at morpeth this cause never will be finished but how much property do you suppose there is locked up in chanceryeh ah now i am going to tell you something astounding indeedand yet as true as the gospel thirtyeight millions sterling are locked up in that dreadful tribunal a tribunalnoit is a sepulchrea tomba grave in which all justice and all hopes are interred but you will say that this enormous fund is only as it were in temporary trust to be in due time portioned out to its rightful owners pshawnonsense more than onethird concerns persons who are dead and have left no heirs or else whose representatives are ignorant of their rights the suitors fund is a bank of plunderof shameful diabolical plunder effected under the forms of the law but what about your own case old fellow enquired the honourable mr pettifer ill tell you in a moment gentlemen cried prout rejoiced to observe the interest created by his strictures on the most hellish tribunal that ever disgraced a civilised country twentyfive years ago he said i was a prosperous man having a good business in the city and i had managed to save four thousand pounds by dint of strict economy and the closest attention to my affairs a lawyera friend of minetold me of a favourable opportunity to place the sum out at good interest and on the best possible security a gentleman in fact wanted to borrow just that amount on mortgage he having a capital estate the matter was fully investigated and the security was considered unexceptionable so i lent the money and for three years the interest was regularly paid and all went on well the gentleman suddenly died and his nephew who inherited the estate hunted out an old entail effected a hundred and fifty years previously and of the existence of such an entail no mention had been made in subsequent deeds so the nephew would not acknowledge the validity of the mortgage and refused to pay me a fraction of my four thousand pounds he would not even settle the interest i was therefore forced into chancery and seven years afterwards i got a decree in my favour but i was sent into the masters office on account of certain details which i will not stop to explain to you this was fifteen years agoand i am still in chancery i have spent three thousand pounds in costsand am totally ruined the excitement and worry of law made me neglect my business my affairs fell into confusionmy creditors took all my stock in tradeand here have i been eleven years for the balance of my liabilities twentytwo years have i been engaged in lawand have not yet got justice and yet i am told that i live in a civilised country where the laws are based on consummate wisdom and where the meanest as well as the highest individual is sure to obtain justice justice indeedsuch justice as one finds in the chancery court my original claim was for four thousand poundsand i have spent three thousand in costs and owe my lawyer five hundred pounds more but what do you think of this eight years ago a written question was put by the master to the respondent in the suit and it is still a matter of dispute whether he is to answer it or not heres law for youheres justice whyit is enough to make a man curse himself for belonging to a country in which such things take place it is enough to make me ashamed of being an englishman suppose a savage from the south sea islands came to englandbeheld all the glitter and glory of our outward appearance of civilisationstudied our language and was then told of such cases as these what would he think he would say after all you are in reality a very barbarous people and i shall be glad when i get back to my own faroff island as far as all this goes you are right enough observed an attorney who was one of the company present but had you gone much farther you would have been equally correct you may denounce nearly all our laws and statutes to be radically bad and a disgrace to civilisation but it is useless to hope that an efficient reform will be ever effected by the parliament because the parliament is loth to interfere with existing usages and is afraid to meddle with existing rights nothing short of a revolution can possibly accomplish a proper change whythis is treason exclaimed the honourable mr pettifer his aristocratic feelings deeply wounded by the lawyers bold and manly declaration it may be treasonbut it is nevertheless the truth said the attorney with the cool firmness of a man entertaining an honest conviction of the justice of his observations i declare most of our laws to be a disgrace and a shame in france all the laws are contained in one book accessible to every person here in this country they are totally inaccessible to the community in general do you think france would ever have had her code without a revolution do you know how silly absurd and contradictory are some of our statutesthose statutes which are approved of by the lawofficers of the crown and enacted by wise senators there is a statute for examples sake which decrees that one half of the penalty inflicted in a particular case is to go to the informer and the other half to the king and yet under this statute judges sentence men to transportationsay fourteen years transportation to be halved by the informer and the king then there are statutes still upon the book and which though unrepealed could scarcely be put into execution without inflicting an odious tyranny a statute of edward vi forbids agricultural labourers to hire themselves out or be hired by the day and not for less than a year by a statute of william and mary no peasant may sell goods in a town except at a fair and a statute of henry vii decrees under severe penalties that no cattle shall be killed in a walled town nor in cambridge there is also a statute i forget of which reign enacting that no shoemaker may be a tanner nor a tanner a shoemaker the laws relating to marriage are in many respects absurd and in others obscure a marriage contracted by persons under age by means of license without the consent of their parents is unlawful but such persons may contract a lawful marriage by banns although without the consent of their parents thousands and thousands of persons have been led to believe that it is lawful for a man to marry his deceased wifes sister whereas it is not lawful and the issue of such a marriage is illegitimate at this moment the learned gentleman was interrupted by the clanging of a loud bell carried by a person who was proceeding round the main building of the prison and who every now and then stopped ringing for the purpose of vociferating as loud as he couldstrangers women and children all out shall you have to leave demanded frank curtis in a whisper to his friend the captain divil a haporth of it me boy exclaimed oblunderbuss the person who keeps the coffeehouse will be glad to give me a bed as well as yourself for money frind currtis procures everything in this blissed spikeisland another halfhour was passed in discourse on various topics the inmates of the coffeehouse parlour having become wearied of commenting upon the laws of their country and at the expiration of that interval renewed shouts now emanating from the immediate vicinity of the lower lobby warned all strangers to quit the prison at the same time the parlour was rapidly cleared oblunderbuss and frank curtis alone remaining therefor it seemed to be a rule on the part of the prisoners to rush to the gate for the purpose of seeing the strangers take their departure the captain now gave a furious pull at the bell and when the slipshod waiter appeared he demanded a conference with the keeper of the coffeehouse this request was speedily complied with and satisfactory arrangements were entered into for beds another bottle of wine was ordered the captain persuading curtis that it would be better for him to take his first survey of all the grand features of the bench in the morning and to pass the evening in conviviality this they accordingly did until eleven oclock when the lights in the parlour were put out and the two gentlemen were shown to their respective bedchambersthe said chambers being each about twice as big as a coffin and quite as inconveniently angular footnote the anecdote is a positive fact footnote it is not terminated yet footnote mr prouts prophecy seems likely to be fulfilled for the case pends yet having now lasted one hundred and sixtytwo years in lord chancellor harcourt made a decree commanding the boundaries of the litigated land to be ascertained and the commissioner appointed to carry this decree into effect reported that no boundaries could be traced proceedings continued and on the th of january the case was reargued before vicechancellor shadwell eight counsel being engaged for relator lessee trustees corporation and the various other parties interested the vicechancellor of england referred the matter to the masters office where it is not likely to be disinterred for the next half century really we english are a highly civilised people a lawsuit may be perpetuated through a dozen generations without any delay or fault on the side of the parties interestedthe whole and sole blame resting upon the chancery court footnote mr commissioner fane of the london bankruptcy court was brought up as a chancery lawyer and in a recent letter to lord cottenham he thus explains the causes of that shameful dilatoriness which characterises chancery proceedings in chancery the suitor applies first to the judge every thing is done in writing the judge after great expense has been incurred and after a long delay makes a decree that decree tells the master in endless detail what he is to do just as if he required to be taught the simplest matters the decree is drawn up not by the judge who might be thought wiser than the master but by the registrar who in teaching the master frequently omits some material direction the parties then adjourn to the masters office there the matter lingers month after month and year after year at last the master makes his report tells the court what he has found and sometimes what he would have found if the registrar had authorised him to do so and at last the court either acts or sends the matter back to the master with new directions meanwhile as lord bacon said about two hundred years ago though the chancery pace be slow the suitors pulse beat quick i know of nothing to which to compare this process except the game of battledore and shuttlecock in which the poor suitor plays the part of shuttlecock and is tossed from the judge to the master and from the master to the judge over and over till the scene is closed only too often by despair insolvency or death footnote the code napoleon is sometimes declared to be a failure but it has been no failure in place of the previously differing laws of the provinces of the ancient kingdom it has substituted a consistent uniform code for the entire of france but it is urged that it has been buried under a load of commentaries of course there has risen a pile of judicial constructions as must be the case with the text of every code but these constructions have a platform to rest upon framed in the light of modern science ours are wholly different they have no such foundation to settle upon they rest upon a mingled heap of rubbish and masonry of obsolete laws and laws in force even the basement storey has not been firmly laid as in france this however it is that the nation requires to have done it requires an entirely new legal edifice to be erected all that is good in the past it would have preserved under a new and better arrangement and then the mass of statutes reports and textbooks from which the analysis had been made and which had long embarrassed both the learned and unlearneddeclared by parliamentary authority to be no better than waste papernull and void and no more citable for any purpose of legal argument illustration or decisionblack book of england footnote rd george iii chapter cvi a farther insight into the kings bench at halfpast seven oclock on the following morning the slipshod waiter knocked at mr curtiss door exclaiming please sir you must get up and go down to the lobby by eight cos youre wanted who wants me there demanded frank leaping from his bed and suddenly animated by the hope that sir christopher had accidentally heard of his predicament and had come to pay his debts but the boy had hurried down stairs again and curtis was accordingly compelled to hurry over his toilette in a state of profound suspense by the time his ablutions were performed and he was dressed it was close upon eight oclock and he repaired to the gate having bestowed en passant a thundering knock with his clenched fist on the door of the captains crib the gate of the lower lobby was not as yet opened but in its immediate vicinity several of the prisoners were collectedsome in dressinggowns others in their shirtsleeves and all having a certain air of seediness not observable elsewhere at length when the massive portal did expand in rushed a motley assortment of messengers charwomen and such itinerant venders as milkmen watercress boys and the fustianclad individual who sold red herrings and shrimps when this influx of varied specimens of animated nature had passed frank curtis entered the lobby and demanded of a onearmed turnkey standing before the fire who it was that required his presence me and my partners sir was the reply and what for enquired frank just to take your likeness sir was the farther explanation given my likeness cried the young gentleman glancing rapidly around in the expectation of beholding an artist with pallet and brushes all ready but not perceiving any such individual he began to look very ferocious indeed under the impression that the turnkey had a mind to banter him we call it taking the likeness of a new prisoner sir observed the onearmed functionary who was really a very civil fellow when we have him here by daylight just to take a look at himso that we may know him again he added significantly you see sir theres between three and four hundred prisoners in the collegewe call it a college sir sometimesand it isnt a very easy thing to remember every newcomer unless we have a good look at him oh now i understand you exclaimed frank laughing heartily at the idea of having his likeness taken in such a style while he was yet indulging in this expression of his mirth the other turnkeys made their appearance and each individually wishing him a good morning they scanned him from head to footapparently committing to memory every one of his features seriatim frank tried to look as unconcerned as possible but he nevertheless felt very uncomfortable and was heartily glad when the operation which lasted about five minutes was over the other turnkeys then withdrew and curtis remained alone with the onearmed official nice place this sir for a prisonaint it asked the latter taking his seat on a stool near the door which stood open and whence the eye commanded a view of the spacious racquetground and a small portion of the main building wellit might be a great deal worse replied frank you must have some strange characters here he added enquiringly i blieve ye exclaimed the turnkey fixing his looks mysteriously upon the young gentleman in a species of dim intimation that it was indeed a very remarkable place you see that old feller in the rugged blue coat arolling the fust racquetground there wellhe come here to this prison twenty year ago in his carriage and had his livery servants to wait upon him and now hes glad to drag that roller every morning for a few pence and cant he manage to get out asked frank with an ominous shudder lord bless you sir cried the turnkey hes his own prisoner his own prisoner repeated curtis whatdo you mean to say that he keeps himself in the bench i do sirand a many does the same continued the turnkey in a low mysterious tone these poor creaturs sir stay in prison so long that all their relations and friends dies off and if they went out they wouldnt have a soul to speak to or a place to go to so if their creditors dies too and their discharge is sent em they keep it in their pockets and never lodge it at the gatecos they prefer staying inside where they have companions and can get a bit of something to eat in one way or another this is the most extraordinary thing i ever heard in my life said frank theres many things more stranger still here returned his informant who was pleased with the mysterious importance which his position as narrator of these marvels gave him what should you think of men putting themselves into prison and making up their minds to stay here all their lives perhaps i should think you were joking if you said so answered curtis joking lord bless you sir i wouldnt joke about no such a thing exclaimed the turnkey with a spice of indignation in his manner but ill tell you how it is thereyou see that stout man in the shootingjacket abargaining for them bloaters with the chap thats sitting on the bench outside the tap wellhe committed a forgery or summut of that kind and knowing there was a warrant against him and not choosing to run away from london for fear of being took in the country he got a friend to arrest him for debt so he immediately passed over to the bench by habeas and the warrant for felony was lodged at the gate against him but his debts must be paid before the warrant can be executed and as you see hes in a manner his own detaining creditorleastways his friend outside ishe isnt likely to have his discharge till the felony business can be settled somehow or other the bench is then a most convenient place for people who ought to be in newgate said curtis but live and learn and the more one sees of the world the more curiouser it isaint it cried the turnkey wellnow you see that tall stout gentleman there walking up and down in front of the state house with the stick in his hand hes been here some years and is wery likely to stay a many years longer his creditors allows him three guineas a week for his kindness in remaining a prisoner in the bench what ejaculated curtis now more astonished than ever his creditors pay him for staying here its as true as youre alive sir was the reply and its easy enough to explain too that gentleman has got a good landed estate which is in the hands of his two or three principal creditors who manage it and receive all the rents for the purpose of paying themselves their claims upon him well nowif he went through the insolvents court all the creditors would come in for their share of the proceeds of the estate and so the two or three principals ones allow him three guineas a week to keep him here and prevent him going through the court its a deuced good thing for him i can tell you and hes as happy as a king he has his wifeleastways his lady with himwe call em all wives hereand hes got a batch of the loveliest and nicest children you ever see there they are sirthe little innocentsaplaying there in the mud just as if there wasnt no such place as prison at all and yet they was all born up in that room there in the state house with the green safe at the window and the flowerpots and who is that lame elderly man running about with newspapers in his hand enquired frank hes the newsman of the benchand a prisoner like the rest on em was the answer ah some years ago he was a rich man and in a flourishing way of business but he got into chancery and thats the same as getting into the bench cos one always leads to totherfor even to be a vinner in chancery one must pass at least a dozen years or so here fust that seems to be the rule as far as i can understand it well sirnow that lame man is obliged to turn newsman so you see theres a many rewerses in this world sir ah the worlds a queer place aint italmost as queer as the bench itself what the turnkeys notions of the world might be it is not easy to conceive but they were evidently somewhat dim and mistyinasmuch as he seemed impressed with the belief that the bench and the world were two distinct placesbut then the bench was his world though not a prisoner there himself and perhaps he established a distinction as existing between the world within and the world without alas manymany who were prisoners did the same who are those two ladies that have just come down to walk on the gravel there by the side of the racquetground enquired frank curtis much amused by the turnkeys gossip we call that gravelwalk the parade observed the official those ladies are mother and daughter and its the daughter thats a prisoner shes a devilish fine gal and the old woman stays with her to take care of her but she and the honourable mr pettifer are deuced thick together and the mother winks at it such things will happen in the best regilated familiesparticklerly in the bench where no one aint over and above partickler this isnt the shop for morals mr curtis all the young single women that comes here is sure to get corrupted but thats no lookout of mineand with this solacing conclusion the turnkey hit the lock of the door a tremendous blow with his key be the powerrs and is it afther staling a march upon me that ye are vociferated a wellknown voice at this moment and the captain stalked up to the gate looking quite fresh and blooming after a good nights rest and copious ablutions they had me down to take my likeness cried frank or else i dare say i should have slept on till now wellwell just make the round of the binch me boy exclaimed the captain and by that time the breakfast will be ready ive orthered ithot rolls and coffee with kidneys eggs cresses and such like thrifles and a walk will give us an appetite curtis accordingly took his friends arm and they set out on their limited ramble that building on your right frank said the captain is the state house where government prisoners and such like spalpeens are keptor ought to be but the prisoners for debt get hould of the rooms there and the divil himself cant turn em out but heres the tap and this is the first lion of the binch they entered a low and dirtylooking place in which there were several common tables of the roughest description and the surfaces of which were completely carved out into names initial letters men hanging and a variety of devicesthese ingenious and very elaborate specimens of woodengraving having been effected by penknives a tremendous fire burnt in the grate round which were assembled several of the poorer class of prisoners and the messengers eating their breakfastand at one of the tables just alluded to the newsman was sorting his papers as the captain and curtis were retracing their way from an inspection of the interior of the taproom the former stopped at the bar exclaiming to the man in attendance two half pints misther vernonand good mornin to ye you would not drink malt liquor so early will you asked frank with a look of astonishment at his companion be jasus and its for you to taste the porther me boy exclaimed the captain dont you remimber all i said yesterday in its praise comedhrink and mr curtis was accordingly compelled to swallow half a pint of porter though malt liquor before breakfast was somewhat repugnant to his taste the beer was veritably of firstrate quality and the captain was as proud to hear the young gentlemans eulogy on its merits as if he had brewed it himself now let us continue our ramble said heand away they went arminarm the two or three poor prisoners who were lounging at the door of the tap respectfully making room for them to pass entering upon the parade frank now for the first time obtained a full view of the front of the main buildinga long gloomy barracklike structure with half a dozen entranceways leading to the various staircases fixed to the ledges of many of the windows were safes in which the prisoners kept their provisions and in several instances these safes were covered with flowerpots containing sickly plants precisely in the centre of the building was the chapel and over the chapel was the infirmary most of the rooms on the groundfloor were fitted up as little shops the occupants being prisoners and the business carried on being entirely in the general line the lumps of butterwedges of cheesered herringsslices of baconmatchesballs of twinecandlesracquet ballssweetstuffloaves of breadrollssoapeggsand other articles of the nature usually sold in such magnificent marts of commerce were arranged so as to make the best possible show and carry out the spirit of competition which raged as fiercely in that little community as in the world without a peep through the window of one of those miniature shops showed the canisters of tea and the jars of tobacco and snuff standing orderly upon the shelves of three feet in length and behind a counter along which tom thumb could have walked in two strides stood the stout proprietor of the concern examining with rueful looks the wonderful increase of chalkmarks which the mornings sales had compelled him to make upon a slate against the honoured names of his customers now look this way me frind cried the captain as he forced frank to turn round towards the racquetcourts dye see nothing particular nothing but the high wall with the spikes on the top and the netting to prevent the balls from going over answered curtis therethere me boy vociferated oblunderbuss impatiently pointing in a particular direction now dye see any thing worth looking at welli see the pump there said frank vainly searching after a more interesting object be jasus and thats jist what i wanted ye to see exclaimed the captain its the dolphinpump me boythe finest pump in eurrropethe pride of the binchbut be the powerrs ye shall taste the wather and judge for yourself curtis protested that he would rather notthe captain was however resolute and a tumbler was borrowed from a prisoner who was smoking an early pipe at one of the groundfloor windows then the captain began to pump away like a madman and frank was compelled to imbibe a deep draught of the icecold water which would have been pronounced delicious by any one who did not admire alcoholic beverages much better than adams ale dont you mean to take a glass captain enquired frank be jasus and i know it of ould returned that gallant gentleman so theres no need for me to pass an opinion upon it besides its not to astonish my stomach with any unusual dhrink that id be afther frank but youre a young man and can stand wather better than me curtis did not consider the reasoning altogether conclusive he however refrained from farther argumentand the two gentlemen resumed their walk between the eastern extremity of the mainbuilding and that part of the wall which looked directly upon the borough was the marketplacean assemblage of miserable sheds where a butcher a fishmonger a greengrocer and a vender of coals carried on each his peculiar trafficthe said spirited traders being prisoners as well as the shopkeepers above alluded to at a stall in the centre of the market and at which vegetables fruit and fish were sold stood a tall thin weatherbeaten old woman resembling a gipsey in dress as well as in complexion and having an ancient bonnet perched most airily upon the top of her head this respectable female was denominated old nanny and was in such wise greeted by captain oblunderbuss who informed frank in a whisper that she was not a prisoner and in spite of competition had pretty well the monopoly of the market the fact is me boy he said she has the advantage of money those fellows in the sheds there set up in business with a floating capital of eighteenpence each and cant afford to give credit and a tradesman in the binch who cant give credit stands no more chance be jasus of getting custom than if he began with an empty shop the captain now proceeded to show his friend the public kitchen which was in the immediate vicinity of the market and thence they passed up the back of the main building oblunderbuss especially directing franks attention to that quarter which was denominated the poorside the poorsideyes in every public establishment in england is the line of demarcation drawn between the rich and the poorin the debtors prison as well as in the church of god oh what a disgraceful thing is poverty made in this country whythe contamination of newgate if borne by a man possessing a wellfilled purse will be overlooked in society while the rags that an unsullied character wears are a bana stigmaa reproach he has been in the workhouse or she has been on the parish are taunts as bitter in meaning and as keen in spirit as the phrase he has been in newgate or she has just come from the treadmill ayeand even amongst the lowest classes themselves it is a deeper stain to associate a name with the workhouse than to connect it with the felons gaol such is the dreadfuldemoralizing consequence of that example set by the upper classes whose ideas of mens excellence and worth are guided chiefly by the standard of the purse the poorsideand for whom is the poorside of debtors prisons instituted for those who go penniless to gaolthe best proof that they have profited nothing by the losses of their creditorsthe best evidence that their liabilities were legitimately contracted but the fashionable swindleryour manabouttownyour rouyour rake who gets into debt wherever he can and without the slightest intention of ever paying a single farthinghe drives down in his cab to the prisontreats the bailiff to wine upon the wayand takes with him into confinement all that remains to him of the plunder of duped tradesmen there to spend it in riotous living and in the best room which the best quarter of the gaol can afford if a debtors prison have a poorside it ought also to have a swnidlersside no word in the english language is used so frequently and so contemptuously as the monosyllable poor oh he is a poor devil is a far worse character to give of any one than to say at once he is dishonest from the latter sentence there is a hopeful appeal in the questionbut can he pay yeshe can if he chooses oh then if he can we will trust him and risk it but from the former sentence there is no appeal it is a judgment without qualificationa decision too positive and weighty to admit of a doubt the objectionwell he may be poor but he may also be honest is never heard the idea of poverty being honest whyin the estimation of an englishman poverty is a word expressing all that is bad to say that a man is poor is at once to sum up his character as every thing unprincipled and roguish such magic is there in the word that rich men and men welltodo in the world instantly button up their breeches pockets when they hear it applied to a person they seem to consider that a poor wretch can have no other possible object in view than to get the better of them poverty in their eyes is something that goes about preying upon the richsomething to be loathed and shunnedsomething that ought not to intrude itself into respectable places a man may just as well be leprous as be poor so undeniable are these truthsso universally recognised are these facts that designing individuals always endeavour to seem well off even if they be insolvent they dress well because they know the sovereign influence of a good coat they talk largelybecause they see how necessary it is to keep up appearances they toss about their last few guineas as the only means of baiting a hook to catch fresh dupes it is impossible that a man with fine clothes wellpolished boots elegant guardchain and lemon coloured glovesit is impossible that such a man can be poor oh notrust him with anything whywhat poor man would be perfumed as he isthe aristocratic odour of wealth surrounds him as with an atmosphere peculiar to the rich trust him by all meansbut that poorlooking devil who sneaks along the shady side of the waywho has a wife and halfadozen children at homeand who is struggling from morning to night to earn an honourable crustdont trust himhave nothing to do with himdont assist him with the loan of a single sixpenceon the contrary give him a thrust farther down into the mud if you canbecause he is undisguisedly poor such appear to be the rules of conduct in this enlightened and glorious country god help the poorfor poverty is a terrible crime in merry england the poorside of the kings bench struck frank curtis as being particularly miserableit quite gave him the horrors and no wonderfor the architecta knowing fellow was hehad so arranged the building that the windows of the poorside should look upon the dustbins and the conveniences yesa knowing fellow was that architect he understood what the poor are worth in this free and civilised landhe saw in a moment where they ought to be putand therefore he arranged for their use a number of dens where the atmosphere was certain to be one incessant pestilential odour and where he would have been sorryvery sorry to have placed the kennel of his favourite hound yeswell might frank curtis feel the horrorscallous and indifferent as the young man naturally wason beholding the poorside the groundfloor rooms were even at midday in a state of twilight the colossal wall being only a few feet distantthe windows were blackened with dirt and from the upper ones hung a few ragsthe miserable duds of the miserable miserable inmates halfstarved pale and emaciated womenthe wives or daughters of those poor prisonerswere loitering at the doorwayssome with children in their armschildren oh so wan and wastedso sickly and so deathlikethat it must have made their parents hearts bleed to feel how light they were and how faminestruck they seemed and yet those little starving children had their innocent winning ways as well as the offspring of the rich and they threw their skeleton arms around their mothers necksand their lips sent forth those infantile sounds so sweet to mothers earsbut still the little beings seemed to be pining rapidly away through actual want and in the prison atmosphere god help the poor we said ere now but oh with tearful eyes and beating heart do we exclaimgod help the children of the poor frank curtis and the captain having now completed their walk round the prison entered the parlour of the coffeehouse where an excellent breakfast awaited them and to which they did ample justice the repast being disposed of captain oblunderbuss took a temporary leave of frank curtis it being arranged that the gallant officer should proceed to baker street in order to induce the men in possession either by means of bribes or menaces to allow mrs curtis to remove as many valuables from the house as possible and this notable aim being achieved the captain was to pay his respects to sir christopher blunt frank curtis being now temporarily thrown upon his own resources for amusement strolled out upon the parade and was gazing at the racquetplayers when mr prout accosted him good morning sir have you taken a survey of the bench yet said the chancery prisoner i have been round the building and seen all thats worth seeing i believe replied curtis but the poorside appears to be a wretched place wretched cried prout in a bitter tone ah you may well make that observation sir but if my affairs do not end in a speedy settlement i shall have to move to that quarter myself how is that enquired frank do you not knowhave you not yet learned that you must pay even to have a room in this prisona place to which you do not come of your own accord said prout a shilling a week is the roomrent and he who cannot pay it must go over to the poorside this is english justice mr curtis you must pay to live in a prison it seems to me monstrously unfair unfair tis vilerascally cried the chancery prisoner but talking of the poorside puts me in mind of a strange story connected with that quarter of the bench and if you have nothing better to do for an hour or so and will step up to my room i shall have great pleasure interrupted curtis for to tell you the truth the time does hang rather heavy on my handsand till my friends the marquis of aldersgate and the prince of paris who is staying in london come over to see me i may just as well amuse myself with your story prout accordingly led the way to his room which was in the front of the building and commanded a view of the parade and racquetgrounds it was very plainly furnished but neat and clean and its owner informed curtis that he had a married daughter who visited him every day was very kind to him and superintended his little domestic concerns but i will not detain you longer than i can help sir observed prout and i can promise you that you are about to hear a true tale of deep interest i have thought of it so often and have so frequently repeated its details to myself in the solitude of this chamber that i am enabled to give you the whole story in a connected form although it was not in the same continuous manner that the vicissitudes i am about to relate became known to me alas tis a sadsad tale sir but i am afraid that bad as it is it still is not the worst that might be told of human nature frank curtis seated himself opposite to the old man who after a short pause commenced his narrative in the following words chapter cvii a tale of sorrow it was about thirty years ago that a poor but respectable and kindhearted tradesman of the name of craddock came up from plymouth to london to receive a hundred pounds which had fallen to him through the death of a relative of whom he had not heard for years until he received the lawyers letter announcing his decease and the legacy craddock was a linendraper in a very small way at plymouth and though industrious temperate and obliging he never had succeeded in doing any thing better than earning a mere living he was about fortyfive years of age at the time of which i am speaking and had long been married to a woman as generoussouled as himself they were childless and in spite of their poverty they often regretted that they had no offspring to become the object of their affection and to comfort them when old age should overtake them indeed it appears that they had seriously thought of adopting some poor persons child but circumstances of various kinds had opposed this plan and they at last ceased to converse upon itendeavouring to render themselves as happy as they could in each others society and happy for that matter they were too for the mutual attachment which linked their hearts together was firmly established and as they advanced in years they seemed to become so necessary to each other that when craddock received the lawyers letter summoning him to london it was with the greatest difficulty his wife would allow him to set out alone he however succeeded in making her understand that a hundred pounds did not constitute an independent fortunethat it was absolutely necessary to carry on the shopand that therefore she must remain at home to manage it accordingly the worthy dame tarried at plymouth and her husband came up to london by the stageat that period a journey of no inconsiderable importance it was the first time mr craddock had ever been in the metropolis but he did not stay a moment longer than his business absolutely compelled him which was four or five days the lawyer with whom he had to transact his little affair was a kind and conscientious manfor there are many good lawyers as well as bad onesand he hastened the business as much as possible accordingly mr craddock received his money in less than a week and he instantly went to the belle sauvage on ludgate hill to take his place home again by the coach there was only one insideseat vacant by the stage that was to start in the evening and craddock secured it he then returned to the little lodging where he had slept during his sojourn in london and which was somewhere in the neighbourhood of doctors commons having packed up his portmanteau he shouldered it and was wending his way to the belle sauvage when his attention was drawn to a little boy who was sitting on a doorstep in one of the narrow secluded streets in that district the child who was very neatly dressed and about two years old was crying bitterly craddock stopped and spoke kindly to him and though the boy was too young to give any explanation of the cause of his grief it was easy to divine that he had strayed from home or been lost by a negligent servant two or three other persons stopped likewise and some of the neighbours came out of their houses but the boy was unknown to them craddock tried to console him but the little fellow wept as if his heart would break by accident the parishbeadle passed that way and on learning what was the matter said oh the best thing i can do is to take the poor child to the workhousenow the mere name of a workhouse was terrible to the ears of the kindhearted craddock and obeying the impulse of the moment he exclaimed no no not while i have a crust to give him poor childwhy dont you take him home with you then demanded the beadle the parish will be very glad to be quit of such a bargain as a lost child promises to bebut i live at plymouth returned honest john craddocknever mind if you live at the devil so as you agree to take the child persisted the parochial authoritywell i have not the least objection on the contrary i shall be delighted to do so said craddock his eyes filling with tears as the poor boys grief became more heartrending i will give you my address and if you hear any enquiries made by the parents of the child you can let me knowvery good exclaimed the beadle as he received the card on which john craddocks name calling and abode were printed in bold type the worthy linendraper then took up the boy in his arms the beadle consenting to carry the portmanteau and in this manner they proceeded to the belle sauvage the kind looks soothing tone and fond caresses of craddock having the effect of somewhat diminishing the little fellows grief illustration the coach was just ready to start and craddock took his place with the child upon his knees the beadle renewed his promise to write in case he should hear any thing relative to the boys parents and the stage rolled out of the old inn yard it was eveningthe shops glared with light and the scene as well as the ride in the coach amused the boy so that his violent weeping ceasedbut frequent sobs agitated his little chest until at last he fell asleep in worthy john craddocks arms it was now for the first time that the linendraper had leisure to reflect upon the step which he had taken and it struck him that he had acted imprudently he was taking away the child from the city to which he most probably belonged and where he was alone likely to be found by his parentstaking him away to a far distant town but on the other hand he remembered the beadles declaration that the lost child must be conveyed to the workhouse and he likewise felt certain that should the little creatures parents make proper enquiries concerning their child the parochial authority would know what explanation to give craddock therefore came to the conclusion that he had performed a christian deed and an englishmans duty and having thus set all scruples at rest he began to reflect upon the pleasure which his wife would experience in receiving the foundling for the child was a most interesting onewith curly flaxen hair sparkling blue eyes and a sweet complexion and as he lay sleeping in craddocks arms and the lights of the shops in the outskirts of london which the coach was then traversing beamed through the window upon the boys countenance the worthy linendraper thought that he had never seen a face so truly cherublike but tears came afresh into the worthy mans eyesfor he reflected that an afflicted father and a distracted mother might at that moment be calling upon heaven to restore them their lost child and as he bent down and kissed its cool and firm cheeks on which the traces of weeping still remained he murmured to himself if thy parents never succeed in recovering thee my boy i will be as a father and i know that my wife will be as a mother to theethe other inside passengers admired the child greatly but when honest john craddock told them the story connected with his possession of the boy they merely hemd and coughed drily as if they thought him a very great fool for so burthening himself craddock understood what was passing in their minds and he only hugged the child closer to his bosom during the night the little fellow frequently awoke and cried for his papa and mamma and the good linendraper was indefatigable in his exertions to console and comfort himuttering all possible kind things and purchasing nice cakes for him at the wayside inns throughout the following day too craddock was compelled to persevere in this affectionate and conciliatory treatment which he however maintained with a good heart and as the long tedious journey of two hundred and sixteen miles drew towards a close and evening was again drawing on he had the satisfaction of observing that his little charge seemed to appreciateor at least to understand his attentions at last the coach entered the famous seaport and in a very short time craddock was set down at his own door the stage passing through the street in which he lived you may suppose that his wife was greatly astonished when she perceived the present that the worthy linendraper had brought her but she was not many moments before she took the child in her arms and covered it with kisses then how the kindhearted dame wept when craddock explained to her the manner in which he had become possessed of the boy and as he spoke she pressed the little being all the closer and all the more fondly to her bosom the social teatable was spread and the servantgirl was sent out to procure some cakes and other nice things for the boy and then how he was petted and made much ofand how happy the good couple seemed when their attentions and caresses were rewarded with smiles several days passed during which craddock received no intelligence from the beadle who had promised to write to him in case of enquiries being instituted respecting the lost childweeks elapsedand still no tidings the ideai had almost said the fearwhich the worthy couple entertained that they might be compelled to part with the child just as they were getting fond of it grew gradually fainter and fainter and at length when six months had passed and little alexander for so they called the boy had grown not only reconciled to his condition but appeared to have forgotten that it had ever been otherwiseby the time six months had passed i say mr and mrs craddock ceased to contemplate even the chance of being called upon to surrender their charge not but that those excellent people would have rejoiced in one sense to restore little alexander to the arms of his parents but in another sense they could not quench in their secret souls the fond hope that he might be left undisturbedly in their care thus time passed on craddocks business which had only required a little capital to give it an impetus exhibited every sign of improvement since the investment therein of the hundred pounds received in london and alexander throve apace i shall now take a leap of twenty years which brings us up to a date of only ten years ago and at that time great alterationsbut all for the betterhad taken place in the circumstances of the craddocks indeed they had retired from business having made a considerable fortune and were settled in a handsome dwelling at a short distance from plymouththeir native town craddock and his wife had however descended tolerably far into the vale of life sixtyfive winters having passed over their heads but in alexandernow a fine tall handsome young man of twentytwothey had a source of real comfort and happiness though acquainted with the circumstance which had led to his adoption by mr and mrs craddock and therefore knowing well that they were not his real parents his attachment to them was so greathis affection so sincereand his gratitude so boundless that he never once manifested any desire to quit them for the purpose of instituting enquiries relative to his birth his constant and unwearied endeavour was to show himself deserving of all they had done for himthe tender care they had taken of him in his infancythe excellent education they had given him in his boyhoodand the affectionate consideration with which they treated him now that he was grown to mans estate for in all respects did they regard him as their son and in this light was he looked upon by their friends and dependants in fact nothing was wanting to complete the happiness of alexander craddock he had become enamoured of a beautiful girl the orphan daughter of an officer in the navy and who resided at plymouth with an old aunt lucy middleton had no fortune but she possessed the invaluable treasures of amiability of dispositiona sweet tempera kind heartand those sterling qualities which fitted her for domesticity and gave promise that she would prove an admirable housewife alexander loved her and was loved in return and his adopted parents gave their consent to the match accordingly one fine spring morning when the heavens appeared as auspicious as the prospects of the youthful pair the hands of alexander craddock and lucy middleton were united and after a six weeks tour in wales they returned to plymouth to take possession of a commodious and handsome dwelling which the adopted father of the young man had furnished during their absence for their reception a year passed away at the expiration of which lucy presented her husband with a lovely boy but almost at the same time the family experienced a severe loss in the death of old mr craddock who was carried off in a moment by the lightningstroke of apoplexy alexander was dreadfully grieved at this shocking occurrencea feeling in which his excellent young wife largely shared but they were compelled to restrain their sorrow as much as possible in order to console the bereaved widow mrs craddock was however unable to bear up against this heavy affliction the suddenness of its arrival and the awful manner in which her husband fell down dead at her feet when as it were in the midst of a state of perfect health gave her a shock which she never recovered she was spiritbroken and could not rally in spite of the tender devotion and unwearied attentions shown her by alexander and lucy as well as by the aunt of the latter thus was it that in less than six weeks from the sudden demise of mr craddock his affectionate relict was consigned to the same tomb which held his remains when alexander had so far recovered himself after experiencing these cruel inroads upon his happiness as to investigate the affairs of his late adopted parents he found that he was left sole heir to the handsome fortune acquired by their honest industry but though the will and other papers were strictly correct and accurate in all points he found that certain circumstances connected with his inheritance would compel him to repair to london and probably retain him in the capital for some weeks he was not sorry at the idea of quitting plymouth for a time his spirits having been deeply affected by the deaths of his adopted parents and he found lucy and her aunt who now lived altogether with them perfectly agreeable to shift their place of abode it was accordingly about eight years ago that this family arrived in london and took a house in a genteel but quiet neighbourhood alexander found his income chiefly derived from funded property to be seven hundred ayear and on this he knew that he could live well but not extravagantly a natural curiositywhich was the more lively now that he had lost his adopted parentsprompted him to make certain enquiries in the district of doctors commons with the hope of solving the mystery of his birth the only intelligence he gleaned was that the beadle who figured in the opening of the tale had been dead just twentytwo years and as alexander was now twentyfour he could calculate pretty accurately that the parochial authority alluded to must have been carried off by the hand of the destroyer within a few weeks if not within even a very few days from the date when he himself as a young child had fallen into the charge of craddock beyond this fact alexander could ascertain nothing at all calculated to assist in rolling away the veil of mystery which covered his parentage none of the inhabitants in the street where craddock had found him sitting on the doorstep remembered any thing of the loss of a child at the period namedno tradition of the fact remained alexander felt somewhat disappointed with these unsuccessful results of his enquiries but he possessed too many elements of happinesstoo many substantial accessories to comfort and mental tranquillityto remain long affected or dispirited by the apparent permanence of that mystery which enveloped his birth alexander was naturally of an active disposition and abhorred a life of idleness he had been married two years and was the father of two children and contemplating the probability of having a numerous offspring he felt anxious to augment his worldly possessions my adopted father he would reason with himself carried on business until a late period of his life and was happy in the occupation which it afforded him why should not i embark in some eligible and safe undertaking which will give me a few hours employment every day and yield a profit at the same time the subject of his musings was communicated to his amiable wife and her aunt and those ladies joyfully encouraged a spirit so praiseworthy and so indicative of steadiness and prudence the matter had been under discussion one morning at the breakfasttable when the daily newspaper was brought in and an announcement worded somewhat in this way met alexanders eyeseligible investmentany gentleman having a few thousand pounds at his immediate disposal and desirous to occupy a few leisure hours each day in a highly respectable and advantageous manner is requested to apply to edward walkden solicitor bush lane cannon streetalexander read this advertisement aloud and the ladies agreed with him that the nature of it was tempting enough to prompt farther enquiry accordingly the young man proceeded in the course of the morning to the address indicated and found mr walkdens establishment to be large and having every appearance of respectability as well as solidity halfadozen clerks were busily employed in the front office and the shelves were covered with japanned tin cases containing the papers of the most substantial clients upon being introduced into the lawyers private office alexander found himself in the presence of a tall man whose years were upwards of sixty and whose countenance once handsome wore an expression of mingled mournfulness and severity he was attired in a plain suit of black his manners were cold and reserved but there was a businesslike air about him and his office which augmented the good opinion already entertained by alexander in respect to the lawyer and his establishment walkden was evidently a man of very few words and therefore when alexander had explained the object of his visit the information he sought was speedily given i have a client said the lawyer who has taken out a patent for a particular purpose and he requires five or six thousand pounds to work it effectually the person advancing the amount will become an equal partner with the patentee and will find a few hours of pleasant and agreeable occupation daily in superintending the commercial branch of the concern while the patentee directs the manufacture of the article there are the papers sir take them with you and read them at your leisure walkden handed the young man a bundle of documents tied round with red tape and then bowed him out of the office on his return home alexander examined the papers and was highly delighted with the prospect which they opened to him he felt convinced that an immense fortune was to be made the thing was as clear as daylight the patentee possessed the secret of effecting vast improvements in the manufacture of broadcloths which he undertook to produce not only of a superior quality but likewise at a very reduced price the calculations showed that large returns were certain to follow a comparatively small outlay and that the business might be extended to a wonderful degree in proportion to the capital advanced to work upon in a word the whole affair was of the most roseate hue alexander his wife and her aunt were in raptures at the brilliant prospect thus fortunately opened to their contemplation and it was resolved that he should lose no time in securing a share in so excellent an undertaking accordingly on the following morning he returned to mr walkden who received him with cold politeness and requested his speedy decision in the matteras so promising a business had already attracted the notice of several capitalists who were eager and willing to embark their fundsand you will guarantee the respectability of your client sir enquired alexanderi have been established in this profession for upwards of thirty years young man said the lawyer almost sternly and never have i allowed my office to be made the means of carrying out an illegitimate transaction my client mr scudimore is a man of integrity and honour and whatever he promises that will he performin this case mr walkden observed alexander craddock the sooner i have an interview with mr scudimore the betterthe lawyer made no farther observation but furnished his visitor with the address of the patentee and alexander accordingly repaired to mr scudimores dwelling which was situated somewhere near finsbury square mr scudimore was an elderly personvery well dressedplausible in his discourse and overpolite in his manners in fact he seemed to be the very reverse of his solicitor in respect to disposition for he received alexander as if he had known him all his life and the young man found himself sitting at lunch and on the best possible terms with his new friend almost before he had time to look round him then if the affair which thus brought them together had looked well upon paper it assumed so glorious an aspect when described in the glowing language of mr scudimore that alexander craddock generous frank and confiding as he naturally was came to a complete understanding with the patentee ere he took his departure on the following day scudimore dined at his house and the ladies were quite charmed with their new acquaintance matters progressed rapidly through the businesslike attention which walkden devoted to the affair and in less than a fortnight the deeds of partnership between alexander craddock and james scudimore were duly signed at the lawyers office in bush lane cannon street immediately afterwards alexander sold out six thousand pounds which he paid into a bank to the joint account of craddock and scudimore and in the course of a few days the latter gentleman took his departure for a manufacturing town where he was to hire premises and establish a factory without delay alexander remaining in london to prepare a warehouse to receive the goods for some months all appeared to go on to the complete satisfaction of both parties scudimore wrote up the most pleasing accounts from the country and at last he informed his young partner that the factory was in perfect readiness to commence operations it however appeared that more money was required and alexander after an interview with walkden threw a farther sum of four thousand pounds into the business all the funds being completely at the disposal of scudimore but almost immediately after the advance of this second sum the letters from the provincial town ceased several weeks passed away no communications were received from scudimoreand mr walkden appeared to be as astonished as alexander himself a visit to the banker created a vague suspicion in the mind of the young man that all was not rightfor though scudimore had drawn out the first amount by means of a number of successive cheques he had received the whole of the second advance on one draught and almost immediately after it had been paid in a little farther enquiry convinced alexander that walkden had presented all the cheques for payment at the bank without however losing a moment by calling on the lawyer for an explanation alexander proceeded posthaste to the provincial town where he expected to find scudimore and there all his fears were speedily confirmed no premises had been hired by any such personno factory established in such a name but mr scudimore had resided at an hotel in the place for several months and had taken his departure no one knew whither at a date which on calculation alexander found to be precisely four days after he had paid the second sum into the bankers hands no doubt now remained in his mind that he was the dupe of a designing villain and he was convinced that walkden was an accomplice to london he returned without delay and on his arrival he repaired direct to the lawyers office that professional gentleman received him with his usual cold and reserved politeness affecting not even to notice the excitement under which the young man was labouring your friend mr scudimore sir is a villain exclaimed alexandersuch language is intolerable in my office sir said walkden in his chilling phlegmatic mannerintolerable or not it is the only language i can use under such circumstances cried the young man scudimore has absconded with the whole sum of ten thousand pounds which i advanced in this swindling concern and it was through you and your representations sir that i have been thus cruelly deceived and basely plunderedsoftly mr craddock if you please observed the lawyer because your language conveys an imputation which i repel with scorn and contempt my character is too well established to be injured by the calumny of an obscure stranger you requested me to give you mr scudimores address in the first instance i did so and it was with him that you made all your arrangements you then both came to me informed me that every thing was settled between you and employed me professionally to draw up certain deedsbut you gave me the highest character of your friend scudimore ejaculated alexanderi spoke of him as i had always found him up to that hour when you questioned me said walkden but i never pretended to possess the power of prophesying that he would continue honest up to the day of his deathcontemptible vile sophistry exclaimed alexander his cheeks glowing with indignation it is a base conspiracy to plunder me and i will unmask youand supposing that i have incurred a chance of losing as much as yourself through this mr scudimore said the lawyer without losing his temper but with a smile of malignant triumph on his lipsyou lose by him cried alexander in a tone of bitter irony you knew him too well to trust himat all events i may have somewhat calculated upon your joint responsibility observed walkden fixing his cold grey eyes upon the young man whom these ominous words startledwhat do you mean he demanded his heart sinking within himi mean answered walkden that i have discounted your acceptances to the amount of eight thousand pounds that i have passed away those bills of exchange in the course of business that when they fall due shortly i shall be unable to take them up and that the holder will therefore look to you for the payment of themalexander sank speechless and powerless into a seat as the whole scheme of villainy was thus fully developed to his horrified contemplationas you were in partnership and all the deeds establishing that partnership were drawn up in the regular way and strictly binding scudimore had not only a right to sign bills in your joint name proceeded the lawyer but you cannot for an instant dispute your liability in respect to themis it possible gasped alexander that i can have been so foolish and you so wicked oh my poor wifemy beloved children what will become of you now that i am ruined by my own madness and this awful combination of villainiesmr craddock said walkden drawing himself up to his full height while his iron features remained implacable and rigid you must not allow your tongue a license in respect to me again i tell you that my character is too well established and my reputation too substantially good to be injured by false calumnies indeed i am not at all clear that i have not some grounds to complain of conspiracy and villainy for it certainly looks suspiciousmost suspicious that your partner should obtain from me advances to the amount of eight thousand pounds and then abscond you would not come out of court with very clean hands mr craddock i can tell youwretch ejaculated the unhappy young man now goaded to desperation how dare you hint at any connivance on my part with the scoundrelism of your own friendyou who presented at the bank all the drafts for the money which i was insane enough to lodge therei certainly received several sums on behalf of mr scudimore to whom i duly remitted them said the lawyer still in that cold reserved tone which so much aggravated the rage of the ruined craddock but we will now put an end to this interview sir he added as my time is preciousyes i will leave you treacherous miscreant that you are exclaimed alexander and rushing into the clerks office he vociferated with mad excitement gentlemen if you wish to behold the greatest villian on the face of the earth go and look at your masterhe then hurried away the victim of a mingled rage and grief which it would be impossible to describe but how could he face his dear wifeher affectionate aunthis muchloved children ruinedtotally ruined how awfully do these words sound upon the ears a man when alone in the world and with none dependent on him or his exertions may murmur those words to himself with comparative calmness but the individual who has a wife and children looking to him for every necessary of existenceah he indeed feels his heart seared as with redhot iron when his lips expressing the conviction which circumstances force on his startled mind frame the frightful words ruinedtotally ruined miss middleton the aunt and lucy were already acquainted with the unpleasant nature of the suspicions which scudimores protracted silence had created in the mind of alexander and they were likewise aware of the object of his journey into the country but they had yet to learn the fatal result of the enquiries which he had instituted and it was still left for him to break to them the particulars of his interview with walkden on his return home his anxiety and mental suffering were betrayed by his countenancefor he was unskilled in the schools of duplicity and knew not how to conceal a lacerated heart beneath a tranquil exterior the ladies pressed him with questions they saw that something dreadful had occurredand they implored him not to keep them in suspense he told them alltold them how scudimore had plundered him of ten thousand poundshow he remained liable to walkden for eight thousand moreand how the payment of this imminent liability would sweep away the whole of his fortune leaving him a ruined man then in that hour of bitter trial he found how dear is woman as a ministering angel and having been comparatively soothed and tranquillised by the consolatory language of his lucy and miss middleton he proceeded to the office of his own solicitor whom he resolved to consult relative to the posture of his affairs the moment he had left the house lucy and miss middleton held a hasty council together do you think it would be imprudent or improper my dear aunt asked the young wife if i were to call upon this mr walkden and implore him not to press the payment of a debt which will deprive alexander of all the resources that he might render available for the purpose of retrieving himselfon the contrary i approve of the step was the reply alexander says that mr walkden was stern and severe but then alexander himself may have been hasty and indignant after all this mr walkden has perhaps been duped as well as your husband by scudimorei fear that this is not the case said lucy i am impressed with the conviction that the lawyer and scudimore were in league together nevertheless as we are entirely at walkdens mercy it would be unwise to irritate but prudent to conciliate himgo my dear child exclaimed the aunt and may you succeed in softening the heart of this man who holds your dear husband in his iron grasplucy accordingly attired herself in a simple and modest manner and proceeded to the office of mr walkden who happening to be disengaged at the time immediately received her i have called sir began lucy whose courage almost failed her when she found herself in the presence of a man of such stern cold and indeed forbidding aspectfor this was the first time she had ever seen himi have called sir she repeated on behalf of my husband whose ruin is certain unless you show him some degree of mercymr craddock behaved in a manner the most insulting and dared to utter suspicions the must derogatory to my character even in the presence of my clerks observed walkden in a tone so chilling that it seemed as if the breath which wafted those words to the young wifes ears passed over the ice of the polesbut surely sir urged lucy the tears trickling down her cheeks you will make some allowances for the excited feelings of a young man just entering the world as it were and so cruelly struck on its very threshold by the hand of misfortune at least sir if not for his sake i implore you for that of his innocent children to be lenient and mercifullaw forms and ceremonies are not influenced by such considerations madam said mr walkden at the same time i have no objection to search the commentaries and if i there find leniency recommended in filing a declaration or mercy enjoined in signing judgment i have not the slightest objection to instruct my commonlaw clerk accordinglylucy stared at the attorney in wild bewilderment and uncertainty as he thus delivered himself in a measured tone of such frigidity that it seemed as if an automaton of ice were speaking but at length she murmured may i then hope sir that you will not press for the payment of this heavy debt when the bills become duewalkden fixed his eyes upon the lovely and tearful countenance which was upturned so imploringly towards him and at the instant he thought within himself that he had never before seen a female face of such surpassing beauty then his glance slowly and deliberately wandered from the faultless features to the contours of the wellformed bust developed even by the plaits of the thick shawl which lucy wore and thence his survey was continued until his contemplation had embraced the wasplike waist and the flowing outlines of a symmetrical form terminating in feet and ankles ravishingly modelledyou are doubtless much attached to your husband madam he said his tone becoming the least thing more tenderor rather losing one small degree of its cold severityattached to him sir exclaimed lucy perfectly astonished at the question i lovei worship him he is the best of husbands and the best of fathersthen you would make any sacrifice to restore him to peace of mind said walkden his voice becoming more tender still and his demeanour gradually unbending from its stiff formalityoh yes cried the artless lucy any sacrifice would i make to see my alexander happy as he was wont to beany sacrifice repeated the lawyer now positively allowing his features to relax into a faint and significant smile while his voice was lowered and changed into a tone of soft familiarity consider what you sayany sacrifice well then on that conditionand he took her handa light broke instantaneously upon the mind of lucy and snatching back her hand as if from the maw of a wild beast she started from her seat uttered a cry of indignation and abhorrence and disappeared from the office before the baffled and disconcerted lawyer had time to make an effort to detain her lucys heart was still swelling with mingled resentment and anguish when she reached her home and alexander who returned at the same time saw in an instant that she was a prey to no ordinary emotions throwing herself into her husbands arms lucy burst into tearsher pentup feelings no longer obeying the control of that restraint which she sought to impose upon them then by dint of questioning alexander gleaned enough to convince him that his beloved wife had been flagrantly insulted by the villain who had already heaped such grievous wrongs upon his head maddened by this fresh injury alexander was about to rush from the house and inflict some dreadful chastisement upon the coldblooded monster walkden when his wife and her aunt threw themselves at his feet and implored him with tears and impassioned entreaties not to aggravate the perils and embarrassments of his position by involving himself in a quarrel with their enemy alexander was moved by the prayers of those whom he loved and he faithfully promised them not to suffer his indignant feelings to master his prudence when calmness and composure were somewhat restored he proceeded to explain the result of the visit which he had just paid to his own solicitor that gentleman had said to him it is as clear as daylight that you are robbed by walkden and scudimore conjointly but i really do not think that you could prove a conspiracy in a criminal court i should however decidedly advise you to resist the payment of the bills and as walkden is tolerably sure to push the matter on to trial the verdict of a jury in the civil case will enable us to judge how far we may hope to punish the scoundrel attorney in another manner alexander had accordingly placed himself entirely in his solicitors hands and there rested the business for the present but a serious change took place in the disposition and habits of alexander craddock smarting under the wrongs which he had received he grew restless and unsettledexperienced less delight than he was wont to feel in the society of his wife and childrenshowed signs of irritability and an impatience of the slightest contradiction however trivialand remained longer over his wine after dinner lucy beheld all this and wept in secret but when with alexander she redoubled her attentions and sought every possible opportunity of proving her devotion she implored him to give up the house they then occupied and adopt a more economical mode of life but his answers were at first evasivethen impatientand at last so sharp and angry that she was compelled though with reluctance to abandon the topic at least for the present to add to lucys grief her aunt who had so long fulfilled towards her the duties of a mother was attacked with sudden indisposition which increased with alarming rapidity and carried her off in the course of a few days alexander manifested far less sorrow than lucy had expected him to have shown and this proof of an augmenting callousness on his part pierced the heart of the amiable young lady to the very quick but scarcely had the remains of miss middleton been consigned to the tomb when a fresh misfortune occurred to increase the irritability of alexander the bills for eight thousand pounds fell due and were dishonoured by him in accordance with the advice of his solicitor he was immediately after arrested and as he had resolved to defend the action he paid into court the whole sum in dispute a proceeding whereby he could alone save himself from remaining in prison until the trial he had however gone through the ordeal of a spunginghouse and he considered himself disgraced the irritability of his temper increasedhe daily grew more attached to the bottleand his affections towards his wife and children were evidently blunted oh how ramified and vast are the evil effects of the villainy of one man towards anotherstriking not only the individual victim but rebounding and reacting on his wife his children and his friends lucy again revived the expression of her wish that a cheaper dwelling should be taken and a more economical style of living adopted but alexander would not listen to the proposal he declared his certainty of gaining the suit and of recovering his money from the courta result he said which would enable him to employ his funds in some legitimate commercial enterprise on this subject he spoke so confidently that lucy entertained the most sanguine hopes of beholding happiness restored beneath a roof where naught save happiness had once prevailed and it was but with little apprehension that she marked the arrival of the day fixed for the trial the most able counsel had been retained on both sides and the cause excited immense interest walkden had been established for years and bore an excellent character indeed none of his friends or clients could for a moment believe that he was an accomplice of the villain scudimore the whole question as presented to the cognizance of the tribunal was whether mr walkden had given value for the bills and was a bona fide holder of securities which he had legitimately and honourably discounted in the course of business the evidence he adduced to establish these points was certainly of a nature likely to prove most convincing to a jury though alexander knew full well that walkden had suborned the grossest perjury on the part of his clerks and the other persons whom he put forward as witnesses nevertheless the verdict was in walkdens favour and alexander returned home a prey to the liveliest grief and the most bitter resentment lucy did all that womans goodness and ingenuity could suggest to console him but the excitement of his feelings gained upon him with such overwhelming violence and rapidity that he grew delirious and a brainfever supervened the best medical advice was procured for him by the almost heartbroken lucy but weeks and weeks passed away without enabling the physicians to pronounce him beyond the reach of danger during that period he had many lucid intervals on which occasions he recognised his wife and childrenembraced them tenderlywept over themimplored heaven to bless themand then in the bitterness of overwhelming reminiscences desired them to look upon him as one who was deadhis excitement relapsing into delirium again poor lucy seldom was it that she reposed her aching head upon a pillow throughout the period of her beloved husbands illnessand never until completely crushed with the fatigue of long vigils and the burthen of a grief beneath which she herself was sinking at lengthjust as her pecuniary resources began to fail and the want of funds excited alarms which augmented her afflictionsalexanders malady took a sudden turn which filled her mind with the most joyous hope and when the delirium had altogether passed away his manner was so kind and gentlehis language so endearing and affectionateand his temper so entirely devoid of irritability that lucys heart became elate with the most cheering aspirations and delightful visions alexander spoke of his misfortunes with calmness and resignation and said our property is all swept away dearest but i am young and shall soon be strong and active again and then i will work to obtain a livelihood for us all and who knows my beloved lucy but that the bread of honest though perhaps severe toil may not prove the sweetest we shall have ever eatenthen when his wife heard him discourse in this manner she would throw herself into his arms and thank himyes thank him fervently for becoming a consoler in his turn the fond pair had been conversing in this style one afternoonthe first day on which alexander was enabled to walk down stairs to the parlour without assistanceand their children were playing in a corner of the apartment when the door was suddenly and violently opened and two or three coarselooking fellows unceremoniously made their appearance their mission was soon explained the money paid into court had only just covered the amount of the bills of exchange which had formed the ground of action and alexander was now arrested by walkden for the costs which had been taxed at a hundred and odd pounds the unfortunate young couple had not the money and lucy had already made away with their plate jewellery and other valuables in order to provide her husband with every comfort and luxury in his illness the furniture was worth more than the amount of the costs but arrears of rent were due to the landlord lucy implored the bailiffs with tears in her eyes not to remove alexander for a few days when he might have recovered the shock of this new and unforeseen blow but they were inexorable intimating pretty plainly that they were instructed to show no leniency of any kind she however by dint of entreatiesactually going down upon her knees to the officerssucceeded in inducing them to wait while she repaired to his own solicitor but this gentleman was unable to assist her to the amount she required he nevertheless manifested the kindest and most respectful sympathy towards her giving her a few guineas for immediate necessities and promising to incur the expense of the measures necessary to enable her husband to remove next day from a lockup house to the kings bench it was some consolation to the almost heartbroken young lady to find that alexander possessed at least one friend in the world but even this faint and poor gleam of solace vanished and gave way to the keenest apprehensions when on her return she found her husband a prey to all that fearful excitement which had proved the forerunner of his late dangerous malady what was to be done there seemed but one alternative and this she was determined in her affectionate solicitude and zeal to adopt without the knowledge of alexander indeed he scarcely appeared to be aware of what was going on but raved talked wildly and menaced and wept by turns in the presence of the officers who surrounded him away sped lucy to bush lane and a second time did she enter the establishment of that individual who had brought such rapidsuch signalsuch unredeemable ruin on the heads of a once happy family walkden received her in his private office and coldly desired her to be seated a smile of infernal triumph relaxing his stern and usually rigid features while his eyes scanned the wasted but still touchingly beautiful and deeply interesting countenance of that afflicted young lady lucy was for some minutes so overcome by the intensity of her feelings that she was unable to utter a word and when she did speak it was a mere gasping forth of disjointed sentences broken by frequent sobs of convulsing agony the lawyer bent over her like satan whispering to a desperate creature the terms on which wealth and power might be purchasedbent over that crushed muchenduring and amiable young wife and murmured in her ears his terms of mercy towards her husband she rose and looked at him in amazement and horror was he a human being or a veritable fiend his cold grey eyes sank not beneath the reproachful and indignant glance of that outraged lady and a smile of demoniac triumph again played upon his lip doubtless he thought that her anger was only momentary and that the sternness of necessity would force her to a compliance with his will but he knew not the mind of lucy villain monster she exclaimed has your infamy no bounds and she fled from the presence of the coldblooded scoundrel as if the atmosphere which he breathed were fraught with the plague with what a heavy heart did she return homethat home from which her husband must now be dragged immediately and before her eyesa home which perhaps would not long remain so for herself and children but suddenly and as if by divine inspiration she remembered that all her courage was now required to enable her to bear up against her afflictions for the sake of alexanderfor the sake of her offspringand it is astonishing how in the midst of the deepest sorrows woman can ofttimes display an energy of which the stronger sex is altogether incapable and so it now was with lucy craddock she even succeeded in comforting her husband and soothing his excitement by reminding him that the more he appeared to be crushed the greater would be the delight of his savage and unrelenting enemy this species of remonstrance so kindlyso gently administered had the desired effect and alexander animated with a spirit of endurance and fortified by the example of his admirable wife rose if possible superior to his misfortunes and proceeded with a feeling of proud resignation to the lockuphouse thence on the ensuing day he was removed to the kings bench and it was here that i first formed his acquaintance when he entered the prison six years ago immediately after his arrival his spirits gave way rapidly and it was necessary for his wife to take up her abode with him altogether she accordingly disposed of the furniture in their house paid the landlord and the few other small creditors and brought her children over to the small cheerless chamber in which her husband was lying on a bed of sickness thus was this once happy familylike so many many others reduced from a state of comfort and even affluence to poverty and a prisonroom heaven only knows what miserywhat privations they had undergone when it was first whispered to me by a charwoman that the craddocks seemed to be in great distress i was then a little better off than i am now and i immediately repaired to their room inventing some excuse for my intrusion oh what a scene of destitutionwhat a heartrending spectacle met my eyes the furniture which the craddocks had hired had been all removed away in consequence of their inability to pay for its use alexander pale and emaciated was sitting upon a trunk the two children thin and wasted were crying for food and the poor heartrent lucy was looking over a few things in a hatbox evidently with a view to select the most likely articles to be received by the pawnbrokerwhile her scalding tears fell fast upon her hands as she turned over the only relics left of a wardrobe once extensive and elegant it went to my very soul to contemplate that scene i shall not pause to explain all the particulars which rendered me intimate with the craddocks suffice it to say that they accepted my assistance and that in a few hours their chamber once again wore an aspect of such comfort as the restitution of the furniture and a well supplied table could possibly afford in a prison i did not learn their history immediatelynor all its details at once portions of it were communicated by degreessome of the particulars oozed out incidentallyand the feelings and sentiments experienced by the sufferers in the various phases of their eventful tale transpired from time to timeuntil at length i gleaned all those facts which i have now related to you but by far the most terrible portion of the history of the craddocks is yet to come prout paused for a few moments and then enquired of frank curtis if he were wearied of the narrative the young gentleman assured him that so far from being tired of the story he was deeply interested in its progress whereupon the chancery prisoner proceeded in the following manner footnote o woman in our hours of ease uncertain coy and hard to please and variable as the shade by the light quivering aspen made when pain and anguish wring the brow a ministering angel thou walter scott and such is womans lovethe secret power that turns the darkest to the brightest hour that smothes the wrinkles care has learned to plough and wipes the trace of anguish from

chapter cviii conclusion of the tale of sorrow although i was enabled to administer temporary assistance to this unfortunate and persecuted family and under the delicate guise of a loan of money gave them the wherewith to make themselves comparatively comfortable it was nevertheless necessary for alexander to resolve upon some decisive step to remain in prison was to bury his talents in a manner so as to render them completely unavailableto think of liquidating the enormous burthen of debt which lay upon his shoulders was ridiculousand to move the stony heart of walkden was a hopeless idea the only alternative was the insolvents court good food medical attendance and the altered appearance of his wife and children who had all improved greatly restored alexander to some degree of health and spirits and he soon began to discuss with me and lucy his present position and plans for the future the lawyer who had enabled him to pass over to the bench returned to town at this precise period after some weeks absence and he not only agreed to provide the funds to take alexander through the insolvents court but also promised to give him employment as a clerk on his release thus was it that this good man infused hope into the bosoms of the craddocks and the necessary steps were adopted to effect the emancipation of the prisoner but scarcely were the initiatory proceedings set on foot when intelligence was received to the effect that walkden was resolved to oppose alexanders discharge by all the means that were within his power this intimation which reached the prison through a private channel aroused alexanders fury against the man who so unrelentingly persecuted him and it required all the attentions of his amiable wife and all the manifestations of friendship which i was enabled to offer to restore him to comparative tranquillity illustration well the day fixed for his examination at the insolvents court arrived and alexander proceeded thither in the usual charge of a tipstaff his case was called on at an early stage of the days business and he found a formidable array of counsel employed against him i shall not pause to dwell upon all the details of the proceeding suffice it to say that walkden was placed in the witnessbox and being examined by the barristers whom he had feed made the entire case look so fearfully black against alexander craddock that he was remanded to gaol for twelve months his discharge to take place at the expiration of that period fearful was the state of excitement in which he returned to the bench and in the course of a few hours he was delirious it was frightful to hear his ravings in which the name of walkden was uppermost and associated with the bitterest imprecations and menaces poor lucy i thought her heart would break as she sate watching by her husbands bed but she was rewarded to some extent for her vigils and her sorrow when on the return of his senses he recognised her before he even knew his own children much less mehis humble friendand manifested his purest love for her in the most impassioned language and with the tenderest embraces but though the delirium left him and returned no more he soon fell into a deep and brooding melancholy from which it was scarcely possible to arouse him he fancied himself dishonouredpermanently dishonoured by the sentence passed upon him by the insolvents court and though the friendly lawyer and myself as well as lucy endeavoured to reason with him against the beliefpointing out every circumstance calculated to prove that he was a victim and not a culprithe took the matter so to heart that it was evident his spirit was broken my own resources began to fall off at this period and i was unable to assist the craddocks as much as i could wish moreover alexander and lucy both felt averse to remain dependant upon me and the friendly lawyer had proved so generous that they were naturally delicate in applying to him lucy accordingly made up her mind how to act she proposed that they should remove over to the poorside and receive the county money they would thus obtain a room rent free and a few shillings aweek to purchase bread alexanders pride struggled against this project but he yielded at last to the entreaties and representations of his excellent wife who assured him that she felt no shame in showing that she was poor and that the only real disgrace lay in dishonesty wherefore then should we contract any debts which we cannot pay she enquired and if we continue to live in this part of the prison we must keep up certain appearances which we have not the means to doalexander succumbed i say to this reasoning and to the poorside they accordingly removed i never shall forget the day when this change took place lucy had made the new chamber look as neat at possible and she endeavoured to maintain a smiling exterior as she arranged the little furniture and the few things of their own which were left to them but every now and then she glanced anxiously towards her husband who sat in a musingor rather an apathetic mannerwatching her proceedings and i observed that a tear frequently started to her eye and that every now and then she caught up her children and pressed them passionately to her bosom i insisted upon providing dinner on that day and i did all i could not only to make this poor family as comfortable as possible but also to raise alexanders spirits but if he smiled it was so faintly or sickly that my heart sank within me as if he had been my own son a few weeks passed away and i observed that lucy managed to keep the family pretty comfortably they had no lack of plain and humble foodand the children were always neat and clean whenever i called at their room i found lucy busy in some way or anothereither washing or mending the clothes or ironing out her husbands linen or else plying the needle at work which though i know little of such matters did not seem to me to have any reference to the family wardrobe at all one night i could not sleep and got up to take a walk round the prison it was between twelve and one and as i passed round by the poorside i chanced to look up at the window of the craddocks room to my surprise i observed a light burning and the truth flashed upon me poor lucy was sitting up to workto waste her youth her health and her spirits over the needle that she might obtain the means to purchase comforts for her husband and children the conviction went to my very heart like a pang and i thought how bitter is often the mission of a good and virtuous woman in this world i remember that i had no inclination to retire to rest again that night and i kept walkingwalking round the prison impelled by some invincible influence thus to wander about the gloomy place as if to watch how long the feeble light would be burning in that one room it was nearly four oclock when that light was extinguished and i heaved a sigh as i murmured to myself the name of poor lucy craddock when day came and i was enabled to call upon alexander after breakfast i examined the young wife and mother with more attention than usual and it then struck me that she was visibly wasting away her health was evidently declining and her spirits were entirely forced she was gay and lively as ever but that gaiety and liveliness were assumed not realartificial not naturalthe veil which an excellent and amiable womana most affectionate wife and the best of mothersput on to cover the secret of her breaking heart three mouths of the year for which alexander had been remanded passed away and lucy beheld her children drooping and pining through want of proper air and exercise this discovery was a new affliction she would not permit the little things to play about along with the ragged dirty offspring of the other prisoners on the poorside and she was unable to spare the time to take them out herself i understood the struggle that was passing in her mind if she devoted an hour or two each day to them she must give up some of the work which as i found out she had obtained from a warehouse in the borough and by so doing their comforts and those of her husband would be abridged on the other hand she could not see those poor innocents confined to a close room and pining for fresh air she accordingly resolved to take them out for a certain period each day and to steal another hour or two from her repose i knew that she did this because when i either walked about until very late or else rose early to take my ramble about the prison i saw the light in the chamber even at five oclock in the morning my god it is as true as i am here that this poor devoted woman at length limited herself to only three hours rest and though her children improved in health her own was suffering the most frightful ravages it was evident that alexander did not suspect the labour and toil which his wife endured he had sunk into a species of apathy which blinded him to a fact that i discovered so easily and which gave me the acutest pain you may be sure that i did all i could for the family and in as delicate a way as possiblealways proposing to join my dinner to theirs when i knew that i had a better one than they but my own resources were becoming daily more cramped and my accursed chancery business not only lingered on but absorbed all the funds i could raise or my friends could muster in my behalf thus six months passed awaylucy in the meantime being worn down to a skeleton and seeming only the shadow of her former self still she grew not slovenly dirtthat too frequent companion of povertywas not the characteristic of her little chamber and her husband always had his clean shirt for the sabbath and even decent apparel considering that he lived on the poorside of the kings bench prison it was term time and my business compelled me to take a dayrule that is to say i obtained permission to go out for a day to attend to my affairs my friends giving security to the marshal of the bench for my safe return i resolved to avail myself of this opportunity to call on walkden and represent to him the cruelty and absurdity of keeping alexander in confinement when by withdrawing the detainer he might restore him to freedom i was prepared to find walkden a severe and hard man but the reception i experienced was calculated to make me set him down as a fiend in mortal shape the moment i mentioned my business he stopped me shortrising from his seat and saying in a cold icy manner the name of craddock is abhorrent to me sir i was grossly insulted by his injurious suspicions and he shall rot in prison before i permit him to escape my vengeance he thinks that he will be freed in six months time but he is mistakenno sir i exclaimed indignantly it is you who are mistaken the fiat of the insolvents court is stronger than your vindictive willwe shall see observed walkden in an implacable tone and i was compelled to withdraw not only grieved at the illsuccess of my visit but filled with vague apprehensions that fresh persecutions were in waiting for my unhappy friend but i did not breathe a word to either alexander or lucy relative to the step which i had taken nor the fears thus excited within me although i could not banish the lawyers dark menace from my thoughts months passed awaylucy still managing to keep the wolf from the door as the vulgar phrase goes while her health was sinking rapidly at length the period drew nigh when alexander expected to obtain his deliverance and now his spirits began to rise he gradually shook off the apathy which had so long clouded his intellect and impaired his energies and he spoke highly of the prospect of release but walkden watched him from a distance and seemed to gloat over the new scheme of vengeance which he had in store for this hapless family indeed the blow came on a day when alexander had declared to me that he had not felt his heart so light for a long long time a detainer was lodged against him at the gatea detainer for a thousand pounds the fact was that a mistake had been committed in alexanders schedule and an item to that extent omitted the judgment of the court was therefore void and null in respect to a debt not inserted in the schedule for such is the atrocious law made on purpose to persecute those unfortunate debtors who do not come within the meaning of the acts which enable traders to apply to the bankruptcy court the way that i heard first of the detainer being lodged at walkdens suit was in this wisea charwoman came to my room saying that mrs craddock who appeared to be in great distress of mind wished to see me immediately i hurried to the poorside a misgiving preparing my mind to receive intelligence of farther persecution on the part of the fiend walkden on entering the craddocks chamber i found alexander lying almost senseless on the bed deep and prolonged gaspings alone denoting that he was alive lucy was on her knees imploring him not to give way to despair and the children were crying piteously although they were too young to understand the nature of the misfortune which had fallen on their parents heads i strove to awaken my unhappy friend to the necessity of enduring this new affliction with courage and in a short time my representations joined to lucys prayers and entreaties succeeded to some little extent you must petition the insolvents court again i said and you are sure of having no farther remand in six weeks you will be freebut the meansthe means to pass this ordeal a second time he exclaimed almost franticallythe marshal has some charitable funds at his disposal i observed and i will instantly wait upon him and present the whole circumstances of the casealexander was in that feverish state of excitement which cannot endure suspense when any gleam of hope is afforded in the midst of despair and he urged me to lose no time in seeing the marshal as i quitted the room lucy pressed my hand in a manner expressive of deep emotion as she murmured in a low tone you are our only friend within ten minutes i was seated in the marshals private office explaining the nature of my business i unreservedly and frankly revealed to him alexander craddocks whole history and you may be sure that i did not forget to dwell upon the admirable conduct of lucy the marshal is a humane man although nothing more than a superior kind of gaoler and he listened to me with great interest when i had concluded my narrative which was rather long he said mr prout i will lose no time in calling myself upon mr walkden whom i know well by name and whose character has certainly appeared to me this day in a new light i am well aware that he is harsh and severe but i do not think him capable of keeping this man in prison under all the circumstances which you have detailed to me i will see him and endeavour to excite his compassion by unfolding to him all the particulars of craddocks history as you have now related them to me if he should persist in retaining him in gaol i will then from my own pocket advance the necessary funds to enable your poor friend to petition the court again in the meantime give craddock this guineai returned my warmest thanks to the marshal for his goodness and was hurrying back to the craddocks with the money and the hopeful intelligence i had in store for them when as i passed through the upper lobby my attention was directed to a new prisoner who had just arrived for on the turnkey asking him his name he repliedscudimore a moments scrutiny of the man convinced me that he was the same who had plundered craddock a description of his personal appearance having been frequently given to me by alexander i was sorry to find that he had become an inmate of the same place as the individual whom he had so deeply injured and whose excited feelings i feared might lead him to some act of violence towards the villain well aware that alexander could not be long before he must inevitably learn the fact of scudimores arrest i resolved to mention it to him without delay so as to prepare him to meet his enemy within the precincts of the bench i however communicated my good news first and lucy was overjoyed when she learnt that the marshal had resolved to interest himself in her husbands behalf but alexanders manner suddenly became so strangeso unaccountably sombre and gloomyand so menacingly mysterious when i revealed to him the circumstance of scudimores presence in the prison that both lucy and myself grew terribly alarmed we implored him not to notice scudimore even when they should meet but he gave no reply i however whispered to lucy my hopes that the marshal would succeed in inducing walkden to liberate her husband at once and thereby remove her husband from the vicinity of the scoundrel who had ruined him i also resolved to be as much with alexander as possible and i was delighted to find that he showed no inclination to leave his room for the purpose of taking his usual walk up and down the back of the prisonbuilding in the course of a couple of hours the marshal sent me in word that he had not succeeded in finding mr walkden at his office but had made an appointment with the headclerk to call again in the evening when the result of his interview with the lawyer should be immediately communicated to me even if the gates were closed i therefore saw that the marshal was in earnest in carrying out the business he had taken in hand and lucy was inspired with the same strong hopes that i entertained but alexander received the marshals message with an apathetic coldness which filled me with alarm and it was evident that his mind brooded over other affairs which i could not help thinking were connected with the arrival of scudimore at the bench i was however glad to observe that lucy did not participate in my fears to the same extent as she did in my hopes poor creature the thought of seeing her husband soon free was the absorbing sentiment in her mind i remained with the craddocks on that eventful day up to almost nine oclock when a letter which i received by the last post compelled me to go to my room for a few minutes to look out a few papers connected with my own case and which my attorney required the first thing in the morning i assured lucy that i would return as soon as possible the promised intelligence from the marshal being now every moment expected by us and now i come to a frightful portion of my sad tale i had been about five minutes in my room and had just sealed up the packet which was to be given to a messenger that night to deliver early next day to my solicitor when lucy rushed in without knocking she fell exhausted upon the floor and it was some moments before she could articulate a word i was cruelly alarmed and my hand trembled so as i poured her out some water that i could scarcely hold the glass at length i learnt that alexander had suddenly started from his chair a minute after i left him and seizing a knife had rushed from the room before lucy could reach the bottom of the stairs he had disappeared and in a state bordering on distraction she had naturally flown to me while she was gasping forth the few words which thus made me acquainted with the cause of her visit cries of horror suddenly burst from the paradeground and struck upon our ears i cannot at this moment remember what we thought or what we saidno nor how we got down the stairs the next incident that i do recollect after hearing those appalling cries was finding myself elbowing my way through a group of prisoners assembled on the parade and then by the moonlight what a spectacle met my eyes a man was lying on the ground weltering in his blood and another was passive and motionless in the grasp of three or four prisoners the former was scudimore the latter was alexander craddock then female shrieks of anguish rent the air and lucy threw herself wildly into her husbands arms exclaiming in a tone so piercing that it still rings in my earsyou did not do it alexander oh noyou could notyou would not tell mei conjure youtell me that you did not do it almost at the same moment a cry was raised ofthe marshalland immediately afterwards that gentleman came up to the spot accompanied by another individual whom as the moonlight fell upon his countenance i instantly recognised to be walkden and that countenancehow was it changed no longer cold and implacable every feature bore the imprint of ineffable anguish and black despair then when in a few hurried words the assassination of scudimore was communicated by the byestanders to the marshal and walkden and alexander craddock was mentioned as the murderer a scene of the most wildly exciting interest ensued for walkden sprang towards the guiltyunhappy young man and throwing his arms frantically around himpoor lucy shrinking back at his appearanceexclaimed my sonmy dear and longlost son pardon mepardon mei am the cause of all thisoh my god how frightfully am i punishedand the wretched walkden fell heavily upon the ground overpoweredstunnedcrushed by emotions too awful to be even conceived i must here pause for a few moments to give a word or two of necessary explanation the marshal had found mr walkden at his office in the evening and had begged him to grant alexanders release but the miscreant was inexorable alleging that he had received at the prisoners hands insults of a nature which rendered mercy impossible the marshal hoping to touch the mans heart by a recital of all the interesting circumstances of alexanders life began to tell his story but scarcely had he explained how alexander had been found by the late mr craddock in the neighbourhood of doctors commons when walkdens whole manner suddenly underwent an appalling change he turned ghastly paletrembled like an aspenleafand then in another minute covered his face with his hands exclaiming in a tone of the deepest anguish merciful god it is my own son whom i have plundered and persecuted thus vilely oh wretch that i ammiscreant demon that i have beenthe marshal was naturally overwhelmed with astonishment at these terrific selfaccusations which nevertheless appeared to be too well founded for it was indeed the only child of the miserable lawyer who had been lost by a neglectful servant years ago in the neighbourhood of doctors commons and the sudden death of the beadle happening the very next day had destroyed the only clue to the infant mrs walkden died of a broken heart and it was most probably these misfortunes which acting upon a morbid mind rendered the attorney the harsh severe merciless man which he had so effectually proved himself to be and what miseries had he piled up to fall on his own head he had ruined his sonrendered him a murdererand also endeavoured to seduce that sons wife oh it was a fearful scene which took place on the paradeground on that eventful evening scudimore lay a corpse at the feet of the man whom he had injured and senseless by the side of the corpse fell walkden who had made scudimore his instrument and accomplice in the iniquitous transaction which paved the way for this accumulation of horrors alexander understood nothing that took place he saw it allbut comprehended it not his reason had fled and it is most probable that he was already a maniac when he rushed from his room armed with the fatal knifeand perhaps even when i observed the strange change come over him on his learning from my lips that scudimore was an inmate of the bench as for lucypoor crushed heartbroken lucyshe had fainted when walkden proclaimed himself her husbands father but i must hasten and bring my story to a conclusion the marshal speedily gave the orders necessary under the circumstances which had occurred and on lucy being recovered from her swoon she found that she had not been the prey of a hideous dream as she at first supposedbut that her husband had been taken from her and lodged in the strongrooma maniac and a murderer oh what a heartrending duty it was for me to implore her to take courage for her childrens sake walkden who had in the meantime been restored to his senses begged her to make his house her home in future and look on him as a fatherbut she shrieked forth a negative in so wild a tone and accompanied by such a shudder that the wretched man could not be otherwise than deeply convinced how ineffable was the abhorrence that she entertained for him the marshal kindly took charge of the stricken woman and her young children and the corpse of scudimore was conveyed to a room there to await the attendance of the coroner on the following day but little more remains to be told during the night that followed the deplorable events which i have just related alexander craddock grew furious with excitement and became raving mad a brainfever supervened and in less than twelve hours from the moment when his hand avenged his wrongs on the villain scudimore he himself was no longer a denizen of this world ten days afterwards the marshal received a letter from walkden which he subsequently showed to me and the contents of which ran thus as nearly as i can recollect themi am about to quit england and shall never be again heard of by one who has to much reason to shudder at the mere mention of my name i allude to my deeplyinjured daughterinlaw my share of the ten thousand pounds of which scudimore plundered her husband was precisely one half this amount with compound interest i have placed in the funds in her name and i implore her to forgive a man who is crushed and heartbroken and who loathes himselflucy who had only for her childrens sake been able to sustain anything like the adequate amount of courage necessary to support her afflictions was somewhat solacedif solace there could be in the midst of such bitter bitter woeby the certainty that those children were now secure against want she accordingly removed with them into a small but comfortable dwelling near norwoodbut not before she had called on me to express all her gratitude for the kindnesses which i had been enabled to show the family she moreover endeavoured to compel me to receive a sum of money as she said in repayment for the amounts i had at various times lent them but that sum was a hundred times greater than any i had ever been able to assist them with i would not receive a fraction and i wept on parting with her as if she had been my own daughter during the year which she survived the loss of her husbandfor she only did survive it a yearshe came frequently to visit me always accompanied by her children and on every occasion she brought me some touching and delicate memorial of her esteem but her health had been undermined by the long vigilsthe deep anxietiesthe corroding caresthe serious toilsand the frightful shocks which had characterised her existence in this accursed prison and she died in the arms of an affectionate female friend who dwelt in her neighbourhood and whose bosom her misfortunes had deeply touched this friend promised to be a second mother to the poor children and she has fulfilled her word two respectable gentlemen accepted the guardianship of the orphans so far as their pecuniary interests are concerned and those orphans will be rich when they become of agefor walkden died a short time ago leaving them all his fortune poor lucy sleeps in the same grave with her husband and thus ends my tale of sorrow the old man wiped away the tears from his eyes and frank curtis was not only deeply interested in the narrative which he had just heard but even affected by its lamentable details on which he was about to make some remark when happening to glance from the window he espied the captain on the parade staring about him in all possible directions curtis therefore took leave of mr prout after thanking him for the recital of the melancholy tale and hastened to join his friend captain oblunderbuss had no good news to relate the officers in possession in baker street had positively refused to allow mrs curtis to take any thing beyond wearing apparel away with her and the excellent lady had accordingly moved with her two trunks and her five children to a lodging in belvidere place the captain had likewise been unsuccessful in his visit to sir christopher blunt he had seen the knight it is true but neither menaces nor coaxings had proved potent enough to induce that gentleman to draw forth his purse or sign his autograph to a cheque what the devil then must i do demanded frank curtis shuddering as he thought of the poorside be jasus and go dacently and genteelly through the insolvents court exclaimed the captain and ill skin the commissioners alive if they darr to turn you back my frind i really think there is no other alternative left but to petition the court observed frank curtis and therefore ill make up my mind at once to do so chapter cix the prisoners we must leave mr frank curtis to adopt the necessary measures in order to effect his emancipation from the bench vi the insolvents court and suppose that a month has passed since the period when the blackamoor consigned to his dungeons tim the snammer josh pedler old death mrs bunce her husband and tidmarsh it was about nine oclock in the evening when the blackamoor attended by csar who bore a light entered the subterranean passage containing the doors of the cells in which the prisoners were separately retained wilton followed bearing a large basket and two more of the blacks retainers brought up the rear one carrying a naked cutlass and the other a pair of loaded pistols in their hands opening the door of the first cell the blackamoor took the light from csars hand and stopping on the threshold said timothy splint another sun has set and the close of another day has come had you been surrendered up to the justice of the criminal tribunals of your country you would ere this have ceased to exist your guilt would have been expiated on the scaffold oh i would rather it had been that exclaimed the man in a tone which carried to the hearts of his listeners a conviction of his sincerityi would rather it had been that than this frightful lingering in utter darkness the light sir is as welcome to me as food would be if i was starving he added with profound emphasis are you afraid to be alone and in the dark enquired the blackamoor it is hell upon earth sir cried tim the snammer what can you ask me whether im afraid when the place is haunted with dreadful spectres the spectres are created by your own guilty conscience answered the black mildly but solemnly then advancing farther into the dungeon so that the light fell upon the haggard countenance of the prisoner he said you see that there are no horrible apparitions now and why should they not remain here when you can enjoy the use of your eyes as well as when you are involved in darkness that is what i say to myselfthat is what i am always asking myself exclaimed timothy splint and yet i cant help thinking that he is therethe murdered man you knowwith his throat so horribly cutoh yeswhen i am alone and in the dark i am sure he is therejust where you are standing now he never moveshe stands as still as deathand his eyes glare upon me in the dark it is dreadfuldreadfuland the wretched criminal hid his face in his hands are you sorry then that you killed sir henry courtenay asked the black sorry repeated splint in a thrillingagonising tone i wish that i could only live the last few months over again id sooner beggo to the workhousebreak stones in the roador even starve than rob or do any thing wrong again oh i would indeed for i see now that though a man may only mean for to rob he stands the chance of taking away life and its a horridhorrid thing to say to ones self i am a murderer but its more horrid still to see the dreadful spectre always standing by onequite plain though in the darkand never taking his cold eyes off his assassin if you had a light timothy splint you would no longer think of your crimes said the blackamoor and then you would be ready to fall back into your old courses if you had your liberty given to you once more heaven forbid exclaimed the man his frame convulsed with a horrible shudder i wish i had never known such courses at all i wish i could live over again during the whole period that ive been so wicked i am sure i should be a good man thenif so be i had all my experience to teach me to be so i never thought it was such a shocking thing to be wicked till i came to be left alone in darknessyes all alone with my frightful thoughts i would sooner be put to death at once butbut he added in a hesitating manneri havent the courage to brain myself against the wall because the spectre of the murdered baronet seems to stand by to prevent me and have you then ever thought of suicide since you first became a prisoner here enquired the blackamoor often and often sirvery often exclaimed splint emphatically you never told me this before and yet i have visited you regularly every evening to bring you food and talk to you for a short time said the blackamoor but you never spoke to me so kindly as you do now sir cried the criminal earnestly and when a man has been upwards of thirty daysyes i have counted your visits and this is the thirtyfirstwhen a man i say has been thirtyone days all alone and in darkness except for a few minutes every evening he begins to feel the want of hearing a human voiceand when that voice speaks in a kind manner timothy splints tone had gradually become tremulous and now he burst into tears yesthe villainthe robberthe murderer wept and those were tears such as he had not shed for a long long time when the river is icebound by the cold hand of winter it seems unconscious of the presence of the flower thrown on its impenetrable surface but when thawed by the warm sun and flowing naturally again the stream opens its bosom to receive the rosebud which it caresses with its sparkling ripples and wafts gently along as if rejoiced at the companionship so was it with the heart of this man and the slightest word spoken in a kind manner was now borne on by the current of feelings thawed from a state of dull and longenduring obduracy your crimes are manifold and great said the blackamoor but there is hope for even the vilest he added unable altogether to subdue a profound sigh and contrition is all that remains for sinful mortals who cannot recall the past i am penitent siri am very penitent i can assure you exclaimed the man in a tone of deep emotion a few weeks ago i should have been ashamed to utter such a thing and now it does me good to say soand ill tell you something more sir he continued after a moments hesitation though i suppose you will not believe me speak frankly said the blackamoor well siri have tried to recollect a prayer and last night when i repeated it i thought that the spectre gradually grew less and less plain to the view and at all events seemed less horrible i was praying again when you came just nowand i shall pray presentlyfor i know that there is some consolation in it you do well to pray timothy observed the blackamoor would you not like to be able to read some book if i only had a candle and a bible sir exclaimed the man speaking under the influence of feelings deeply excited but unquestionably sincere i think i should even yet be happy in this dreadful dungeon what makes you fancy that the bible would render you happy enquired the black because i used to read it when i was a lad and i remember that it contains many good sayings answered splint besides it declares somewhere that there is hope for sinners who repent and i should like to keep my eyes fixed at times upon gods own promise i am sure that my mind would be easier for though i know that the promise is given yet i feel a desire to repeat it over and over again to myselfand also to learn whether god ever forgave any one who was so bad as i am you shall have a light and a book said the blackamoor oh you are jestingyou are deceiving me cried splint but that would be so cruel sir on your part i am not jestingthe subject is too serious to be treated lightly was the answer then making a sign to wilton to step forward he took from the basket which that dependant carried a lamp already trimmed and a couple of books there is a volume of talesand there is the bible he continued take whichever you prefer the bible if you please sir cried splint eagerly while his countenance denoted the most unfeigned joy i know not how to thank you enough for this kindnessand tears again started from his eyes had you chosen the tales you should not have had either book or light said the black wilton now gave the prisoner a plate containing bread and cold meat and a bottle of water while csar lighted his lamp and the door was then again closed upon him that man is already a true penitent whispered the blackamoor to wilton let us now visit his late companion in iniquity the party proceeded to the next cell in which joshua pedler was confined the two armed dependants stationing themselves in such a manner as to be visible to the inmate of the dungeon when the door was opened thank god you are come again he cried starting up from his bed the moment the light flashed in upon him but why do you come with swords and pistols in that fashion he demanded savagely in case you should offer any resistance answered the blackamoor i do not choose to put chains upon you and therefore i am compelled to adopt every necessary precaution when i visit you in this manner i really would not harm you siri would not for the world said pedler in a milder tone you are not cruelthough severe and i feel very grateful to you for not giving me up to justice i hope you are not offended with me for speaking as i did i try to be patienti endeavour to be mild and all that what is it then that irritates your temper enquired the blackamoor my own thoughts sir answered josh pedler bitterly just before i heard the key grating in the lock i was a thinking what a fool i have been for so many years and how happy i might be perhaps if i was a labouringman you are sorry that you have been wicked observed the black interrogatively and so would any one be when he comes to be locked up here in the dark returned the man it is all very well when one is at liberty and has friends to talk to and plenty of drink because company and gin can prevent a body from thinking but herehereoh it is quite different and my opinion is that a dark dungeon is a much worse punishment than transportationleastways judging by all ive heard from men which has been transported and has come home again when their time was up would you rather be transported at once thenor remain here enquired the blackamoor i would sooner remain here for several reasons said pedler in the first place i dont want to get into bad company again because im afraid i should go all wrong once moreand in the second place i know that the thoughts which i have are good for me though theyre not pleasant but if you could this minute join some of your old friends to drink and smoke with them would you not gladly do so asked the black i scarcely know how to answer you sir replied pedler musing i am afraid i mightand yet i am very certain that i should be a fool for my pains i would sooner earn an honest living somehow or another i should like to have good thoughtsbut that is impossibleimpossible he added shaking his head gloomily why is it impossible demanded the black because a man to have good thoughts must do something that is good was the prompt rejoinder and i have been a wicked fellow for so many years i wish i had been good but it is too late now it is never too late to repent said the blackamoor i know that the bible promises that observed pedler but then people would never believe that a rascal like me could become good for any thing besides after all that has happened i dont hope for any opportunity of showing that i feel how stupid i have been to lead such a life as i have done who would trust me with any work what honest person would associate with me its no use questioning me sir you see that even you yourself dont feel comfortable in visiting this place since you come with armed people if you could obtain your liberty by killing me would you not do it asked the black as true as you are there i would not harm a hair of your head cried josh pedler emphatically i shudder when i think of that dreadful business down at the cottage yonderin fact i cant bear to think of it i dont say that i am actually afraid at being in the dark but darkness causes terrible thoughts it seems as if the mind had eyes and couldnt shut them against particular thingsand now that i have found out this much i should be a long time before i did a wrong deed again even if i was turned out into the midst of london this very minute without a penny in my pocket what would you do if you were set free this moment demanded the blackamoor at the same time do not suppose that you are about to have your liberty i am not mad enough to fancy it possible replied josh pedler but if such a thing did happen i would go to matildathe gal that i spoke to you about sir and who is now in a comfortable position added the black yesthanks to your kindness said the man and i should like you as long as i lived if it was only on account of what you have done for her but as i was going to tell yousupposing i was set free i would take tilda with me into the countryas far away from london as possible and then id change my name and try to get work ah i should be happy he continued with a profound sigh if i could only earn enough to keep us in a little hut but dont make me talk in this way any longer i feel justjust as if ii was going to cry the mans voice became faltering and tremulous as he uttered these last words and his lashes were moistened with tears should you feel pleasure in writing a letter to matilda asked the blackamoor in a kind tone yesabove all things eagerly cried the criminal i am no great penman but she could make out my scribbling i dare sayand it would do me good to give her some proper advicei mean just to let her know what my thoughts is at times besides now that im separated from her i find that i liked her moreyesa good deal more than i used to fancy i did and i should be glad to beg her forgiveness for what i made her do when i was sick and in want you shall have a light and writingmaterials observed the black you are a good mani feel that you are sir exclaimed josh pedler the tears now trickling down his cheeks if i had only fallen in with such a person as yourself when i was young i shouldnt have turned out as i did but though people may never know that it is possible for a fellow like me to alter yet altered my mind isand i dont look on things as i used to do wilton gave josh pedler a supply of food a lamp and writingmaterials the dungeon already containing a table in addition to the other necessary but plain and homely articles of furniture the criminal was overjoyed at the indulgence shown him on the occasion of this visit and he saw the door close upon him with feelings which seemed to have experienced a great relief end of vol i of the second series printed by j fautley bonner house seacoal lane london transcribers
