by susanna moodie chapter i one of the most terrible instances of dishonesty i ever knew said a lady friend to me happened in my own family or i should say in one of its relative branches you were staying last summer at westcliff did you hear dr leatrim preach yes my friends resided about a mile from the parsonage and were constant in their attendance at his church the doctor was one of the principal attractions of the placeone of the most eloquent men i ever heard in the pulpit did you ever meet him in company never i was told that he seldom went into society and lived quite a solitary life that some great domestic calamity had weaned him entirely from the world that his visits were confined to the poor of his parish or to those who stood in need of his spiritual advice that since the death of his wife and only son he had never been seen with a smile upon his face to tell you the truth i was surprised to hear sermons so full of heavenly benevolence and love breathed from the lips of such an austere and melancholylooking man ah my poor uncle sighed my friend he has had sorrows and trials enough to sour his temper and break his heart he was not always the gentle earnest christian you now see him but a severe uncompromising theologian of the old school and looked upon all other sects who opposed his particular dogmas as enemies to the true faith a strict disciplinarian he suffered nothing to interfere with his religious duties and exercised a despotic sway in the church and in his family he married early in life my fathers only sister and made her an excellent husband and if a certain degree of fear mingled with her love it originated in the deep reverence she felt for his character he was forty years of age when the earl of b who was a near relation conferred upon him the living of westcliff the last incumbent had been a kind easygoing old man who loved his rubber of whist and a social chat with his neighbours over a glass of punch and left them to take care of their souls in the best manner they could considering that he well earned his pounds per annum by preaching a dull plethoric sermon once a week christening all the infants marrying the adults and burying the dead it was no wonder that dr leatrim found the parish as far as religion was concerned in a very heathenish state his zealous endeavours to arouse them from this careless indifference gave great offence the people did not believe that they were sinners and were very indignant with the doctor for insisting upon the fact but he spared neither age nor sex in his battle for truth and fought it with most uncompromising earnestness rich or poor it was all the same to him he spoke as decidedly to the man of rank as to the humblest peasant in his employ his eloquence was a vital power the energy with which he enforced it compelled people to listen to him and as he lived up to his professions and was ever foremost in every good word and work they were forced to respect his character though he did assail all their public and private vices from the pulpit and enforced their strict attendance at church on the sabbath day this state of antagonism between the doctor and his parishioners did not last long prejudice yielded to his eloquent preaching numbers came from a distance to hear him and many careless souls awoke from a state of worldly apathy to seek the bread of life just to give you a correct idea of what manner of man george leatrim was in these days contrasted with what he is now i will relate an anecdote of him that i had from an eyewitness of the scene a wealthy miller in the parish a great drunkard and atheist and a very hard unfeeling immoral character dropped down dead in a state of intoxication and being a nominal member of the church was brought there for burial when the doctor came to that portion of the service we therefore commit his body to the ground earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our lord jesus christ he paused and looking round on the numerous band of relations and friends that surrounded the grave said in the most solemn and emphatic manner my friends the prayerbook says this but if there is any truth in gods word it cannot be applied to this man he denied the existence of a god ridiculed the idea of a saviour was an irreligious and bad member of the community and died in the commission of an habitual and deadly sin and it is my firm conviction that such as he cannot enter into the kingdom of god footnote a fact the doctor was greatly censured by the neighbouring clergy for boldly declaring what he felt to be the truth but it produced an electrical effect upon those present and the son of the deceased who was fast following in his fathers steps became a sincere and practical christian mrs leatrim was quite a contrast to her husbanda gentle affectionate simplehearted woman she never thwarted his wishes in word or deed and was ever at his side to assist him in his ministrations among the poor in teaching the children and reading to the sick and inquiring she had been the mother of several children but only one and that the youngestborn survived the three first years of infancy it is this son named after his father george leatrim who forms the subject of my present story which though a painful one in its general details is strictly true if the good doctor had an idol in the world it was his son george the lad possessed the most amiable disposition uniting to the talent and earnestness of the father the gentle endearing qualities of his mother he was handsome frank and graceful the expression of his face so truthful and unaffected that it created an interest in his favour at first sight religious without cant and clever without pretence it is no wonder that his father who was his sole instructor reposed in the fine lad the utmost confidence treating him more like an equal than a son over whom he held the authority of both pastor and parent there was none of the nervous timidity that marked mrs leatrims intercourse with her husband in the conduct of her son his love for his stern father was without fear it almost amounted to worship and the hope of deserving his esteem was the motive power that influenced his studies and gave a colouring to every act of his life the father on his part regarded his son as superior beingone whom the lord had called from his birth to be his servant there was another person in the house whom next to his wife and son doctor leatrim held in the greatest esteem and veneration not only on account of his having saved him when a boy from drowning at the imminent peril of his own life but from his having persuaded him when a youth to abandon a career of reckless folly and become a christian ralph wilson was an old and faithful servant who had been born in his fathers house and had nursed the doctor when a little child upon his knees when his master died ralph was confided to the care of his son and as he had never married he had grown grey in the doctors service and his love for him and his family was the sole aim and object of his life everything about the parsonage was entrusted to ralphs care and he was consulted on all business matters of importance all the money transactions of the family went through his hands and like most old servants his sway over the household was despotic the doctor gave him his own way in everything for it saved him a great deal of trouble his mind was too much engrossed with his ministerial duties to attend to these minor concerns ralph was a better business man he said he could manage such matters more skilfully and economically than he could if mrs leatrim came to consult him about any domestic arrangements it was always put a stop to dont trouble me mary go to ralph he can advise you what to do poor mrs leatrim did not like ralph as well as her husband did and would much rather have had the sanction of the legitimate master of the house by his fellowservants the old greyheaded factotum was almost detested they could receive orders from the rector and yield to him cheerful and hearty obedience but to be under the control of a stingy canting old hypocrite like ralph wilson was hard to be borne the bible that was so often in his mouth might have taught him that no man can serve two masters this fact was fully illustrated in their case for they loved the one and hated the other there was always trouble in the householda perpetual changing of domestics greatly to the annoyance of mrs leatrim but the matter was one of small importance to the rector provided he was left in peace to pursue his studies amiable and gentle as george was he could not force himself to feel any affection for ralph wilson he treated him with respect for his fathers sake more than from any personal regard though the old man was servile in his protestations of love and devotion some minds are surrounded by a moral and intellectual atmosphere into which other minds cannot enter without feeling a certain degree of repulsion such an insensible but powerfully acknowledged antagonism existed between the faithful old servant and his young master they did not hate one anotherthat would have been too strong a termbut doctor leatrim often remarked with pain that there was no love lost between them and often blamed george for the indifference he manifested towards his humble friend you remember the beautiful old church at westcliff surrounded by its venerable screen of oaks and elms and the pretty white parsonage on the other side of the road facing the principal entrance to the church the house occupies an elevation some feet above the churchyard the front windows command a fine view of the sacred edifice particularly of the carved porch within the iron gates at the entrance and the massive oak door through which you enter into the body of the building a person standing at one of these windows at sunset and looking towards the porch can see everything there as distinctly as if he were in it recollect this circumstance for it is connected with my story in the porch dr leatrim had placed a box against the wall on the righthand side as you went in for receiving contributions for the poor it was only unlocked twice a year at christmas and easter and its contents distributed to the most needy among his parishioners there were many wealthy people in the neighbourhood and the poorbox generally yielded a plentiful harvest for the destitute the key of the box was always kept in the rectors study and occupied the same hook with the key of the church the windows of this room were directly opposite to the church no person had access to this apartment but dr leatrim his wife and son and old ralph the latter kept it in order for fear the women folk should disarrange his masters papers he performed all the dusting and cleaning and never was there a room kept more scrupulously neat he had a private desk for his own use under one of the windows in which he kept all the accounts that passed through his hands and it was not an unusual sight to see the doctor composing his startling soulawakening sermons at the large table in the centre of the room and the little shrewdlooking greyhaired housesteward dotting down figures quietly at the desk below the window his presence never disturbed his master who often read to him portions of the discourse he was writing for his approval ralphs applause gave him confidence he considered his judgment in spiritual matters more correct than his own on opening the poorbox at christmas the rector was surprised to find that an unusually small sum had been deposited he could not account for the falling off but made up the deficiency from his own purse and thought no more about it at easter the earl and countess of b always gave liberally and their example was followed by all the wealthy landholders in the parish there was always a good sprinkling of silver and gold to set against the weekly donations of coppers and small coin to make glad the widows and orphans of westcliff to comfort the lame the halt and the blind the sunday after easter was the day dr leatrim had always appointed for the distribution of these alms to the poor the box was opened the morning previous and the different sums allotted according to the necessities of the recipients and to avoid all confusion the portion of each individual was enclosed in a sealed packet and addressed to the respective parties after the morning service was over the rector met his poor in the vestry and george delivered to each claimant the packet inscribed for him this was always followed by a short address and an earnest prayer from dr leatrim it was a happy day for him and george who seemed to enjoy it as much as his father you may imagine the consternation of the rector when he opened the box on the saturday morning and found the same deficiency which had struck him as so remarkable on the previous christmas the earl of b generally gave a fivesovereign gold piece at easter and his numerous lordly visitors always followed suit the doctor was never behindhand with his noble neighbours and many of the welltodo yeomen gave their sovereigns and halfsovereigns and there was no lack of silver this day not a single gold piece was to be found in the box the conviction was unwillingly forced upon the rectors mind that the church had been robbed both before and now but by whom it was a bramah lock the secret only known to himself ralph and his son george the good man felt fear clutch at his heart with an iron grip but the thing had to be investigated however repugnant to his feelings before he mentioned it to his family and in order to satisfy his own uneasiness dr leatrim thought it best to obtain a private interview with the earl and inquire what he had given as a foundation upon which to ground his own investigations the information he obtained from this quarter did not lessen the difficulty the earl told him at once that he had given five sovereigns in gold and that he believed the duke of a who was a guest at the castle had done the same that a maiden aunt of the earls who was very rich had put in ten and all the members of his household not excluding the servants who were constant attendants upon dr leatrims ministry had given liberally that the box must have been robbed and that to a considerable amount my uncle returned home a miserable man a great and heinous sin had been committed to suspect any of the members of his household was a sin almost as great what was to be done chapter ii dr leatrims was not a spirit to brook delay as stern as brutus like brutus he could be as unflinching in the performance of his duty he called ralph into the study and after carefully closing the door addressed him in a voice hoarse with emotion ralph the church has been entered the poors box opened and money to the amount of twenty pounds been abstracted my dear old friend he continued grasping his hand can you throw any light upon this dreadful transaction the old man was as much agitated as his master a deadly pallor overspread his face and tears came into his eyes the church entered money stolen to such a large amount my dear sir can it be possible only too true but the thief ralph who can be the thief it must be some one well acquainted with the premises who could gain access to the key and must have known the secret of the lock it is this which distresses methat fills my mind with the keenest anguish he looked hard at the old mannot a look of suspicion but one of intense inquiry as if he depended upon his answer to solve his doubts ralph trembled visibly his voice became a broken sob oh my dear my honoured master you cannot surely suspect me your old and faithful servant i would as soon suspect myself the old man continued in a deprecating tone you know your reverence that money is no object to me i have neither wife nor child and my wants are liberally supplied by you i shall have to leave you the money saved in your service for the want of an heir and i generally give half my wages to the poor through that very box being more anxious to lay up for myself treasures in heaven than upon earth yes yes i know all this my good ralph cried the doctor impatiently your character is above suspicion i want you to give me some clue by which the real culprit could be brought to justice the old man cast a hasty glance at his master as if he could do so if he pleased but remained silent the look did not escape doctor leatrims keen eye speak ralph speak out like a man i feel certain that you know something about it and suppose i dohe came a step nearer to his master and spoke in low mysterious tonesthat something had better remain unsaid you are a rich man twenty or thirty pounds are nothing to you you gave twice that sum last week to get hall out of jail replace the money and depend upon my word that the felony will never be repeated and let the culprit escape without the punishment due to his crime and such a crime would that be just old man it would be merciful returned ralph drily a knowledge of the truth would do no good it would only make your reverence unhappy i must not consult my own feelings on the subject said the rector greatly excited no though the felon were my son who is dearer to me than my own life and i could effectually conceal his guilt he should pay the penalty due to his crime the old man shuddered and drew back a few paces your reverence has made a pretty shrewd guess it was master george george my george the doctor sank into his study chair he grasped at the arms convulsively his broad chest heaved and panted his breath came in hoarse gasps he was too much stunned to speak ralph poured out a glass of water and held it to his white and rigid lips blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy the lord help and comfort you my dear master under this heavy affliction we are all liable to temptation try and forgive your son my son never call him my son again i disown himcast him off for ever george george this will kill me i loved and trusted you so muchwould have given my life to save yours any dayand you have disgraced my name and calling and broken my heartbut are you sure old man he cried clutching ralph by the shoulder sure that my george did this horrible thing for gods sake sir moderate your anger master george is very young he may never do the like again that is no answer to my question cried the wretched father tightening his grasp upon the old mans arm i do not ask you to palliate his guilt it admits of no excuse did you see him do it tell me thattell me quickly i am in no humour for trifling ay seeing is believing said the old man sullenly as your reverence knows the worst it is of no use hiding the details i saw master george take the money the doctor groaned in anguish of spirit howwhenwhere did you see him do it may you not have been mistaken impossible sir i would not advance a thing of this nature without i had positive proof i repeat to you again on my word of honour on the faith of a christian that i saw him do it what more do you require it is enough sighed the miserable father covering his face with his hands george george my son my only son have i deserved this at your hands the trial is too great for flesh and blood to bear o my god my just and righteous god thou hast shattered my idol of clay to pieces and my heart lies broken and trampled in the dust ralph tell the wretched boy to come to me directly the old man hesitated not while you are in this excited state my dear master wait a while until your passion calms down it is apt to betray you into sin i implore you to deal leniently with the lad remember it is his first offence he may repent and you may save your son yes if i could believe that it was his first offence the same thing happened at christmas he has become hardened in successful villany the crime is not against me alone it is against the church and must be punished accordingly dont raise your hands in that deprecating manner ralph or attempt to plead for him and he stamped his foot impatiently i must and will be obeyed why do you loiter old man go for him directly just then a rap came to the door ralph opened it for he knew the step and the accused stood before them smiling and serene unconscious of the thunderclouds that lowered above his head he advanced a few paces into the room then stood still his eyes wandered from his fathers deathpale face to the downcast countenance of the old servingman surprised and distressed he wondered what it could mean his mother had been confined to her chamber for some days with a serious attack of lung disease the doctor had just seen her and pronounced her out of danger he came to bring the glad tidings to his father the first thought that struck him was that anxiety about her had produced the dreadful agitation that his father with all his stoical philosophy found it impossible to restrain and which was so painful for him to witness he hurried to his side dont be alarmed my dear father mamma is better she sent me to tell you so and that she wishes to see you for a few minutes he met the stern severity of dr leatrims glance it chilled him to the heart he drew back regarding him in wondering surprise what is the matter my father something dreadful has happened are you ill yes sir i am illsick at heartsick of a malady that will bring my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave my wound is incurable and the hand of a wicked son has dealt the blow father what do you mean i do not understand these terrible words and the boy raised the calm inquiring glance of his clear candid eyes to the fathers clouded brow and rigid face in what manner can i have offended you miserable boy if you had only offended me i could bear it and forgive you but you have committed a crime against goda crime so great that the felon who will be hung next week at n for murder is innocent in comparison george gazed steadily into his fathers face as he said slowly and with blanched and quivering lips what have i done robbed the poor stolen thirty pounds in gold from that box pointing to the poors box on the table before him and you dare to ask me what you have done and knowing your guilt to raise your hardened eyes to mine the hot blood rushed in a crimson tide into the face of the accused he drew up his slight figure to its full height and looked a man in the strength of his indignation the guilty alone are cowards he said softening the vehemence of his manner it is only truth that dare look at justice without quailing if i am guilty of the crime of which you accuse me father i am no longer worthy to be your son who then is my accuser who charges me with the guilt of a crime so base who dares to tell me to my face that i did this foul wrong one who saw you do it the man does not live who saw me do it the spirit does not live who read in my heart a thought so vile the god to whom the secrets of all hearts are open knows my innocence knows that i am belied o father dear honoured father do not look so sternly upon me i have thought at times that you could read my heart with that searching gaze oh read it now it is bared for your inspection i do not shrink from the investigation do not pronounce me guilty until you have sifted the matter thoroughly innocence is stronger than guilt i never took the money i know nothing about it so help me god dr leatrims heart was touched his eyes were full of tears he made a motion to ralph wilson to speak master george said the old man coming close up to the agitated youth and laying his hand upon his shoulder the lad shuddered and shrank from his touch as if he had suddenly come in contact with a viper how can you speak in that hardened manner to your father are not you ashamed of what you have done will you add falsehood to theft peace old man this is no business of yours i appeal to my father not to you then looking sternly in the old mans face he added in a bitter tone perhaps you are the traitor who has poisoned his mind against me if so speak out i do not fear you i defy your malice bold words master george and boldly spoken but facts are hard things to disprove then going close up to the lad he said in a cool deliberate tone i saw you take the money out of that box old villain you lie george cried the doctor in an angry tone lifting his pale face from between his supporting hands how dare you use such language to my friendmy fathers friend no friend to you sir when he charges your son with a crime he never committed i spoke rashly anger is always intemperate you must make some allowance for my just indignation again he turned and confronted his greyhaired accuser you saw me take the money out of that box when did i take it last friday afternoon you came into the study while i was writing out a receipt at my desk you were in a great hurry i dont think you saw me i did see you ha cried the rector who was now sitting upright in his chair intently listening to the conversation you own then that you were in the study at that hour i have no wish to conceal the fact returned george it would be of little use his attempting to deny it said ralph pointedly he came in and took the key of the box from the hook on which it always hangs i did not take the key of the box in that at least you are under a strange delusion o master george ralph shook his head and raised his hands in pious horror where did he go ralph when he left the study asked dr leatrim i am not quite certain sir i think he went first into the garden and then across the road into the churchyard when he took down the key he seemed very much confused there was a look in his eyes which made me mistrust him and i went to the window which commands a view of the inside of the porch if you come here sir continued ralph advancing to the window you will see everything as plainly as if you were there i know it well sir i saw master george take down the box place it on the bench by the door unlock it and take out something you may guess what that was for he was some minutes examining the contents george leatrim turned very pale and visibly trembled but he never took his eyes from the old mans face george leatrim said the doctor you are now at liberty to give your explanation of this extraordinary conduct i charge you to answer truly the questions i put to you i do not mean to condemn you unheard what did you want in the study last friday afternoon i went there to seek you and not finding you i took down the key of the iron gates that open into the porch of the church and went to look for you in the garden what did you want with me you gave me on my birthday a silver crown piece i did so my father gave it to me when a boy of your age it was one of the coins struck in commemoration of george iiis coronation what of that i wished to give it to god i went into the study to ask your permission to do so as it was a present from you i found ralph wilson writing as he says and you absent i took the key of the churchnot of the poors box as he affirms for i could make my deposit without thatand went into the garden hoping to find you there i then made up my mind to put the piece into the box as it was getting late this i did without taking down the box a fact which that man knows as well as i do i returned to the study and replaced the large iron key ralph was no longer there this is the truththe whole truth so help me god the lad before so calm now flung himself in an agony of tears at his fathers feet and clasping his knees cried out in piteous tones father do you believe me the doctor pushed him aside the evidence is too strong against you i wish i could father did i ever deceive you never that i am conscious of until now did you ever detect me in an act of dishonesty never then how can you condemn me you will say upon the evidence of this honest man am i not as worthy of belief as ralph wilson his character is above suspicion so ought mine to be said the lad proudly ralph is incapable of falsehood how dare you to insinuate that he could be capable of such a crime what inducement could that pious greyheaded old man have for slandering the son of his friend and benefactor i am so certain of his fidelity that i know he would rather bear the brand of shame than bring dishonour upon me and mine it is strange mused george unconsciously uttering his thoughts aloud and half repenting the harsh language he had used to the old servant if he has not plotted this accusation against me to hide his own guilt he has made a grievous mistake it is no mistake cried ralph indignantly i saw you take the money you cant persuade me out of my senses i have borne an honest character all my life it is not a beardless boy that can rob me of it in my old age it may be possible ralph that you were mistaken said dr leatrim after a long and painful silence in which he had been summing up the evidence on both sides the boys account of himself is very clear george i will give you one trial more if i find that crown piece in the box i will believe that ralph is in error that some villain unknown to us has been the robber most joyfully dear father exclaimed george springing from his knees beside the rector and bringing him the box god will attest my innocence and prove to you that i have spoken the truth a gleam of hope shot through the thick gloom that had gathered round dr leatrim with a steady hand he unlocked the box the crown piece was not there liar he cried in a tone of mingled contempt and horror what have you to say for yourself now george uttered a sharp and bitter cry of disappointment he pressed his hands tightly over his breast as he murmured in a hollow broken voice nothing you plead guilty i should prove myself a liar sir if i did liar and thief base hypocrite kneel down and ask pardon of that worthy man for the injurious language you have used towards him never george leatrim fixed his brow like iron i will die first you deserve death sir cried his father rising in great anger and i would inflict upon you the utmost penalty of the law were it not for your poor mother oh my mother said george in a low heartbroken voice this disgrace will kill her dr leatrim was too much overcome by passion to hear that despairing moan his pride too deeply wounded to pity and forgive and he continued with the utmost severity of look and manner ay wretched boy you should have thought of that before but not even to spare her feelings can i neglect my duty i cannot demean myself by touching a thing so vile ralph whom you have calumniated shall inflict upon you a punishment suited to the baseness of your crime wilson you will find a light cane in that corner bring it here you do not mean to chastise me like a dog father never address me by that title again sir until deep repentance and a longcontinued course of welldoing restore you once more to my love and favourthough never never can you again occupy the place you once held in my heart you have acted like a felon and shall receive a felons reward beware what you do sir cried george frowning in his turn get your menial to punish me in this degrading manner and you will repent it to the last day of your life oh monstrous depravity do you dare to threaten me take off your jacket sirralph give him twenty lashes and dont spare the whip the man drew back i cannot strike my masters son do as i bid you the boy stood firm as a rock his lips compressed his brow rigid and his face livid in its ghastly pallor turning from his stern parent to the old man he said with an air of calm indifference i am ready perform your task i am not the first victim who has suffered wrongfully my saviour endured a harder scourge i will learn patience from his cross what barefaced wickedness groaned the doctor god grant him repentance and save his miserable soul amen said ralph as he turned to his abhorrent task with an energy equal to the guilt of the criminal george bore the severe castigation without a murmur when it was over doctor leatrim told him to go to his own room and pray to god to soften his hard and impenitent heart as the boy passed his father on his way out he gave him a look full of love and compassion and said in a firm voice sir i pity and forgive you if you have erred it was under the full conviction that you were doing your duty he closed the door softly and staggered up to his own chamber what was there in that look that went so home to the heart of the stern fatherin those loving broken words of the poor abused boy if they did not stagger the conviction of his guilt they made him feel most unhappy had he acted well or wisely or like a christian was the punishment that he had inflictedso harsh and degrading to a sensitive mindlikely to produce the desired effect he could not answer the question in a manner at all satisfactory to his mind or still the sharp upbraidings of conscience and flinging himself upon his knees he buried his face in his hands and offered up to god an agony of repentant tears chapter iii george leatrims first thought was to go to his mother but then she was ill and happily unconscious of what had taken place besides like his father she might believe the evidence that ralph had witnessed against him and he had not the fortitude to bear that as his passion subsided he had courage to recall the painful events of the past hour and to acknowledge that the circumstances by which he was surrounded were suspicious enough to condemn him in any court of law and must be maddening to a proud sensitive man like his father struggling with the shame and agony of his position he could not recognise this before or admit that both his father and ralph might be deceived he had never felt the severe corporeal punishment during its infliction his mind was in too violent a state of agitation to care for bodily suffering but now that he was alone the fiery indignation that had upheld his spirit in the hour of his humiliation flickered and went out and the sense of degradation and intolerable wrong alone remained he remembered how his father had spurned him from his feet had called him a thief and a liar and witnessed unmoved the infliction of a cruel punishment administered by the hand of the menial who had accused him of the crime and had ordered him from his presence without one word of pity or affection these afterthoughts were terrible george felt that he had not deserved this severity and the tears which pride had restrained while under the weight of ralph wilsons unsparing hand now burst forth in a torrent and he wept until the lamp of life flickered to extinction in his panting breast the mother whom he wished to save from the knowledge of his degradation awoke suddenly from a short and disturbed sleep she heard the sobs and moans in the adjoining room and recognised the voice of her son the next moment saw her seated upon his bed her arms around the weeping boy all sense of her own sickness of her weak state was gone she was only conscious of his intense mental agony he placed his aching head upon her faithful breast he wound his trembling arms around her slender neck and poured into her sympathizing ear the terrible tale of his wrongshow he had been falsely accused of the commission of a heinous crime his protestations of innocence disregarded and had been sentenced by his father to receive a punishment more galling to him than death that he had been tempted to rebel against his fathers authority and curse the hand that smote himto hate where he had loved with such fond idolatry the good mother listened attentively and weighed every circumstance the frankness of his unreserved confession convinced her of its truth when all the sad tale was told she took him in her pitying arms and told him that though all the world should believe him guilty she felt that he was innocent from her very soul god bless you dearest best mother sobbed the poor boy covering her hand with kisses i knew you would not condemn me i never have nor ever will give you cause to be ashamed of me but my fatherit seems unnatural monstrous that he should believe me guilty at once i shall never get over it it crushes my heart it presses out my life if i could only convince him of my innocence i could die in peace dont talk of dying george leave your cause to god he can bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make the black cloud that now envelopes you as clear as the noonday let me go to your father george i think i can convince him of your innocence and that he has acted too hastily exhausted as he was george grasped his mothers hand and held her fast i could not see him again while this conflict is going on in my mindnot while he looks upon me as a felon a disgrace to his name and family the brand must be removed from my brow before i meet him face to face i want to love him as i once loved him i feel as if i never could love him again again the voice became choked and hoarse and the lad gave way to a fresh agony of tears after a while he grew calmer and said in a whisper mother pray for mepray with me that i may bear this cross with christian fortitude and be taught to forgive my enemiesyes as he the dear master forgave them he continued reverently folding his hands together and gave his life for sinners like me and died the just for the unjust they prayed long and earnestly that sorrowful mother and son at length a light broke over the pallid countenance of the youth he raised his head slowly and with difficulty from that dear mothers supporting arms and gazed into her tearful eyes with a look of unutterable love mother blessed mother he whispered the agony is over i feel calm and happy now our prayers are accepted the divine peace which christ bestowed upon his disciples his last best gift is filling my heart and the anger i felt at my dear fathers unjust suspicions is lost in pity and love my sorrows are over his alas are to come to you dearest mother i leave the task of reconciliation you will vindicate my memory and teach him to respect me in death and that miserable old mantell him to deal gently with him for my sake tell him that i forgive him that he must forgive him also and lead the sinner back to god he paused and panted for breath george cried the terrified mother you are ill let me send for dr aldis and call your father too late who can heal a broken heart it will soon be over god is dealing very gently with me beloved mother let the thought console you that you have a son in heaven but my father my dear unhappy father may god comfort him it grows very dark i cannot see your sweet face mother but all around is joy and peace a shade passed over the noble young face a tremor shook the slight frame of the dying boy and the enfranchized spirit throwing off the last coil of clay followed the unseen messenger to the land of the hereafter a shriek a loud piercing shriek rang through the silent house dr leatrim started from his knees and rushed upstairs the next moment he was standing beside the bed of his son upon which his wife was sitting with the head of the dead boy in her lap the doctor staggered like a drunken man and held to the bedpost for support he comprehended the awful truth at a glance but the conviction was too terrible to receive at once it was an illusion of the senses a ghastly vision it was too dreadful to be a hard everyday fact he had poured out his soul to god had deplored to the great judge that his sentence had been too severe that kindness would have done more to soften the proud heart of the boy than the violent course he had adopted he had just made up his mind to go to george and once more address him with love and confidence when that horrid cry wrung from a mothers breaking heart closed the doors of mercy for ever and left him desolate and childless mary he gasped out do not say that he is dead it is but sleep or exhaustion it cannot be that he is dead his wife was quite calm now with a mournful smile she pointed to the beautiful face of the dead the seal of god is on that brow your severity could only destroy the body god has claimed the soul i cannot weep for him he is happier than his parents can you now look in that pure face and believe him guilty o woman great is your faith but the proofhow can i do away with the proof of his crime leave that to me i have a solemn duty to perform for my murdered son may god give me strength for the task call ralph wilson but do not tell him what has happened humbled and subdued but still unconvinced of his sons innocence the doctor left the room and shortly returned followed by the old man mrs leatrim motioned to him to approach the bed rigid and immoveable the doctor resumed his place still grasping the bedpost to support him from falling mrs leatrim spoke slowly and with some effort but every word fell distinctly upon his ear ralph wilson this is your work i my lady i did not kill him i did not strike him hard enough for that it was the doctor that ordered me to do it i begged him to have mercy on the lad o lord who would have thought of his taking a little beating so to heart the old man turned from the bed and cried aloud a slanderous tongue is sharper than a twoedged sword to noble natures like his it strikes home to the heart ralph wilson you are an old man standing on the very verge of the grave you accused my son of theft and declared on your word of honour as a christian that you saw him commit the robbery yes my lady a dreadful business my lady but too true i demand in proof of this that you come here and lay your hands upon the brow of your victim and swear by the living god by your hopes of salvation through the blood of christ that you saw george leatrim commit this crime the man made a few steps forward his face became livid large drops of perspiration trickled down his forehead his teeth chattered together and a universal spasm convulsed his features you dare not do it said mrs leatrim pointing to the calm majestic face of her son to witness against him now were to lie in the face of god i have murdered him sobbed the old man sinking on his knees at his masters feet it was i who stole the money you ralph and the doctor tried to shake himself free from the grasp of the withered hands that clutched his garments oh my poor injured boy yes i did it continued ralph in a tone of despair the devil tempted me as he did judas to betray his master i have been a hypocrite all my life i loved goldi worshipped iti lost no opportunity of obtaining it when i could escape detection but it has destroyed my miserable soul but why lay the robbery of the box on george asked dr leatrim you were safe from detection i never suspected you but he did returned the old man bitterly he never loved me i saw it in his eye i knew it by his manner he believed me to be a rogue though he dared not express his opinion in words i hated him because he knew my character and to ensure my own safety i denounced him and what do you think of your work and the doctor turned ralphs face towards the dead mercy mercy shrieked the felon i would rather die upon the gallows than look in that face again you will have to meet it once more and that before long ralph wilson to answer for this foul murder at the judgmentseat of christ with a heavy groan the old man fell down in a swoon at his masters feet deal gently with ralph said a low voice from the bed george made it his dying request he not only forgave him his sin against himself but charged you to do so for his sake my dear afflicted husband continued mrs leatrim let us be thankful to the heavenly father that he has cleared the stain of guilt from the memory of a beloved son and placed him beyond the power of sin and temptation for ever and what became of the wicked old man said i eagerly that night mrs leatrim died her sons tragic end brought on a fatal return of her dangerous malady when ralph heard of her death he went out and hung himself what dr leatrims feelings were at this unlookedfor desolation of all his earthly hopes one can only imagine it is impossible to describe one grave contained the mortal remains of the mother and son and the sad story created for the bereaved husband and father a worldwide sympathy it was some years after the occurrence of this domestic tragedy before i visited westcliff time had softened the anguish of the wound but it was still unclosed and left the traces of a deep incurable grief in my uncles face he had become a drooping whitehaired man but was still at his post a faithful and zealous minister of the gospel sorrow had worn smooth all the harsh angles in his character and made him simple and affectionate as a little child he had borne the cross and worn the crown of thorns and purified by selfdenial and suffering had found love a more powerful weapon than fear in bringing souls to christ his calamities had endeared him to his people and he had become their pastor in the truest sense of the word on the anniversary of the day when george and his mother died dr leatrim holds a solemn fast and excludes himself from every eye spending the long day in meditation and prayer one fine summer evening last july i was strolling through westcliff churchyard and found the dear old man lying on the turf that covered the remains of his wife and son he called me to him this little hillock of green sod he said contains all that was once dearest to me on earth my heart rebelled against god when my treasures were taken from me but the judge of all the earth knew what was best for my eternal peace it was not until these idols were shattered in the dust that i discovered that i was poor and blind and naked and not a righteous man wiser and better than my neighbours in my deep sorrow and humiliation i was taught the knowledge of myself that i was still in my sins a proud unregenerated man yes i can now acknowledge with the deepest gratitude that heavy and maddening as the blow was it was necessary to bring me to god and make me a true christian i went up to the monument it was a simple urn of white marble surrounded by beautiful flowering shrubs the inscription that recorded the untimely death of his son made me start it was so painfully characteristic of the truthfulness of the father here repose in peace the mortal remains of george leatrim who died at the age of of a broken heart caused by a false accusation and the unchristian severity of his too credulous father reader mourn not for the dead but weep sore for the living i saw that my uncle was watching me with his eyes full of tears he told me the sad story you have just read sitting beside that grave in the dim twilight how much i respected the undying love of the faithful heart that never sought to spare himself in the mournful narration ah he said rising from his recumbent posture and speaking in a cheerful hopeful voice how little we know of the spirit of which we are made i have reason to rejoiceay and i do rejoicethat god gave me such a son and that he died a true christian martyr forgiving and praying for the wretched sinners that caused his death
