the world before them a novel by mrs moodie author of roughing it in the bush in three volumes vol iii illustration london richard bentley new burlington street london printed by a schulze poland street the world before them chapter i mrs gilbert rushmere the dinner was so well cooked and so nicely served that in spite of the unusual hour mrs rowly and her daughter made a very hearty meal mrs rushmeres easy chair had been drawn to the head of the table and dorothy sat beside her and carved gilbert being unable at present to cut his own food dorothy longed to do it for him when she observed how unwillingly his wife performed this necessary service i am a great trouble to you sophy he said but directly my arm is healed i shall soon learn to help myself as i have seen others do who had met with the same misfortune it is a good thing to have a wife to help you suggested mrs rowly yes but it makes a fellow feel so dependent he has to submit through sheer necessity to petticoat government a dont think that even one arm would make me do that said rushmere tho i believe a had the best wife in christendom mrs rushmere laughed goodnaturedly oh lawrence men be often under their wives government an as ignorant of the fact as babies you speak i suppose from experience said mrs gilbert in her gentle low voice i should have thought the old gentleman a very difficult person for any wife to manage i find gilbert a hard case in spite of his one arm theres only one way to rule me and thats by kindness returned gilbert without meaning it perhaps his voice assumed a serious tone almost amounting to sadness he looked up and his eyes and dorothys met forcing an appearance of gaiety he said what have you to say on the subject dorothy i never give an opinion on subjects i know nothing about i am the only person in the room who cannot speak from experience i should think your plan however must be the best it is a pity you have not an opportunity of trying it miss whats your name said mrs gilbert in which case you might perhaps find out that kindness can be thrown away i expected to find dorothy married when i came home said gilbert i thought it impossible that the young fellows in the neighbourhood could suffer her to remain single she waited for you gilly till she found it o no use cried rushmere passing the bottle to his son oh that i had waited for her was the thought that flashed through gilberts mind charged with a deep regret father will have his joke said dorothy colouring like a rose without thinking that it may be at the expense of another mrs gilbert left off eating and listened keenly to what was passing believe me gilbert that there is no one present who congratulates you more sincerely on your marriage than i do my dear child will you help me up stairs said mrs rushmere apprehensive of mischief from her husbands blunt indiscretion and want of delicacy gilbert rose and with his left arm supported her to the foot of the stairs oh dorothy he said no wonder that you despise me god only knows how i despise myself it is too late to repent now gilbert you must try like me to forget you owe it to your wife as much as to me she passed her arm round mrs rushmeres waist and left gilbert at the foot of the stairs he put the cuff of his empty sleeve to his eyes was it to wipe away a tear his wife looked daggers at him when he returned to the table his father proposed a walk round the farm after dinner an invitation that gilbert eagerly accepted and the mother and daughter were left alone together we shall have a nice time of it here said mrs gilbert let us go out mother and take a look round the premises one might as well be in a prison as confined to this dark dingy room i can see no garden attached to the place said mrs rowly looking out of the deep bay window which only opened upon the stonepaved court that girl who helped at dinner could tell us all about it dont call her mamma i have a perfect horror of that woman i am certain that gilbert and she have been very intimate he never took his eyes off her during dinner you need not be jealous of her sophy i am certain that she cares nothing for him you are foolish to trouble your head with any love affairs he had previous to his marriage but i am sure he cares for her and i dont mean to play second fiddle in his fathers house to any one but mrs rushmere if this girl remains in the house i must quit it and would you like to nurse the sick mother i hate sick people let her hire a nurse she may not be able to do that i see no indications of wealth here a carpetless sanded floor and furniture old enough to have come out of the ark one room which serves for drawingroom diningroom and parlour i dare say these poor people have enough to do to keep themselves but gilbert said that his father was rich pshaw you see now gilbert has exaggerated matters but what are we to do i cant and wont live here till your debts are paid you must oh dear i wish i were single again and mrs gilbert began to cry sophy when you were single you were never contented always lamenting that you were not married no one ever asked you to marry until i gave out that you would have a fortune and what have i gained by that lie a handsome honest fellow if you would only think so he would not have been so badly off either if he had not been forced to sell his commission to pay your debts he had a fair chance too of rising in the army if he had not met with that misfortune i think you very unreasonable to throw all the blame on him what now remains for you to do is to make yourself agreeable to his parents and secure a home such as it is for us i cant pretend to like that old man and sophy shrugged her shoulders hes rather an amusing variety of the species said mrs rowly and the easiest person in the world to cajole but once more let me tell you mrs gilbert rushmere it is no use quarrelling with your bread and butter put on your hat and let us take a turn in the open air perhaps we may chance to meet the gentlemen and now they are gone to spy out the nakedness of the land we will tell our readers a little of their private history and how the young soldier was deceived in his fortunehunting speculation mrs rowly was the widow of a customhouse officer and for many years lived very comfortably nay affluently upon the spoils which he gathered illegally in his office their only child sophia though very far from pretty was a genteellooking girl and educated at a fashionable boardingschool but just as she arrived at womanhood the father was detected in his unlawful pursuits and so heavily fined that it caused his utter ruin and having incurred heavy debts to keep up an appearance beyond his station he ended his days in prison leaving his wife and daughter to shift for themselves in the best manner they could with the assistance of a brother who was in the grocery line of business and of whom they had always been ashamed in their more prosperous days mrs rowly set up a small boardinghouse in one of the little cross streets in the minories and just contrived to keep her head above water for several years until sophia was turned of sevenandtwenty the young lady dressed and flirted and tried her best to get a husband but all her endeavours proved futile she was ambitious too of marrying a gentleman and looked down with contempt upon shopkeepers assistants clerks in lawyers offices and mechanics until the time had nearly slipped by when she could hope without fortune to marry at all it was then that her mother finding herself deeply involved circulated the report in her neighbourhood that sophy had been left six thousand pounds on the death of a cousin a consumptive boy who could not reasonably be expected to live many months the bait took miss rowly was invited to houses she never before had hoped to enter and at a ball given by the mother of an officer in gilberts regiment she met the handsome young man just raised to the rank of a subaltern who had so gallantly saved the life of captain fitzmorris though still rather countrified in his appearance she was instantly smitten by his frank free manners and his fine manly figure some foolish fellow in the shape of a friend whispered in gilberts ear that the young lady would have a fortune in a rash moment when a little heated by wine and won by her soft flatteries he made her an offer of marriage this was instantly accepted particularly as gilbert boylike had boasted of his old ancestral home and the noble family from which he was descended and besides all this he was an officer in the army and likely to rise in his profession under the patronage of a wealthy nobleman like lord wilton miss rowly was charmed with her future prospects gilbert proposed to take her down to hadstone as his wife directly the campaign was over but his charming sophia was too fearful of losing him during that indefinite period and got her mother to propose to him that they should be married before he left for spain and that she would accompany him abroad they were married but the affectionate bride when the time for his departure drew nigh forgot this part of her promise and preferred staying at home with her mother to encountering all the hardships attendant upon a soldiers wife whose husband was on actual service in a foreign land during his absence mrs gilbert and her mother enjoyed every comfort on the credit of their supposed fortune and when he returned sick and disabled from spain he had not been many days at mrs rowlys before he was arrested for the debts his wife had contracted since their marriage it was then that gilbert discovered what a dupe he had been that the woman he had taken to his bosom was a miserable deceiver and he had to sell his commission to avoid the horrors of a prison after much recrimination and mutual upbraidings on the part of gilbert and his wife they at last came to the conclusion that it was useless to quarrel over what could no longer be remedied that it was far better to sit down calmly and consider what was to be done all mrs rowlys furniture had been seized and sold for the benefit of her creditors for she was as deeply involved as her daughter why cant we go home to your fathers asked mrs rowly i am sure your parents will be glad to see you gilbert had some doubts on that head he knew how he had deserted them and never having received a line from them to assure him of their forgiveness though this had been his own fault in omitting to tell them where and how to direct him he was sadly at a loss how to act and then he thought of dorothy and wondered if she were unmarried and living still with the old people if so how should he be able to meet her and introduce her to the cold selfish woman he had preferred to her no he could not he dared not go back to hadstone why dont you answer gilbert urged his wife what prevents you from going home i parted with my father in anger i am doubtful for he is an obstinate man whether he will be willing to receive us dont put him to the trial said mrs rowly let sophy write and tell him we are coming and start without giving him time to send a refusal we must go somewhere to remain here is impossible for you cannot draw your pension for the next six months and we cannot live upon air gilbert was terribly perplexed while pride forbade him to seek an asylum with his parents necessity compelled him to do so and though he now almost loathed both his wife and her mother he was too manly to leave them in distress he therefore sold his watch his sword and regimental suit to procure money to prosecute their journey and when he arrived at hadstone he had only a few shillings left in his purse the kind reception he met with cut him to the heart and the sight of that beautiful girl who might have been his almost maddened him with grief and remorse when he proposed that walk with his father he fully intended to open his mind to him and tell him how he was situated but shame and pride kept him tongue tied besides was it not his fathers fault that he had not married the woman he loved and could he expect an avaricious man to sympathize with him in the misery he endured or feel for his present poverty and degradation so he walked by his fathers side over the old fields that had witnessed his labours with dorothy without saying a word upon the subject nearest his heart it was with feelings of inward disgust that he saw his wife and her mother coming over the heath to meet them chapter ii how people are taught to hate one another mrs rowly had been chiding her daughter for showing her temper before her husbands family pointing out the imprudence of her conduct in such forcible language that the young lady had promised to behave more cautiously for the future she greeted mr rushmere with her blandest smile and slipping the little white hand within his arm told him in her softest voice that he must teach her all about farming as she did not know wheat from barley or a pig from a calf lord bless your ignorance my dear in what part o the world were you raised oh im a cockney born within the sound of bow bells what else can you expect of me i never was out of london before i am afraid i shall rival the renowned citizen who immortalized himself by finding out that a cock neighed i dont think however that i could be quite so foolish as that old rushmere was highly flattered by the attention paid to him by his daughterinlaw he complimented her upon her sweet little hand and foot and told her that he envied gilbert his pretty wife though if the truth must be spoken young mrs rushmere had no beauty of which to boast beyond a slight graceful figure and the small hands and feet which had attracted the farmers attention her face was something worse than plain it was a cold arrogant deceitful face with harsh strongly marked features and a pair of long narrow eyes that never looked honestly or openly at any one reminding you of some stealthy animal ever on the watch for a deadly spring she loved to say things that she knew would annoy and irritate in a coldblooded contemptuous way and under those half closed eyelids lurked any amount of malice and low cunning though weak in intellect and very vain she was as obstinate as a mule and though moving in a different position from martha wood there was a great congeniality of disposition between them sophia rushmere was a petty tyrant martha wood though less cold and calculating than her mistress knew how to rule over her and make her a tool and a slave the pair were well worthy of each other mrs rushmere though simple and natural as a child had read sophias character at a glance she looked in that dubious face and felt that it was false she listened to that low soft studied voice and was convinced that the owner could speak in far other and less musical tones and she wondered how gilbert could have taken this artificial woman in preference to her dorothy and the good mother pitied him from her very heart mrs rowly though sharp and angular with a ridiculous assumption of consequence was not so disagreeable as her daughter she looked like a person who could speak her mind and that in the coarsest and most decided manner and carry her point against overwhelming odds by sheer pretence and impudence but she could not conceal like sophia her real disposition if she betrayed like judas for money it would not be with a kiss what do you think of my poor gilberts wife said mrs rushmere to dorothy that afternoon as the latter sat beside her bed dont ask me dear mother i have no opinion to give he is an unhappy man dorothy as all men deserve to be who sell themselves for money he had better ha died in yon battle than tied himself to that woman dorothy thought so too but she gave no expression to her thoughts she merely remarked that the marriage might turn out better than mrs rushmere expected the meeting between dorothy and her lover had been less painful than she had anticipated she no longer regretted the separation which had occasioned her so much anguish but fervently thanked god that his providence had so ordered it and she knew from the deep sense of gratitude that overflowed her heart that it was for the best that gilbert rushmere though greatly improved in his appearance and manners was not the man to make her happy the enlargement of her own mind and the society of intelligent people had made her crave for something higher and better mentally and morally than he could ever bestow she entertained for him much of the old sisterly affection which she felt for him when they were boy and girl but nothing beyond she did not like his wife but excused the hostility of her manner towards herself if she had been made aware of the relation which once existed between her and gilbert she thought it perfectly natural placed in the same situation as mrs gilbert she might feel a little jealous of an old love too in this opinion dorothy greatly underrated the high sense of moral rectitude which actuated her general conduct under the greatest provocation she would have despised herself for wantonly wounding the feelings of another she longed to leave the house for she dreaded the insolence of mrs gilbert and her mother but mrs rushmere had so pathetically entreated her to stay and nurse her that she felt that it would be the height of ingratitude to refuse a last request made by a dying friend and of one to whom she owed so much she wanted to go and consult mrs martin who would point out the best course to pursue in avoiding unpleasant collisions with gilberts friends but she was kept so fully employed that no opportunity presented itself in the meanwhile martha wood had not been idle in the kitchen by the dint of cajoling and flattering polly she had wormed out of her some of the family secrets which she lost no time in turning into capital when called by her mistress to attend her to her chamber at night she came with a face full of importance as if she had something very particular to communicate well martha how have you got through the day cried mrs gilbert opening her eyes a little wider than usual as her confidant approached to undress her oh badly enough maam that polly welton is a horrid low creature not above six months out of the workhouse you ought to have a fellow feeling for her martha said mrs gilbert spitefully i was not a workhouse bird mrs rushmere returned martha swelling and puffing out her broad cheeks you know that well enough my father was a gentleman and i was brought up at a private institution at his expense you need not try to fool me about that martha you have attempted often enough but it wont go down your father might or might not have been a gentleman you were a natural child and your mother a poor creature who got her living on the streets so no more of your fine airs to me what have you been doing with yourself all day sitting in the kitchen nursing jewel said the girl with a sulky scowl you might have been doing something why did not you offer to help the girl wash the dishes when you are mistress here i will do what you bid me i have no call to wait upon them but they will not keep you for nothing martha i dont want them if you are not satisfied give me my release and let me go i could soon get a better place nonsense you must do as i bid you and see that you help that girl polly in her work tomorrow you would not wish me to help her if you knew all the vile things she said of you replied martha in an audible aside of me what could she say of me she knows nothing of me or my affairs she did not say she did but she said that you were old and ugly and not to be compared with miss dolly that you had not a single good feature in your face what do you think of the picture the wretch but how came she to say all this just because i asked her who the plain dark girl was that mrs rushmere called dorothy she fired up like a vulgar vixen as she is and defended her friend by abusing you i thought we should have come from words to blows for i could not sit by and hear my own mistress abused after that fashion but if you wish me to help her of course i can ill tell gilbert ill complain to mr rushmere sobbed sophia crying for rage if he suffers me to be insulted by his servant ill leave the house ive no doubt that dorothy is at the bottom of it allwho and what is she some child that mrs rushmere adopted years ago polly told me that it was for love of her that mr gilbert ran away and listed for a soldier because the old man would not give his consent and this dorothy refused to marry him mrs gilberts misery was now complete she sat down in a chair with her fair hair all loose about her shoulders staring at the incendiary in a wild vacant manner at this unfortunate moment gilbert entered the room hurrying up to his wife he demanded the cause of her distress are you a man gilbert rushmere she said slowing rising and confronting him to allow your wife to be insulted by your fathers menials how and in what manner sophy she repeated the tale of her wrongs as martha had told them gilberts eye flashedhe turned them angrily upon martha who was secretly enjoying the mischief she had made go to your bed girl and let me never hear any of this vile tattling again it is such stories carried from one to the other that ruin the peace of families martha knew that the arrows she had launched had struck home and left the room without a word in her defence gilbert turned sorrowfully to his wife who was crying violently sophy if you will encourage that girl in bringing you tales about other members of the family how can we ever live in peace you know the imperative necessity of curbing your temper until i am able in some way to provide a living for you why will you frustrate all my plans for your comfort by this childish folly how dare you talk to me sir in that strain when you had the dastardly cruelty of bringing me down here to live in the same house as your former mistress she rose and stood before him with her hand raised in a menacing attitude and a smile of scorn writhing her lip good heavens sophia what do you mean i mean what i say sir it is useless for you to deny facts so apparent will you have the assurance to say to me that you do not love this girlthis dorothy chance the love i once felt for her certainly not the love you still feel for her demanded the angry wife sophia i am a married man yes sir i know it to my cost but that is no answer to my question i despise the hypocritical evasion you know in your heart that you prefer this woman to your wife you will force me to do so sophia if you go on at this unreasonable rate you must be aware that dorothy chance was brought up with me under this roof and it was natural that i should feel something more than brotherly love for a creature so beautiful and good stop hold your tongue i wont hear another word screamed sophy such a confession is enough to drive me mad it has nothing to do with you wife all this is past and gone and happened before ever i saw you if my father would have given his consent to our marriage you would never have been so unfortunate as to become my wife and i should never have been tricked into the belief that you loved me and were a woman of fortune he laughed bitterly for he saw that this latter observation had completely silenced his wife who slowly and sullenly retreated towards the bed and he continued my love for dorothy at that time was a species of madness i loved her with all my heart and soul with every faculty of mind and body she was young gay and lighthearted and i thought returned my passion very coldly i was impatient of delay and very jealous i urged her to marry me without waiting for the old mans consent she had promised him not to do so and stood to her word refusing my hand before his very face my god shall i ever forget the mortification and rage of that moment i could have killed her my redhot love turned to ice i left the house wishing never to see her face again and perhaps had i known that she was still here i never should have thrown myself in her way are you satisfied now sophia i think you ought to be after such a degrading confession his wife did not answer though she heard every word she had slipped into bed and pretended to be sound asleep chapter iii a dead dog before gilbert went to sleep that night he fully determined to tell his father the real state of his affairs and throw himself and his family upon his charity until something should enable him to get a decent living the loss of his arm was a great drawback he well knew but he had the reputation of being an excellent practical farmer which made him entertain strong hopes of being employed as a bailiff or overseer on some gentlemans estate he trusted that lord wilton would assist him in procuring such a situation and probably would employ him on his own property in return for the service he had rendered his son he knew that his father was a close calculator of domestic expenditure that he would soon be tired of keeping such a large addition to his family without receiving an equivalent from them in money or services he might grumble now and then of having to board him and his wife gratis but the additional expense of mrs rowly and the servant for any length of time would make him outrageous in everything pertaining to household matters sophia was as ignorant as a child she had been brought up to catch a rich husband not to soil her pretty white hands with work to spend her time before the glass in adorning her person or to lie on a sofa reading novels he had urged her before leaving london to part with martha but she obstinately refused to do so the idea of waiting upon herself she said was not to be tolerated for a moment marthas term of apprenticeship had not expired and she was bound to keep her and as to dear mamma she must accompany them for she had no money to procure a lodging elsewhere what was to be done with such impracticable people was beyond gilberts power to devise he turned and tossed all night and the day broke and found him as undecided as ever in the morning he walked out after breakfast to the hayfield with his father and had an excellent opportunity of getting the trouble that perplexed him off his mind but his courage failed him altogether and he put off the dreaded disclosure that he was utterly destitute from day to day his wife at last suggested that he had better tell his mother and leave it to her to break the matter to mr rushmere entreating him at the same time to spare her in the relation as much as he possibly could since the day of their arrival at heath farm mrs rushmere had rapidly declined and was now entirely confined to her own room which dorothy never left without it was to arrange with polly the cooking and the necessary work of the day gilbert generally went up to spend an hour with his mother during the absence of her kind nurse and in one of these interviews he informed her of his humiliating position and implored her advice and assistance in his present emergency mrs rushmere was greatly distressed by his communication simple and natural as a child herself she possessed a great insight into character and though she seldom saw either of the women with whom her son had unfortunately connected himself she had read their characters and foresaw in case of her death the miserable life that her dear old partner would lead with either of them as mistress of the house dorothy of course would have to leave directly she had followed her to the grave she reproached herself for keeping the poor girl in her present disagreeable position but dorothy had promised her to put up with every insult and slight patiently for her sake and mrs rushmere rightly conjectured that the time of her emancipation was not far distant well my poor son i will speak to your father about this sad business you must not be impatient if he feels angry and resentful i know how he rejoiced in the idea of your being a rich man this will be a cruel disappointment to him oh mother dear it was his fault had he been only a little less avaricious i might at this moment have been a happy man he laid his head beside her on the pillow and wept like a child that night mr rushmere was duly informed of the communication gilbert had made to his mother he had however carefully concealed the duplicity of his wife with regard to the fortune by saying that she had fully believed that she was to be heir to her uncles property and was as much disappointed as himself old rushmere sat for some time beside his wifes bed astonished and almost stupefied oh dang it wife he broke out at last this is a confounded bad business and ruination to us all to think that the boy should be sich a simple fool to go an marry a woman older nor himself without being sure o the money sold his commission too and to pay her debtsworse and worsean nothing but the pension for his wound to depend on to keep his wife an mother from starving well well that ever lawrence rushmere should be father to such a simpleton lawrence and mrs rushmere took the large brown hand of her husband between her thin pale hands you must forgive him for my sake dang it wife how am i going to keep all this posse o people its unreasonable that it be a wont do it he be your only son lawrence all that will soon be left to you o me oh mary you are not going to leave me not yet not yet a few more years and then we must both go but oh not yet not yet my dear good wife get hearty and well and old larry will do all you require o him the stout old yeoman bent over the pillow and kissed the pale meek face of his wife and the tears from her gentle blue eyes well larry dear you must do this for me whiles i be living give your son an his family a home until such time as poor gillys arms healed an he be able to help himself you are not a poor man husband an can spare this much for an only son an remember he might have done better if ye would only ha let him aye im sorry for that now doll would have made him a better wife than his butterfly o a woman if so be i have to keep her gilly must set her to work an the old mother likewise im not going to keep a house full o sarvants to wait upon them neighbour sly wants a girl an will take polly off your hands lawrence an this martha wood can fill her place but leave me dorothy my darling dorothy till i be gone it wont be long on the whole rushmere behaved better than could be expected at dinner he told gilbert that his mother had informed him of his troubles and he was willing to take him as partner in the farm he was to manage the concern and dispose of all the produce sharing the returns equally with him dorothy looked earnestly at the old man when he made this proposal she knew enough of human nature to feel convinced that it would never work well that old rushmere would never consent to act under the direction of his son and that his labourers who were very fond of him would never serve two masters but her influence for good in that house was over advice or remonstrance with a man of rushmeres obstinate character was alike vain gilbert was profuse in his expressions of gratitude which were echoed by the ladies and now my dear said the old man turning to mrs gilbert i cant afford to keep idle folk what can you do for a living can you cook i never was brought up to kitchen work father returned mrs gilbert in a very bland voice but i can try dolly can teach you i shant trouble her muttered the newly installed mistress of the house a woman of sense surely may acquire a knowledge of such trifling matters without any particular instructions ah my dear but it requires experience said rushmere it dont want a person to be able to read an write to brew good ale an make sweet butter an bake light bread but it do want practical knowledge o such work as dorothy here can tell you she be a first rate housekeeper you need not refer me to dorothy chance mr rushmere while my own mother is present she always was considered a capital manager i dessay i dessay quoth rushmere nodding pleasantly towards the lady in question mrs rowly looks like a woman well acquainted with work an it would be strange if you could not manage the house an dairy between you i think mr rushmere there will be no occasion to employ so many hands in the kitchen said mrs rowly glancing significantly at dorothy surely my daughter and martha with the assistance i can give them ought to be sufficient certainly certainly cried old rushmere those be exactly my sentiments maam too many cooks spoil the broth polly goes when her month expires to mrs slys an dorothy when my dear old wife the farmer stopped short he could not finish the sentence cannot i nurse mrs rushmere said mrs rowly i have had a great deal of experience in that way no doubt you could said rushmere howsomever she wont suffer any one to help her but dorothy i shall leave you father the moment my services are no longer required said dorothy i have a good home and kind friends to go to it is only on dear mothers account that i have remained so long i shall gladly resign to mrs gilbert my place in the house the next morning on going into the kitchen dorothy found mrs gilbert and her mother up to their eyes in business examining the contents of cupboards and pantries and making a great litter and confusion everywhere she was told when she offered her assistance in restoring the place to order that her services were not required by mrs gilbert whom she must now consider as mistress of the house that she must not presume to interfere with martha wood and her work but confine herself entirely to mrs rushmeres chamber and mrs gilbert commenced her reign over heath farm by treating dorothy and polly as creatures beneath her notice and decidedly in the way while she encouraged martha in her mischievous tattling until she set polly and her by the ears together old rushmere grumbled over the badly cooked dinners the heavy bread and sour butter and blamed dorothy for what certainly she could not help one morning dorothy went down into the kitchen to prepare a little broth for the poor invalid the fire was out and everything in the greatest confusion a greasy unwashed floor and dirty towels and dusters scattered around on tables and chairs it was impossible to get the least thing done without worry and difficulty polly she said very gently while you remain here you should do your duty to your employers why is your kitchen so dirty and your fire always out when i want to cook broth or gruel for your poor sick mistress things should not be in this disgraceful condition and you have martha to help you martha help me lauk miss dorothy she

go down directly the breakfus wor over miss dorothy wull want it says i to make the old missus her broth let her want says she or make it hersel i dont mean to attend to her wants i can tell you alas alas sighed dorothy what a house of misrule poor old father how will it be with him by and bye when they begin to abuse their power so early like the sailors she saw breakers ahead but had no power to steer the vessel off the rocks missus gilbert continued polly glad of getting some one to whom she could tell her griefs is allers jawing me for not doing the work but while her fat lazy girl sits doing naught but towzleing the dawg im not a goin to kill mysel wi work bear it patiently for a few hours polly you will soon be free now run theres a good girl to the woodstack and bring some sticks to rekindle the fire in a few minutes polly rushed back to the kitchen and flung an arm full of sticks down with a bang upon the hearth that could be heard all over the house and holding up her hands cried out at the top of her voice as been an gone an done it i knew a wud directly a got a chance done what demanded dorothy her cheeks blanching with terror owr pincher ha chawed up yon lump o white wool killed mrs gilberts little poodle ah as dead as a door nail i am sorry for it very sorry she will make an awful fuss about it polly did you see pincher do it no but martha says a did it she oughter to know see she be coming in crying an roaring as if it wor a dead child martha ran into the kitchen carrying the dead dog in her arms screaming and shouting in a state of great excitement oh the precious jewel the darling pet what will my mistress say how shall i tell her oh oh oh hearing from the next room the outcries of her servant mrs gilbert hurried in and demanded what all the noise was about oh maam just look here at your beautiful dog sobbed martha holding up the little creature from whose throat the blood was dripping all over the floor who has dared to ill use my dog cried sophy rushmere not yet aware he was dead and she turned and glared at polly with the ferocity of a tigress oh he is dead screamed martha stone dead who killed him the horrid brute pincher call mr gilbert to shoot the monster a cant do it maam said polly very innocently a ha got but one arm hold your tongue you impudent jade i have no doubt you set the other dog to worry him mrs gilbert took the dead dog in her arms and cried aloud dorothy went up to her and very kindly offered to examine the little animal and ascertain whether he was really dead dont touch him screamed sophy pushing her rudely away i dare say you are glad of his death and know more about it than you choose to say dorothy drew back with an air of disgust i can excuse your grief and annoyance at the death of the poor dog who was a pretty harmless little creature but not your insulting those who never injured him perhaps if it were a fellowcreature you would not feel the least distress about it martha said mrs gilbert paying no heed to her go and call your master i will be revenged on that ferocious beast if he refuses to kill him i will kill him myself dorothy became suddenly aware of the danger that threatened her old favourite good heavens she thought this cruel woman will never execute her threat gilbert will not suffer her to destroy the good old dog mrs gilbert she said in a voice of entreaty i hope you do not mean to hurt the dog it is the nature of these animals to quarrel and fight with each other the death of pincher would do you no good while it would greatly distress mrs rushmere who loves the dog oh i suppose you care nothing about him when i see you feeding and caressing him every day you have no regard for my feelings there was nothing in the world i loved so well as my dog not even your husband sophy said gilbert who just then came in now dont expect me to be very sorry for the death of my rival when martha came running to me in the field i thought something terrible had happened could anything be worse sobbed his wife kissing the head of her dead favourite if you have any regard for me gilbert you will just go out and kill the hateful wretch that murdered him kill pincher i would lose my other arm first god bless you gilbert cried dorothy with her eyes full of tears i felt certain you would never kill such an old friend that speech meant for his good decided the fate of poor pincher a sinister smile passed over mrs gilberts pale face she dropped the body of jewel upon the floor and left the room after she was gone gilbert took up the animal and carefully examined the wound pincher never did this the dog has been stabbed with a knife the jugular vein is completely severed i never cared much for the creature who gave more trouble than a child but it was a dastardly thing to do i saw pincher do it said martha sulkily you saw no such thing retorted her master it is a base lie it is more likely you did it yourself martha gave way to a fresh burst of hysterical crying and ran upstairs to her mistress gilbert called polly to fetch a spade and bury the dead dog in the garden martha said mrs gilbert as that worthy came into her chamber shut the door and come here to me i will give you half a crown if you will hang the dog pincher la maam keep your money its dorothy chances dog and ill hang him to spite her shes fonder of that ugly cur than ever you were of jewel it will vex her dreadfully if anything happens amiss to him so much the better cried the amiable sophia i shall then be revenged on them both so pincher was hung without judge or jury as innocent of the crime for which he paid the penalty as many a poor creature condemned upon circumstantial evidence had been before him dorothy was the first to discover her old favourite dangling from the low branch of an apple tree in the orchard a cry of anguish and surprise brought mr rushmere and gilbert to the spot dolly girl whats the matter cried the yeoman your face is as white as a sheet dorothy answered by pointing to the dog and walked away to hide her tears gilbert hardly less distressed than herself guessed the truth in a moment his father flew into a frenzy of passion and threatened to inflict all sorts of punishment on the dastardly rascals who had killed his faithful brave old dog a man would never have done it muttered gilbert this is the work of a jealous woman and he felt the deepest abhorrence for the author of the outrage chapter iv death in another shape in the afternoon mrs martin walked up to the farm to see mrs rushmere and dorothy and to call upon their new friends dorothy had not been to the parsonage for three weeks and her place at church and in the sunday school had been vacant mr martin and his wife suspected that all was not right with dorothy that either her mother was worse or that she was so fatigued with overwork that she was unable to attend to these important duties both were convinced that dorothy would never desert her post unless compelled to do so mrs martin had been confined to the house by the dangerous illness of little johnnie whom the doctor had only pronounced that day out of danger anxious as she was to learn in what manner dorothy had borne the meeting with her lover and whether his wife and mother were agreeable people she had not been able to leave the sickbed of her child to satisfy her natural curiosity when dorothy opened the door she was startled by her pale face and altered appearance my dear girl are you ill not illonly heartsick weary of the world and its ways if it were not for the love of a few dear friends i could leave it tomorrow without the least regret as she said this the poor girl looked so sadly and earnestly into mrs martins face that it brought the tears into her eyes you must have thought that we had forsaken you altogether but johnnie has been very ill alarmingly so and i could not leave him to the care of the servant henry would have been up to see you but since mr fitzmorris has left us every moment of his time has been occupied as he is obliged to take the charge of both the parishes with the additional care of the sunday schools i have been unable to attend my class and your absence threw all the work upon him mr fitzmorris gone dorothy turned pale and almost gasped for breath what took him away a sad sad accident did no one tell you of it my dear mrs martin how should i hear the news of the parish i am confined all day and sometimes during the greater part of the night to my mothers sickroom but tell me about mr fitzmorris i have felt grieved and hurt at his seeming desertion of us when mrs rushmere grew so much worse is anything amiss with lord wilton his lordship has written once to his nephew since he left england in his letter he spoke very despondingly of the health of his son mr fitzmorris sudden departure from hadstone had no reference to the earl or his affairs in truth dorothy it is a sad tale his brother is dead lost his life by a fall from his horse in a steeple chase mr fitzmorris was sent for in all haste he started immediately and though his brother was living when he arrived at he was unconscious and never recovered his senses before he died poor mr fitzmorris feels this dreadfully and keenly regrets that he was not able to prepare him for the awful change from time to eternitythat his brother should die in his sins among gamblers and men of the world who had dissipated his fortune and led him astray it is dreadful said dorothy i know how he feels it i believe that if he could have saved his brothers soul by the sacrifice of his own he would have done it but will he ever return to hadstone directly he can arrange his brothers affairs which are in a state of great confusion his reckless extravagance has involved the estate and gerard is afraid that when everything is sold there will hardly be enough to satisfy the creditors you know how honest and upright he is and how it will pain him if he thought these people would suffer loss through any one belonging to him he carries this romantic sense of honesty so far that henry is afraid that he will give up his property to pay these debts he is so noble how i honour him for it cried dorothy how cruel it was of me to blame him for neglect when he was not only at the post of duty but suffering such anguish of mind how cautious we should be in judging the actions of others i can scarcely forgive myself for harbouring against him an unkind thought and how is dear mrs rushmere said her friend anxious to turn the conversation into another channel when she saw the big bright tears that trembled on dorothys eyelids she is fast sinking we may not hope to keep her here much longer i read and pray with her whenever she is able to bear it but oh dear mrs martin my reading and praying is so different from his i did so long to see him and hear him again do not look so despondingly dorothy you will soon see him again in the meanwhile tell me about gilbert and how you met as friendsnothing more i might add scarcely as friends i am so thankful that my heart was weaned from him months ago i now marvel at myself how i ever could have felt for him the passionate affection i did or how his desertion could plunge me into such intense grief mrs martin pressed her hand warmly i expected as much and his wife dont ask me what i think of her and dorothy waved her hands impatiently your silence is eloquent dorothy and when can you come to me when dear mother no longer requires my services at times she suffers cruel agony but she bears it with angelic patience she will be delighted to see you dorothy led the way to the sick chamber they found mrs rushmere awake and in a very happy frame of mind she greeted mrs martin with unaffected pleasure and talked cheerfully and hopefully of her approaching end she made no comment on her sons marriage and scarcely alluded to his wife expressing great thankfulness that she had been permitted to see gilbert before she died dear mrs martin she said i need scarcely ask you to be kind to dorothy when she has no longer a mother to love and care for her or a home here in which she can live in peace a loving daughter she has been to me a faithful and devoted nurse the blessing she has been to me in this cruel and loathsome illness the good god who gave her to me alone knows that he may bless and reward her when i am in the clay is my constant prayer may she never want a friend in her hour o need mrs martin stooped and kissed the pale earnest face of the dying woman god will raise her up friends never fear the good father never forsakes those who love and honour him mrs rushmere threw her arms about her visitors neck and drew her head down to the pillow while she whispered in her ear take her out o this mrs martin as soon as i am gone these strange women are killing her with their hard unfeeling ways it is amost breaking my poor heart to see the dear child pining day by day she will have her reward my dear old friend no one ever loses by suffering in a good cause mrs martin sat for some time with the invalid and explained to her the cause why mr fitzmorris and her husband had not been up to see her and promised that mr martin should visit her on the morrow on inquiring of martha wood for mrs rowly and her daughter she was not sorry to learn that they had walked down to the village in the humour i feel towards them she said to dorothy i would rather that they made the acquaintance of my handwriting than of me it was dorothys practice to visit mrs rushmere the first thing in the morning and carry her a cup of tea before the inmates of the house were stirring mr rushmere slept in the same room with his wife but since her illness occupied a separate bed as dorothy unclosed the chamber door she was startled by a low hoarse moaning that seemed to proceed from the bed of the invalid alarmed at such an unusual occurrence she hurried forward the cup dropped from her hand and with a wild cry she flung herself upon the bed and clasped in her arms the still pale figure that for so many years she had loved and honoured as her mother mr rushmere was kneeling upon the floor his face buried in the coverlid holding in his trembling grasp the thin white hand that no longer responded to the pressure mother dear blessed mother sobbed dorothy speak to me again one word one little word you must not leave me for ever without your love and blessing alas my child she cannot death has silenced the kind voice for ever groaned the stricken old man my wife my precious wife i never knew half your value until now all that you were and have been to me oh speak to me mary my lost darling smile once more upon me as in the happy days gone by say that you forgive your larry for all that he has said and done amiss you were allers an angel of kindness to a stern husband i have been a hard man to you but i loved you with my whole heart though i could not allers tell you how dear you were she was quite sensible of your affection dear father and would grieve to hear you reproach yourself we have all our faults of temper mother made every allowance for that she knew how truly you loved her that your heart was in the right place how did she die the old man raised his head and looked long and fondly on the still calm face of his dead wife sleeping as you see her there dorothy as sweet and peacefully as a little child the lord bless her she was surely one o his gentle lambs she generally spoke to me when the sun rose an told me to call up the folk to their work about half an hour ago i heard her own dear voice call me three times larry larry larry it be time for thee to wake up out o sleep the lord calls upon thee to rise the night is far spent the morning is at hand in which thou must give to him an account of the deeds done in the flesh i jump up all in a cold sweat an cries out trembling all over with a deadly fear mary didst thee call an awful stillness filled the room no answer came the sun shone right upon the still pale face an told me all it was a voice from heaven that spoke the dear angel had been dead for hours again his heart sank upon the coverlid and the strong frame shook with the still stronger agony that mastered him dorothy thought it best to leave nature to deal with him who is ever the best physician and comforter of the wounded heart while she went to rouse the household and take necessary steps to perform the last sad offices for the dead in a few minutes all was hurry and alarm as the suddenly aroused inmates of the house rushed halfdressed into the chamber of death in vain gilbert rushmere tried to lead his father into another room the heartbroken old man resisted every effort to separate him from his wife the commonplace condolences of mrs rowly and her daughter were alike unheeded it was useless to tell him that it was a merciful release from great suffering that mrs rushmere dying in her sleep had been saved the pain and agony of a separation from her family or that she was now an angel in heaven the bereaved old man admitted all this but looked upon her death as far as he was concerned as the greatest calamity a loss so terrible and overwhelming that he disdained to ask of heaven fortitude to bear it and he drove these jobs comforters out of his room in the frenzy of his great sorrow do not torture him sobbed dorothy with this cruel kindness however well meant his mind is not in a state to bear it leave him alone with his dead for one little hour till nature softens his sorrow with the holy balm of tears the shock has been so sudden that his mind is prostrated with the blow he will recover himself when left alone with the beloved the silent eloquence of that sweet calm face will do more to restore him to peace than all we can say to reconcile him to his loss oh if she had only spoken to me before she died groaned rushmere i should not feel so bad i could bear my misfortune like a man if she had only said in her soft kind voice god bless you lawrence it would ha been something to think on in the long lonesome nights afore me but she left me without a word how can i sleep in peace in my comfortable warm bed knowing her to be alone in the cold earth oh mary my love my treasure how can i live a wanting thee after a pause of some minutes he looked up from the dead wife to his son who was leaning against the bedpost his face covered with his sole remaining hand you may well mourn for your mother gilbert many a salt tear she shed for you the grief she felt for your cruel desertion broke down her constitution and brought her to this father i was not alone to blame said gilbert in a hoarse voice yesyes lay the fault on the old man he has no one now to take his part but that poor lass whose heart he nearly broke father whispered dorothy gently taking his hand mother forgot and forgave that long ago she loved you and gilbert too well to cherish animosity against either we are all human and prone to err if she could speak she would tell you to banish all these sinful heartburnings these useless recriminations and prepare to follow her to the better land where she has found peace and assurance for ever i will i will if so be i could only find the way responded rushmere with a heavy sigh oh god forgive me i am a sinful man i wish i could follow her dear steps for i am a weary o my life he laid his head upon the pillow beside his wife and the tears streamed from his closed eyelids down his pale cheeks come let us leave him said dorothy he will feel calmer soon and here is dear mr martin who can better soothe him in his grief than we can oh i am so glad you are come she whispered to the good curate as she followed the rest of the family from the room he is dreadfully afflicted poor old father he loved her so much the four days that intervened between mrs rushmeres death and the funeral were very trying to dorothy she had to receive so many visitors and listen to so many unfeeling remarks and questions regarding her future position in the rushmere family put to her with the coarse bluntness of uneducated people who could not realize her grief for the loss of one who was not a blood relation was she going they asked to remain at the farm or to take service elsewhere and they expressed great surprise that young mrs rushmere had suffered her to remain there so long then she was asked to give minute particulars regarding the terrible disease of which her fostermother had died of how she bore her sufferings what doctor she employed and what remedies had been applied all this was trying enough to a sensitive mind but they went further still and utterly regardless of the wounds they were inflicting demanded of the weeping girl if mrs rushmere had left her anything and who was to get her clothes this important piece of information was urged by no less a personage than letty barford who in company with her motherinlaw and miss watling called to look at the corpse i think mrs rushmere has done enough for her said miss watling as they descended the stairs keeping her for so many years after all the trouble she has made in the family this was not said in dorothys hearing but addressed to mrs gilbert and her mother to whom the party were offering their condolence these interlopers are always a nuisance in families said mrs rowly this dorothy chance is a good enough girl but my daughter will be very glad to get rid of her it does not do to have two mistresses in a house and she has been used to have her own way in everything it was but natural suggested the elder mrs barford she was more than a daughter to them and it must have been trying to dorothy to give up the place she had held for so many years with such credit to herself to strangers i pity her with all my heart when does she leave you mrs gilbert as soon after the funeral as possible it is only on the old mans account that i allowed her to remain here so long she is the only creature in the house that can manage him but it is high time that all this should be put a stop to you are perfectly right mrs gilbert cried miss watling i think you have shown great forbearance in tolerating the presence of such a dangerous person in the house so long while she was kept in her place as servant of all work it was all very well but since the earl has taken her under his especial patronage there is no bounds to her assumption and insolence would you believe it ladies he is paying for her education and is actually having her taught to play upon the piano strange that we never heard a word of this before cried both the ladies in a breath is she his mistress thats the inference which most people have drawn from such strange conduct on his part and miss watling shrugged her shoulders significantly i dont believe a word of it cried the elder mrs barford i heard just now that dorothy was going to live with mrs martin and she is too good a woman to tolerate such doings in her house it is an easy thing for a man of lord wiltons rank and wealth to bribe people to hold their tongues sneered miss watling it is nothing to me what she is i shall never give my countenance to a person of doubtful character and one so every way my inferior it is a good thing for you mrs gilbert that it has pleased god to take the old woman or this artful girl might make mischief between you and your husband oh maam i have no fears on that head replied sophia tartly i am not afraid of such a mischance i saw very little of mrs rushmere and considering the nature of her complaint i think her death a happy release and if the old man were to follow his wife it would not break my heart sophia you should not speak your mind so freely said her mother shaking her head but indeed ladies my daughter has been treated with so little respect by the whole family that you must not wonder at her indifference at the death of a motherinlaw who hardly said a civil thing to her since she came into the house of course it was the interest of this girl chance to set the old folk against us in the hope which i have every reason to believe she entertained that they would leave her all their personal property has the old woman left her a legacy demanded letty with breathless interest not a thing her sudden death prevented that the old man wanted to give her all his wifes clothes and some of the fine linen which he said belonged to dorothy but sophia lifted up her voice against it and the creature refused to accept the least thing when she found that she could not get all just like such domestic sneaks cried miss watling i am so glad she was disappointed it will serve as a warning to others like her shaking hands with mrs gilbert in the most affectionate manner and hoping that they would soon become excellent friends miss watling and the two barfords took their leave all but the elder of the twain delighted with mrs rowly and her daughter whom miss watling pronounced a very sweet ladylike young person until the morning appointed for the funeral the poor old yeoman had confined himself entirely to his own room beside the coffin which contained the mortal remains of his wife on that morning however he rose early washed his pale haggard face and shaved himself and put on with unusual care the mourning suit his son had provided for the melancholy occasion kissing with reverence the cold brow of his wife he screwed down the lid of the coffin with his own hands that no one he said should see her again or rob him of that last look it was now time for him to gird up his loins and act like a man dorothy hearing him stirring brought up his breakfast for he had tasted nothing but bread and water for the last four days and she knew that he must be weak and faint from his long fast she found him standing behind the closed curtains of the window looking mournfully into the court below at the sound of the light well known footsteps he turned to her and held out his hand dorothy threw her arms about his neck and for some minutes they mingled their tears together at length rousing himself rushmere placed his large hand upon her bent head and solemnly blessed her dolly he said dolly my dear child had i only known the woman that now fills the place in this house that you ought to have held i would ha seen my right hand struck from my body afore i would ha refused my consent to your marriage with gilbert i ha been punished terribly punished for my folly and sin ever since yon deceitful woman came into my house to lord it over me and mine night and day i hear marys voice repeating to me over an over again the words she said to me on that sorrowful morn that gilly first left his home an i turned you out friendless upon the pitiless world you who i ought to ha protected to the last hour o my life larry as a man sows so must he reap oh my daughter what sort o a crop am i likely to reap with these women when you be gone they will be kinder to you father when i am away not a bit not a bit it is not in their natur child people cannot act agen natur the only thing that reconciles me to my marys death is that she will not have to put up with their evil tempers and that you dolly will be removed from their malice dear father dont vex your mind with anticipating troubles they always come soon enough without opening the door to call them in come with me into the next room and eat a bit of breakfast you have been fasting too long and look as weak as a child i have cooked the steak with my own hands that you might have it nice ay dolly you wor allers a firstrate hand at making good cheer yon lunnon fine lady wud starve a body with her dirty ways dont think of her father said dorothy leading him by the hand like a child into the adjoining room where she had a small table neatly spread and his breakfast all ready you must do justice to my cooking it is the last meal your poor dolly will ever cook for you in the old house oh that it wor the last a would ever want to eat sighed rushmere wiping his eyes and consenting to partake of the meal so temptingly spread before him after moving the dishes dorothy entreated him to go down stairs and take a turn in the open air to revive him after his confinement in the close atmosphere of the deathchamber but this the old man could not be persuaded to do i wud not ha minded dorothy had the day been wet and he looked sadly toward the window where the gay sunbeams were glancing through the closed white drapery but such a fine morn as this wi the birds singing gaily as if they never knew sorrow or care an the blessed beams o the young sun laughing in the glistening drops o dew an all things o gods making but man looking so bright and cheery just maddens me wi grief to think that my mary will never look upon this beautiful world again it doth seem grievous to the wounded heart that natur is allers happy an today i cant stand the smile on her gladsome face it wud comfort me to see it covered up in storm and cloud you know the old saying dolly happy is the corpse that the rain rains on if there was any truth in the old rhyme lawrence rushmeres wish was gratified the beautiful morning rapidly clouded over and just as the funeral procession left the house the storm burst over the melancholy train in awful thunderclaps accompanied by floods of rain every one was drenched and looked uncomfortable but the chief mourner he held up his sad pale face to the pitiless shower as if its desolating progress was in unison with his own sad heart nor did the tempest abate its fury until the sods were piled upon the narrow bed which separated him from the love of his youth chapter v the false accusation dorothy was not sorry to leave the old homestead all the old associations that had endeared it to her and surrounded its gloomy walls with an atmosphere of love were broken up or changed so completely that she could no longer recognize them even the joyous bark of old pincher rushing forth to greet her on her return from church or market had been silenced oh how cruelly she could not bear to recall the treachery that had robbed her of an humble faithful friend i cannot recognize the presence of god in this place as i once did she thought where every word spoken to me is a provocative to evil to do as they do not to do as i would be done by i have daily prayed to be delivered from evil and kept from temptation and have too often yielded to the snares laid to entrap my soul it is hard to dwell with the scorner and escape free from contamination she was just cording her trunk ready for its removal to the parsonage when mrs gilbert suddenly entered the attic i wish to look into that trunk before you take it away may i ask why mrs gilbert rushmere to see that you have taken nothing but what belongs to you certainly if you are mean enough to suspect me of such baseness and the hot blood rushed into dorothys cheeks and her dark eyes flashed with a bright light that made the cold flaxen haired woman recoil before them but hold she cried as mrs gilbert laid her hand on the trunk i shall not give you the key except in the presence of competent witnesses lest the heart that conceived such an insult should belie me also springing down stairs and scarcely feeling them beneath her feet she encountered gilbert in the hall come with me upstairs mr gilbert dorothy what ails you why are you so dreadfully excited have you seen anything he had heard of her encounter with the supernatural on the heath and for a moment was possessed with the idea that she had seen the apparition of his mother it is no risen angel cried the excited girl but a human fiend i want you to see follow me gilbert if you ever loved me and vindicate my honour alarmed for he had never seen dorothy in such a passion before and anxious to learn the cause of her distress he followed her swift footsteps into the attic where he found his wife still standing beside the halfcorded trunk tapping the floor with her foot and humming the tune of a country dance she smiled disdainfully as dorothy put the key into gilberts hand here is the key of my trunk will you please to open it and empty the contents upon the floor what for dorothy you amaze mewhat have i to do with it to satisfy the suspicions of that woman i cannot call her lady the lie would choke me she has demanded the inspection of its contents lest i should leave the home of my childhood on the night of my beloved mothers funeral with stolen goods in my possession at the mention of mrs rushmeres name who had so loved and trusted her the hot fire of anger was quenched and she turned so faint she had to lean against the low wall of the attic for support what a fine piece of acting sneered sophia its a pity the girl had not been brought up for the stage is it possible mrs rushmere and gilbert looked and spoke sternly that you can have disgraced yourself and me in this outrageous manner and cruelly insulted a noble girl whose shoe latchet you are not worthy to unloose open the trunk dont talk in that style to me i have my doubts as to this fine young ladys honour and i dont mean to leave the room until they are satisfied mr gilbert do what she requires or after i am gone she may accuse me of theft when i am not here to defend my character that cannot be recovered that was lost long ago said the coldhearted woman gilbert reluctantly opened the trunk and his wife coolly kneeling down upon the floor proceeded to toss over its neatly arranged contents presently she dived down among the clothes and quickly withdrawing her hand held up two silver table spoons who do these belong to she cried with a laugh of fiendish triumph they are not mine said dorothy trembling from head to foot they were never placed there by me oh of course not every thief is honest till they are found out i suppose you never saw these spoons before i have cleaned them a thousand times said dorothy calmly for she saw that she was in her enemys power they were on the dinner table today i have not seen them since in what manner you have contrived to produce them out of my trunk god only knows this i can declare in his holy presence that i never placed them there you need not assert your innocence dorothy replied gilbert who had seen an expression on his wifes face that convinced him that she was the incendiary i know you too well to believe you guilty for a moment thats all very fine lieutenant rushmere but facts are stubborn things i like to unmask hypocrisy i would therefore thank you to send one of the men to town for a constable to convey this virtuous honest miss chance to jail i want further conviction of her having committed an act deserving such rigorous measures said gilbert what farther do you need this is no case of circumstantial evidence you have the proofs in your hand do you think sir that i would condescend to deceive you s death madam cried gilbert in a towering passion it would not be the first time and still keeping the spoons which he had taken from her in his hand he went to the door and called martha wood the girl came up stairs on hearing her masters voice he went into the passage to meet her so that no eye telegraphing could take place between her and her mistress martha did you wash the two large silver gravy spoons after dinner yes sir what do you want with them thats nothing to you did you put them into the platebox no sir i gave them to mrs gilbert she said she wanted them for a particular purpose i need not be so nice in cleaning them she said she would have a good joke to tell me about them before night woman do you hear what this girl says asked gilbert stepping back into the room who deserves to be sent to prison now his wife only answered by recommencing the same tune in a louder strain as she glided snake like from the room oh my god i thank thee said dorothy raising her clasped hands thou hast delivered me from a doom far worse than death taking gilberts sole remaining hand she pressed it warmly between her own how shall i thank you dear brother for saving your poor orphan sister from disgrace and ruin remember me in your prayers dorothy i can no longer pour out my heart to you as in the old happy days when we were all the world to each other but there is no sin in asking you to pray for me a disappointed and most unhappy man he left the room and dorothys lips quivered and tears again welled up in her eyes as she caught a half smothered moan that told more than words could do the bitter anguish that was eating out his heart she found the old man moping on the stone bench in the courtyard his head bowed upon his hands his face completely hidden by the snowwhite locks that fell over it in tangled confusionthe beautiful silky hair of which his wife had always been so proud which she loved to brush over her fingers before he went to church or market who was there to take pride in the handsome old man now gilbert had grown reserved and shy there seemed little confidence or affection between the father and son dorothys heart bled for the lonely old man left so desolate and uncared for in his heavy affliction goodbye dear father dont fret yourself ill i shall see you at church every sunday and we can have a nice walk together after service on the common to talk over the good old times you will be sure to come wont you yes my darling if only to see her grave i know you cant bide here dorothy that woman would be the death of us both but if i wor sick or dying would you come and nurse the old man who used you so ill yes that i would if mrs gilbert were to bar the door in my face i would climb in at the window but cheer up father god is good there may be many happy days in store for you yet you must try and live for my sake she put the white locks back from the old mans ample forehead and kissing him tenderly went her way without casting a backward glance on the old house before we follow dorothy to the pleasant home of her friend mrs martin we will step into mrs gilbert rushmeres chamber and hear what is passing there when detected by her husband in her design to ruin dorothy she had borne the exposure of her cruel treachery with an air of insolent nonchalance and left the room singinga common artifice with lowbred people who attempt to hide their malignity by an affectation of gaiety and perfect indifference the snake hisses before he strikes his victim perhaps to give him timely warning to make his escape the human snake hisses to hide its disappointment that it has shown its fangs in vain it was terrible when alone to witness the rage that disfigured the countenance of sophia rushmere when she found herself baffled in her coldblooded treachery the tune was changed to curses loud and deep and threats of vengeance against the innocent object of her jealous hatred she rated martha wood in no measured terms for the defeat of her well laid plot that individual answered her with corresponding insolence how should i know what you were after with the spoons if you had told me i could have sworn that i saw dorothy steal them whats the use of making a mystery about your doings to me i should think i knew too much about your affairs before your marriage for that but you must have been very obtuse martha said her mistress softening down not to perceive what i had in hand i should if i had got a sight of your face in the manner that mr gilbert stood in the open doorway i did not see that you were in the room until the blunder was out do you know what he said about it after i left no but i saw dorothy go up to him and take his hand and he bent down and kissed her i saw that through a crack in the door the shameless wretch cried sophy stamping with passion but for your folly i should have had her transported thank god shes gone i have got her out of the house at last and ill take good care that she never comes into it again she is too near at hand i should think mrs gilbert for your peace if your husband is as fond of her as i hear folks say that he once was it is a very easy matter for them to meet on that lonely heath even in broad day and no one be a whit the wiser the artful girl was heaping fresh fuel on the fire she had kindled in the breast of her weak employer and when she had nearly maddened her with her base insinuations she went away laughing at her as a consummate simpleton mrs rushmere did not go to bed she sat up nursing her wrath and waiting for her husband the venom of marthas poisoned arrows was rankling in her breast she considered herself the injured party now and no longer dreaded the indignant expression of his displeasure at her conduct to dorothy she would begin the battle first accuse him of infidelity and bear him down with a torrent of words following out this idea a terrible scene of mutual recrimination took place between the husband and wife which ended as such scenes generally do in total alienation on his part and frantic jealousy on hers gilbert rushmere had endeavoured to make the best of a bad bargain and though he could not respect the woman who had tricked him into making her his wife he had treated her with more consideration and kindness than she deserved the consciousness of having married her for money involved a moral sense of degradation which made him more lenient in his judgment of the deceit practised against him for had it not been mutual he could not blame her without including himself in the same condemnation for a long time he listened in silence to her maddening speeches trusting that the heat of her passion would wear out that her tongue would grow tired with continual motion and that not meeting with any opposition she would give it up as a useless task and go to sleep he was fully aware of her weakness but not of her obstinate strength of will sophia he said when utterly wearied with her reproaches for imaginary injuries after the disgraceful scene this afternoon in the attic it would be wiser in you to hold your tongue and go to sleep if you wish me to retain any affection for you let me never have a repetition of such conduct again i shall not keep silence sir because you dare to tell me to hold my tongue i shall speak when i please and as i please without asking your leave well dont expect me to listen to such nonsense my heart is overwhelmed with grief for the death of a dear mother you surely take a strange time to distress me with your foolish and groundless jealousy and you to show your preference for that vile woman that hired mistress of your patron lord wilton good heavens sophia what do you mean i mean what i say what all the world knows but yourself do you think that i will condescend to be placed below this infamous creature in my husbands estimation to be told that i am not worthy to untie her shoes you dont know sophia rowly if you can imagine that i will submit to such an indignity for a moment i who was born a lady received the education of a lady and was always treated as such until i became the wife of gilbert rushmere the son of an ignorant illiterate tiller of the soil who has given you a home when you had none madam when the debts you dishonestly incurred during my absence had made beggars of us all this illiterate tiller of the soil made you mistress of his house and placed you at the head of his table and this is the way you abuse his generosity it was an evil day for him and those dear to him when your foot crossed his threshold you would rather have seen dorothy chance at the head of the table she would be the ornament of any table you cannot make me believe the vile scandals propagated against dorothy by such women as nancy watling they are just as true madam as your accusations against her this afternoon when nothing would appease your hatred to this beautiful girl but sending her to prison or getting her transported it was murder however you may disguise the fact and in perjuring your soul to ruin her you dared the wrath of god to damn yourself fine language this to address to your wife said sophy cowering before her husbands withering and contemptuous glance you deserve it he cried in a voice of thunder i scorn it she returned with a faint laugh and pointing at him with her finger it is time sophia that you and i came to an understanding said gilbert becoming suddenly calm if you mean to persevere in this line of conduct we must part the sooner the better she said in the same taunting tone though inwardly terrified lest he should carry out his unlookedfor proposal for cold and selfish as she was she entertained for him a passion that shed a vivifying heat into her torpid nature it would have been love had she been capable of the devotion and selfsacrifice that are the leading characteristics of that glorious sentiment she saw the gulf that yawned at her feet but was too obstinate to yield gilbert now spoke in a more earnest and decided manner sophia do you really mean what you say there was something in the look and manner that was startling he at any rate meant what he said she would not retract but remained obstinately silent will you answer me can you give me a separate maintenance she sobbed out at length will you turn me and my mother out to starve this difficulty had not occurred to him before it was insurmountable he had no means but what he derived from his father and though as perfectly divorced in affection as the sanction of a legal tribunal could have effected he was compelled by a dire necessity to wear the chain that avarice and ambition had rivetted they might henceforth sleep in the same bed eat from the same board and in public act towards each other as husband and wife but they were as much divided in heart and confidence as if the wide ocean flowed between them gilbert kept his own secret sophia rushmere gave hers to martha wood who told it as a greater secret to mrs rowly chapter vi a proposal dorothy felt like a captive long incarcerated in prison who has just got his release and awakes once more to life and liberty a year ago and she would have considered it impossible for her to feel glad at leaving heath farm or any place that gilbert rushmere called his home gilbert she had ceased to respect and where he was could no longer be a home for her she pitied him because he was miserable but he had brought his sufferings upon himself in a manner that she could neither excuse nor justify and her compassion was of that mixed sort that made her feel ashamed of its object the insults she had received from his wife were still rankling in her breast their low base character made them unendurable to a sensitive mind and she thought less of her former lover when associated with this woman whom he had accepted in her place for six thousand pounds his bargain would have been a dead loss to him at treble that sum he had ventured his all upon it and had lost everything which makes life desirable the love of a true heart his own selfrespect and the fair prospect of domestic happiness dorothy felt it painful to witness his degradation and the situation in which she had been placed precluded any attempt on her part to elevate his mind and inspire hopes of a more exalted nature she had a sad foreboding that this false step though the first was not likely to be the last in a rapid downward career what better could be expected from constant association with such a partner as he had chosen the mother whose loss at that moment was pressing heavily on her heart to whom gilbert had always been an earthly idol had been mercifully taken from the evil to come and much as dorothy had loved her she no longer wished to recall her to life to preside over a home that mrs gilberts temper would render a domestic hell dorothy was thankful for her emancipation from that house of misrule she breathed more freely in the fresh air and her heart once more expanded to the genial influences of nature the evening was warm and balmy after the thunderstorm and the golden sunset shed upon wet leaves and dewy grass a glory as from heaven the birds sang in the glistening bushes by the roadside and the air was rife with delicious odours as if an angel had scattered his censor over the rebaptized earth the holy tranquillity of the scene chased away the dark shadows that like spirits of evil had been brooding for several weeks upon her mind thoughts which were not of heaven the remembrance of all those injuries that had been heaped upon her making her angry and resentful and anxious that her tormentors might be paid in their own coin natures vesper song to her creator poured from a thousand warbling throats once more attuned dorothys sad heart to prayer and praise her soul fell prostrate to the earth the green footstool of his glorious throne and was gently raised by ministering spirits and lifted towards heaven near the parsonage she met mrs martin and the children coming to meet her with what joy she kissed and embraced them all what charming little tales they had to tell her of domestic life their rabbits had multiplied their pigeons had all accessions to their families harry had discovered that very morning a nest of young kittens in the stable belonging to mrs prowler the cat and they were not to be killed or sent away until dear dolly had picked out the prettiest for little arthur who was going to name it dolly in honour of their dear friend then they told her that johnnie had been ill but was able to sit up now and he wanted to hear all the nice stories she used to tell him and sing to him his favourite hymns and dorothys weary heart overflowed with happiness to find herself once more among faithful and loving hearts after having taken her the round of the garden to look at all the flowers she had helped them in sowing and planting and pointing out the prettiest blossoms and gathering her a choise nosegay they went gamboling before her into the house wild with joy that she had come to live with them never to go away again there is another friend very anxious to see you dorothy said mrs martin as they passed the well known study door mr fitzmorris arrived by the midday coach he looked ill and fatigued and i persuaded him to lie down for an hour or two until henry returned from storby where he had to attend a vestry meeting after poor mrs rushmeres funeral i wonder if he is awake she gave a low rap at the door and dorothys heart leaped to the sound of the gentle voice that bade them come in go and speak to him dorothy the sight of you will do him good and help to dissipate his melancholy at that moment the door opened and gerard received them with his usual frank kindness dorothys black dress informed him of what had happened he took her hand and led her into the room making her sit down in the study chair while he drew his seat beside her my dear friend i see how it is you have lost that excellent mother i did hope i should see her again and administer to her the glorious symbols of christs undying love before she sank to rest god has ordered it otherwise did she suffer much in that last conflict which all foolishly dread and shrink from she was spared all its terrors mr fitzmorris she died in sleep to judge from the beautiful serenity of her face her waking was in heaven i too have looked on death since last we met in death itself there is nothing terrible it is but the returning wave of life flowing back to him and may be regarded as the birth of spirit to its higher destiny but oh dorothy the death that i lament that i would have given my own life to avert was one of such a painful nature so sudden so unlooked for by the dear thoughtless being who cared not for his soul scarcely knew that he possessed one that i can feel little hope in his case struck down in a moment in the vigour of manhood of all the wasted years of a misspent life he could not redeem one hour from time to prepare for eternity it is terrible heartcrushing but it is gods will and what am i that i should dare to murmur at a just decree but did you ever warn him of his danger asked dorothy i have nothing to reproach myself with on that head after my own conversion i besought him with tears and prayers with all the eloquence which conviction can give to turn from the errors of his ways he laughed at my enthusiasm and called me a madman and a fool refused to listen to my earnest appeals and finally shunned my company i loved him too dearly to be baffled thus i wrote constantly to him and laid my own heart bare in the hope of winning his but he refused to answer my letters and at length returned them to me unopened i had no other resource left but to pray for him but my prayers have returned into my own bosom and my brother went down to his grave and gave no sign he lived two days after his accident but was never conscious for a moment it may be better with him than you suppose suggested dorothy though unconscious to you his soul may have been vividly awake to its spiritual danger and petitions for mercy which he could not utter in the hearing of man may have been heard and answered in heaven thank you for that thought dear girl it is suggestive of some comfort the thief on the cross might have been as regardless of his duty to god and his fellow men as my poor brother yet his petition received a gracious hearing and a blessed promise we cannot judge others as the great searcher of hearts judges them many a criminal in our estimation may shine hereafter a gem in his crown there was a pause for some minutes and gerard fitzmorris continued pacing the study with rapid steps so wrapt up in his own thoughts that he had almost forgotten the figure in black that sat so pale and still in his easy chair come and take a turn with me in the open air he said suddenly returning to her side the atmosphere of this place is close and stifling the evening excessively warm i can always think and speak more freely beneath the canopy of heaven dorothy had not removed her bonnet and shawl and they strolled out upon the heath during their ramble he made her recount all that had happened since gilberts return and was shocked at the manner in which she had been treated there is only one way to punish such people he said to return good for evil it is not only the best but the easiest way and the peace and satisfaction it confers repays the injury a thousand fold i have tried it in many instances and have experienced its happy results it sounds excellent in theory said dorothy but i find it a hard doctrine to reduce to practice nay dorothy it is the theory which is difficult for our sinful human nature with its perverted reason rebels against it the other course being more in unison with its vindictive feelings and the spirit of retaliation by which we are more or less governed if however we make the slightest effort on the side of mercy and forgiveness the spirit of god working with our spirit makes it not only easy but brings with it the utmost peace and satisfaction verifying even the old pagan maxim that virtue is its own reward our blessed lord would never have promulgated a doctrine which could not be reduced to practice and which he carried fully out in his own person but then he was so different from us not while he partook of our nature he was subjected to temptations as great or even greater than those that he taught us by precept and example to shun if there had been no conflict with evil there would have been no victory remember he fought the battle for us alone and single handed without praying for the legion of angels to assist him in the awful struggle we have not only his example to help us but the powerful aid he promised to all who would take up the cross and follow him our very weakness constitutes our strength when upheld by his saving arm after a walk of some minutes in silence he said in a more lively manner dorothy you must forgive this cruel woman and only indulge the godlike revenge of doing her good for the evil she has done to you take her conduct as a life trial and bear it with the courage of a christian i will endeavour to do so returned dorothy and when you are near to advise and strengthen me i do not feel it so hard to restrain these resentful feelings but directly i am left to myself i grow fierce and angry and wish that my persecutors may meet with the punishment they deserve dorothy said mr fitzmorris stopping and looking earnestly into her face will you answer me truly a simple and straightforward question his companion looked up with a wondering smile would you like to remain always with me dorothy will you become my bosom friendmy faithful counsellormy beloved wife bound to me by that blessed and holy tie the love of christ one with me in heart and purpose in the bond of faith and love and charity with all mankind answer me dorothy fully and freely with the beautiful candour which makes you so charming in my eyes can you love me as well as you loved gilbert rushmere yes better than anything on earth whispered dorothy without venturing to lift her eyes or wipe away the tears she was unable to restrain and sinking into the arms which were held out to receive her i never knew what it was to love truly devotedly and with my whole heart until now we are one my own dorothy my beloved in heart and soul and henceforth i trust for ever and he sealed the contract of their engagement with a kiss as pure from the dross of passion as the young mother bestows upon her firstborn child oh mr fitzmorris i am not worthy of your love sobbed dorothy a highly connected man like you should seek out a fitter mate than me you should have thought of that before you gave your sanction to my proposal little wife and the old beautiful smile lighted up his face it is too late to draw back now if i did not love you better than the world and its foolish conventionalisms i should not have asked you to be mine i value the gift that god has bestowed upon me too highly to give it up for the prejudices that belong to wealth and caste you have made me very happy dorothy darling as little henry calls you poor little fellow i am afraid that he will feel very jealous of his big rival and dorothy was happy too happy to waste her joy in words as she leaned upon the strong arm of her noble protector she realized the delightful consciousness that she was no longer alone in the world the lovers lingered upon the heath talking over their future prospects until the moon rose and shed her melancholy loveliness on ocean and heath they were not to marry until after lord wiltons return and gerard thought it advisable that both should write to him and make him acquainted with their engagement he did not wish it to be kept secret he thought that dorothys claim upon his protection would prevent unpleasant scandal silence the foolish tattling of her former acquaintance and conduce to her own peace and comfort his character stood too high for his conduct to be attributed to base and dishonourable motives and as his affianced wife dorothy would rise in the estimation of her worldly neighbours they found mrs martin waiting tea for them and wondering what had detained them so long from the social meal the shy conscious look on dorothys face revealed the mystery which gerard wholly cleared up when he pleasantly introduced her to his old friends as his future wife lady dorothy fitzmorris said the curate rubbing his hands with great glee i wish you much joy the title is rather premature returned gerard gravely though it may fall to her only too soon you know henry that gallio careth for none of these things for the last three years i have been looking for a wife that would answer solomons description a woman whose price is above rubies and i am fully persuaded that i have found my ideal in the dear girl before you it little matters to me whether she be a peasant or a princess the highest of all titles is comprised in that of a christian mr fitzmorris i honour you for your choice cried mrs martin and rejoice at the good fortune of our young friend dorothy overwhelmed with the unexpected turn that her affairs had taken sat with downcast eyes and averted head in order to conceal her quivering lips and fastcoming tears yet she was happy far too happy to speak and would gladly have left the table to escape observation and commune with her own heart in the solitude of her chamber gerard saw her confusion and in order to restore her selfpossession called out gaily i hope mrs martin you have reserved for us a good cup of tea and have not been guilty of destroying henrys nerves by giving him the strength of the pot i assure you i feel viciously hungry after a long days fast and am not yet sufficiently spiritualized to live wholly upon love strangely enough this speech which was meant to raise dorothys spirits recalled forcibly to her memory the conversation between herself and gilbert rushmere at the stile when she had rallied him for saying in such passionate terms that if she refused to marry him he would die of love and now she was the betrothed of another with a heart overflowing with joy and gratitude that she could never be gilberts wife while he had united his destiny with a woman whom he could neither love nor honour and was more likely to die the victim of avarice than love how inscrutable she thought are the ways of providence how little human wisdom could predict such a result dorothy was no longer banished from the sacred study gerard insisted on her taking possession of the great leathern chair while he composed those heartsearching sermons that were making his name known as an eloquent preacher when absorbed in his own meditations the pale fairhaired priest seemed scarcely conscious of her presence but if by chance he encountered her look of devotional tenderness the wonderful eyes responded with an earnest gaze of love and peacetheir owner sometimes observing with a sigh dorothy darling i am too happy then dorothy would creep to his side or sit down on the stool at his feet just to feel the pressure of his large white hand on her ebon ringlets and hear him say in his rich deep voice god bless you my dear girl and when the writing was laid aside for the day and she accompanied him in his visits to the poor and suffering she enjoyed with unspeakable delight the walk over the heath and the share he allotted to her in his ministrations of charity poor old francis died during mr fitzmorris absence but he still continued his visits to hog lane to read and pray with its halfheathen inhabitants he had made slow progress in the conversion of old mrs bell but her grandson ben had become a reformed character and was a monitor in storby sundayschool speaking of the grandmother he said it was difficult to make any religious impression upon minds whose feelings and faculties were deadened and rendered indifferent by age and infirmity if they do not seek god in youth or middle life they seldom draw near to him after reaching the appointed age of man returning from one of these parochial visits dorothy reminded her lover of a promise he had once made to her of telling her some of the events of his former life and the circumstances that had led to his conversion and induced him to become a minister of the gospel i am glad you have asked me dorothy i feel quite in a communicative mood this evening you have made me acquainted with every page in your short eventful history it is not fair that you should be kept in ignorance of mine uninteresting as it may appear they sat down upon a sloping bank crowned with a screen of tall furze bushes among whose honeyed blossoms bees and butterflies were holding a carnival the sun had not yet set and his slanting rays gleaming over the wide heath obscured every object with their golden radiance it is a shame to turn our backs upon that glorious sunshine said dorothy but my eyes are dazzled and blinded by excess of light what a type of the beautiful but fallacious visions of youth said gerard when we behold everything through a false medium coloured by fancy to suit our own taste truth lies at the bottom of the picture like the ragged landscape that the golden sunset hides from our view while attracted by the brilliancy of his beams and building castles among the clouds we forget the barren soil and the bare rocks beneath our feet mine is no tale of romance gentle wife though i have been a great dreamer in my day but one of sad reality and that i may avoid trespassing too much upon your patience i will endeavour to be as brief as possible chapter vii a confession my father colonel gerard fitzmorris was brother to sir thomas the father of the present earl of wilton gerard was many years younger than his brother a large family having died between their respective births he held the rank of colonel in the army and served the whole of the american war of independence and had gained the reputation of a brave and distinguished officer after the termination of the struggle he returned to england and married lady charlotte granville sister to the lady dorothy fitzmorris these beautiful and accomplished women were the only children of the late earl of wilton this was an excellent match for my father in the common parlance of the world but was one entirely of convenience on his part he was a handsome dashing soldier and was held in great esteem by men of his own class who considered him the model of a perfect gentleman and a leader in the ranks of fashion where he shone as a star of the first magnitude in short he was one of those easygoing reckless men who are known among their companions as excellent fellows men whose hearts are in the right place who spend their money freely and are only enemies to themselves they may drink and swear and gamble and break gods commandments with impunity drawing others into the same maddening vortex by their vile example but the world for which they live excuses all their faults they are of it have sworn allegiance to it body and soul and as long as they retain wealth and influence it will continue to make idols of them colonel fitzmorris in addition to all these conventional advantages possessed the act of pleasing in an eminent degree and was admired and courted by the other sex as the beau ideal of manly beauty and elegance doubtless it was these external graces that captivated and won the heart of my mother people wondered that the proud earl should give his consent to the marriage of his daughter with a man of moderate fortune and dissipated habits but she was the child of his old age the sole fruit of a second marriage another petted idol of his heart from a baby she had been used to have her own way and the doting father could not withstand her passionate appeals to his parental affection to be allowed to marry the man of her own choice the earl in this case appears reluctantly to have yielded to her wishes and delayed the marriage until after she had attained her majority hoping that time and the gaieties of london would divert her affections from my father and concentrate them upon a more eligible object she however remained firm to her attachment and their marriage was celebrated with unusual magnificence a prince of the blood royal gave away the bride who inherited a fine fortune from her mother which i fear was the sole inducement my father had in making her his wife my poor deceived mother i have every reason to believe was passionately fond of her husband but retiring in her habits she lacked the art to secure the affection of a man of the world and such a general lover as colonel fitzmorris was known to be she was his legal wife but not the mistress of his heart in public he treated her with marked attention and politeness which he considered due to a woman of her rank in private she was neglected altogether or regarded with cool indifference and having no inclination for the ostentatious show of a life spent in public my dear mother passed most of her time in the country with her infant sons at the beautiful seat which had formed a part of her noble dower while she continued to love my father his conduct must have occasioned her great anguish of mind a faithful female attendant has since informed me that most of her solitary nights were spent in tears after every tender feeling had been torn and estranged and indifference succeeded to love she unfortunately transferred the affections which had never been reciprocated by her faithless partner to a man who had she known previous to her illstarred marriage would have been worthy of her love general halstead commanded the brigade in which my father was colonel and was a constant visitor at the house he was a man in middle life with a fine gentlemanly presence frank brave and independent had read and travelled much and could talk well on most subjects he was very kind to us boys and we both loved him for we saw a great deal more of him than of our father who never kissed or played with us as general halstead did but to hasten a sad story general halstead sought and won the heart my father had trampled and spurned and my mother eloped with her seducer to france i have often since wondered how she could leave her two young sons who were rendered worse than orphans by her rash desertion i can just remember my mother she was always gentle and kind to francis and me we so seldom saw our father that we loved her with the most ardent affection i recollect the fatal night of her departure as well as if it were but yesterday the weather was july and oppressively warm and mrs starling the nurse put us early to bed that we might not disturb lady charlotte who was dressing to go to a large party she said and could not play with us that night i was a nervous irritable boy i could not sleep for the heat and lay awake watching the moon and the strange shadows thrown by the vineleaves that encircled the window upon the white curtains of my bed at last i grew frightened by the grotesque shapes which my too active imagination endowed with life and motion when the summer breeze from the open window stirred the drapery i began to cry piteously a figure glided into the room and sat down beside me on the bed it was my mother she was dressed for a journey and wore a dark cloth riding habit and a broad black velvet hat and white feathers she was a tall elegantlooking woman more remarkable i have been told for her exquisite form than for her face she was if anything too fair with dark blue eyes and flaxen hair like my own she used to call me her dear whiteheaded boy and congratulate herself on my being a granvilleher maiden nameand not a fitzmorris that night she looked very pale and sad and seen in the white moonlight appeared more like a ghost than a creature of warm flesh and blood what ails my darling boy she said and took me out of the bed into her lap pressing me tightly to her breast and kissing the tears from my wet cheeks i am afraid mamma i trembled and looked timidly towards the curtains afraid of what and her eyes followed mine with a startled expression of those things dancing on the bed curtains dont you see the black ugly creatures mamma they are only shadows they cannot hurt you gerard oh yes they can they are coming for me dont let them carry me away i clung to her and hid my face in her bosom oh do stay with me dear mamma until i go to sleep dont leave me alone i felt her warm tears falling fast over my face she kissed me over and over again then tried to lay me down quietly in the bed i did not want to go to bed and i flung my arms round her neck and held her with desperate energy dont go if you love me mamma dont go i must go my dear boy what tonight mamma yes tonight the carriage is waiting her lips quivered she wrung her hands with an impatient gesture dont ask any more questions gerard i am going a long journey with a friend now lie down like a good boy and go to sleep and when will you come back she was weeping passionately and didnt answer tomorrow she shook her head then take me too i will be a good boyindeed i will but dont go away and leave me i cant take you gerard where i am going you cannot come she tried to unclasp my clinging arms but it was some time before she succeeded i held her so fast oh my poor little boys my poor little boys she cried in an agony of grief as she bent over me and kissed my sleeping brother what a wretch i am to leave you to the care of such a father gerard she said softly if i never come back will you sometimes think of me and continue to love your poor mother i was growing sleepy and was too young to comprehend the terrible truth concealed by those words i dimly remember as in a dream a tall man leaning over us and extricating my mother from my clinging arms he is going to sleep charlotte dearest you should have spared yourself this trying scene how can i live without them charles she sobbed and stretched her arms towards us you must now live for me charlotte we have ventured too far to go back come away my love it is time we were on board that was the last time i ever saw my mother before she left the room i was asleep in blissful ignorance of the great calamity that had befallen me though guilty of a terrible crime i have never been able to banish her from my heartwhere she must ever remain as one of the most beautiful visions of childhood poor gentle affectionate illused mother with a heart brimful of love and kindness how dreadful the conflict must have been between duty to a husband who never loved her and fidelity to the man by whom she was passionately loved terrible must have been her mental struggles before she resolved to burst those sacred ties asunder and leave for ever the children so dear to her was she more guilty than the husband who in defiance of his marriage vows lived in open adultery with another woman on whose children he bestowed the parental love he withheld from those born in lawful wedlock wasting the noble fortune he obtained through his injured wife among disreputable companions in low scenes of debauchery and vice the world can always extenuate the fault of the male offender and lay the blame solely upon his unhappy partner insinuating that faults of temper and a want of sympathy in his tastes and pursuits was most probably the cause of his estrangementunscrupulously branding her name with scorn and infamy there is one however who weighs in an equal balance the cause and the effects produced by it in the actions of men who will judge her more leniently the merciful saviour who said to the erring woman dragged into his presence to be made a public example and put to a cruel death woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more oh how my bosom thrilled and my heart burned within me when i read that text seriously for the first time and thought of my poor mother and was comforted with the blessed hope that she too might be forgiven gerards voice faltered and dorothy felt the strong frame tremble with emotion but the stronger will conquered the human weakness and he continued my fathers sense of honour in the worlds acceptation of the term was stung by the desertion of his neglected wife he learned that the fugitives had been seen in paris and lost no time in tracing them out a duel was the result in which my father received a mortal wound his body was brought home and buried with due pomp in the family vault my brother was seven years of age myself a little chubby boy in frocks and trowsers and we had to act as chief mourners in that melancholy pageant we saw the coffin that contained the mortal remains of our father the once handsome and admired colonel fitzmorris placed in due form among the forgotten members of his ancient house and after the nine days wonder was over he was as much forgotten by his fashionable associates as if he had never been the night before my father died by the hand of the man who had dishonoured him he made a will leaving everything he possessed to my brother francis the settlement made from my mothers property on younger children alone falling to my share as there were no other younger children and the property was considerable i was nearly as independent as my brother we were left to the guardianship of the earl of wilton who you will remember was our maternal grandfather the brothers fitzmorris having married two daughters of that noble house and females not being excluded from the succession sir thomas fitzmorris the present earls elder brother was the heir presumptive to the title and estates lord wilton was a cold proud man of the world and the slur that my mothers elopement and subsequent marriage with general halstead had cast upon the family did not enhance his love for her children he took more to frank than he did to me though he said that he greatly resembled his rascally father he was a handsome dashing boy with the same winning popular manners that had contributed to the ruin of colonel fitzmorris fond of money but only with the intent to spend it from a child he paid great court to his wealthy grandfather in the hope of becoming heir to the immense private fortune he had the power to bestow in this fortune hunting edward fitzmorris the present earl was quite as much interested as my brother but he pursued his object with a great deal more tact the fitzmorrises though an old family and highly connected were not a wealthy family and captain fitzmorris was a younger son with little more to depend upon than a very handsome person and his commission in the army he watched us lads with a very jealous eye giving us very little cause to regard him with affection he was many years our senior his father having married early and ours late in lifein fact he was a man when we were noisy boys not yet in our teens it was only during the holidays that we ever met as we were sent to eton and then to college it is of no use to tell you dorothy of all the thoughts and follies which too often mark a schoolboys and a students life suffice it to say that your grave gerard was no better than the rest a more frolicsome mischievous imp never drew the breath of life always in trouble and difficulties of some sort or another and when at oxford the most daring leader of the wildest and most reckless set of young fellows that ever threw away fortune health and respectability at that famous seat of learning how little i thought of religion in those days still less of ever mounting a pulpit or teaching the poor and ignorant at twentyone i received from my grandfather a cadetship for india and went out as a soldier to fight under the present lord wellington who was then sir arthur wellesley you start dorothy your future husband a soldier it is pleasant to read your astonishment in those large wondering eyes i bear the marks of some hot service too in sundry ugly scars which i regarded as badges of honour in those worldloving days it was while suffering severely from one of these wounds that i was sent home to see if my native air could restore me to health before leaving india i determined if possible to obtain an interview with my mother i had never met her husband though i had eagerly sought an opportunity to revenge upon him the death of my father my mother i found had been dead several months and her husband had been appointed to command a division in spain i was terribly disappointed that i could not shoot this man who had been the best and kindest of husbands to the woman he had led astray from the path of duty and was reported as almost inconsolable for her loss when i returned to england great changes had taken place my grandfather was dead my cousin sir thomas was likewise dead and the present earl who had been for some years a widower had come in for the title and all the immense private fortune belonging to his grandfather of course francis and i felt ourselves very much aggrieved that we were not mentioned in his will and my brother who had been living a life of reckless extravagance and hoping to pay off his debts with his share of the spoil was terribly disappointed my aunt lady dorothy for whom i had always felt the deepest regard invited me to spend the time i remained in england at her beautiful residence in devonshire it was here that i first met her charming cousin miss julia curzon with whom i fell in love at first sight dont be jealous little one more episodes of this kind occur in the lives of men than women and the first love though remembered the longest is not always the wisest or the best i did love this fair accomplished girl with all the energy of youthful passion and my love was not only returned but accepted and i looked forward to our union as the consummation of my earthly happiness i did not then suspect that she loved the world better than she did me and was more afraid of incurring its censure than of rendering me miserable for life several months glided away in that earthly paradise and in constant companionship with the woman i adored i considered myself the happiest of men i saw no clouds in my smiling horizon and never anticipated a storm the dark days came at length that shrouded the sunbeams of hope in gloom and obscurity the summer had set in with intense heat and much sickness prevailed in the neighbourhood a slight cold i had taken was succeeded by typhus fever of the most malignant type when the nature of my malady was made known to the household all the leading members becoming alarmed for their own safety left the house and fled to the seaside julia deserted me without venturing to bid me farewell even my brother who was on a visit with lady dorothy abandoned me as all supposed on my deathbed to the care of hirelings who were indifferent about me and more anxious that i should die than live as in the former case it would remove from them the sense of danger and responsibility oh dorothy selfish and worldly as i had been unguided by the holy precepts of religion i hardly think that i could have deserted any one so near and dear to me as a betrothed wife and an only brother in such sore extremity i was anxious to keep julia and francis out of danger but their selfish conduct went home to my heart i thought about it continually and raved about their cruelty during the hours when fever and delirium were in the ascendant one friend however remained constant to me in the hour of need never deserting his post by my bedside a most tender and selfconstituted nurse he was the son of a small yeoman who for the sake of good wages with which he helped to maintain his widowed mother and her family had undertaken the care of my horses of which i possessed several splendid animals being a keen sportsman charles harley had formed a strong attachment to me though i often laughed at him for his pious propensities the young fellow however was so conscientious in the discharge of his duty that he had won my respect and for his humble opportunities was a man of superior endowments possessing a fine intellect and strong good sense in my rational mood he took great delight in reading the scriptures to me the monotony of his voice wearied me i was so much indebted to him for his kind attention to me in my helpless state that i did not like to wound his feelings by telling him to desist that i wanted faith to believe in his dogmas but i considered them a great bore often pursuing my own train of thought without listening to him the first night that the fever took a favourable turn and my burning eyelids at last closed to sleep i had an awful dream or inspiration i will call it to rouse me from a state of careless indifference to the future and set before me the urgent necessity of selfexamination and repentance i thought i was travelling with a gay and joyous set of companions fellows to whom i was wellknown through a beautiful and highly cultivated country my father and brother and my affianced bride formed part of the pleasureseeking crowd some were on horseback some on foot and some in splendid carriages but all intent on one object and evidently bound to the same place as i journeyed onward somewhat behind the rest there gradually rose before me in the east the walls of a magnificent city sloping back from the banks of a wide deep stream in the depths of whose clear pellucid waters towers and spires and majestic trees were reflected in golden splendour the very sight of which created in me an intense desire and impelled me forward to reach the height on which it stood while feasting my eyes upon the novel spectacle so different from anything i had ever before seen a sudden halt took place in the foremost ranks of our jovial company when noisy shouts and acclamations were changed into groans and shrieks and melancholy wailings i hurried forward to ascertain the cause of the delay and learn the reason of such frantic lamentations it was then that i first discovered that between us and the shining river that flowed beneath the walls of the golden city extended a fearful gulf of unknown depth and shrouded in utter darkness which completely intersected the country precluding the possibility of any advance in that direction from the yawning jaws of this frightful abyss a lurid mist continually floated up hiding the celestial city from my view into this hideous chasm as if driven by an irresistible impulse or dire necessity the crowd so lately full of noisy merriment slowly and surely disappeared some made desperate efforts to escape and clung to the rocks and bushes and called upon their comrades to save them from destruction others plunged sullenly into the awful gulf with stoical indifference to their fate without asking assistance from their companions in misery or uttering one prayer for mercy i watched them one after another disappear till my mind was overwhelmed with horrortill my hair stiffened on my head and my limbs were paralyzed with fear i could not utter a sound or make an effort to escape from a doom which appeared inevitable but my soul sent up a cry through that dense darkness which reached though unspoken to the throne of the great judgesave me lord for i perish a flash of vivid lightning dispelled for a moment the black horrors of the scene and revealed to me a cross towering above the dreadful abyss and planted upon a rock and one bound thereon like unto the son of man pale bleeding and dewed with the deathagony and written above his head in characters of light which revealed all the ghastly horrors of that dismal scene i read these words look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth that light pierced my soul like a twoedged sword and pointed out the only way by which i could escape i sprang forward i toiled on hands and knees up the steep acclivity and sank down gasping at the foot of the cross embracing it with desperate energy in my arms i awoke bedewed with a cold perspiration and trembling in every limb thank god it is but a dream i cried as i felt the clasp of harleys hand who had heard me scream in my sleep and had hurried to my assistance but such a dreamoh such a frightful dream so terribleso realit looked like truth he gave me a composing draught and after a while begged me to tell him what had frightened me so much in my sleep i was ashamed to tell him my dream for fear he should think me a coward for quailing before a mere vision of the night but it haunted me continually waking or sleeping it was ever present to my mind i still imagined myself standing upon the brink of that dreadful precipicestill heard the cries of my lost companions ringing in my ears as the cloud received them in its sable folds and the yawning gulf swallowed them up for ever i no longer turned a deaf ear to harleys prayers or listened with indifference while he read to me the word of life my heart responded to every petition and i listened with intense interest to his simple exposition of passages of holy writ my heart was now opened to conviction and hungered and thirsted for a knowledge of divine truth with desperate eagerness a horrible consciousness of guilt pressed so heavily upon my mind that it is a wonder my brain did not yield to the mental pressure after a long struggle with pride i revealed to harley the state of my mind and with many tears besought his advice and assistance with what joy he embraced me and mingled his tears with mine and assured me that i was in the right path that no man without repentance could ever hope to see god that my dream was a solemn warning sent by him to show me the danger of delay and called upon me to abandon my wicked courses and lay down the burthen of my sins at the foot of the cross he besought me in the most eloquent language not to neglect the heavenly vision lest i should share the fate of those i had seen in my dream i was still too weak to leave my bed or read for myself and i fear i taxed the poor fellows strength too much in making him read to me for hours at a time and then i prayed oh dorothy have you ever experienced the mingled joy and agony of earnest heartfelt prayer when shocked at the cold indifference of your own heart you have bowed your head in the dust as one bereft of all hope when a sudden gleam of light has shot into your soul revealing glimpses of heaven and filling your mind with contentment and holy peace such a happy moment came for me at last which repaid me a thousand fold for all my past sufferings and the image of christ was formed in my soul the hope of glory i awoke to a new lifeawoke to rejoice in him for evermore and cheerfully took up the cross to follow him and sufferif called upon to do sogladly for his sake the first trial that awaited me after my recovery was the death of my dear friend harley who took the fever from which a merciful god had suffered me to escape i nursed him with the same devotion he had shown to me and it was in my arms he passed from earth to heaven if anything had been wanting to confirm my faith and strengthen the resolution i had formed of devoting myself to the masters service harleys deathbed would have done it his faith in jesus was so perfect his victory over the last enemy so triumphant that it left no room for cavil or doubt when my friends heard of my intention of leaving the army and studying for the church they pronounced me mad and it was publicly reported through the country that i had lost my senses during the fever my conversion was a standing joke among my gay companions and my brother was never tired of quizzing me about it and making it the subject of ribald jests this was hard enough to bear but when julia curzon whom i loved so truly joined with the rest in ridiculing my absurd fanaticism as she was pleased to call it and declared that if i persisted in such folly she never would become my wife i was sorely tempted to step back into the old path and resign for her sake my newborn hopes of heaven fortunately for me i was saved from such wickedness by the young lady herself who ran off with a rich country squire with whom she had been flirting desperately at the seaside during my illness this ended my romance of life i felt heartily ashamed of myself for having loved such a worldlyminded woman my love for her was sincere but i had no other basis to support it than mere beauty and a certain amount of fashionable accomplishments my castle was built upon the sands and the foundations yielded readily to the first shock and when it fell though humbled and mortified i regained my freedom after this disappointment i returned to college to redeem the time i had wasted there in the days of my reckless youth and to study diligently for my profession it was more than two years before i was satisfied with the sincerity of my belief and my fitness for so sacred a calling when i gladly accepted from lord wilton the parishes of hadstone and storby as vicar under him and now little wife you are acquainted with the leading points of my history and nothing more remains to be told so let us up and be walking homewards or we shall be too late for the school examination this evening kissing the small hand that insinuated itself into his own he lifted her from her lowly seat and they returned to the parsonage in time for tea chapter viii mr fitzmorris reads a temperance lecture mr fitzmorris lost no time in writing to lord wilton and informing him of his engagement with dorothy chance not because he considered that the earl had any power to influence her choice but as a matter of courtesy he having proved himself a kind friend to the orphan girl that she was his daughter he had little doubt if a legitimate child such a worldlyminded man as he knew the earl to have been in his younger days would never have consented to see her the wife of gilbert rushmere a man so much beneath him in birth and education the idea was preposterous and fully convinced him that she was the offspring of some unfortunate connection in which the earl had suffered loss of honour and perhaps a woman whom he had passionately loved henry martin represented him as a conscience stricken and unhappy man who seemed anxious to make atonement for the evil acts of his past life by deeds of benevolence and kindness he has stumbled upon that great stumbling stone said the good curate in thinking it possible to obtain the forgiveness of sins through acts of charity and selfsacrifice if this could be done there was no need of an atonement and the cross would never have groaned beneath the weight of the son of god whatever was the nature of the tie that bound dorothy to the earl it was involved in mystery which gerard fitzmorris cared very little to solve his love for dorothy was so pure and disinterested that had he found her begging along the highway and been convinced of the noble qualities of heart and mind with which she was endowed he would have thanked god with all the fervour of his large heart for giving him such a wife he made no allusion in his letter to these matters but merely stated that the admiration he felt for dorothy chance and her unaffected piety had kindled in his heart a sincere and ardent attachment which had overcome the prejudices of education and caste and induced him to make her his wife that having lost her fostermother she had no place which she could properly call her home or any legal protector to silence the shafts of calumny that were already assailing her character in all directions that he was happy in having secured the affections of the woman he loved and he was certain that his noble kinsman as a friend to both parties would rejoice in this happy union and dorothy wrote to her absent friend all that was in her heart hadstone parsonage dear lord wilton i am no scribe and never attempted to write a letter before in my life so you must excuse the cramped hand and all the other blunders and blots which really i cannot help i was in great trouble when i got your kind letter for my poor mother was dying a cruel painful death from cancer and my heart was very sore with having to dress her wounds and witness her sufferings i read your generous expressions of love and friendship with the deepest gratitude and entered into your sorrows with tears of true and heartfelt sympathy wondering who i was to awaken such an interest in the mind of a great lord pondering this over and over in my own way a sudden thought struck me i will not mention it for i know it would pain you perhaps more than it did me but it had reference to my unknown mother and i felt very angry and hoped that what i expected might not be the case and that i might still continue to love and honour you as heretofore which indeed i could not do if those wicked thoughts were true they took such a hold of my mind that i was going to tear your letter and the draft you sent me to pieces and trample them under my feet i was saved from committing such an outrage by my poor friend mrs rushmere who told me that i was acting very foolishly you may know by this that i am not so meek as i look but a very vixen when bad thoughts get into my head oh my good lord you need not have told me that you were not my lover indeed indeed i never was so vain or presumptuous to imagine such a thing though if i had been such a little simpleton it would not have been half so bad as the other crime of which i suspected you i thank you much for your generous gift but i have had no occasion to use it and when you come back i will return the draft to you a great many things have happened since you went away gilbert came to visit his parents and brought down with him his wife and her mother and a very disagreeable servant girl which put me sadly about and mother so sick when i saw gilbert again i wondered how i had ever loved him so much and made myself so miserable he is far handsomer is better dressed and externally improved in every way yet i felt glad that i could never be his wife he was kind enough but his women folk treated me very cruelly and insulted me in every way they could their conduct was such that if i had not promised dear mother to stay with her till all was over i would have left the house the very day they entered it they were not contented with insulting me themselves but set the vulgar impudent girl they had with them to harass and annoy me in every way these women called themselves ladies but to me they seemed like illbred pretenders who asserted their claims to respectability by treating with insolence and contempt those whom they considered inferiors oh my lord i was really ashamed of shedding so many tears about their unkind speeches and unwomanly remarks but i found their conduct was making me as wicked as themselves you knew my old dog pincher the scotch terrier that you said should be called old faithful because he loved me so well the vile girl martha wood actually murdered her mistresss pet poodle that she might lay the blame upon poor pincher tom our farm servant told me he saw her do it over the hedge and mrs gilbert rushmere gave the wretch half a crown to hang my noble pincher i believe this treacherous girl would have betrayed our blessed saviour for thirty pieces of copper this which will appear but a light matter to your lordship caused me the keenest grief when we have few friends to love us the attachment of these simple creatures seems to me so touching my dear mother was found dead in her bed on the tenth of last july she had had a long conversation with me about her end which everybody saw was fast approaching the night before and was so tranquil and happy and spoke so cheerfully of it as a blessed release from great suffering and of the perfect peace she enjoyed in the assurance of her saviours love that it seemed an act of impiety any one wishing to detain her from her promised rest i stayed until after the funeral to comfort the dear old man and restore something of order to the house while i was busy packing up my few things to remove to dear mrs martins young mrs rushmere came into the room and demanded of me the key of my trunk that she might see if i had taken anything that did not belong to me it made me feel dreadful oh my lord your good gentle dorothy was turned into a fiend but for the restraining hand of god i believe i should have murdered her well my lord when she did examine my trunkfor i called up her husband and made her do it before him did she not produce the two large silver gravy spoons that belonged to the old covenanter sir lawrence rushmere of whose picture father is so proud as if by magic from the bottom of the box though i knew i was innocent i am sure that i looked as if i was guilty i could not have felt worse if satan himself had accused me before the throne of god i was so bewildered that i did not know how to defend myself and when she told her husband to call in a constable and send me to gaol to be tried for theft and i knew that the evidence might hang or transport me i felt dumb with horror gilbert however suspected treachery and proved my innocence past a doubt through the evidence of martha wood whom she had only partially made acquainted with her scheme to ruin me and so a merciful providence turned the tables against her you may be certain that i was not long in leaving a house that contained such inmates pitying gilbert the possession of such a wife and doubly pitying the poor forlorn old man who must depend upon her for all his future comforts and now my lord that i have wearied you with an account of all my troubles i must tell you something that has made me very gladso glad that i consider myself the happiest woman in england mr fitzmorris loves me and has asked me to be his wife i know that i am not worthy to be the wife of such an excellent man but if i am always with him i cannot fail in becoming wiser and better for i love him with all my heart and feel in very truth that our union cemented on earth will last for ever mr fitzmorris has recently lost his brother and our marriage will not take place before the spring with sincere wishes for the speedy recovery of your son and that your lordship may enjoy many years of health and happiness i remain your grateful little friend dorothy chance lord wilton received this quaint and singularly candid letter a few days after the death of his son and just as he was embarking for england to carry the loved remains to their final resting place in the family vault this was not exactly the sort of letter lord wilton had waited so impatiently to receive he had expected sentiment mingled with a dash of youthful romance and he found only an unvarnished truthful statement of plain facts one passage in dorothys epistle however instantly riveted his attention francis fitzmorris dead he exclaimed and dorothys future husband heir to the earldom and estates how strange what an unexpected interposition of providence to save me from exposure and disgrace while she will lose nothing by that sad affair remaining an impenetrable secret what the earl alluded to has yet to be explained dorothys engagement to the vicar could not long be concealed in a small village like hadstone whether through servants or the shrewd observation of neighbours it soon leaked out miss watling was in arms in a moment and stoutly denied the facts wherever she went while old mistress barford insisted that the report was true that she had heard it from the very best authority from mrs martin herself the dispute was at its height when the two women stepped into the hall at heath farm in order to return a friendly visit from its present mistress have you heard the news mr rushmere said mrs barford addressing the old gentleman who had greatly failed since his wifes death and was composing himself for an afternoon nap in the great chair what news quoth he theres very little news that can interest me now your old favourite dorothy chance is going to be married ay thats summat though and he leaned eagerly forward and quite wide awake shell make an excellent wife whoever has the luck to get a whos the man no less a person than the vicar young mr fitzmorris theres a chance for her what our dolly marry the parson and he rubbed his hands in great glee good for her i beg mr rushmere that you will not believe a word of it cried miss watling a very likely thing indeed for a man of his condition to marry the child of some miserable vagabond its a story all got up between dorothy and mrs martin to throw discredit on mr fitzmorris who everybody knows is not a marrying man no discredit i should think to him or to any one said gilbert turning with a flushed face from the window where he was standing if marrying a beautiful virtuous woman can be a disgrace thats right gilbert speak up for your old love sneered nancy unrestrained in venting her spleen by the lowering brow of gilbert but ladies she continued is it probable that this man who is now lord wiltons heir will ever make such a woman as that a countess ah said mrs barford i told you more than a year ago nancy that we might live to see dorothy chance ride to church in her carriage ill believe it when i see it remarked mrs rushmere i should as soon expect seeing martha wood a countess the girl is very pretty said mrs rowly there is no denying that but i dont believe that she is either virtuous or over honest my daughter caught her stealing silver spoons howwhats that who dares to call dorothy a thief cried old rushmere starting to his feet if it were goliath of gath i would tell him he lied that a wud my wife did replied gilbert sullenly and had to eat her words i think sophia considering the part you took in that infamous affair it would have been better for you to have held your tongue always against your wife sir but i know the reason why you are so savage this afternoon you dont like to hear that dorothy chance is going to marry a better man than yourself replied sophia in her softest tone she deserves it as much as i did a better wife he left the room slamming the door after him miss watling raised her eyebrows shrugged her shoulders and cast a pitying look towards his wife sophia smiled thats a warning to all young unmarried ladies miss watling not to be too eager to get a husband i can assure them that it is far better to remain single you may spare such advice mrs rushmere it will never appear rational except to the initiated said mrs barford from the time of eve downwards old maids and young maids never will give up the hope of getting married i had a maiden aunt of sixty who put this proviso in her will i leave all my personal property to my nephew james stanton but in case of my marrying an event not impossible though rather improbable i revoke the said bequest if men are such bad folks said old rushmere i want to know mrs barford why all the widdies are so anxious to thrust their heads again under the yoke they have met with one bad husband and hope to get a better returned mrs rowly thinking that in duty bound she ought to speak up for them there is one piece of advice however which i who have been some years a widow would give to both widows and maids never to marry a cross superannuated old man and she cast a scornful glance at the master of the house sour grapes muttered the old rushmere one shefox is enough in a house without having two to eat the grapes what did you say about foxes mr rushmere asked miss watling very innocently have they been troubling your poultry lately yes nancy eating me out of house and home i wish a could get rid of such troublesome vermin you must feel the loss of your wife very much remarked the same kind individual more an more every day while mary lived i had a quiet comfortable home but now i am no longer master o my own house ay times are changed but it wont be for long and taking up his staff he hobbled out the poor old man is failing very fast said mrs barford what a hale strong man he was a year ago oh he frets and fumes and finds fault with everything returned mrs gilbert its of no use attempting to please himin fact i now never try a nice house it would be if i allowed him to interfere between him and his son i lead the life of a dog how do you get on with the dairy mrs rushmere asked mrs barford heath farm was always celebrated for its butter and cheese i have given all that up returned mrs gilbert i can tell old rushmere and his son that they wont make a dairymaid of me but how will you live without it the farm is fit for nothing else i dont care i just get martha to make enough butter to supply the house the old fellow grumbles and says its only fit for cart grease but if i can eat it i am sure he may i wont put up with his airs poor old man sighed mrs barford as they left the house its very plain to me how all this will end gilbert cant work and this wife of his wont and the old place will soon come to the hammer if all we hear of gilberts constant visits to the alehouse be true how dirty and untidy everything looks said miss watling i was afraid the dusty chairs would spoil my black silk dress how neat and clean the house used to be in dorothys time suggested mrs barford rushmere did a foolish thing when he hindered gilbert from marrying her however the poor girl will be much better off oh dont talk about her i hate her very name nancy it is all envy returned mrs barford laughing you will like her very much when she is countess of wilton what mrs barford had hinted about gilberts visits to the publichouse in the village was but too true the young man had no peace or happiness at home his wife and her mother insulted and abused his old father who gave way alternately to fits of passion and sullen gloom he would appeal to gilbert when he felt himself unusually aggrieved but for the sake of peace for he was really afraid of his wife gilbert chose to remain neutral this enraged the old man who would call him a poor henpecked coward to stand by and see him illtreated then gilbert roused in his turn would tell him that it was his own fault that if he had let him marry the woman he loved they might have been all happy together one evening when dorothy and her lover were returning home through the lane from visiting a sick man in the country they observed a tall man staggering along before them making very ludicrous efforts to keep his balance which was greatly frustrated by the want of an arm thats poor rushmere said gerard walk home dear dorothy i must speak to him i cannot see a fellowcreature in this state without attempting to warn him of his danger directly dorothy was out of sight for she took the path over the heath he followed gilbert and laying his hand gently on his shoulder said my friend you are in the wrong path take my advice and i will guide you into a better go to was the awful rejoinder from the intoxicated soldier no my friend i should be very sorry to travel one step in your road it is to save you from the frightful termination of your journey that i now address you i neither care for your cant nor your companionship begone and leave me to pursue my own way and gilbert turned fiercely round and struck mr fitzmorris a heavy blow with his left hand do you like that you see and he laughed bitterly though i am drunk and have only one hand i have some strength left gilbert rushmere said gerard very quietly i do not mean to resent your blow though now a canting parson i was for five years a soldier you lost your arm in one great battle i have received wounds in four i am no coward those who fight under the banner of the prince of peace must use other weapons than those wielded by the arm of fleshpatience temperance and brotherly love i cannot be angry with you i pity you from my very heart and would save you if you would allow me to do so if i had known you had been a soldier mr fitzmorris and fought and bled for old england i should have been the last man in the world to strike you can you forgive me with all my heart there is my hand the blow i gave you was a severe one rather i could have returned it with interest i was once a good boxer but i wish to be your friend cannot i persuade you rushmere to renounce this vile habit and escape from the ruin which it involves i cannot promise you mr fitzmorris even to try it is the only relief i have the only antidote to misery like mine the sooner it kills me the sooner i shall get rid of this wretched world i hate and loathe my life and want to die that would be all very well if you could kill your soul but though you may sinfully abuse and destroy the machine in which it dwells to destroy that is beyond your power it is only the god who made it that can destroy both body and soul in hell suppose that you succeed in killing yourself you will find the second state worse than the first a whole eternity of misery instead of a few years spent on earth dont push me off rushmere i cant see you perish in this foolish way without trying to convince you of your sin i will listen to you some other time i have heard enough for one night if you could tell me how to get rid of my wife i would listen to you patiently all day he brushed hastily past his foot caught on a stone and he measured his length upon the dusty road see you are not in a fit state to guide yourself and gerard once more set him on his feet go out of my way i can get on without you if you knew how jolly a glass makes me feel you would get drunk too and he staggered on singing at the top of his voice which is the properest day to drink sunday that parson wont do for your shop good night unhappy man said gerard what good angel can arrest your downward course if he will not be persuaded by me i must try what dorothy can do i could almost love the fellow for having had taste enough to love her chapter ix the old man in prison several weeks passed away happily enough for dorothy and her lover who every day became better acquainted with each other and more deeply sensible of the congeniality of character which though different in many trifling points yet harmonized so well together while they advanced hand in hand along that narrow path whose steep ascent towards perfection no human being ever trod unrewarded or in vain a very different line of conduct had been adopted by gilbert rushmere and his wife private quarrels had increased to public brawls insulting language and mutual recriminations and the house was kept in such a miserable state that few of the old friends and associates of the family ventured across the threshold lawrence rushmere had cause enough to repent of his interference between dorothy chance and his son and found to his cost that little peace or comfort remained for him in his old age the farm was going to ruin gilbert was never home until late at night when he generally was conducted to the house by some neighbouring toper as fond of losing his senses in the bowl but in a lesser degree of brutal intoxication mrs gilbert raved and her mother reviled and scorned and the wretched old man if he attempted to make his voice heard in the domestic uproar was silenced by mrs gilbert telling him to hold his tongue that she wanted no advice from such a superannuated dotard the report of these doings at heath farm were not long in reaching the ears of the vicar and gave great pain to dorothy what was to be done to rescue gilbert from ruin that was the great question mr fitzmorris tried to obtain an interview with him and for that purpose called several times at the house but always received the same answer from martha wood that young mr rushmere was not at home where was he to be found she did not know perhaps at jonathan slys at the plough and harrow may be at storby where he was looking for a man to whom he had sold a team of horses so to storby the vicar went and inquired of every likely and unlikely place in the town for lieutenant rushmere at one low tavern the landlord told him that he had been there with a horse jockey that they had some liquor and went out again he believed to bet in the cockpit where may that be i did not know that you had such an abomination in the town said mr fitzmorris well its not zactly in the town sir theres a little low hedge ale house by the road side as you come in by the back way a hole kept by old striker that was a smuggler and made to suffer some years agone he keeps the game cock it is a bad place only resorted to by thieves and swindlers and a dreadful pity that the leaftenant ha got in with such a set hell soon bring the old man to a gaol and hisself is going to the devil as fast as he can mr fitzmorris perceived the great urgency of getting gilbert out of the clutches of these men and after thinking over the matter for some minutes he proposed to the landlord to go with him to the game cock and tell young rushmere that a friend wanted to speak to him on a matter of great importance na na i would not venture my nose in amongst them wild chaps for a crown piece you see sir im but a little man of a quiet turn i never could fight in my life an its only farm labourers that ever frequents my tap an they have but little money to spend and are too heavy and loompish to quarrel and kick up a bobbery they only laughs and grins and jokes one with the tother whiles they drinks a glass of beer or yeats a mouthful of bread an cheese on their way down with their teams to the wharf where they ships loads of corn an then return with coals these poor creturs are just harmless as lambs the fellows that rushmere has got in with are a set of noisy dare devils wholl knock a man down as soon as look at him i think yer reverence had better not go near them my duty lies in such places and while in the performance of it i feel afraid of no man can you give me directions as to the situation of the cockpit without the necessity of my going into the house just beside the house there runs a high brick wall open a low door about the middle of it and youll find yourself in a shed with a set of rude fellows swarming round it looking down upon the pit with the cocks its exciting work sir that fighting with the bonnie birds continued the little man with a knowing twinkle in his eye but tis reckoned a vulgar low pastime now in my young days lauk a mercy sir it was played by high and low and fortins have been won an lost on a game cock did your reverence ever see a match i have seen my friend more than is good in my short life when i foolishly thought more of the amusements of this world than of the endless happiness and glory of the next ah sir a man cant allers be thinking of heaven and reading the bible and saying prayers all the time im sure if i were your reverence i should find it very dull work mr fitzmorris smiled goodnaturedly there are many ways my friend of serving god besides reading the bible and praying when we endeavour to follow our blessed lords example in trying to do good to our fellowcreatures we award him the best praise of which our nature is capable and the man who loves him and does all for his sake without claiming any merit for himself enjoys in acts of love and charity the most exquisite pleasure laying his hand emphatically on the little publicans shoulders he continued seek the lord earnestly diligently and with your whole heart and serve him faithfully and you will know the truth of what i say and experience such joy and inward satisfaction as you never dreamed of before the heaven of a true christian commences on earth for where god is there is heaven if his spirit dwells in you old things pass away and all things become new before he had finished the sentence a farmservant came up to the little tavern in hot haste hullo barnaby he cried can yer tell un aught o young measter rushmere the bullybailiffs are in the houseold measter raging like a wild bullmistress crying an wringing her handsthe old un scolding and fussing the blackguard of a servantgirl laughing in her sleeve to hear what she calls the funan the

the devil to pay an no pitch hot it seems hot enough joe by your account already returned master barnaby this will be a good excuse for your reverence to get him away from that sink o iniquity let us lose no time said mr fitzmorris turning to the man who was standing gaping at him with open mouth and eyes my good fellow can you show me the way to the game cock why yees sir its on our way whome supposing yer goes round the back o the heath yer sartainly wont find measter gilbert there he is there and gerard swung his strong oak stick in the air and followed his conductor at a rapid pace down a narrow footpath that led across the marshes to hadstone it was a lonely desolate tract intersected with wide ditches full of stagnant water generally crossed by a single plank the sluggish river crept its lazy length to the sea between high banks of mud and when the tide was out its dimensions contracted to a tiny stream which flowed through a wide bed composed of the same alluvial deposit that filled the air for miles with a rank fishy smell a footpath ran along the top of the mudbank and mr fitzmorris and his guide followed this till they came to a low stone bridge with one arch of very ancient structure which crossed the mainroad to london where the heath sank down to the level of the salt flats a few paces from the bridge and below the heath a low dwelling composed of wattle and daub bore the ostentatious sign of a large fiery red game cock in the act of crowing as if to give notice to the tired pedestrian that he could get refreshments for man and beast at the house kept by jonas striker well measter fitzmorris this be the place an yer wud knowt by the uproar thats going on in the shed without the help o the bird thats allers crowing but never do crow outside the door but dont yer hear the crowing an clapping o wings o the bully birds within an the shouts o the men that ha won on the conqueror mr fitzmorris did not answer he pushed open the door of which barnaby had spoken and entering the yard with a firm decided step walked up to the drunken and noisy crowd some drew back as he advanced as if ashamed of being caught by the parson in such a disreputable place while others turned and faced him with an audacious stare gilbert rushmere who was leaning on the rail cried out in a sneering tone you are too late for the main parson but just in time to perform the funeral service over the black cock there he lieshis last battle ended as brave a knight as ever wore steel spurs ill be chief mourner for i ventured upon him my last guinea without taking the least notice of this speech or the ribald crew by whom he was surrounded gerard went up to gilbert and drew him forcibly apart rushmere i have bad news for you come home with me the bailiffs are in the house and everything in confusion at heath farm you know what the feelings of the proud independent old man must be in such circumstances leave this disgusting place and your vicious companions and i will see what i can do to save your family from disgrace gilbert looked in gerards face with a halfstupefied stare of blank incredulity now parson you are only funning methis is one of your pious dodges to get me out of this i know im a fool to be herebut having once passed the rubicon i dont mean to go back what i tell you is perfectly true here is your manservant ask him surely surely mr rushmere you have enough of manhood left in you not to suffer your wife and poor old father to bear the weight of such a calamity alone as to father let him take it he deserves it all but for him you would not be in my shoes rejoicing that the woman who ought to have been my wife will shortly be yours you might be contented i think without following me like my shadow to triumph over me gilbert rushmere said mr fitzmorris very gravely i never saw dorothy until after you were the husband of another your desertion of her when you knew how much she loved you was no deed of your fathers but your own voluntary act for he never knew of your marriage until a few days before you came down to heath farm and let me tell you that any man who could desert such a noble woman as dorothy chance for the sake of a few thousand pounds was most unworthy to be her husband but she has nothing to do with the matter now in hand it is profanation to breathe her name in such an assemblage as this do you mean to come home with me or not i wont go home in your company i have nothing to say against you i believe you to be an honourable man and a gentleman but i hate you for supplanting me in the affections of the only woman i ever loved the very sight of you makes me wish to break the sixth commandment why act the part of the dog in the manger you cannot marry dorothy yourself why entertain such uncharitable feelings towards me because i have taste enough to prize a jewel that you cast from you come rushmere let better feelings prevail dismiss this unreasonable jealousy and listen to the advice of one who sincerely wishes to be your friend can you tell me the amount of this execution if it is within my power i will try and settle it for dorothys sake youll be afool for your pains if you do and he laughed scornfully it is the first but it will not be the last i want no man especially you of all men to ruin himself for me every thing has gone wrong with me since i married that woman if she would have put her shoulder to the wheel and worked for me i would have forgiven her the folly and wickedness of deceiving me but she does nothing but run up bills and make me miserable shes not a bad looking woman and i might have learned to love her in time but theres no chance of that now im not sorry for this business for i hope it will be the means of my getting rid of her go home i wont they may fight it out the best way they can and turning suddenly on his heel he disappeared among the crowd full of grief at his want of success mr fitzmorris took the road that led to heath farm here to his grief and indignation he was informed by martha wood that the old man had been taken off to prison for debt and the ladies were shut up in their own room and could not receive visitors tired with a long fruitless walk and feeling sad at heart he determined to visit lawrence rushmere early the next morning and if possible to pay the amount of his debt anxious to save dorothy from useless distress he did not inform her of the cause that had kept him away so long she only remarked as he kissed her cheek my dear gerard looks tired and paler than usual oh dolly he replied it is a sad world one is never allowed to feel happy in it long if it were always the paradise that you have made it for the last few weeks i should never like to leave it all things darling are for the best the purest pleasures are born in the lap of sorrow as the brightest sunshine succeeds the darkest storm directly after breakfast he ordered his horse and gig and telling mrs martin that he could not be home before night drove over to the town of in which the gaol was situated before going to visit the old man he went to the lawyer at the suit of whose client he had been incarcerated to discover the amount of the debt which he found to be under three hundred pounds including the law costs it was a large sum for mr fitzmorris having expended all he could well spare from his own income in settling his brothers affairs paying funeral and law expenses and other items any thought of his own comfort or convenience seldom stayed the too generous hand that was never held back by selfish motives if it could possibly relieve the necessity of a fellow creature it was only retrenching a few needless luxuries he would say for a few months or years and the interest would be amply repaid there was no bank in which a man could invest his means which made such ample returns as the bank of heaven in which there was no fear of losing your capital as it was chartered for eternity he wrote a check upon his banker for the sum and received the release from mr hodson the man of business i am afraid mr fitzmorris that you have sacrificed this large sum of money to little purpose this though certainly the largest claim against the rushmere estate is not the only one it would require more than a thousand pounds to keep the place from the hammer i thought that lawrence rushmere had been a person who had saved money he had to the amount of a few hundred pounds but the farm is a very poor one which for half a century past has barely supplied the necessary outlay to continue its cultivation when the lieutenant returned the father sacrificed his little earnings to enter into a speculation with his son for furnishing horses to the government for the use of the army such a traffic requires large means and constant attention the young man who was the sole manager got among dissipated companions from buying horses to betting upon them and has not only lost all the money advanced by the father but has involved himself irretrievably the creditors thought it better to bring things to a crisis as the sale of the property might possibly leave a small overplus to keep the old man from the workhouse he is such an impatient obstinate creature observed mr fitzmorris that he may choose to remain in prison rather than pay these creditors that he will be sure to regard not as the injured party but as personal enemies to himself in that case you had better retain in your possession the draft you have just given me until after you have seen and conversed with lawrence rushmere would it be possible to stay proceedings against the estate until after lord wiltons return which is expected daily and remove the old man from prison he is so proud and independent the disgrace of having been inside a gaol will kill him the creditors who are all decent yeomen might be inclined to serve the old man who has always been respected in the county as an honest fellow but being associated in this horse traffic with the son whom they look upon as a great scoundrel throws more difficulties in the way the father was unprepared nay never expected this blow or he might have arranged matters to save himself i could perhaps stave off the other creditors if this first claim were settled for two or three months and a bond were given that they should receive their money at the end of that term the old man who is honest as daylight might indemnify you by turning over to you the estate and continue to farm it for your benefit i will own mr hodson that i do not exactly wish to sacrifice my money for the benefit of gilbert rushmere without he were a reformed character if the estate were mine i could give it to lawrence rushmere rent free for his life the lawyer promised to make all the necessary arrangements to secure mr fitzmorris from unnecessary loss and he left him to communicate to the prisoner the result of his mornings work and to relieve him from durance he found the old man in the debtors room pacing to and fro with a restless stride which proved how much vigour still remained in the tough heart of oak on perceiving mr fitzmorris the caged lion suddenly came to a stand still and confronted him with a gloomy brow and proud defiant eye as he said in a low voice are you come parson to speak to lawrence rushmere in a den like this to seek an honest man among felons an thieves i was allers laughed at for holding my head so high i must carry it a foot higher here to look above a lawless set of ruffians and ragamuffins in spite of his affected bravado the tears stood in the old mans eyes and staggering to a bench he sunk down helplessly upon it and covered his face with his hands i came to seek a friend said gerard laying his hand on the old mans shoulder one whom i esteem or i should not be here oh dang it cried rushmere take off your hand mr fitzmorris no offence i hope but it do put me in mind o the tap that rascal gave me he said in the kings name as if the king god bless him had ever a hand in sending a honest loyal subject like me to prison i had the satisfaction however of knocking the fellow down it did me good i can tell you the cold clear blue eye was lighted up with a gleam of fire which cast an angry glare around like a flash of summer lightning leaping from the dark clouds the man was only in the performance of his duty it was expending your wrath upon a wrong object he just deserved what he got none but a rascal would ever fill such a post none but rascals ever do fill it men far worse in moral character than the villains they take an honest man would sweep the streets before hed earn his living in such a mean way gerard could scarcely forbear a smile at this tirade when rushmere asked him abruptly the cause of his visit to take you out of this place and carry you back to your own home and who pays the debt i have agreed to do that you what business ha you wi paying my debts if lawrence rushmere cant do that he must content himsel to stay here you must not refuse me this great favour consider me as a son willing and anxious to serve you at the mention of the word son the old man sprang to his feet and clenching his fist exclaimed i have no son the rascal who has brought me to this wi his drinking and gambling is no son of mine i disown him now and for everand may my curse mr fitzmorris put his hand before the old mans mouth and in a solemn voice that made him fall back a few paces said who are you that dare curse a fellow creature especially a son though he has rebelled against you it is committing an outrage against your own soulagainst the excellent mother that bore himagainst the most high god who through his blessed son has told us that only as we forgive those that injure us can we ourselves hope to be forgiven oh mary my wife my dead angel it is only for your sake i revoke my curse he be your child but oh he has wounded me in the tenderest part again the old man sank down upon the bench and for a few minutes gerard thought it best to leave him to his own thoughts when he seemed more calm he urged him more earnestly to accompany him back to hadstone to go back to that shecat no a wont i tell you why gaol is a paradise compared to living wi her you must not urge me sir if i dont curse the scamp that has brought me to thisi fear i should kill him if we met but you would not refuse to live with dorothy ah dollyshe was a good lass i have naught to do wi her now it would ha been well for me if a had never set eyes on her but dorothy loves you so sincerely what after i have used her so ill howsomever it was a great service i rendered her when i hindered her from marrying that scoundrel unintentionally on your part my friend you can take no merit for that your son might have turned out a noble character but for that act it was of no use urging the old man to leave the gaol his pride was offended at the idea of mr fitzmorris paying his debts he was hurt too that gilbert had sent no message to let him know how matters really stood or if there remained any chance of paying the creditors by the sale of the property you see mr fitzmorris i trusted all to him i never thought that my own son would neglect the business and ruin me no no i deserve to be here for my folly and here i will remain until all the creditors are paid seeing that he was obstinately bent on adhering to his purpose gerard told him that he would send mr hodson to talk the matter over with him and he would come and see him again when he heard that he had come to a decision he was willing to give him a fair price for the estate and let him remain in it rentfree for his life the old man seemed struck with this last suggestion and promised to listen to reason and so they parted on mr fitzmorris return to hadstone the first news that met his ears was that gilbert rushmere had gone off to parts unknown with martha wood who had dexterously fomented the quarrels between him and his wife to further this object and that mrs gilbert and her mother had packed up and left for london never they said to return to a beggarly place like hadstone chapter x a long chapter the various plans formed by gerard fitzmorris for the future comfort of lawrence rushmere were temporarily suspended by the receipt of a letter from lord wilton who had just landed in liverpool with his sad freight he earnestly requested his cousin to meet him in london and join in the melancholy cortege that would accompany the mortal remains of the young viscount to their last restingplace in the family vault in hadstone church i have much to say to you my dear gerard he wrote upon the important subject which formed the leading topic in the letters received from you and dorothy just as i was about to sail for england but while the arrow rankles in my heart for the death of a justly beloved son i cannot yet bring my mind to dwell upon marrying and giving in marriage this must suffice you both till time has cicatrized the wound the marriage of my daughter dorothy with the last male representative of our ancient house cannot fail to be regarded by me with entire satisfaction i will explain everything when we meet gerard folded the earls letter and sat for some minutes in deep thought most men in his position would have felt more joy than sorrow for the death of a relative they had scarcely known which made them heir to a title and vast wealth gerard fitzmorris cared very little for either distinction he had for some time past felt a deep and growing interest in lord wilton and he sympathised with him most sincerely in the loss of a noble and deserving son he was much struck by the decided manner in which he had avowed without entering into the particulars of the case that dorothy chance was his daughter if legitimately he would have no claim to the earldom which came through a granville and would only be entitled to the baronetcy held by his descent from sir thomas fitzmorris their mutual grandfather dorothy would be countess of wilton in her own right he could not bring himself to believe if this were the case that the earl would have suffered her to remain so long ignorant of her just position time would explain all but he could not fathom the mystery he instantly complied with the earls request to meet him in london before he left hadstone dorothy begged as a great favour that she might accompany him on his journey as far as to take mr rushmere out of gaol and bring him back to heath farm it would be better for me gerard to break to him the elopement of his son and if he will return with me to stay with him at the old place till you come back just like my own dorothy he cried pressing her to his heart go like a good angel as you are and my blessing go with you during their journey gerard gave his betrothed the earls letter to read and watched her countenance during the perusal there was no other passenger inside the coach but themselves they could talk to each other without reserve he saw her start and her cheeks crimson when she came to the paragraph in which his lordship spoke of her as his daughter oh gerard she said bursting into tears as her head sank upon his shoulder had i not better go with you to london to comfort him in his sorrow my father my poor father i can never supply to him the loss of his dear son had he wished it my sweet cousin he would have made the request public taste has dispensed with the presence of female mourners at the funerals of relations and friends the gentle hearts that loved the truest and the best are denied by the tyrant fashion the blessed privilege of seeing the last sad rites performed for the beloved dead after lord fitzmorris funeral your presence will be more needed it is not until the earth closes her bars for ever on the loved and lost that we can fully realize the fact that they can no more return to us on reaching the county town dorothy and her lover partedone to act as chief mourner in a solemn and useless pageant which the good sense of mankind ought to banish from the earth with all its artificial trappings and hired mourners the other to visit that grave of the living a prison and carry hope and comfort to the careworn heart of the victim of a cruel and oppressive law which demands of a man to pay his debts while it deprives him of the chance of doing so following the directions she had received from gerard dorothy went first to mr hodson and learned from him that the debt for which her fosterfather was in gaol had been settled by her lover that everything had been satisfactorily arranged with the other creditors rushmere having concluded to sell heath farm to mr fitzmorris for the sum of two thousand pounds which would pay all the demands upon the estate and leave the old man at liberty the dry man of business was much struck by the extraordinary beauty of the young lady who had deigned to visit his dusty office in behalf of the prisoner and being a widower of some years standing without any incumbrance in the shape of children it struck him that so charming a girl would make him an excellent second wife with this wise project in his head he crossquestioned her very closely on their way to the gaol as to her parentage and station to all which questions she gave such frank and straightforward answers that he soon became acquainted with her private history mr hodson had been employed to make old mrs knights will and well remembered the remarkable clause it contained with regard to the child of the poor vagrant found on the heath which if proofs could be actually obtained that dorothy was the daughter of alice knight whether legitimately or illegitimately would entitle her to a fortune of thirty thousand pounds with all its immense accumulations of interest and compound interest for so many years it was a case worth looking into the old womans deathbed confession which had been made in his presence to mr martin fully established a fact only known to themthat the consciencestricken murderess of the mother had discovered in the corpse of the poor vagrant her grandchild so that all that was now required to entitle her child to inherit this large fortune was the registration of its birth if it had taken place in any workhouse or public charitable institution this might be obtained by offering suitable rewards without the said alice knight had adopted a fictitious name as the light began gradually to dawn upon his mind that this lovely girl was no other than mrs knights heiress he rubbed his hands gleefully together and told his fair visitor that if she made him her friend he might be able to put her in the way of obtaining a handsome fortune dorothy laughed and looked incredulously at the plain matteroffact lawyer how can i do that sir i have no money to give you not at present my dear but you can bestow upon me more than the worth of money this dear little white hand oh said dorothy snatching her hand from him before he could convey it to his lips and without adopting the affectation of pretending not to understand his meaning i cannot do that for it is given away already the lawyers fine castle of a moments building evaporated slowly into air as he asked in a disconcerted tone to whom a gentleman you know quite well the reverend gerard fitzmorris it was he that directed me to you oh i see the gentleman that was here a few days ago lord wiltons cousin and successor to the titles and estates that is in case the earl does not marry again young lady i offer you my sincere congratulations on your prospect of becoming a countess and i hope he continued with great emphasis that you will forgive me for wishing to secure the affections of such a charming young lady oh certainly you are not much to be pitied on so short an acquaintance and dorothy laughed merrily had not the fortune something to do with it and she looked archly up in his face no upon my honour i was struck with your appearance before you told me who you were but really miss chance or knight or whatever we can prove your name to be we must not lose sight of this fortune and if you will pay me say five thousand pounds provided i am able to establish your claims will you empower me to take the necessary steps but should you fail in that case i should not claim a farthing we will consult gerard and mr martin said dorothy who thought that this might bring about proofs of her identity that would satisfy lord wilton and she felt in high spirits at the possible result of such a legal inquiry so quite forgetful of the sly lawyers proposal to make her his second wife she chatted with him during their way to the gaol in the most friendly and confidential manner she found lawrence rushmere moping in the corner of the debtors room looking pale and haggard with beard unshaven and his uncombed locks falling round his face in tangled confusion running up to him dorothy flung her arms about his neck and tenderly embraced him rushmere looked up and clasped her to his heart dolly is that you yes dear father my dear girl i be hearty glad to see thee but what broughtee dolly to this confounded place to take you out of it wheres gilbert he asked lowering his voice and looking cautiously round lest the other debtors should hear him ask after his unworthy son gone father no one knows whither he went off with that bad girl martha wood who i believe has been at the bottom of all the mischief the young limb of iniquity a fit companion for my son and what has become of the wife gone back to london joy go with her she was a bad un an the cunning old witch the mother has left hadstone never to return an the old place what have they done with it it is open to receive you father when you return with me i will soon make it bright and cosy again ah well a day dolly i hardly wish to see it again it will only remind me o happier days o a wife that i loved with my whole heart o a son that i can consider mine no longer who would ha thought that such an excellent mother could ha been parent to such a graceless bairn that a good beginning should make such a sorry ending na dorothy i cannot go back even the bright black eyed lass who might ha been my daughter but for my folly is going to carry joy an sunshine into another home let me bide dorothy where i be i can die as well here as in the old homestead i cannot lose my dear old father yet where i am there shall always be a warm nook by the fireside for him dolly my darling thou art one in a thousand yes i will go with you reach me my hat and staff the shrewd man of business thought with the yeoman that dorothy was one in a thousand and was not a little affected by her filial piety he then accompanied dorothy and her charge to the inn and ordered a good dinner at his own expense for the refreshments of the travellers over a glass of excellent home brewed he told rushmere of the hopes he entertained of securing mrs knights large bequest for the beautiful foundling this news however gratifying to the old man on dorothys account only served to increase the deep regret that was ever brooding in his mind that his unreasonable obstinacy had been the cause of gilberts ruin and his own it was night when they got to heath farm mrs martin and the good curate were there to welcome rushmere back to his old home with the assistance of polly and mrs sly who had been at work all the day mrs martin had succeeded in restoring the house to its original order the absence of which during the misrule of mrs gilberts brief reign had been such an eyesore to the sturdy yeoman he was perfectly astonished and no less gratified to find everything in its accustomed place a bright fire was roaring up the huge chimney as in the winter nights long passed away a comfortable hot supper was smoking on the oak table which was covered with a spotless cloth of dorothys own spinning his easy chair in its own place at the head of the hospitable board fronting the portrait of his venerated ancestor which had been cleaned from dust and fly spots by mrs martins own hands the grand old soldier of the covenant looked down from his lofty height and by the glow of the genial fire seemed to smile benignantly on his careworn descendants sorrowful face the old yeoman fixed his eyes long and lovingly on the timehonoured picture then stretching his large hands to the cheerful blaze muttered to himselfthe last am i to be the last o his race that will leave the old place with an untarnished name oh gilbert oh my son i had expected better things o thee the cheerful conversation of the good curate and his wife and the caresses of dorothy succeeded at last in winning lawrence rushmere from his melancholy and something of his former honest hearty expression beamed forth from his clear blue eyes he joined earnestly in henry martins beautiful evening prayer which he declared had done him a world of good and refreshed his weary spirit when dorothy lighted him up to bed he whispered in her ear at parting i thought this morning dorothy that a never could feel happy or comfortable agen it had been previously arranged by her friends that dorothy was to remain at the farm as mistress of the establishment until after gerards return and do all she could to make her fosterfather forget his past sorrows and present desolate position though such a result could hardly be expected at his age she accomplished more than she had anticipated she read to him the newspapers sang to him the old ballads he loved so well in her clear dulcet voice and talked to him cheerfully of his future prospectsof the pleasant days yet in store for him if he would resolutely abandon vain regrets and trust in the goodness and mercy of a loving god several days glided tranquilly away before she received a letter from gerard which informed her that the funeral procession would reach hadstone at noon on the following day when the burial of the young viscount would take place lord wilton and himself being chief mourners and mr martin reading the service for the dead he told her that he had found the earl in better health and spirits than he expected that his son had died in such a happy frame of mind that it had done more to establish his belief in the great truths of the christian religion than a thousand homilies we will pass over the funeral with all its black and melancholy details which seem to have been invented by our progenitors to add unnecessary horror to death the pagan rites of chinese idolaters have a far more spiritual meaning than our dismal funereal processions the mourners wear robes of spotless whiteyoung children strew beautiful flowers along the path to the grave and accompany the dead to their peaceful rest with music and song rejoicing in the birth of the spirit to a better world the day after the funeral gerard fitzmorris came in lord wiltons carriage to bring dorothy up to heath hall as the earl was impatient to see her on arriving at the stately mansion they were immediately ushered into the noble library that had haunted dorothys dreams since the day she first met her titled father the earl was standing with folded arms before the portrait of his beautiful mother the resemblance between her and dorothy having been rendered yet more striking by the air of refinement that education and the society of superior minds had given to the latter at the sound of her light steps the earl held out his arms dorothy sank upon his breast only uttering the simple word father my child my beloved child for a long while he held her where nature had placed her next his heart and they mingled their tears together gerard walked to the window not less affected by their emotion the earl at length mastered his feelings and placing dorothy on a sofa he called gerard to him and taking a seat between them held firmly a hand of each my dear children he said in a voice that still trembled with emotion the time for an explanation of what must seem to you a strange and needless mystery has arrived and while i reveal my past sins and folly i beg your earnest attention and forgiveness you dorothy chance are my child born in lawful wedlock the only fruit of my marriage with alice knight the beautiful and unfortunate young protegee of my mother lady dorothy granville you both know that i was a younger son my eldest brother sir thomas being a strong healthy young man i never entertained the least expectation of being called to fill his place i was proud and poor depending solely for my future position on my mothers jointure at her death and my chance of rising in the army i was always haunted by a terrible dread of poverty not that i loved money for its own sake for i was reckless in the extravagant expenditure of my limited means but i valued it for the power and prestige that it always confers upon its fortunate possessors to be esteemed as a man of fortune by the world was at that time the height of my ambition i was not aware of the little satisfaction that mere wealth unconnected with better things confers my grandfather the late earl had early singled me out as his future heir i was his godson and had been called after him edward granville he did not like my eldest brother who was an honest generous fellow frank and independent to a fault the very beau ideal of a soldier and a gentleman he never would condescend to flatter the avaricious old man for the sake of his money my grandfather had a high veneration for rank a feeling which my dear mother shared with him in common both had an unmitigated horror of a mesalliance this terror of mingling their pure old norman blood with any one of inferior degree took a strong possession of my own mind which was greatly strengthened by the often reiterated threat of the proud old aristocrat that if i married beneath my rank i should never possess a shilling of his vast wealth this great fortune he inherited from an uncle who for many years had been governor of india and died childless i must confess that i was dreadfully jealous of the infant sons of his youngest daughter by a second marriage not so much of you gerard who from an infant shewed a proud and independent spirit you were a sturdy democrat from your very cradle and fearlessly urged the rights of man to the old earl and laughed at his absurd prejudices as unworthy and truly ignoble i entered hotly into all the vices and follies of a young man of fashion the earl forgave all these peccadilloes paid my gambling debts and excused every fault so long as i flattered his weakness and held his opinions my regiment was ordered to america and i saw some hot service and soon acquired rank and position in the army on my return to england the earl used his great influence to get me into parliament his wealth overcame all opposition and i made no insignificant figure in the house and was considered a rising young man of great promise it was during this period the brightest and best in my life as far as my worldly interests were concerned that i married with my grandfathers consent the lady lucia montressor who though an earls daughter was one of a large family of girls who had no claims to wealth but were handsome accomplished women looking out for rich and advantageous settlements as the reputed favourite of the rich earl wilton and considered by the public a man of talent mine was considered a very eligible position i was really attached to my young wife and sincerely grieved when she died in her beautiful girlhood leaving me the father of a fine boy only a few hours old my dear mother was much interested in my bereavement and took home my motherless infant while i went abroad on a secret mission for the government it was during my absence that lasted over two years that she saw the neglected granddaughter of a woman by the name of knight who kept a shop furnished with expensive foreign silks and laces and much frequented by ladies of rank in the town of storby struck with the extraordinary beauty of the girl who was in her fifteenth year she took her under her own protection to be nursery governess to my little edward and wait exclusively upon her person when i returned to heath hall i found this incomparable girl high in favour with lady dorothy whom she accompanied with the child in all her walks and drives in this way we were often thrown together when i found the charms of her mind equal to the graces of her person i fell madly in love with her and it was only then that i realised the truth that i had not loved before my frantic passion absorbed my whole being obliged to be wary i could make no outward demonstration of my admiration for my beautiful alice for fear of alarming the jealousy of my mother which restraint served only to increase the vehemence of my attachment to my infinite joy i discovered that it was mutual the fear of losing my grandfathers patronage and with it his fortune for a long while presented as i supposed an inseparable barrier to my making her my wife to my grief and shame be it spoken if i could have obtained her on less honourable terms i should not have hesitated in adopting such an infamous course but i found the innocent girl as virtuous as she was fair then the thought struck me of marrying her privately and enjoining upon her the strictest secresy until after the death of my rich relative should leave me at liberty to make a public acknowledgment that she was my lawful wife to this arrangement alice readily consented an opportunity was not long in presenting itself lady dorothy spent a few weeks every summer at bath on this occasion i went with her and alice as a matter of course accompanied us with my child of whom she was passionately fond and i believe the little fellow loved her with as much devotion as he did his father there was a small retired old church which though belonging to the parish in which we lodged was never frequented by aristocratic worshippers my aunt having engaged seats in one situated in a more fashionable quarter of the town where a celebrated preacher drew together large congregations in the little church of st marys alice and i were married by banns and the old superannuated incumbent delivered our names to his small flock in such mumbling tones that they were unrecognised among a long string of unknown and unhonoured ones early one morning after the third publication of the said banns we were united by the old clergyman whom i bribed pretty highly to keep our secret and we were happy blessed beyond measure in our boundless love if she had been dear to me before she was doubly so now if ever a man worshipped a woman i did her our stolen meetings used to take place in a lonely unfrequented opening in the park beneath the shade of a large oak tree there we were once nearly surprised by poor henry martin who had been brought up with alice and still entertained for her a violent passion our dream of happiness vanished only too soon my mother had gone to make a visit to the seat of a nobleman about thirty miles distant and could not return till next day when i received a sudden notice from government that my services were required in a most important mission to the court of russia and that i must leave for london without a moments delay my uncle had been very active in obtaining for me this appointment which if well conducted might lead to the governorship of some important colony among the british possessions i dared not hesitate in accepting a post from which such great future results were to be expected even for her sake it behoved me to go but how could i leave heath hall without one last embrace one last farewell to the beloved i got this appointment by the evening mail and had to appear in london by ten oclock the next morning receive my dispatches and sail immediately for st petersburgh where it is probable that i might be detained for some months i was however determined if possible to see her before i went and rode a noble horse to death to obtain that object when i arrived at hall it was long past midnight the family had retired to rest and the idea of obtaining an interview with my wife was utterly preposterous i had nothing for it but to return to the london road which skirted the park and wait for the coming up of the night mail my impatience having outridden the coach i was so dreadfully fatigued with my previous ride that i had scarcely taken my seat before i fell asleep and did not awake until the rumbling of the wheels upon the stones told me that i was in london though dreadfully pressed for time i wrote a brief letter to alice explaining the reason of my absence and directing her to write to me through my agent in town in a postscript i charged her most solemnly to keep our secret if she valued my peace and happiness she had hidden from me the important fact of her pregnancy my poor darling kept our secret only too well it was during that visit to hall that some prying domestic discovered her situation which was whispered to other members of the household till it reached my mothers ears i can well imagine lady dorothys grief and indignation a woman of stern morality she was not very likely to forgive a dependent to whom she had been a sincere friend calling alice into her presence she taxed her with her crime and demanded of her to name the father of the child this the poor girl steadily refusing to do my mother reproached her with ingratitude and dismissed her from her service before she returned to heath hall i can well imagine the despair of the dear young wife when she found upon reaching storby that i had left the country no one could tell whither without letting her know the cause of my seeming desertion she never could have received my letter though i paid a private messenger highly to deliver it into her own hand in this emergency she applied to her grandmother for protection who at first ignorant of her cause for leaving lady dorothy received her into the house i have no doubt that had she taken the wise course of making a confidant of this wicked old woman her pride and avarice would have been so highly gratified that she would have given her a home without paying any regard to the disgrace attached to her name the discovery of her situation exasperated the old woman to fury she did not even ask for an explanation but thrust her from her doors with cruel words and coarse usage thus far i was informed by a man who waited in the shop who told me that he was so much affected by the distressed looks of the affrighted girl that it moved him to tears after the shop was closed he sought her through the town but no one had seen or could give him any account of her retreat a report got into circulation which made my mother very sorry for the part she had played in this tragedy that alice knight had walked into the sea when the tide was coming in and buried her shame and sorrow in the waves i never could believe this story i felt in my soul that she was still living and loved me too well to have taken such a rash and wicked step from the hour she left mrs knights house her fate remained till very lately a mystery how she passed the intervening period between the birth of dorothy and her own melancholy death while in search of me will never be accurately known i was retained at the court of st petersburgh for nearly three years i wrote constantly under cover to my agent to alice often sending her large sums of money and was astonished when my man of business informed me after the lapse of twelve months that all my letters had been returned from the dead letter office as no such person as alice knight was to be found i then wrote to lady dorothy confessing to her that i was the father of alice knights child and imploring her to tell me what had become of the mother and her babe lady dorothy died before this letter reached england and her father the earl of wilton only survived her a few weeks leaving to me the fortune for which i had sacrificed my wife and child too late to afford me any pleasure the death of my eldest brother which happened abroad gave lady dorothy such a shock that she never got over it i thus suddenly and unexpectedly became a wealthy and titled man i had married in the summer of the year and returned to england in july on my way to hadstone i must have passed over the heath during that dreadful storm unconscious that the beloved object whose loss had plunged me into a state of incurable grief was dying exposed to its pitiless fury in the wet hollow beneath from that hour until i met dorothy i could obtain no reliable information concerning my poor wife when this dear girl first presented herself before me and i saw in the glass the wonderful likeness which you gerard cannot fail to recognize between the country girl and my aristocratic mother and through her to me and heard the sound of her voice so like my lost wifes i could hardly refrain from clasping her in my arms and telling her that she was my child the story of her mothers sad fate the sight of the ring with which we were married which belonged to my first wife and had her initials and my own engraved on the reverse side and the tress of alices exquisite golden brown hair corresponding with a lock which at that moment was lying next my heart removed all doubts if such indeed had ever existed that the poor dead wanderer was my wife forgive me my lord for interrupting you said gerard but how could you being satisfied that this was the case encourage an alliance between dorothy and gilbert rushmere a person so inferior to her in birth she loved him gerard was quite unconscious of her real position and i thought the knowledge of it would not conduce to her happiness if it separated her from her lover rank and wealth had been the means of destroying mine for ever besides my son was living and likely to live and i had no wish to reveal to the world that sad and blotted page in my life for the sake of securing an heir had alice lived i should have owned her as my wife to the world exhibited the proofs of our marriage and there the matter would have ended but in legally claiming dorothy i should subject myself to the most painful and humiliating investigations which going the rounds of the public papers would be bruited abroad throughout the land my children he cried in a tone of earnest entreaty it is in your power to save me from this terrible degradation a frown was gathering upon gerards brow and he said with some asperity my lord i do not quite understand your meaning if you possess the legal proofs of dorothys legitimacy you surely would not rob her of her birthright to cover your own sin what does it matter to her gerard if she becomes your wife she would still be countess of wilton i am certain by what i know of dorothys unselfish character that she would rather receive her title through her husband than through a law process which would make her father the most miserable of men what do you say my daughterwill you insist upon the legal restitution of your rights or be contented to receive them through your husband dorothy rose from the earls supporting arms and stood up before him her eyes brightened and a vivid flush crimsoned her cheeks as she said with an air of decision which admitted of no misinterpretation my lord i care neither for rank nor wealth the vindication of my mothers honour is dearer to me than either i will not bear the title of your daughter branded with an epithet i need not name dorothy is right replied gerard i would not purchase her birthright on such dishonest terms it would be a cruel injustice to both mother and daughter to let them bear the brand of shame which a small sacrifice of personal vanity could remove the earl remained for a long time leaning his head upon his clasped hands without speaking at length looking up with a deep sigh he said gerard you press me very sore i declare to you that i would rather die than expose my mental weakness in a court of justice it will clear your character from a foul stigma my lord the seduction of a beautiful young girl and her supposed death in consequence of your desertion but have you positive proofs of dorothy being her child i had not until the day before i wrote to dorothy and i obtained them by a most singular chance when going up to london to meet my poor edward a wheel came off my carriage and it required the aid of a blacksmith to repair the damage i walked forward to the village and went into a neat public house while my servants found a smith i thought i recognized in the master of the house an old tenant of mine who had once kept a similar place of entertainment at thursten the village on the north of hadstone years had changed me so much that he scarcely knew me again after talking for some time about indifferent subjects he told me that the very day before he had stumbled over a letter that was given to him by a poor miserable sickly young woman who stopped at his house late one july evening eighteen years ago and begged for a cup of milk and a bit of bread for her child a beautiful little black eyed girl barely two years old my missus asked her he said who she was and where she was going she replied that she had friends in storby whom she wanted to see that she was very ill and was going home to them to die but in case she was too weak to get there she wished me to send a letter she had in her pocket to lord wilton as she expected that if he were at the hall he would help her i took the letter and thought that it was only some begging petition and of little consequence and our people were busy in the hayfield and i forgot all about it in the autumn i removed with my family to this place i heard of the death of a young person answering to the description of the poor young woman who had been at my house on the night of the tenth of july who had been found on the heath by farmer rushmere who had adopted the little girl but did not trouble myself to go and see the corpse a few weeks ago my wife died and in looking over some of her little traps to find a receipt i stumbled on this letter and though i daresay it is of little consequence to your lordship or to any one else now i may as well give it to you this long forgotten document contained a few lines from my poor alice enclosing the registration of the birth of dorothy in the lyingin hospital in london you will find it enclosed in the packet i sent to dorothy in case i should never return to england and it fully identifies her as my child and heiress to the title and estate of wilton there is therefore no difficulty in a legal point of view and if you are both determined not to spare my feelings in the matter i will immediately take the necessary steps for her recognition as my daughter i would dearest father willingly save you from any exposure as far as i am myself concerned replied dorothy but would it be just to my poor mother i am certain that your own good heart will acquiesce in my decision that when you come to reflect more deeply on the matter you will own that i am right if this proof had been wanting i think another one could have been obtained she then related her interview with mr hodson and his proposal of trying to gain legal evidence of her being the child of alice knight in order to put her in possession of the large fortune left to her by her grandmother which if followed up would likewise involve the discovery of her title to the estates of wilton what i am to do with all this wealth puzzles me she continued it is a great trust placed in my hands by the almighty which will enable me if rightly applied to do much good to my less fortunate fellow creatures the earl folded her in his arms dorothy my beloved child you have conquered for you are more righteous than your father may the blessing of the merciful god who has watched over you all the days of your life for ever rest upon your head i have been weak and cowardly you have proved yourself great and noble and well worthy of your happy destiny chapter xi a painful recognition immediate steps were now taken by the earl to establish dorothys claims and while the suit was pending he yielded to her earnest request to remain at heath farm with her old protector lawrence rushmere who was still ignorant of the great future anticipated for his adopted daughter the old yeoman had grown so fond of her since the desertion of his son that he could hardly bear her out of his sight the responsibilities of a lofty station weighed heavily on her mind and there were moments when she sincerely wished her lot might be cast midway between poverty and riches and she might avoid the humiliation of the one and great temptations incidental to the other there never was a period in her life when pride exerted so little influence over her or she thought more humbly of herself she became pensive and silent and being now entirely exempt from domestic drudgery passed much of her time in reading and serious reflection gerard remarked the change that had passed over dorothy but attributed it to the extreme conscientiousness of her character which made her consider herself unfitted by previous habits and education to fill a lofty station once when she had opened her mind to him on the subject and not without tears lamented her ignorance of the usages of fashionable society and wished that she could have remained with him always in the country the happy and useful wife of a village pastor he gently chid her for her want of faith you possess qualities dorothy that are truly noble that would do honour to any station human nature is the same in every class and those who have prized you when only a country girl working in the fields will not hold you in less estimation when transported to a higher sphere only retain the same natural unaffected manners that charmed my heart in simple dorothy chance and i know enough of the society you so much dread to assure you that you need not feel the least alarm for the result but dorothy still doubted and feared and shrunk from the public expressions of interest and curiosity which could not fail to be exerted in her case when lord wilton determined to do what was right he became happy and contented and never let a day pass without paying her a visit to inform her how the suit was progressing lawrence rushmere marvelled at the earls condescension and was so won over by his kindness that he no longer regarded him as his hereditary enemy one day the portrait of the soldier of the covenant caught the earls eye he started up to examine it then turned to rushmere and spoke with animation i have often heard of that picture and feel as proud of my descent from that glorious old fellow as you do who are his lineal representative and bear his name how do you make that out my lord said the yeoman it is the first time i ever heard that the blood of a rushmere ran in the veins of a fitzmorris you dont seem greatly honoured by the relationship returned the earl laughing but whether or no what i say is strictly true my grandfather sir lawrence fitzmorris was grandson to that famous roundhead by his eldest daughter alena and bore his christian name you and i my worthy old friend are cousins in the third degree will you acknowledge me as a kinsman aye that a wull wi my heart in my hand cried rushmere grasping the noblemans outstretched hand who could have dispensed with at least one half of the energetic pressure that compressed his thin white fingers within the strong grip of the honest tiller of the soil dear dear he continued if a had only known that afore i should ha thought a deal more o your lordship i have something to tell you which will surprise you much more lawrence this little girl dorothy whom you adopted as your own is descended from him too now my lord you be surely making fun o me for nobody in the world knows who dollys mother was still less her father i ha been puzzling my brain about that secret for the last sixteen years without finding it out it was the want of knowing who she was that has ruined both me and my son she is my daughter lawrence the poor woman that you found dead on hadstone heath was alice knight a beautiful girl whom you may remember was adopted by my mother lady dorothy she was my wife and the mother of our dorothy the lord a mercy cried rushmere starting to his feet an you let the poor lass die for want an her child work for her bread in the house of a stranger you may call yourself noble an all that lord wilton but i should feel prouder of the relationship of a poor honest man i do not blame you rushmere my conduct from the view you take of it must appear atrocious indeed but i was as ignorant of the facts as you were but how could your lawful wife come to such a state o destitution did a play you false i will tell you how it all happened returned lord wilton and you will be more ready to forgive me as the unfortunate worship of the golden calf which i find is an hereditary sin brought about this unhappy affair drawing his seat beside the old yeoman he told him the story the reader has just learned from the preceding chapter patiently submitting to his blunt crossquestioning on many points that could not fail to be very distressing to his feelings well my lord he said when he had listened with intense interest to the said history i am sartain sure i should ha done exactly as you did such a fortin as that very few men could ha resisted it was a sore temptation theres no doubt i allers thought that yon poor creature had been summat above her condition she had bonny hair an the smallest foot an hand in the world people that work hard allers show it most in the extremities labour calls out the muscles and sinews makes the limbs large an gives breadth more than height to the figure tans the complexion an makes it ruddy an coarse to such as i this be real beauty but you lords of the creation prefer a white skinned die away half dead an alive sort o a cretur to a well grown healthy buxom lass like our dorothy who ha grown up just as god made her whom all the delicate women folk envy an all the young men are mad arter she be just what i call a beauty dorothy laughed at her fosterfathers ideas of real beauty and told him that she was not at all flattered by his description as she was very much afraid the gentle folks would consider it barnyard beauty dont you mind what they call it my lady dorothy i spose i must call you so now you need not be ashamed to show your face anywhere all i be afeared on is this that when you go home to live in the grand old hall that belonged to him pointing up to the picture youll forget the cross old man who was father to you when you had none an you might ha been my own darter too he added with a sigh but for my greed an your children an gilberts might have inherited the home of my ancestors i was nigh cursing gilbert tother day but gilly has more cause to curse me alack alack what poor miserable blind creatures we be it is well for us that gods providence is at work behind it all father you need never fear my forgetting you said dorothy i have known this change in my fortunes a long time and have you found any alteration in my regard an did a wait upon the old man for the last three months an knew a was a titled lady all the time im not a titled lady to you dear father but always your own little dorothy where i amyou must go too and when i leave heath farm you will have to go to heath hall for i cannot live without you and kind mrs brand has prepared a nice room for you and we will try and make you forget all the past troubles and she put her arm round his neck and kissed him rushmere i shall grow jealous of you said lord wilton if my daughter bestows on you more kisses than she gives me what dorothy says is perfectly true she considers you too old to trouble about the farm that it is high time you should rest from labour you must allow her to have her own way in this matter i have no doubt that she will contrive to make you happy a week later and dorothys claims were established on a legal basis and all the country rang with the romantic tale mrs lane put on her best bonnet and hurried up to nancy watling with the newspaper in her hand she had run every step of the way a good half mile for fear miss watling should hear the news from any one else and when she burst into the parlour she was too much out of breath to speak miss watling ran upstairs for her smelling bottle thinking that the good woman was going to faint by the time however that she reached the parlour the vendor of small wares had recovered the use of her tongue well miss watling she cried still panting the mysterys all out at last dorothy chance is lord wiltons own daughter and that poor beggar woman as you was used to call her was no other than alice knight rich old mrs knights daughter whom the earls good mother adopted and he married unbeknown to her ill not believe a word of it said nancy resolutely why woman its all here in the paper and mrs lane tapped the important document significantly and as true as gospel do you suppose the earl would allow the newspapers to meddle with his private affairs dont you hear the bells ringing and if you come down to the village with me youll see all the flags a flying and them who has no flags puts out o their windows quilts and hankerchers oh its true true and i be right glad on it i allers did think dorothy chance a fine girl i wonder how her ladyship bears her new dignity said miss watling waspishly as meek as a lamb returned mrs lane how the old man will fret and fume that gilbert did not marry her it serves him right at any rate how money do make people turn about continued mrs lane it was only this time last year that i heard you praise old rushmere for turning dorothy out o doors before another week is over you will be boasting of her acquaintance good morning nancy i cant stay longer the butcher has promised to give me a cast in his cart as far as barfords i know jane barford will be glad of any good that happens to dorothy and off went the little bustling woman to spread the glad tidings in every house she passed miss watlings envy of dorothy was greatly diminished by her exaltation to rank and fortune she was now too far above her to provoke competition and she began to praise what she could not pull down mrs lane was right when she anticipated the hearty congratulations of mrs barford even letty stopped her churn and clapping her hands said who wud ha thought that we shud ever have a titled lady for a dairy maid or that a countess wud nurse my boy tommy it do seem jist like a fairy tale yes returned old mrs barford and dorothy may be considered as the queen of the fairies if gilberts in england i wonder what he will say to all this as to dorothy she had a good miss of him they do say that he made that other woman a wretched husband im thinking said letty sententiously that it wor the wretch o a woman that made him a bad wife what he could see in that dirty impudent wench martha wood to run off wi un stonishes i more thans marrying yon stuck up gallimaufry from lunnon nothing need astonish you letty that is done by a drunken man but in this matter of dorothy chance lawrence rushmere was more to blame than his son and a fine mess he has made of it howsomever i dont believe that people can marry just whom they like god mates them and not man or we should not see such strange folk come together if that be true mother cried letty with unusual vivacity how can yer go on from day to day fretting an nagging an blaming joe for marrying i if i had to be his wife he wor forced to take i whether or no this was rather a poser to mrs barfords favourite theory on which much might be said for and against and which still remains an unsolved enigma the old lady was wont to excuse her own imprudent marriage on the score of its being her fate she took up her knitting and began rattling her pins vigorously as if perfectly unconscious of her daughterinlaws sensible remark there was one however to whom the change in dorothys social position brought no joy producing the most bitter disappointment and giving rise to vindictive and resentful feelings this was gilbert rushmere before leaving heath farm with martha wood he had secured a tolerably large sum of money by the sale of the farm horses which had been accomplished without the knowledge of his father with this sum it was his intention of taking his passage to america but meeting in london some of his gambling associates they had prevailed upon him to stay until fleeced in his turn of all his illgotten store he was reduced to the necessity of acting as a decoy duck in a low tavern which was the common resort of men even yet more fallen and degraded than himself he was sitting maudling over a strong potation of gin and water after a night of riot and debauchery in an underground kitchen in this den of infamy striving to drown the recollection of former respectability in the maddening glass his red bloated face unshaven chin and matted hair contrasted painfully with the faded uniform that seemed to claim for its wearer the title of a gentleman it is not the murderer alone who bears upon his brow the stamp of cain vice marks all her degraded victims with an unerring sign which reveals to the spectator the depths of their debasement this sign is so distinctly traceable in the countenance of a wicked man that a little childnay even a dogalike unconscious of the cause of this physical degradation sees that something is wrong and shrinks instinctively from his companionship if a good man feels it difficult to maintain the straight onward path of prescribed duty the downward career of the wicked man has no stumbling blocks in the way every step accelerates his speed till he gains by a final plunge in deeper guilt the dreadful goal that miserable man in his half conscious state with his unwashed face and soiled garments and brutalized expression is a sad illustration of such a frightful career scarcely a year has expired when a brave honest soldier he was respected by his comrades the pride of his parents and the beloved of a virtuous woman and held an honourable and independent position he then gave a fair promise of becoming a useful member of society look at him now leaning on that dirty table drivelling over the accursed liquor for which he has bartered body and soul and to obtain which he has to herd with ruffians yet more fallen and degraded than himself his shameless companion deserted him when he was no longer able to gratify her vanity by the purchase of fine clothes and bogus jewellery of his wife and her mother he neither knows nor cares and never names them without a curse as the author of his misery his glass is out and he is just going to fling himself upon the dirty floor to sleep off the headache due to last nights shameless orgies hullo rush youre not going to sleep cries one of the gang entering in his shirt sleeves with a newspaper in his hand in less than an hour youll have plenty of work to do if you are in your senses rouse up and read this to keep your eyes open till the governor wants you rubbing his eyes with a dreadful oath and wishing his companion in the place to which he is himself fast hastening gilbert staggered up and sat down once more by the greasy table its hard that you wont leave me alone boxer this lifes killing me my head aches confoundedly i want to go sleep to forget my misery as that jolly old dog solomon has it and remember my poverty no more this paper will wake you up its the history of your old sweetheart dolly that you are always boring me about not that i believe a word of all that now not a very likely tale that such a girl as that would have anything to say to such a chap as you a nice fellow ant you for a lady of rank to break her heart about dont bother me yawned gilbert if theres anything worth hearing cant you tell me without my having the trouble to read it theresee for yourself cries the other flinging the paper at his head my eyes but you lost a fine chance if ever it was in your power to win it gilbert mechanically picked up the paper and went to a dresser under the only window in the room to find out what his companion meant the columns were filled with the termination of the famous suit that had pronounced dorothy chance the legitimate daughter of lord wilton and secured to her the accumulated wealth left by her grandmother mrs knight whether it was the liquor that had maddened him the sense of his own degradation or the full consciousness of all that he had lost by his cruel desertion of dorothy the news contained in that paper rendered him furious he raved and sworecursing his own folly and his fathers avarice that had hindered him from being the fortunate possessor of all this wealth for dorothy herself he no longer cared he had sunk too low in the mire of iniquity to love a pure and virtuous woman but the idea of another possessing her filled him with rage and envy and he swore with a terrible oath that dorothy chance should never be the wife of gerard fitzmorris that he would have his revenge or die in the attempt his vicious comrades laughed at him and made fun of his awful imprecations but the gloomy determination in his eyes proved that he at least was not in joke what a mercy it is that people are generally unconscious of the evils plotting against them that the sorrows of the coming hour are hid beneath the folded wings of the future while her quondam lover was plotting all sorts of mischief against her to disturb her peace dorothy had taken her first journey to london in company with her father her presence was necessary to sign important papers and to prepare a suitable outfit for her marriage which was to take place the first of may a noble suite of apartments had been prepared at heath hall for the reception of the bride and bridegroom on their return to hadstone after their bridal tour which owing to gerards strict notions of the sacred obligations of his profession and the little time that a faithful pastor can afford to devote to his own gratification was to be of short durationembracing a brief visit to the highlands of scotland and a glance at the english lakes on their homeward route to a young girl brought up in the seclusion of a very retired country life who can catch but a faint echo from the great world to which she is an entire stranger the metropolis seen at a distance through the dazzling medium of the imagination is believed to be a wonderful place a city full of enchantments where beauty and wealth meet you at every turn and cares and sorrows are forgotten in an endless round of dissipation and pleasure the reality of those diversions and enjoyments soon makes them distasteful to a sensitive and reflective mind who can discern the sharp thorns thickly studding the stem of the rose and who will not sacrifice peace of mind and integrity to secure the fleeting flowers of popular applause dorothy whose tastes were all simple and natural felt lonely and disappointed in the crowded streets of the great city their amusements and pursuits were so different to those to which she had been accustomed that it required time and reflection to reconcile her to the change she cared very little for expensive jewels and magnificent attire and did not feel at home in the splendid halls and saloons of the wealthy and highborn when arrayed for the first time in a costume befitting her rank to attend a great ball given by the beautiful duchess of and led before the mirror to admire the charming image it reflected the simple girl shocked her ladys maida very great lady indeed in her own estimationby turning from the glass and bursting into tears her romantic story had excited the greatest interest in the public mind crowds collected round the earls town residence to catch a glimpse of his beautiful daughter when she took a drive in the carriage and men and women vied with each other in extolling the charms of her person and the unaffected grace of her deportment songs were made and sung in her praise and wherever she appeared she was forced to submit to the flatteries and adulations of a crowd of admirers this was all very painful to dorothy it oppressed her restrained her natural freedom and rendered her a silent passive observer in the society in which she might have shone she was not insensible to the admiration of the new friends who had so graciously received her into their charmed circle but she longed to get out of it and find herself once more in the country she wrote daily to her lover an account of all she heard and saw which helped to beguile the tedium of a separation in answer to a paragraph in one of his letters she said you are afraid dear gerard that i may be induced to forget you surrounded by so many admirers that all this gaiety and ballgoing may give me a taste for frivolous amusements and spoil my heart it cannot damage what it never touchesi hardly know i have a heart it lies so still under this weight of jewels and brocade it is only in the silence of my own chamber when my thoughts flow back to you that it awakes to life and happiness everything strikes me as hollow and false in the life i am at present compelled to lead people live for the world and its opinions and not for each other still less for god they dare not be simple and natural and love the truth for its own sakethe blessed truth that would set them free from all these conventional forms and ceremonies that shackle the soul and deaden all its heavenward aspirations you will laugh at me gerard when i declare to you that i have experienced more real enjoyment in working among the newmown hay and inhaling its delicious perfume when the skylark was warbling in the blue heaven above me than i have ever known in these crowded palaces following the dull routine of what my noble young friends term pleasure you need not fear such gorgeous insipidities will ever wean me from the love of nature or make me indifferent to the quiet happiness of a country life the higher enjoyment of being useful and striving to benefit others on several occasions when riding out with her father dorothy had been startled by observing a face in the crowd that bore a strong resemblance to gilbert rushmere but haggard and degraded regarding her with a fixed scowling stare of recognition from which she shrunk with feelings of terror and disgust why did this person follow her whenever she appeared in public glaring upon her with those wild bloodshot eyes with unequivocal glances of hatred and ferocity it was impossible that it could be gilbert and yet the fear that the presence of this person never failed to inspire convinced her much as she repressed the ungenerous idea that it was he and no other once when dismounting at her milliners in bond street she was so near to him that they were almost face to face he put his sole remaining hand hastily into the breast pocket of his coat as if to deliver something to her but was pushed back and told to get out of the ladys way by the footman and with a glare of rage and disappointment had shrunk back among the crowd this frightful apparition haunted her for several days and disturbed her mind so much that she kept close in doors pleading indisposition to avoid her usual drive chapter xii in conclusion her marriage which took place a few days after this painful rencounter banished all these vague fears and surmises and made her the happy bride of the man she loved it was conducted in a very quiet manner and after partaking of the splendid dejeuner prepared for the occasion and receiving the congratulations of the noble guests who honoured it with their presence she started with her husband in a private carriage for the north after a delightful tour of several weeks she rejoined her father in london received her bridal visits and full of hope and happiness proceeded with him to take possession of the princely home that was to be her future residence great were the preparations made by the good folks of hadstone to welcome their beloved pastor and his beautiful bride the gardens and meadows had been rifled of their june blossoms to strew the path from the village to the park gates where a triumphal arch of evergreens crossed the road from which gay silken banners floated forth upon the breeze emblazoned with mottos of joyful welcome the road was lined with crowds of people in their holiday attire to hail the approach of the bridal party and when the cortege came in sight the air rang with deafening shouts and acclamations an elegant open carriage drawn by four noble grey horses contained the bridal party the earl and lawrence rushmere whom they had taken up at heath farm occupied the front seat the old man had been provided with a dress suitable for the occasion and his fine patriarchal face was lighted up with gratified pride and pleasure lady dorothy dressed in a simple but elegant morning costume was seated beside her husband in the body of the equipage and received the congratulations of her rustic friends with smiles of undisguised pleasure a charming incarnation she was of youth and beauty mr and mrs martin followed in a private carriage with the children if gerard fitzmorris was not a proud and happy man his face belied him a public dinner was to be served in the park to the poor of the parish and parents and children were dressed in their best attire their smiling faces beaming with gladness the carriage drew up beneath the triumphal arch and the earl rose to thank the people for the hearty welcome they had given to him and his daughter he had scarcely raised his hat and uttered the first sentence when a tall haggard looking man bareheaded and covered with dust rushed from behind the arch to the door of the carriage and fired a pistol with his left hand at the lady dorothy who uttering a faint cry sank insensible into the arms of her husband all was now terror and confusion the earl sprang from his seat to secure the assassin amidst the groans and execrations of the excited multitude with a fiendish laugh the ruffian discharged the contents of another weapon into his own mouth and fell a hideous corpse beneath the feet of the horses he was instantly dragged out of sight by several men in the crowd and the mangled remains conveyed to a neighbouring cottage the dreadful deed had been the work of a moment and pale and trembling with the sudden shock the earl grasped convulsively the door of the carriage the sight of his daughter her white dress stained with her blood seemed to recall him to consciousness is she dead he gasped no my lord said dr davy who had been examining the nature of the injury she had received and who now dismounted to assist the nobleman into his carriage the wound is not a dangerous one it was aimed at the ladys heart but at the moment the ruffian fired she providentially put up her arm to raise her veil which has received the ball of the assassin the sooner we can convey her home the better gerards handkerchief had formed a temporary bandage to stop the effusion of blood and as he held his fair young wife in his arms his face was as pale and rigid as her own how quickly he thought does sorrow tread in the footsteps of joy how little of real happiness can be expected in a world on which rests the curse of sin the shadows of the grave dorothy did not recover from her fainting fit until after they reached the hall and she had been conveyed to bed then followed the painful operation of extracting the ball from her right arm where it was lodged about four inches above the elbow and dressing and bandaging the wound which dr davy assured the anxious father and husband would only prove a temporary inconvenience of a few weeks at the farthest dorothy bore the operation without a murmur placing her left hand in that of her husband and leaning her head upon his breast when it was over she was gently laid back upon her pillow and given a composing draught to induce sleep gerard she whispered did you see that unhappy man no my love it was gilbert rushmere has he escaped from the punishment due to his crime yes thank god i would not have him suffer death on my account oh gerard if you had seen his eyesthe look he gave when he fired it was not gilbert rushmere but some demon in his shape hush my precious wife you must not talk and distress yourself your wound though not dangerous may be rendered so by want of rest and excitement but dorothy was too much agitated to sleep did his poor father see him i think not the whole thing was so sudden and unexpected that rushmere was not conscious of it until after it was all over try and keep him from knowing who the assassin was tell him that it was the act of a madman in the crowd dorothy we must not do evil that good may come of it or attempt to cover crime by uttering an untruth leave the sinner to his god and speak of him no more and the people gerard you must not disappoint them of their dinner tell them from me that i shall soon be well that i wish them all to be happy ah me and she closed her eyes and sighed heavily this is a dismal ending to a day that dawned so pleasantly that unhappy man may god have mercy upon him and bring him to repentance she spoke no more and to the infinite relief of her husband and mrs martin who had constituted herself as nurse soon dropped into a profound sleep this sad affair threw a great damp upon the joy of the people their gay shouts were converted into sorrowful ejaculations though the roasted ox was eatenthe barrels of strong ale drankand the children did ample justice to mrs brands excellent plumpudding they dispersed sadly and sorrowfully when the meal was ended lady dorothy awoke in a high fever and for several days was considered in imminent danger this was not caused by the wound the ball having penetrated only an inch beneath the skin but from the severe shock her nervous system had sustained from witnessing a scene so terrible she still fancied herself in the carriage surrounded by the gaping crowd and encountered the frenzied gaze of the maniac as he aimed at her the deadly weapon unconscious of his last desperate act she would cling to her husband and cry out in a tone of agonized earnestness he is mad dont kill him let him escape i loved him once i cannot see him die as a natural antidote to this state of mental excitement gerard thought it best during a brief interval of composure to reveal to her the facts of the case which calmed at once her agitation by causing her to shed tears he suffered her to weep for some time without disturbing her with any remark he had more than once experienced that the truth however painful is more endurable and fraught with less danger to the human frame than a state of suspense that the natural elasticity of the mind when the worst is known and nothing remains to hope or fear reconciles us to a blow that we cannot avert and which becomes irrevocable as fate after lying quiet for some time dorothy opened her large black eyes and looking earnestly in her husbands face said in a low voice gerard is there any harm in praying for the dead i should think not darling nature herself prompts such prayers cold must that heart be who can witness the death of a parent or friend or even of an enemy without breathing an inward prayer for the salvation of his soul this impulse is almost instinctive in the human heart and few i believe could be found except the hardened sinner who have not uttered such prayers when bending over the loved and lost at the same time sweet wife i must add that these prayers however pious and natural cannot do any good to the dead or change the sentence of a just god but they are of service to the living in filling the soul with a gentle charity and bringing it into solemn communion with him who has extracted the sting from death and risen victorious from the grave ah sighed dorothy how thankful we ought to be that the future is mercifully hidden from us who could endure all the trials of life if they could see them in advance our moments of gladness are often more nearly allied to sorrow than those of grief the terrible reverse is so hard to bear gerard fondly kissed the pale earnest speaker and kneeling beside her bed uttered a fervent prayer of thanksgiving that it had pleased god to restore his dear young wife to reason in a few weeks she was able to sit up and receive the visits of sympathizing friends little now remains for us to record of the eventful history of this truly noble woman the fortune she inherited from her grandmother was entirely devoted to charitable purposes she caused to be erected at storby an hospital for the sick and a house of refuge for infirm and shipwrecked mariners she built a comfortable almshouse for aged and destitute widows and a school and asylum for orphan children whom she made her especial care her chief delight was in doing good and contributing to the happiness of others in which charitable occupation she enjoyed the hearty cooperation of a man well worthy of being the husband and bosom friend of such an excellent wife lady dorothy became the mother of four noble promising boys and one lovely girl named after her mother alice the earl and her fosterfather who shared her home lived to see her sons grow up to men and to mingle their tears with hers over the grave of her only daughter who died in her innocent childhood the portrait of the soldier of the covenant had been removed from heath farm and placed among the pictures of the earls ancestors and old rushmere would rub his hands while contemplating it and declare that old sir lawrence was now in his proper place dorothy had named her second son lawrence rushmere after her fosterfather and the boy was the especial pet and darling of the venerable patriarch edward and gerard and thomas might be fine lads he said but they were none of them so clever and handsome as his own larry the earl erected a beautiful monument over the grave of his unfortunate countess and resisted all dorothys earnest entreaties to cut down the melancholy yew that kept the sunbeams from visiting her mothers grave the spot is holy ground my dorothy the mournful tree a fit emblem for love like ours which was cradled in sorrow and whose constancy survives the grave there too i hope to sleep in peace by the side of the beloved the end transcribers note a number of paragraph ending periods were missing and have been corrected the word cooly is now coolly
