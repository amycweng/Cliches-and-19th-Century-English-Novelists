with sweet observances to dress her beautifully and keep her true that according to mr tennysons latelypublished opinion is the devoir of that deeplytobepitied individual lhomme marie possibly in the times of which the idyls treat launcelot and gunevere might have been the sole exceptional mauvais sujets in the land and woad being the chief ingredient in the toiletdress mightnt come quite so expensive but nowadays sweet observances rendered i presume by gifts from hunt and roskells and boxes in the grand tier tell on a chequebook so severely keeping her true is such an exceedingly problematical performance to judge by sir c cs breathless work and dressing her beautifully comes so awfully expensive with crinoline and cashmeres pink pearls and mechlin and the beau sexes scornful repudiation not alone of a faded silk like poor enids but of the handsomest dress going if its damned by being seen twice that i have ever vowed that plaise a dieu i will never marry and with heavens help will keep the vow better than i might most probably keep the matrimonial ones if i took them yet if ever i saw a woman for whom i could have fancied a mans committing that semisuicidal act that woman was beatrice boville not for her beauty for except one of the loveliest figures and a pair of the most glorious eyes she did not claim much not for her money for she had none not for her birth for on one side that was somewhat obscure but for herself and had i ever tried the herculean task of dressing anybody beautifully and keeping anybody true it should have been she but for the fact that when i knew her first she was engaged to my cousin earlscourt we had none of us ever dreamt he would marry for he had been sworn to political life so long given over so utterly to the battleground of st stephens and the intrigues of downing street that the ladies of our house were sorely wrathful when they heard that he had at last fallen in love and proposed to beatrice boville who though she was lady mechlins niece was the daughter of a west indian who had married her mother broken her heart spent her money deserted her and never been heard of since the more wrathful as they had no help for themselves and were obliged to be contented with distinguishing her with refreshing appellations of a very clever schemer evidently a perfect intrigante and similar epithets with which their sex is driven for consolation under such trying circumstances its a certain amount of relief to us to call a man who has cut us down in a race a stupid owl very little in him but it is mild gratification to that enjoyed by ladies when they retaliate for injury done them by that delightful bonbon of a sentence no doubt a most artful person you see it conveys so much and proves three things in onetheir own artlessness their enemys worthlessness and their victims folly being with earlscourt at the time of his singularly unwise step as they phrased it i knew that he wasnt trapped in any way and that he was loved irrespectively of his social rank but where was the good of telling that to deeplyinjured and perforce silenced ladies they knew better and when a woman says that always bow to her superior judgment my good fellow even when she knows better than you what you did with yourself last evening and informs you positively you were at that odious mrs vanilles opera supper though to the best of your belief you never stirred from the u s cardroom or you will be voted a goth and make an enemy for the rest of your natural life in opposition to the rest of the family i thought and you must know by this time amis lecteurs that i hardly think marriage so enjoyable an institution as some writers do but perhaps a little like a pipe of opium of which the dreams are better than the awakeningi thought that he could hardly have done better as far as his own happiness went as i saw her standing by him one evening in the window of lady mechlins rooms at lemongenseidlitz where we all were that august a brilliant fascinating woman already though then but nineteen noblehearted frank impetuous with something in the turn of her head and the proud glance of her eyes that told you you might trust her that she was of the stuff to keep her word even to her own hinderance that neither would she tell a lie nor brook one imputed to her that she might err on the side of pride on the side of meanness never that she might have plenty of failings but not anything petty low or ungenerous among them the evening sun fell on them as they stood on her high white forehead with its chestnut hair turned off it as you see it in old pictures which earlscourt was touching caressingly with his hand as he talked to her they seemed well suited and yethis fault was pride an unassailable unyielding pride hers was pride too pride in her own truth and honor which would send you to the deuce if you ever presumed to doubt either and i wondered idly as i looked at them whether those two prides would ever come in conflict and if so whether either of them would give in in such a casewhether there would be submission on one side or on both or on neither such metaphysical and romantic calculations are not often my line but as they stood together the sun faded off and a cold stormy wind blew up in its stead which perhaps metaphorically suggested the problem to me as one goes through life one gets up to so many sunny balmy cloudless days and so often before the night is down gets wetted to the skin by a drenching shower that one contracts an uncomfortable habit when the sun does shine of looking out for squalls a fear that sans doute considerably damps the pleasures of the noon but the fear is natural isnt it mores the pity when one has been often caught i chanced to ask her that night what made her so fond of earlscourt she turned her fearless flashing eyes half laughingly half haughtily on me the color brighter in her face i should have thought you would rather have asked how could i or any other woman whom he stooped to notice fail to love him there are few hearts and intellects so noble he is as superior to you ballroom loungers you butterfly flutterers as the stars to that chandelier bien oblige laughed i but that is just what i meant most young ladies are afraid of him you never were she laughed contemptuously afraid you do not know much of me it is precisely his giant intellect that first drew me to him when i heard his speech on the austrian question do you remember how the lords listened to him so quietly that you could have heard a feather fall i like that silence of theirs when they hear what they admire better than i do the cheers of the other house afraid of him what a ludicrous idea do you suppose i should be afraid of any one it is only those who are conceited or cowardly who are timid if you have nothing to assume or to conceal what cause have you to fear i love honor reverence lord earlscourt god knows but fear himnever not even his anger if you ever incurred it i asked her amused with her haughty indignation certainly not did i merit it i would come to him frankly and ask his pardon and he would give it if i did not deserve it he would be the one to repent she looked far more attractive than many a handsomer woman and infinitely more noble than a more tractable one she was admirably fitted for earlscourt if he trusted her but it was just possible he might some day mistrust and misunderstand her and then there might be the devil to pay ii the first shadow lemongenseidlitz was a charming little bad beatrice boville and her aunt lady mechlin earlscourt and i had been there six weeks his brother peersof whom there were scores at lemongenseidlitzcomplimented earlscourt on his fiancee so youre caught at last said an octogenarian minister who was as sprightly as a schoolboy well my dear fellow you might have gone higher sans doute but on my honor i dont think you could have done better it was the universal opinion beatrice was not the belle of the bad because there were dozens of beautiful women and beautiful she was not but she was more admired than any of them and had earlscourt wanted voices to justify his choice he would have had them but he didnt he was entirely independent of the opinions of others and had he chosen to set his coronet on the brows of a peasant girl would have cared little what any one thought or said we all of us enjoyed that six weeks lady mechlin lost to her hearts content at roulette and was as complacent over her losses as any old dowager could be beatrice boville shone best as nice natures ever do in a sunny atmosphere and if she had any faults of impatient temper or pride there was nothing to call them forth earlscourt cold politician though hed been gave himself up entirely to the warmer brighter existence which he found in his new passion and i not being in love with anybody made the pleasantest love possible wherever i liked we all of us found a couleur de rose tint in the air of little lemongenseidlitz and id quite forgotten my presentiment when one night at the kursaal a cloud no bigger than a mans hand came up on the sunny horizon and put me in mind of it earlscourt came into the ball room rather late he had been talking with some french ministers on some international project which he was anxious to effect and asked lady mechlin where beatrice was she was with me a moment ago she is waltzing i dare say said the old lady whose soul was hankering after the ivory ball very likely he answered as he looked among the dancers for her he was restless without her though he would have liked none to see the weakness for he was a man who felt more than he told he could not see her and went through the rooms till he found her which was in a small anteroom alone she started as he spoke to her and a start being a timorous and nervous thing of which beatrice boville was never guilty he drew her to him anxiously my darling has anything annoyed you she answered him with her habitual candor yes but i cannot tell you what just now cannot tell me and why because i cannot i can give no other reason it is nothing of import to you or you are sure i should not keep it from you yes but i am equally sure that anything that concerns you is of import to me to whom should you tell anything if not to me i do not like concealment beatrice his tone was grave indeed too much like reproof to a fractious child to suit beatrices pride she drew away from him nor i you must think but meanly of me if you can impute anything like concealment to me how can i do otherwise you tell me you have been annoyed and refuse to say how and by whom is that anything but concealment if any one has offended or insulted you i ought to be the first you came to a woman beatrice should have nothing hidden from the man who is or will be her husband she threw her arms around him her moods were variable as a childs perhaps this very variability earlscourt hardly understood for it was utterly opposed to his own character you always found him the same she would be all storm one moment all sunshine the next do you suppose i would hide anything from you do you think for a moment i would hold back anything you had a right to know you might look into my heart there would be no thought or feeling there i should wish to keep from you but if you exact confidence so do i would you think of taking as your wife one you could not trust he answered her a little sternly no if i once ceased to believe in your truth or honor as i believe in my own i should part from you forever though god knows what it would cost me god knows what it would cost me but i give you free leave the instant you find a flaw in either i am no longer worthy of your love withdraw it and i will never complain but trust me you must and will i merit your confidence and i exact it look at me ernest do you believe i could ever deceive you he looked into her eyes long and earnestly no when you do your eyes will droop before mine i trust you beatrice fully and i know you will never wrong it she clung to him with caressant softness softer in her than in a meekerspirited woman as she whispered never and a man would need have been obtuse and skeptical indeed who could then have doubted her and so that cloud blew over for a time at the leasttrusted beatrice boville was soft and gentle as a lamb mistrusted or misjudged she was fiery as a young lioness and earlscourt i thought though originally won by her intellect held her too much as a child to fully understand her character and to see that though she was his darling and plaything she was also a passionate ardent proudspirited woman stung by injustice and impatient of doubt no two people could be more fitted to make each others happiness yet it struck me that it was just possible they might make each others misery very completely through want of comprehension on the one side through want of explanation on the other your marriage is fixed isnt it earlscourt asked his sister lady clive edghill who had come to lemongenseidlitz and though compelled by him as he compelled all the rest of the family to show beatrice strict courtesy disliked her because she was not an advantageous match was much too young in their opinion and had no moneythe gravest crimes a woman can have in the eyes of any mans relatives the th indeed yours is a very short engagement is there any reason why it should be longer o dear no none that i am aware of i wish earnestly my dear earlscourt i could congratulate you more warmly but i can never say what i do not feel and i had so much hoped my dear helena as long as i have so much reason to congratulate myself it matters very little whether you do or do not smiled earlscourt he was too much of a lion to be stung by gnats i dare say i sincerely trust you may ever have reason but i heard some very disagreeable things about that mr boville beatrices father do you know that he was in a west india regiment but was deprived of his commission even therea perfect blackleg and sharper i understand i suppose she has never mentioned him to you you are very much mistaken all that beatrice knows of him i know that is but little for lady mechlin took her long ago when her mother died from such unfit guardianship beatrice is as open as the day indeed a little too frank perhaps too frank that is a paradox no one can have too much candor it is not a virtue of your sex but it is one thank god which she possesses in a rare degree though possibly it gains her enemies where it should gain her friends still frankness may merge into indiscretion said helena musingly i doubt it an indiscreet woman is never frank for she has always the memory of silly things said and done which require concealment i was merely thinking helena went on regardless of a speech which she did not perhaps relish pour cause merely from my deep interest in you and my knowledge of all you will wish your wife to be that perhaps beatrice might be in pure insouciance a little too careless a little too candid for so prominent a position as she will occupy last night in passing a little anteroom in the redoute i saw her in such extremely earnest conversation with a man a handsome man about your height and age and the anteroom earlscourt thought with a pang of the start she had given when he entered it the previous night but he was not of a jealous temperament nor a curious one his mind was too constantly occupied with great projects and ambitions to be capable of joining petty things together into an elaborate mosaic he had no petitesses himself and trifles passed unheeded he interrupted her decidedly what is there in that to build a pyramid of censure from doubtless it was one of her acquaintancesprobably one of mine also i should have thought you knew me better helena than to attempt this gossiping nonsense with me o i say no more i only thought you of all men would wish caesars wife to be above the gnatstrings had been too insignificant to rouse him before but at this one his eyebrows contracted and he rose silence never venture to make such a speech as that to me again in insulting beatrice you insult me unless you can mention her in terms of proper respect and reverence never presume to speak her name to me again her enemies are my enemies and whoever they may be i will treat them as such helena was sorely frightened if she held anybody in veneration it was earlscourt and she would never have ventured so far with him but for the causeless hate she had taken to beatrice simply because lady clive had decided long ago that her brother was too voue to public life ever to marry and that her son would succeed to his title she was sorely frightened but she comforted herselfthe little thorn she had thrust in might rankle after a while as pleasant a consolation under failure as any lady could desire beatrice was coming along the corridor as earlscourt left helenas rooms which were in the same hotel as lady mechlins she was stopping to look out of one of the windows at the sunset she did not see him at first and he watched her unobserved and smiled at the idea of associating anything deceitful with hersmiled still more at the idea when she came up to him with her frank bright regard lifting her face for a caress and patting both her hands through his arm accustomed to chill and reserved women in his own family her abandon had a great charm for him but perhaps it led him into his error in holding her still as half a child you have been seeing my enemy she said laughingly your sister does not like me does she not like you why should you think so she may not like my marrying perhaps because she had decided for me that i should never do so and no woman can bear any prophecies she makes to prove wrong very possibly that may be one reason but she does not think me good enough for you her tips curved disdainfully and earlscourt caught a glimpse of her in her fiery mood he laughed at her where with her he had better have admitted the truth beatrice had too much pride to be wounded by it and far too much good sense to measure herself by money and station nonsense beatrice i should have thought you too proud to suppose such a thing he said carelessly it is the truth nevertheless more foolish she then but if you and i do not what can it signify nothing as long as i am worthy of you in your eyes what others think or say is nothing to me i honor you too much to make the gauge between us a third persons opinion or measure you or myself by a few stops higher or lower in the social ladder your sister thinks me below you in rank soit she is right i am quite ready to admit it but that i am your equal in all that makes men and women equal in the sight of heaven i know when she finds me unworthy of you in thought or deed then she may call me beneath younot till then her cheeks were flushed he could hear her quick breathings and in her vehemence and haughty indignation she picked the petals of her bouquet de corsage to pieces and flung them away another time he would have thought how well her pride became her and given her some fond reply just now the thorn rankled as lady clive had hoped and he answered her gravely in the tone which it was as unwise to use to her as to prick a thoroughbred colt with both spurs you are quite right were i a king you would be my equal as long as your heart was mine your mind as noble and your character as unsullied as i hope them to be now she turned on him rapidly with the first indignant look she had ever given to him hope you might say know i think i would have said know and meant it too yesterday yesterday what do you mean why am i less worthy your confidence today than yesterday she looked wonderingly at him her eyes full of inquiry and bewilderment it was marvellous acting if it was acting yet he thought she could scarcely have so soon forgotten their scene in the anteroom the previous night they had now come into the salon he left her side and walked to the mantelpiece leaning his arm on it and speaking coldly as he had never done to her since they first met beatrice do not attempt to act with me you cannot have forgotten what we said in the anteroom last night nothing assumed ever deceives me and you only lower yourself in my estimation she clinched her hands till the rings he had given her crushed together act assume great heaven how dare you speak such words to me dare you speak like an angry child beatrice when you are reasonable i will answer you the tears welled into her eyes but she would not let them fall reasonable is there anything unreasonable in resenting words utterly undeserved would you be calm under them yourself lord earlscourt i remember now what you mean by yesterday i did not remember when i asked you had i done so i should never have simulated ignorance and surprise only last night you promised to trust me is this your trust to accuse me of artifice of acting of falsehood i would bear no such imputation from any one still less from you who ought to know me so well what happiness can we have if you she stopped the tears choking her voice but he did not see them he only saw her indignant attitude her flushed cheeks her flashing eyes and put them down to her girlish passion calm yourself beatrice i beg this sort of scene is very distasteful to me to figure in a lovers quarrel hardly suits me i am not young enough to find amusement in disputation and reconciliation sparring one moment and caresses the next my life is one of grave pursuits and feverish ambitions i am often harassed annoyed worn out in body and mind what i hoped for from you was to borrow the gayety and brightness of your own youth to find rest and happiness and distraction a life of disputes reproaches and misconstruction would be what i never would endure beatrice was silent she leaned her forehead on her arms and did not answer him his tone stung her pride but his words touched her heart her passion was always shortlived and no evil spirit possessed her long she rebelled against the first part of his speech with all her might but she softened to the last she came up to him with her hands out i had no right to speak so impatiently to you god knows to make your life happy will be my only thought and care and wish if i spoke angrily forgive me earlscourt knew that the nature so quick to acknowledge error was worth fifty unerring and unruffled ones still he sighed as he answered her my dear child i forgive you but beatrice there is no foe to love so sure and deadly as dissension and as he drew her to him and felt her soft warm lips on his he thought half uneasily yet she has never told me who annoyed hernever mentioned her companion in the anteroom last night lady clive had her wish the thorn festered as promisingly as she could have desired ce nest que le premier pas qui coute in quarrels as in all else dispute once you are very sure to dispute again whether with the man you hate or the woman you love iii how pride sowed and reaped it only wanted three weeks to beatrice bovilles marriage we were all to leave lemongenseidlitz together in a fortnights time for old lady mechlins house in berks where the ceremony was to take place earlscourt is quite infatuated said lady clive to me one evening beatrice is very charming of course but she is not at all suited to him she is so fiery so impetuous so selfreliant i think you are mistaken said i i admired beatrice bovillecomme je vous ai ditand i didnt like our familys snaps and snarls at her she may be impetuous but as her impulses are always generous that doesnt matter much she is only fiery at injustice and for myself i prefer a woman who can stand up for her own rights and her friends to one wholl sit by inyoull call it meekness i suppose i call it cowardice and hypocrisyto hear herself or them abused thank you mon ami said beatrices voice at my elbow as lady clive rose and crossed the room i am much obliged for your defence i couldnt help hearing it as i stood in the balcony and i wish very much i deserved it i am afraid though i cannot dispute helenas verdict of fiery impetuous and selfreliant i asked her she laughed softly and her eyes unconsciously sought earlscourt who was talking to lady mechlin well not quite now but by the way why should people charge selfreliance on to one as something reprehensible and undesirable a proper selfreliance is an indispensable groundwork to any success if you cannot rely upon yourself upon your power to judge and to act you must rely upon some other person possibly upon many people and you become perforce vacillating and unstable to thine own self be true and it shall follow as the day the night thou canst not then be false to any man as she spoke a servant brought a note to her and i noticed her cheeks grow pale as she saw the handwriting upon it she broke it open and read it hastily an oddly troubled worried look coming over her face a look that earlscourt could not help but notice as he stood beside her is there anything in that letter to annoy you beatrice he asked very naturally she startedrather guiltily i thoughtand crushed the note in her hand whom is it from it troubles you i think tell me my darling is it anything that vexes or offends you he whispered bending down to her she laughed a little nervously for her and tore the note into tiny pieces why do you not tell me beatrice he said again with a shade of annoyance on his face because i would rather not she said frankly enough letting the pieces float out of the window into the street below the shadow grew darker in his face he bent his head in acquiescence and said no more but i dont think he forgot either the note or her destroyal of it i thought there was implicit confidence before marriage whatever there is after sneered his sister as she passed him he answered her calmly i should say helena that neither before nor after marriage would any man who respected his wife suffer curiosity or suspicion to enter into him if he do he has no right to expect happiness and he will certainly not go the way to get it that was the only reply he gave lady clive but her thorn no festered in him and when he bade beatrice good night standing alone with her in the little drawing room he took both her hands in his and looked straight into her eyes beatrice why would you not let me see that note this evening she looked up at him as fearlessly and clearly if i tell you why i must tell you whom the note was from and what it was about and i would much rather do neither as yet that is very strange i dislike concealment of all kinds especially from you who so soon will be my wife it is inconceivable to me why you should need or desire any i thought your life was a fair open book every line of which i might read if i desired beatrice looked at him in amazement so you may do you suppose if i had any secret from you that i feared you should know i could have a moments peace in your society or look at you for an instant as i do now i give you my word of honor that there was nothing either in the note that concerns you or that you would wish me to tell you in a few days you shall know all that was in it but i ask you as a kindness not to press me now surely you do not think me such a child but that you can trust me in so small a trifle if you say i am not worthy of your confidence you imply that i am not worthy of your love you spoke nobly to your sister just now ernest do not act less nobly to me he could not but admire her as she looked at him with her fearless unshadowed regard her head thrown a little back and her attitude halfcommanding halfentreating he smiled in spite of himself you are a wayward spoiled child beatrice you must have your own way she gave a little stamp of her foot she hated being called a spoiled child specially by him and in a serious moment if i have my own way have i your full confidence too yes but my dear beatrice the only way to gain confidence is never to excite suspicion and lady clives thorn rankled a ravir for even as he pressed his goodnight kisses on her lips he thought restlessly shall we make each other happyam i too grave for herand is she too wilful for me i want rest not contention the night after that there was a balmasque at the redoute i was just coming out of my room as beatrice came down the corridor she had her mask in her hand her dress was something white starred with gold and round her hair she had a little band of pearls of earlscourts gift i never saw her look better specially when her cheeks flushed and her eyes brightened as earlscourt opened his door next mine and met her he did not see me the corridor was empty and he bent down to her with fond words and caresses do i look well she said with childlike delight i am so glad ernest i want to do you honor in that mood he understood her well enough and he pressed her against his heart with the passion that was in him whose strength he so rarely let her see then he drew her hand through his arm and led her down the stairs and as i laughed to find to what lengths our cold statesman could come at last i thought lady clives thorns would be innocuous however well planted earlscourt never danced nothing but what was calm and stately could possibly have suited him but beatrice did and waltzed like a willis though she liked even better than that standing on his arm and talking with his friendsdiplomatic military and ministerialon all sorts of questions most of which she could handle nearly as well as they and about the middle of the evening while she was waltzing with some man or other who had begged to be introduced to her earlscourt left the ballroom for ten minutes in earnest conversation with one of the french ministers who was leaving the next morning as he came back again i asked him where beatrice was because powell of the bays was bothering my life out to introduce him to her in the ball room isnt she she is with lady mechlin of course if the waltz is over a familiar voice stopped him she is not in the ball room go where you found her the other night and see if caesars promised wife be above suspicion i could have sworn the voice was lady clives a pink domino passed us too fast for detention but earlscourts lips turned white at the subtle whisper and he muttered a fierce oathfiercer from him because hes never stirred into fiery expletives there is some vile plot against her i must sift it to the bottom and pushing past me he entered the ball room beatrice was not there and wending his way through the crowd he went in through several other apartments leading off to the right and involuntarily i followed him to see what the malicious whisper of the pink domino had meant earlscourt lifted the curtain that parted the anteroom from the other chamberlifted it to see beatrice boville as the pink domino had prophesied and not alone with her was a man masked but about earlscourts height and seemingly about his age who as he saw us let go her hand with a laugh turned on to a balcony which was but a yard or so from the street and dropped on to the pave below beatrice started and colored but i thought she must be the most desperate actress going for she came up to earlscourt with a smile and was about to put her hand through his arm but he signed her away from him your acting is quite useless with me i am not to be blinded by it again i have believed in your truth as in my own so you may still listen to me ernest hush do not add falsehood to falsehood he spoke sternly and coldly his pride which was as strong as his love for her would not gratify her by a sign of the torture within him and even in his bitterest anger earlscourt would never have been ungentle to a woman that word acted like an incantation on her the blood crimsoned her temples her eyes literally flashed fire and she threw back her head with the haughty impatient gesture habitual to her falsehood three times of late you have used that word to me and why because you merited it she stood before him the indignant flush hotter still upon her cheeks her lips curved into scornful anger if she was an actress she knew her role to perfection do you speak that seriously lord earlscourt do you believe that i have lied to you god help me what else can i believe he muttered too low for her to hear it she asked him the question again fiercely and he answered her briefly and sternly i believe that all your life with me has been a lie i trusted you implicitly and how do you return it by carrying on clandestine intercourse with another man giving him interviews that you conceal from me having letters that you destroy doubtless receiving caresses that you take care are unwitnessed while you dare to smile in my face and to dupe me with childlike tenderness and to bid me trust you and believe in you love shared to me is worthless and on my wife beatrice no stain must rest as he spoke a dark shadow spread over her countenance her evil spirit rose up in her and her bright frank fearless face grew almost as hard and cold as his while her teeth were set together till her lips usually soft and laughing were pressed into one straight haughty line since you give me up so easily far be it from me to dispute your will we part from this hour if you desire it my honor is as dear to me as yours to you and to those who dare to suspect it i never stoop to defend it but my god beatrice what am i to believe whatever you please what i please child you must be mad what can i believe but that you are the most perfect of all actresses that your art is the greatest of all sins the art that clothes itself in innocence and carries wouldbe truth upon its lips prove to me that i wrong you she shook her head the devil in her had still the victory her eyes glittered and her little teeth were clinched together what i exact is trust without proof i am not your prisoner lord earlscourt to be tried coldly and acquitted if you find legal evidence of innocence convicted if there be a link wanting if you choose to trust me i have told you often your trust will never be wronged if you choose to condemn me do i shall not stoop to show you your injustice earlscourts face grew dark and hard as hers but it was wonderful how well his pride chained down all evidence of suffering the only sign was in the hoarseness of and quiver in his voice say nothing moreprevarication is guilt god forgive you beatrice boville if you loved me and knelt at my feet i would not make you my wife after the art and the lies with which you have repaid my trust thank god you do not already bear my name and my honor in your hands with those words he left her beatrice stood still in the same place her lips set in one scornful line her eyes glittering her brow crimson her whole attitude defiant wronged and unyielding earlscourt passed me his face white as death and was out of sight in a second i waited a moment then i followed my impulse and went up to her beatrice for heavens sake what is all this she turned her large eyes on me haughtily do you believe what your cousin does i answered her as briefly no i do not there is some mistake here she seized my arm impetuously promise me on your honor never to tell what i tell to you while i live promise me on your faith as a gentleman on my honor i promise well the man whom you saw with me tonight is my father lord earlscourt chose to condemn me without inquiry so let him but i tell you that you may tell him if i die before him that he wronged me you know mr bovillesmy fatherscharacter i had not seen him since i was a child but when he heard of my engagement to lord earlscourt he found me out and wanted to force himself on him and borrow money of him and she stopped her face was crimson but she went on passionately all my efforts of course were to keep them apart to spare my father such degradation and your cousin such an application i could not tell lord earlscourt for he is generous as the winds and i knew what he would have done my note was from my father he wanted to frighten me into introducing him to lord earlscourt but he did not succeed i would not have your cousin disgraced or pained byarthur that is all my crime no very great one is it and she laughed a loud bitter laugh as unlike her own as the stormy shadow on her face was like the usual sunshine but great heaven why not have told this to earlscourt she signed me to silence with a passionate gesture no he dishonored me with suspicion let him go i forbid you ever to breathe a word of what i have told you to him if he has pride so have i he would hold no dishonor greater than for another man to charge him with a lie my truth is as untainted as his and my honor as dear to me he accused me wrongly let him repent i would have loved and reverenced him as never any woman yet could do but once suspected i could find no happiness with him his bitter words are stamped into my heart i shall never forgeti doubt if i shall ever forgivethem i can bear anything but injustice or misconception if any doubt me they are free to do so theirs is the sin not mine as he has sown so must he reap and so must i a low gasping sob choked her voice but she stood like a little pythoness the pearl gleaming above her brow her eyes unnaturally bright the color burning in her face her attitude what it was when he left her defiant wronged unyielding she swept away from me to a man who was coming through the other room and he stared at her set lips and her gleaming eyes as she asked him carelessly count avonyl will you have the kindness to take me to lady mechlin that was the last i saw of her she left the bad with her aunt as soon as the day dawned and when i went to our hotel i found that earlscourt had ordered posthorses immediately he quitted the ball room and gonewhere he did not leave word so my presentiment was verified the pride of both had come in conflict and the pride of neither had succumbed how long it would sustain and satisfy them i could not guess but lady clive smiled again as sweetly as ladies ever do when their thorns have thriven and brought forth abundant fruit some other time i will tell you how i saw beatrice boville again but i often thought of pauline by pride angels have fallen ere thy time when i recalled her with the pearls above her brow and her passionate gleaming eyes and her fearless scornful haughty anguish as she had stood before me that night when pride v pride caused the wreck of both their lives iv where i saw beatrice boville again i dont belong to st stephens myself thank heaven very likely they would have returned me for the county when the governor departed this life had i tried them but as i generally cut the county from not being one of the grass countries and as i couldnt put forward any patriotic claims like mr harper twelvetrees who as hes such a slayer of vermin thought i suppose that hed try his hand at the dryrot and the red tapeworms which according to cotton grumblers are sapping the nation i havent solicited its suffrages the odds at tattersalls interest me more than the figures of the ways and means and diophantuss and kettledrums legerdemain at newmarket and epsom is more to my taste than our brilliant rhetoricians with the surplus i dont care a button about lord raynham and sir c burrells maidsofallwork they are not an attractive class i should say and if they like to amuse their time tumbling out of windows i cant see for the life of me why peers and gentlemen should rush to the rescue like don quixote to dulcineas and as for that great question tea v paper bohea delights the souls of old ladies and washerwomenwho destroy crumpets and character over its inebriating cups and who will rush to crown lord derbys and mr disraelis brows with laurels if they ever go to the country with a teapot blazoned on their patriotic bannersmore than it does mine which prefers bass and burgundy seltzer and sillery and though i dare say brown jones and robinson find the divorce news exciting and paper collars very showy and economical as i myself am content with the times and its compeers and think with poor brummel that life without daily clean linen were worthless that subject doesnt absorb me as it does those gentlemen who find the last tax of knowledge so grandiloquent and useful a finishing period so i have never stood for the county nor essayed to stand for it seeing that to one bernal osborne there are fifty prosers in st stephens and to be bored is to a butterfly flutterer as the young lady whose name heads this paper once obligingly called me torture unparalleled by anything short of acid wine or the chinese atrocities though truly he who heads our lower house with his vernal heart and his matchless brain were enough to make any man coxcomb or hero oppositionist or ministerialist proud to sit in the same chamber with him but there are nights now and then of course when i like to go to both houses to hear lord derbys rich intricate oratory or gladstones rhetoric which has so potent a spell even for his foes and is yet charged so strangely against him as half a crime possibly by the same spirit with which plain women reproach a pretty one for her beauty what business has he to be more attractive than his compeers of course its a peche mortel in their eyes and when mrs breloques who is a charming little woman to whom no man short of a goth could possibly say no to any petition gave me a little blow with her fan and told me as i valued her friendship to get an order and take her and gwen to hear the lords debate on tuesday when my cousin viscount earlscourt one of the best orators in the upper house was certain to speak of course i obliged her her sister gwen who was a girl of seventeen barely out and whom i wished at jerico three is so odious a number one of the triad must ever be de trop was wrathful with the upper house it in no wise realized her expectations the peers should have worn their robes she thought as if the horrors of a chamber filled with thames odors in june wasnt enough without being bored with velvet and ermine she would have been further impressed by coronets also they had no business to lounge on their benches as if they were in a smokingroom they should have declaimed like kean not spoken colloquially andin fact they shouldnt have been ordinary men at all i think a fine collection from madame tussauds with a touch of the roman antique would have been much more to gwens ideal and she wasnt at all content till earlscourt rose he reconciled her a little for he had a grandseigneur air she said that made up for the incongruities of his dress it was a measure that he had much at heart he had exerted for it all his influence in the cabinet and he was determined that the bill should pass the lords though the majority inclined to throw it out as he stood now against the table with his calm dignity of gesture his unstrained flow of words and his rich and ringing voice which could give majesty to commonplace subjects and sway even an apathetic audience as completely as sheridans begum speech every one in the house listened attentively and each of his words fell with its due weight i heard him with pride often as i had done so before though i noticed with pain that the lines in his forehead and his mouth were visibly deepened that he seemed to speak with effort for him and looked altogether as somebody had said to me at whites in the morning as if he were wearing out and would go down in his prime like canning and pitt lord earlscourt looks very illdont you think so said lelia breloques as i answered her i heard a sharpwrung sigh and i looked for the first time at the lady next me i saw a delicate profile lips compressed and colorless chestnut hair that i had last seen with his pearls gleaming above it i saw en deux mots beatrice boville for the first time since that night eight months before when she had stood before me in her passion and her pride she never took her eyes off earlscourt while he spoke and i wondered if she regretted having lost him for a point of honor had she grown indifferent to him that she had come to his own legislative chamber or was her love so much stronger than her pride that she had sought to see him thus rather than not see him at all when his speech was closed and he had resumed his place on the benches she leaned back covering her eyes with her hand for a moment and as i said aloud more for her benefit than mrs breloquess my regret that earlscourt would wear himself out i was afraid in his devotion to public life beatrice started at the sound of my voice turned her head hastily and her face was colorless enough to tell me she had not gratified her pride without some cost of course i spoke to her she had been a favorite of mine always and i had often wished to come across her again but beyond learning that she was with lady mechlin in lowndes square and had been spending the winter at pau for her aunts health i had no time to hear more for lelia having only come for earlscourts speech bade me take her to her carriage while beatrice and her party remained for the rest of the debate but the rencontre struck me as so odd that i believe it occupied my thoughts more than mrs breloques liked who got into her carriage in not the best of humors and asked me if i was going in for public life that id grown so particularly unamusing were always unamusing to one woman if were thinking at all about another do you know who was at the house tonight earlscourt to hear your speech i asked him as i met him a couple of hours afterwards in one of the passages as he was leaving the house he had altered much in eight months he stooped a little from his waist he looked worn and his lips were pale men said his stamina was not equal to his brain physicians that he gave himself too much work and too little sleep i knew he was more wrapped in public life than ever that in his place in the government he worked unwearyingly and that he found time in spare moments for intellectual recreation that would have sufficed for their lifes study for most men still i thought possibly there might be a weakness still clinging round his heart though he never alluded to it a passion which though he appeared to have crushed it out might be sapping his health more than all his work for the nation do you mean any one in particular persigny said he should attend but i did not see him no i meant among the ladies beatrice boville was in the seat next me i had no earthly business to speak of her so abruptly for when i had seen him for the first time after he left the bad when parliament met that february he had forbidden me ever to mention her name to him and no allusion to her had ever passed his lips the worn stern gravity that had become his habitual expression changed for a moment bulletproof he might be but my arrow had shot in through the chain links of his armor a look of unutterable pain eagerness anxiety passion passed over his face but whatever he felt he subdued it though his voice was broken as he answered me once for all i bade you never speak that name to me without being forbidden i should have thought your own feeling your own delicacy might have checked me o hang it earlscourt listen one second without shutting a fellow up i never broached the subject before by your desire but now i have once broken the ice i must ask you one question are you sure you judged the girl justly are you sure you were not too quick to slan he pressed his hand on his chest and breathed heavily as i spoke but he wouldnt let me finish that is enough would any man sacrifice what he held dearest wantonly and without proof she is dear to me now you are the only living being so thoughtless or so merciless as to force her name upon me and rake up the one folly the one madness the one crowning sorrow of my life see that you never dare bring forward her name again he went out before me into the soft night air his carriage was waiting he entered it threw himself back on its cushions and was driven off before i had time to break my word of honor to beatrice boville which i felt sorely tempted to do just then who among the thousands that heard his briliant speech that night or read it the next morning who saw him pass in his carriage and had him pointed out to them as the finest orator of his day or dined with him at his ministerial dinners at his house in park lane would have believed that with all his ambition fame honors and attainments the one cross the one shadow the one dark thread in the successful statemans life was due to a womans hand and that underneath all his strength lay that single weakness sapping and undermining it did you see that girl boville at the house last night lady clive who had smiled most sweetly ever since her thorns had brought forth their fruither son would be his heirearlscourt would never marry now said to me the next day at one of the musical society concerts incredible effrontery wasnt it in her to come and hear earlscourts speech one would have imagined that conscience and delicacy might have made her reluctant to see him instead of letting her voluntarily seek his own legislative chamber and listen coolly for an hour and a half to the man whom she misled and deceived so disgracefully i laughed to think how long a time a womans malice will flourish nimporte how victorious it may have been in crushing its object or how harmless that object may have become you are very bitter about her still lady clive is that quite fair you know you were so much obliged to her for throwing earlscourt away you want horace to come in for the title dont you which truism being unpalatable lady clive averred that she had no wish on earth but for earlscourts happiness that of course she naturally grieved for his betrayal by that little intrigante but that had his marriage been a welladvised one nobody would have rejoiced more etc etc and bade me be silent and listen to vieuxtemps both of which commands i obeyed pondering in my own mind whether i should go and call in lowndes square or not if anybody heard of it they would think it odd for me alone of all the family to continue acquainted with a girl whom report circulated through lady clive said had used earlscourt so ill and wrong constructions might get put upon it but thank god i never have considered the quen diraton if constructions are wrong to the deuce with them they matter nothing to sensible people and the man who lives in dread of reports will have to shift his conduct as the old man of immortal fable shifted his donkey and wont ever journey in any peace at all if anybody remarked my visiting lowndes square i couldnt help it i wanted to see beatrice boville again and to lowndes square after the concert i drove my tilbury accordingly which as that turnout is known pretty tolerably in those parts i should be wisest to leave behind me when i dont want my calls noticed by good fortune i saw beatrice alone they were going to drive in the park and she was in the drawing room dressed and waiting for her aunt she was not altered at her age sorrow doesnt tell physically as it does at earlscourts in youth we have hope later on we know that of all the gifts of pandoras box none are so treacherous and delusive as the one that pandora left at the bottom true beatrice had none of that insouciant shadowless brightness that had been her chief charm at lemongenseidlitz but she was one of those women whose attractions dependent on fascination not on beauty grow more instead of less as time goes on she met me with a trace of embarrassment but she was always selfpossessed under any amount of difficulties and stood chatting a trifle hurriedly of all the subjects of the year of anything i dare say rather than of that speech the night before or of the secret of which i was her sole confidant but i was not going to let her off so easily i had come there for a definite purpose and was not going away without accomplishing it i was afraid every second that lady mechlin might come down or some visitor enter and as she sat in a low chair among the flowers in the window leant towards her and plunged into it in medias res miss boville i want you to release me from my promise she looked up her face flushing slightly but her lips and eyes shadowed already with that determined pride and hauteur that they had worn the last time i had seen her she did not speak but played with the boughs of a coronella near her you remember i went on speaking as briefly as possible lest the old ladys toilet should be finished and our teteatete cut short i gave you my word of honor never to speak again of what you told me in the kursaal last autumn until you gave me leave that leave i ask you for now silence lies in the way of your own happiness i feel sure and not alone of yours if you give me carte blanche you may be certain i shall use it discreetly and cautiously you made the prohibition in a moment of heat and passion withdraw it nowbelieve me you will never repent the flush died out of her cheeks as i spoke but her little white teeth were set together as they had been that night and she answered me bitterly you ask what is impossible i cannot in justice to myself withdraw it i would never have told you but that i deemed you a man of honor whom i could trust i do not think i have proved myself otherwise beatrice i have kept my word to you when i have been greatly tempted to break it when i have doubted whether it were either right or wise to stand on such punctilio when greater stakes were involved by my silence surely if you once had elevated mind enough to comprehend and admire such a man as earlscourt and be won by the greatness of his intellect to prefer him to younger rivals it is impossible you can have lowered your taste and found any one to replace him no woman who once loved earlscourt could stoop to an inferior man and almost all men are his inferiors it is impossible you can have grown cold towards him she turned her eyes upon me luminous with her old passionthe color hot in her cheeks and her attitude full of that fiery pride which became her so infinitely well i changedi grown cold to him i love him more than all the world and shall do to my grave do you think that any who heard him last night could glory in him as i did did you think any physical torture would not have been easier to bear than what i felt when i saw his face once more and thought of what we should have been to one another and of what we are we women have to act and smile and wear a calm semblance while our hearts are bursting and so you fancy that we never feel but great heavens beatrice if you love earlscourt like this why not give me leave to tell him why not write to him yourself a word would clear you a word restore you to him your anger your pride he would forgive in a moment im a military man not a diplomatist or i shouldnt have added that last sentence she rose and looked at me haughtily and amazedly it is i who have to forgive not he i wronged him in no way he wronged me bitterly he dared to misjudge to suspect to insult me i shall never stoop to undeceive him he gave me up without a trial i never will force myself upon him he thanked god i was not his wifecould i seek to be his wife after that love him passionately i do but forgive him i do not i forbid you on your faith as a gentleman ever to tell him what i told you that night i trusted to your honor i shall hold you dishonored if you betray me just as she paused an open carriage rolled past i looked down mechanically in it was earlscourt lying back on his cushions returning i believe from a cabinet council there in the street stood my tilbury with the piebald cognac that everybody in belgravia knew there in the open window stood beatrice and i and earlscourt as he happened to glance upwards saw us both his carriage rolled on beatrice grew as white as death and her lips quivered as she looked after him but lady mechlin entered and i took them down to their barouche you are determined not to release me from my promise i asked beatrice as i pulled up the tigerskin over her flounces she shook her head certainly not and i should think you are too much of a gentleman not to hold a promise sacred pride and determination were written in every line of her face in the very arch of her eyebrows the very form of her brow the very curve of her lipsa soft delicate face enough otherwise but as expressive of indomitable pride as any face could be and yet though i swore at her as i drove cognac out of the square i couldnt help liking her all the better for it the little pythoness for after all it was natural and very intelligible to meshe had been misjudged and wrongly suspected and the noblest spirits are always the quickest to rebel against injustice and resent false accusation v how in perfect innocence i played the part of a rival the season whirled and spun along as usual they were having stormy debates in the lower house and throwing out bills in the upper stifled by thames odors one evening and running down to epsom the next morning blackguarding each other in parliamentary languagewhich on my honor will soon want duels revived to keep it within decent breeding if lord robert cecil and others dont learn better manners and remember the golden rule that he alone resorts to vituperation whose argument is illogical and weak we luckier dogs who werent slaves to st stephens nor to anything at all except as parsons and moralists with whom the grapes sont verts et bons pour des goujats said to our own worldly vitiated tastes and evil leanings spent our hours in the ring and the coulisses whites and the united crush balls and opera suppers and swore we were immeasurably bored though we wouldnt have led any other life for half a million the season whirled along earlscourt devoted himself more entirely than ever to public life he filled one of the most onerous and important posts in the ministry and appeared to occupy himself solely with home politics and foreign politics lady mechlin only a baronets widow though she had very tolerable society of her own was not in his monde and beatrice boville and he with only hyde park corner between them might as well for any chance of rapprochement have been severally at spitzbergen and cape horn two or three times they passed each other in pallmall and the ride but earlscourt only lifted his hat to lady mechlin and beatrice set her little teeth together and wouldnt have solicited a glance from him to save her life earlscourt was excessively distant to me after seeing my tilbury at her door no doubt he thought it strange for me to have continued my intimacy with a woman who had wronged him so bitterly he said nothing but i could see he was exceedingly displeased and the more i tried to smooth it with him the more completely i seemed to set my foot in it it was exceedingly difficult to touch on any obnoxious subject with him he was never harsh or discourteous but he could freeze the atmosphere about him gently but so completely that no mortal could pierce through it and fettered by my promise to her and his prohibition to me i hardly knew how to bring up her name as the fates would have it i often met beatrice myself at the regent park fetes at concerts at a handel festival at sydenham at one or two dinner parties and as she generally made way for me beside her and was one of those women who are invariably though without effort admired and surrounded in any society possibly people remarked itpossibly our continued intimacy might have come round to earlscourt specially as lady clive and mrs breloques abused me roundly each a sa mode for countenancing that abominable intrigante i couldnt help it even if earlscourt took exception at me for it i knew the girl was not to blame and i took her part and tried my best to tame the little pythoness into releasing me from my promise but beatrice was firm had she erred no one would have acknowledged and atoned for it quicker but innocent and wrongly accused she kept silent coute que coute and in my heart i sympathized with her nothing stings so sharply nothing is harder to forgive than injustice and knowing herself to be frank honorable and open as the day his charge of falsehood and deception rankled in her only more keenly as time went on men ran after her like mad she had more of them about her than many beauties or belles there was a style a charm a something in her that sent beauties into the shade and by which had she chosen she could soon have replaced earlscourt still it needed to be no lavater to see by the passionate gleam of her eyes and the haughty pride on her brow that beatrice boville was not happy why will you let pride and punctilio wreck your own life beatrice i asked her in a low tone as we stood before one of ed warrens delicious bits of woodland in the watercolor exhibition where we had chanced to meet one day that he should have judged you as he did was not unnatural think how was it possible for him to guess your father was your companion remember how very much circumstances were against you had they been ten times more against me a man who cared for me would have believed in me and stood by me not condemned me on the first suspicion it was unchivalrous ungenerous unjust i tell you his words are stamped into my memory forever i shall never forgive them not even if you knew that he suffered as much and more than you do she clinched her hands on the rolledup catalogue with a passionate gesture no because he misjudged me anything else i would have pardoned though i am no patient griselda to put up tamely with any wrong but that i never couldi never would i regret it then i thought you too warm and noblehearted a woman to retain resentment so long i never blamed you in the first instance but i must say i blame you now she laughed a little contemptuously and glanced at me with her haughtiest air and on my life much as it provoked one nothing became her better blame me or not as you pleaseyour verdict will be quite bearable either way i am the one sinned against i can have nothing explained to lord earlscourt had he cared for me as he once vowed he would have been less quick then to suspect me and quicker now to give me a chance of clearing myself but you remember he thanked god i had not his name and his honor in my hands i dare say he rejoices at his escape she laughed again turning over the catalogue feverishly and unconsciously those were the words that rankled in her and it was not much wonder if to a proud spirit like beatrice bovilles they seemed unpardonable as i handed her and lady mechlin into their carriage when they left the exhibition earlscourt as ill luck would have it passed us walking on to whites the fringe of beatrices parasol brushed his arm and a hot color flushed into her cheeks at the sudden rencontre by the instinct of courtesy he bowed to her and lady mechlin but passed up pallmall without looking at beatrice how well society drills us that we meet with such calm impassiveness in its routine those with whom we have sorrowed and joyed loved and hated in such far different scenes their carriage drove on and i overtook him as he went up pallmall he was walking slowly with his hand pressed on his chest and his lips set together as if in bodily pain he looked at me as i joined him with an annoyed glance of unusual irritation for him for he was always calm and untroubled punctiliously just and though of a proud temper never quick to anger you passed that girl wonderfully coldly earlscourt i began plunging recklessly into the thick of the subject coldly he repeated bitterly it is very strange that you will pursue me with her name i forbade you to intrude it upon me was not that sufficient no because i think you judged her too harshly think so if you please but never renew the topic to me if she gives you her confidence enjoy it if you choose knowing what you do to be misled by her be so but i beg of you to spare me your opinions and intentions but why i say you do misjudge her she might err in impatience and pride but i would bet you any money you like that you would prove her guilty of no indelicacy no treachery no underhand conduct though appearances might be against her might be you select your words strangely you must have some deeper motive for your unusual blindness i desire for the last time that you cease either the subject to me or your acquaintance with me whichever you prefer with which he went up the steps of whites and i strolled on amazed at the fierce acrimony of his tone utterly unlike anything i had ever heard from him wished their pride to the devil called myself a fool for meddling in the matter at all and went to have a quiet weed in the smokingroom of the u s to cool myself i was heartily sick of the whole affair if they wanted it cleared they must clear it themselvesi should trouble myself no more about it yet i couldnt altogether dismiss beatrices cause from my mind i thought her to say the truth rather harshly used i liked her for her fearless truthful impassioned character i liked her for the very courage and pride with which she preferred to relinquish any chance of regaining her forfeited happiness rather than stoop to solicit exculpation from charges of which she knew she was innocent perhaps at first she did not consider sufficiently earlscourts provocation and perhaps now she was too persisting in her resentment of it still i liked her and i was sorry to see her at an age when life should have been couleur de rose to one of her gay and insouciant nature with a weary passionate look on her face that she should not have had for ten years to comea look that was rapidly hardening into stern and contemptuous sadness you tell me i am too bitter she said to me one day how should i be otherwise i who have wronged no one and have never in my life done anything of which i am ashamed am called an intrigante by lady clive edghill and get illwill from strangers and misconstructions from my friends merely because thinking no harm myself it never occurs to me that circumstances may look against me and hating falsehood i cannot lie and smile and give soft words where i feel contempt and indignation mrs breloques yonder with whom les presens ont toujours raison and les absens ont toujours tort who has honeyed speeches for her bitterest foes and poisoned arrows behind their back for her most trusting friends who goes to early matins every morning and pries out for a second all over the top of her prayerbook who kisses darling helena and says she never looked so sweetly whispering en petit comite what a pity it is when helena is so passee she will dress like a girl just outshe is called the sweetest woman possibleso amiable and is praised for her high knowledge of religion you tell me i am too bitter i think not honesty does not prosper and truth is at a miserable discount straightforward frankness makes a myriad of foes and adroit diplomacy as many friends if you make a prettilyturned compliment who cares if it is sincere if you hold your tongue where you cannot praise because you will not tell a conventional falsehood the world thinks you very illnatured or odiously satirical society is entirely built upon insincerity and conventionality from the wording of an acceptance of a dinner invitation where we write with much pleasure thinking to ourselves what a bore to the giant hypocrisies daily spoken without a blush from pulpit and lecturn and legitimatized both as permissible and praiseworthy to truth and unconventionality society of course is adverse and whoever dares to uphold them must expect to be hissed as paul by the ephesians because he shivered their silver shrines and destroyed the craft by which they got their wealth beatrice was right her truth and fearlessness were her enemies with most people even with the man who had loved her best had she been ready with an adroit falsehood and a quick excuse earlscourts suspicions would never have been raised as they were by her frank admission that there was something she would rather not tell him and her innocent request to be trusted that must have been some very innocent and unworldly village schoolmaster i should say who first set going that venerable proverb honesty is the best policy he must have known comically little of life a diplomatist who took it as his motto would soon come to grief and ladies would soon stone out of their circles any woman bete enough to try its truth among them there is no policy at greater discount in the world and straightforward and candid people stand at very unequal odds with the rest of humanity they are the one morsel of bread to a hogshead of sack the handful of spartans against a swarm of persians and they get the brunt of the battle and the worst of the fight vi how pride bowed and fell beyond meeting earlscourt at whites or for an hour at the reunion of some fair leader of ton i scarcely saw him that season for he was more and more devoted to public life he looked wretchedly ill and his physicians said if he wished to live he must go to the south of france in july and winter at corfu but he paid them no heed he occupied himself constantly with political and literary work and grudged the three or four hours he gave to sleep that did him little good will you get me admittance to the lords tomorrow night beatrice asked me one morning when i met her in the ride i looked at her surprised to the lords of course if you wish i do wish it her hands clinched on her bridle and the color flushed into her face for earlscourt just then passed us riding with one of his brother ministers he looked at us both and his face changed strangely though he rode on continuing his conversation with the other man while i went round the turn with beatrice and the other fellows who were about her le fruit defendu is always most attractive and beatrices profound negligence of them all made them more mad about her than all the traps and witcheries beguilements and attractions that coquettes and beauties set out for them she rode beautifully and a woman who does sit well down on her saddle and knows how to handle her horse never looks better than en amazone earlscourt met her three times at the turn of the ride and though you would not have told that he was passing any other than an utter stranger i think it must have struck him that he had lost much in losing beatrice boville i was riding on her offside each time when we passed him as i say i never thank god have cared a straw for the quen diraton and if people remarked on my intimacy with my cousins cast off fiancee so they might but to earlscourt i wished to explain it more for beatrices sake than my own and as i rode out by apsley house afterwards i overtook him and went up to piccadilly with him though his manner was decidedly distant and chill so pointedly so that it would have been rude had he not been too entirely a disciple of chesterfield to be ever otherwise than courteous to his deadliest foe but disregarding his coldness i said what i intended to say and began an explanation that i considered only due to him i beg your pardon earlscourt for intruding on you a topic you have forbidden but i shall be obliged to you to listen to me a moment i wish to tell you my reasons for what i dare say seems strange to you my continued intimacy with but i was not permitted to end my sentence he divined what i was about to say and stopped me with a cold wearied air i understand but i prefer not to hear them i have no desire to interfere with your actions and less to be troubled with your motives of course you choose your friendships as you please all i beg is that you obey the wish i expressed the other day and intrude the subject no more upon me and he bade me good morning urged his mare into a sharp canter and turned down st jamess street how little those in the crowd who looked at him as he rode by pointing him out to the women with them as viscount earlscourt the most eloquent debater in the lords the celebrated foreign minister author and diplomatist guessed that a womans name could touch and sting him as nothing else could do and that under the calm and glittering uppercurrent of his life ran a dark slender unnoticed thread that had power to poison all the rest those women mon amiif we do satirize them a little bit now and then are we doing any more than taking a very mild revenge dont they make fools of the very best and wisest of us play the deuce with caesar as with catullus and make achilles soft as amphimachus the next morning i met beatrice at a concert at the marchioness of pursangs lady pursang would not have been vous concevez on the visiting list of lady mechlin as she was one of the creme de la creme but she had met beatrice the winter before at pau had been very delighted with her and now continued the acquaintance in town i happened to sit next our little pythoness who looked better i think that morning than ever i saw her though her face was set into that disdainful sadness which had become its habitual expression she liked my society and sought it no doubt because i was the only link between her and her lost past and she was talking with me more animatedly than usual thanking me for having got her admittance to the lords that night during a pause in the concert when earlscourt entered the room and took the seat reserved for him which was not far from ours music was one of his passions the only delassement indeed he ever gave himself now but today though ostensibly he listened to alboni and arabella goddard halle and vieuxtemps and talked to the marchioness and other women of her set in reality he was watching beatrice who her pride roused by his presence laughed and chatted with me and other men with her old gay abandon and impervious to dereglement though he was i fancy even he felt it a severe trial of his composure when lady pursang who had been the last five years in india with her husband and who was ignorant of or had forgotten the name of the girl earlscourt was to have married the year before asked him when the concert was over to let her introduce him to her yet beatrice boville bringing him in innocent cruelty up to that little pythoness with whom he had parted so passionately and bitterly ten months before happy for them that they had that armor which the spartans called heroism the stoics philosophy and wesimply style good breeding or they would hardly have gone through that ordeal as well as they did when she introduced them to each other as strangersthose two who had whispered such passionate love words given and received such fond caresses vowed barely twelve months before to pass their lifetime together happy for them they were used to society or they would hardly have bowed to each other as calmly and admirably as they did with the recollection of that night in which they had parted so bitterly so full as it was in the minds of both beatrice was standing in one of the open windows of the little cabinet de peinture almost empty and when the marchioness moved away satisfied that she had introduced two people admirably fitted to entertain one another earlscourt with people flirting and talking within a few yards of him was virtually alone with beatricefor there is after all no solitude like the solitude of a crowdand then for the first time in his life his selfpossession forsook him beatrice was silent and very pale looking out of the window on to the green park which the house overlooked and earlscourts pride had a hard struggle but his passion got the better of him malgre lui and he leaned towards her do you remember the last night we were together she answered him bitterly she had not forgiven him she had sometimes i am half afraid sworn to revenge herself i am hardly likely to forget it lord earlscourt he looked at her longingly and wistfully his pride was softened that granite pride hitherto so unassailable and he bent nearer to her beatrice i would give much to be able to wash out the memories of that nightto be proved mistakento be convicted of haste of sternness the tears rushed into her eyes you need only have given one little thingall i asked of youtrust would to god i dare believe you now tell me answer me did i judge you too harshly love at my age never changes however wronged it is the latest and it only expires with life itself i confess to you you are dearer to me still than anything ever was than anything ever will be prove to me for gods sake that i misjudged you only prove it to me explain away what appeared against you and we may yet he stopped his voice trembled his hand touched hers he breathed short and fast the pythoness was very nearly tamed her eyes grew soft and melting her lips trembled but pride was still strong in her at the touch of his hand it very nearly gave way but not wholly it was there still tenacious of its reign she set her little teeth obstinately together and looked up at him with her old hauteur no as i told you then you must believe in me without proof i have not forgotten your bitter words nor yet forgiven them i doubt if i ever shall you roused an evil spirit in me that night lord earlscourt which you cannot exorcise at a moments notice remember what was your own motto an indiscreet woman is never frankyet from my very frankness you accused me of indiscretion and of far worse than indiscretion my god if i accused you falsely beatrice forgive me he must have loved her very much to bow his pride so far as that he was at her feetat her mercy now he whom she had vainly sued sued her but a perverse fiery devil in her urged her to take her own revenge compelled her to throw away her own peace you should have asked me that ten months ago it is too late now his face dyed white his eyes filled with passionate anguish he crushed her hand in his too late great heavens answer me child i entreat youi beseech youis it too late because report is true that you have replaced me with your cousinthat you are engaged to hervey tell me truth now for pitys sake i will be trifled with no longer beatrice threw back her haughty little head contemptuously though ladies dont sneer at the idea of being liees with me generally i can assure you her heart throbbed triumphantly and joyously she had conquered him at last the man of giant intellect and haughty will had bowed to her she held him by a thread he who ruled the fate of nationsand she loved him so dearly but the pythoness was not wholly tamed and she could not even yet forget her wrongs you told me before i spoke falsehoods to you lord earlscourt my word would find no more credence now he looked at her dropped her hand and turned away before beatrice could detain him five minutes after he left the house little as i guessed it he was jealous of mei who never in my own life rivalled any man who wished to marry beatrice had fully revenged herself i wonder if she enjoyed it quite as much as she had anticipated as she stood where he had left her looking out on the green park i went with beatrice and her party to the lords that night it was the tug of war for the bill which earlscourt was so determined should pass and a great speech was expected from him we were not disappointed when he rose he spoke with effort and his oratory suffered from the slight hoarseness of his voice for half the beauty of his rhetoric lay in the flexibility and music of his tones still it was emphatically a great speech and beatrice boville listened to it breathlessly with her eyes fixed on the faceweary worn but grandly intellectualof the man whom europe reverenced and shea girl of twentyruled perhaps her heart smote her for the lines she had added there perhaps she felt her pride misplaced to him great as he was with his stainless honor and unequalled genius perhaps she thought of how with all his strength his hand had trembled as it touched hers and how with all her love she had been wilful and naughty to him a second time his voice grew weaker as he ended and he spoke with visible effort still it was one of his greatest political triumphs his bill passed by a large majority and the papers the morning after filled their leading articles with admiration of viscount earlscourts speech but before those journals were out earlscourt was too ill almost to notice the success of his measures as he left the house the presiding devil of beloved albion that plays the deuce with english statesmen as with italian cantatricesthe confounded east windhad caught him finished what overexertion had begun and knocked him over prostrated with severe bronchitis what pity it is that the body will levy such cruel black mail upon the mind that a gust of wind a horses plunge the effluvia of a sewer the carelessness of a pointsman can destroy the grandest intellect sweep off the men whose genius lights the world as ruthlessly as a storm of rain a cloud of gnats and strike peel and canning macaulay and donaldson in the prime of their power as heedlessly as peasants little higher than the brutes dull as the clods of their own valley who stake their ambitions on a surfeit of fat bacon and can barely scrawl their names upon a slate unconscious that earlscourts jealousy had fastened so wrongly upon me i was calling upon beatrice late the next morning ignorant myself of his illness when his physician who was lady mechlins too while paying her a complimentary visit regretted to me my cousins sudden attack lord earlscourt would speak last night he began i entreated him not but those public men are so obstinate today he is very illvery ill indeed though prompt measures stopped the worst he has risen to dictate something of importance to his secretary he would work his brain if he were dying but it has taken a severe hold on him i fear i shall send him somewhere south as soon as he can leave the house which will not be for some weeks he would be a great loss to the country we have not such another foreign minister but i admit to you major herveythough of course i do not wish it to go furtherthat i do think very seriously of lord earlscourts state of health beatrice heard him as she sat at her davenport her face grew white and her eyes filled with great anguish she thought of his words to her only the day before and of how her pride had repelled him a second time i saw her hand clinch on the pen she was playing with and her teeth set tight together her habitual action under any strong emotion thinking to herself no doubt and my last words to him were bitter ones when the physician had left i went up to her beatrice you must let me tell him now she did not answer but her hand clinched tighter on the penhandle his life is in your hands for gods sake relinquish your pride but her pride was strong in her and dear to her still strong and dear as her love and the two struggled together earlscourt had bowed his pride to her but she had not yielded up her own and it cost her much to yield it even now all the pythoness in her was not tamed yet she was silentshe waveredthen her great love for him vanquished all else she rose white as death her passionate eyes full of unshed tears the bitterest yet the softest beatrice boville had ever known take me to him no one shall tell him but myself earlscourt was lying on a couch in his library he had been unable to dictate or to write himself for severe remedies had prostrated him utterly and he could not speak above his breath though he was loath to give up and acknowledge himself as ill as he was his eyes were closed his forehead knitted together in pain and his labored breathing told plainly enough how fiercely his foe had attacked him and that it was by no means conquered yet he had not slept all night and had fallen into a short slumber now desiring his attendants to leave him i bade the groom of the chambers let us enter unannounced and opening the door myself signed to beatrice to go in while her aunt and i waited in the anteroom she stopped a moment at the entrance her pride had its last struggle but he turned restlessly with a weary sigh and by that sigh the pythoness was conquered beatrice went forward and fell on her knees beside his sofa bending down till her lips touched his brow and her hot tears fell on his hands i was too proud last night to tell you you misjudged me i have no pride now i am your ownwholly your own i never loved i never should love any but you i forgive you now o how could you ever doubt me lord earlscourternestmay we not yet be all we once were to one another awakened by her kisses on his brow bewildered by her sudden appearance he tried to rise but sank back exhausted he did not disbelieve her now he had no voice to speak to her no strength to answer her but he drew her down closer and closer to him as she knelt by him and as her heart beat once more against his the little pythoness tamed at last threw her arms round him and sobbed like a child on his breast and sobeatrice boville took her best revengewhile i shut the library door invited lady mechlin to inspect earlscourts collection of french pictures and asked what she thought of punch this week i dont know what his physicians would have said of the treatment as theyd recommended him perfect quiet all i do know is that though earlscourt went to the south of europe as soon as he could leave the house beatrice boville went with him and he took his place on the benches and in the cabinet this season without any trace of bronchia or any sign of wearing out lady clive i regret to say does not know lady earlscourt anything for her beloved brother she would do were it possible but she hopes we understand that for her daughters sakes she feels it quite impossible to countenance that shocking little intrigante a line in the daily a line in the daily who did it and who was done by it lieutenantcolonel fairlies troop of horse artillery is ordered to norwich to replace the th lancers en route to bombaythose three lines in the papers spread dismay into the souls of norfolk young ladies and no less horror into ours for we were very jolly at woolwich could run up to the clubs and down to epsom and were far too material not to prefer ballroom belles to bluebells strawberryice to fresh hautboys the sparkle of champagnecups to all the murmurs of the brooks and the flutter of balletgirls wings to all the rustle of forestleaves but unhappily the ordnance office is no more given to considering the feelings of their royal gunners than the horse guards the individual desires of the two other arms and off we went to norwich repining bitterly or in modern english swearing hard at our destinies creating an immense sensation with our pounders as we flatter ourselves the royals always contrive to do whether on fair friends or fierce foes and were looked upon spitefully by the one or two young ladies whose hearts were gone eastwards with the twelfth smilingly by the one or two hundred who having fruitlessly laid out a great deal of tackle on the twelfth proceeded to manufacture fresh flies to catch us we soon made up i think to the norwich girls for the loss of the twelfth they set dead upon fairlie our captain a brevet lieutenantcolonel and a c b for services in india where he had rivalled norman ramsay at fuentes donor had had a ball put in his hip and had come home again to be worshipped by the women for his romantic reputation they made an immense deal too of levison courtenay the beauty of the troop and called belle in consequence who did not want any flummery or flirtation to increase his opinion of himself being as vain of his almond eyes as any girl just entered as the favorite for the season there were tom gower too a capital fellow with no nonsense about him who made no end of chaff of belle courtenay and little nell otherwise harcourt poulteney nelson who had by some miracle escaped expulsion both from carshalton and the college and votre humble serviteur phil hardinge first lieutenant and one or two other fellows who having cut dashing figures at our woolwich reviews cantering across blackheath common or waltzing with dainty beauties down our messroom made the artillery welcome in that city of shawls and oratorios where according to the gazetteer no virtuous person ought to dwell that volume with characteristic lucidity pronouncing its streets illdisposed the clergy asked us to their rectoriesa temptation we were often proof against there being three noticeable facts in rectories that the talk is always slow the church being present and having much the same chilling effect as the presence of a chaperone at a teteatete the daughters generally ugly and from leading the choir at morning services perfectly convinced that they sing like clara novello and that the harmonium is a most delightful instrument and last and worst the wines are almost always poor except the port which the reverend host drinks himself but which dieu merci we rarely or never touch the county asked us too and there we went for good hock tolerablelooking women and firstrate billiardtables for the first month we were in norfolk we voted it unanimously the most infernally slow and hideous county going and i dare say we made ourselves uncommonly disagreeable as people if they are not pleased be they ever so well bred have a knack of doing things were thus quiescent and stagnant when fairlie one night at mess told us a bit of news old fellows whom do you think i met today how should we know cut along the swan and her cygnets the vanes oh bravo was shouted at a chorus for the dame and demoiselles in question we had known in town that winter and a nicer pleasanter faster set of women i never came across whats bringing them down here and hows geraldine vanes come into his baronetcy and his place is close by norwich said fairlie his wifes health has been bad and so they left town early and geraldine is quite well and counting on haymaking she informed me come that is good news said belle yawning therell be one pretty woman in the county thank heaven poor little geraldine i must go and call on her tomorrow she has existed without your calls belle said fairlie dryly and dont look as if shed pined after you my dear fellow how should you know said belle in no wise disconcerted a little rogue soon makes em look well and as for smiles theyll smile while theyre dying for you little vane and i were always good friends and shall be againif i care conceited owl said fairlie under his moustaches im sorry to hurt your feelings then but your pretty friend never asked after you i dare say not said belle complacently where a womans most interested shes always quietest and geraldine lady vane begged me to tell you you will always be welcome over there old fellows said fairlie remorselessly cutting him short perhaps we shall find something to amuse us better than these stiltified chapter dinners the vanes of whom we talked were an uncommonly pleasant set of people whom we had known at lee where vane a q c then resided his prospective baronetcy being at that time held by a third or fourth cousin fairlie had known the family since his boyhood there were four daughters tall graceful women who had gained themselves the nickname of the swan and her cygnets and then there were twins a boy of eighteen whod just left eton and the girl geraldine a charming young lady whom belle admired more warmly than that dandy often admired anybody besides himself and whom fairlie liked cordially having had many a familiar bit of fun with her as he had known her ever since he was a dashing cadet and she made her debut in life in the first column of the times her sisters were handsome women but geraldine was bewitching a very pleasant family they were and a vast acquisition to us miss geraldine flirted to a certain extent with us all but chiefly with the colonel whenever he was to be had those two having a very freeandeasy familiar pleasant style of intercourse owing to old acquaintance and belle spent two hours every evening on his toilette when we were going to dine there and vowed she was a deuced pretty little puss perhaps she mighthe wasnt sure but perhaps it would be a horrid sacrifice if he were with her much longer he wasnt sure she mightnt persuade him to take compassion upon her he was so weak where women were concerned what a conceit said fairlie thereat with a contemptuous twist of his moustaches and a shrug of his shoulders to me i must say if i were a woman i shouldnt feel overflattered by a lover who admired his own beauty first and mine afterwards not that i pretend to understand women by which speech i argued that his old playmate geraldine hadnt thrown hay over the colonel and been taught billiards by him and ridden his bay mare over the park in her evening dress without interesting him slightly and thatthough i dont think he knew ithe was deigning to be a trifle jealous of his second captain the allmighty conqueror belle what fools they must be that put in these things yawned belle one morning reading over his breakfast coffee in the daily pryer one of those advertisements for a wife that one comes across sometimes in the papers and that make us like a good many other things agree with goldsmith reason they say belongs to man but let them prove it if they can wise aristotle and smiglicious by ratiocinations specious have strove to prove with great precision with definition and division homo est ratione praeditum but for my soul i cannot credit em what fools they must be yawned belle wrapping his dressinggown round him and coaxing his perfumy whiskers under his velvet smokingcap belle was always inundated by smokingcaps in cloth and velvet silk and beads with blue tassels and red tassels and gold tassels embroidered and filigreed rounded and pointed he had them sent to him by the dozen and pretty good chaff he made of the donors awful fools the idea of advertising for a wife when the only difficulty a man has is to keep from being tricked into taking one i bet you if i did like this owl here i should have a hundred answers and if it was known it was i little geraldines self for a candidate eh asked tom gower very possibly said belle with a selfcomplacent smile shes a fast little thing dont check at much and shes deucedly in love with me poor little dearalmost as much trouble to me as julia sedley was last season that girl all but proposed to me she did indeed never was nearer coming to grief in my life what will you bet me that if i advertise for a wife i dont hoax lots of women ill bet you ten pounds said i that you dont hoax one done said belle stretching out his hand for a dainty memorandumbook gift of the identical julia sedley aforesaid and entering the bet in itdone if im not asked to walk in the close at noon and look out for a pink bonnet and a black lace cloak and to loiter up the marketplace till i come across a black hat and blue muslin dress if im not requested to call at no and to grant an interview at

prizefighter or a pipe of port to a college fellow marriagea bachelor tell em a military man all girls have the scarlet fever very wellan officer in the queens of considerable personal attractions my

lookout for tin and only feel an elective affinity for a lot of debentures and consols the advertiser being a man of some present and still more prospective wealth requires no fortune the sole objects of his search being love and domestic felicity domestic felicityhow horrible dont it sound exactly like the end of a ladys novel where the unlucky hero is always brought to an untimely end in a sweet cottage on the banks of the lovely severn domestic felicitybah what are you writing about yawned belle id as soon take to teetotalism however itll tell in the advertisement bravo tom that will do

search being love and domestic felicity address l c care of mrs greene confectioner st giles street norwich whose advertisement do you imagine that is said fairlie showing the daily to geraldine as he sat with her and her sisters under some lilac and larch trees in one of the meadows of fern chase which had had the civility geraldine said to yield a second crop of hay expressly for her to have the pleasure of making it she leaned down towards him as he lay on the grass and read the advertisement looking uncommonly pretty in her dainty muslin dress with its fluttering mauve ribbons and a wreath she had just twisted up of bluebells and pinks and white heaths which fairlie had gathered as he lay put on her bright hair we called her a little flirt but i think she was an unintentional one at least her agaceries were all as unconscious as they wereher worst enemies i e plain young ladies had to allowunaffected how exquisitely sentimental is it yours she asked with demure mischief mine echoed fairlie with supreme scorn its some ones here because the address is at mrs greenes come tell me at once monsieur the only fool in the artillery said fairlie curtly belle courtenay captain courtenay echoed geraldine with a little flush on her cheeks caused perhaps by the quick glance the colonel shot at her as he spoke captain courtenay said katherine vane why what can he want with a wife i thought he had lembarras de choix offered him in that line at least so he makes out himself i dare say said fairlie dryly its for a bet hes made to see how many women he can hoax i believe how can you tell it is a hoax said geraldine throwing cowslips at her greyhound it may be some medium of intercourse with some one he really cares for and who may understand his meaning perhaps you are in his confidence geraldine or perhaps you are thinking of answering it yourself perhaps said the young lady waywardly making the cowslips into a ball there might be worse investments your bete noire is strikingly handsome he is the perfection of style he is going to be equerry to the prince his mother is just married again to lord chevenix he did not name half his attractions in that line in the daily with which geraldine rushed across the meadow after the greyhound and the cowslip ball and fairlie lay quiet plucking up the heaths by the roots he lay there still when the cowslip ball struck him a soft fragrant blow against his lips and knocked the cuba from between his teeth why dont you speak asked geraldine plaintively you are not half so pleasant to play with as you were before you went to india and i was seven or eight and you had la grace and battledoor and shuttlecock and cricket and all sorts of games with me in the old garden at charlton he might have told her she was much less dangerous then than now he was not disposed to flatter her however so he answered her quietly i preferred you as you were then indeed said geraldine with a hot color in her cheeks i do not think there are many who would indorse your complimentary opinion possibly said fairlie coldly she took up her cowslips and hit him hard with them several times dont speak in that tone if you dislike me you can say so in warmer words surely fairlie smiled malgre lui what a child you are geraldine but a child that is a very mischievous coquette and has learned a hundred tricks and agaceries of which my little friend of seven or eight knew nothing i grant you were not a quarter so charming but you were i am afraidmore true geraldine was ready to cry but she was in a passion nevertheless such a hot and shortlived passion as all women of any spirit can go into on occasion when they are unjustly suspected if you choose to think so of me you may she said with immeasurable hauteur sweeping away from him her mauve ribbons fluttering disdainfully i for one shall not try to undeceive you the next night we all went up to a ball at the vanes to drink rhenish eat ices quiz the women flirt with the pretty ones in corners lounge against doorways criticise the feet in the waltzing as they passed us and do in fact anything but what we went to dodanceaccording to our custom in such scenes the swan and her cygnets looked very stunning they made up well as ladies say when they cannot deny that another is goodlooking but qualify your admiration by an assurance that she is shockingly plain in the morning and owes all to her milliner and maids geraldine who by the greatest stretch of scepticism could not be supposed made up was bewitching with her sunshiny enjoyment of everything and her untiring waltzing going for all the world like a spinningtop only a top tires and she did not belle who made a principle of never dancing except under extreme coercion by a very pretty hostess could not resist her and tom gower and little nell and all the rest not to mention half norfolk crowded round her all except fairlie who leaned against the doorway seeming to talk to her father or the members or anybody near but watching the young lady for all that who flirted not a little having in her mind the scene in the paddock of yesterday and wishing perhaps to show him that if he did not admire her more than when she was eight other men had better taste she managed to come near him towards the end of the evening sending belle to get her an ice well she said with a comical pitie dellememe do you dislike me so much that you dont mean to dance with me at all not a single waltz all night what time have you had to give me said fairlie coldly you have been surrounded all the evening of course i have i am not so disagreeable to other gentlemen as i am to you but i could have made time for you if you had only asked for it at your own ball last week you engaged me beforehand for six waltzes fairlie relented towards her despite her flirting he thought she did not care for belle after all well he said smiling will you give me one after supper you told me you shouldnt dance colonel fairlie said katherine vane smiling one cant tell what one maynt do under temptation said fairlie smiling too a man may change his mind you know oh yes cried geraldine a man may change his mind and we are expected to be eminently grateful to him for his condescension but if we change our minds how severely we are condemned for vacillation so weak just like women never like the same thing two minutes poor things you dont like the same thing two minutes geraldine laughed fairlie so i dare say you speak feelingly i changeable i am constancy itself are you you know what the italians say of ocche azzure but i dont believe it monsieur cried geraldine blue eyes beat black fifty to seven for blacks of hell but blues of heaven i beg your pardon mademoiselle laughed fairlie done by the odds it is not true one devils black but scores are blue he whirled her off into the circle in the midst of our laughter at their ready wit soon after he bid her good night but he found time to whisper as he did so you are more like my little geraldine tonight the look he got made him determine to make her his little geraldine before much more time had passed at least he drove us back to norwich in what seemed very contented silence for he smoked tranquilly and let the horses go their own pacetwo certain indications that a man has pleasant thoughts to accompany him i do not think he listened to belles and gowers and my conversation not even when belle took his weed out of his mouth and announced the important fact hardinge my ten guineas if you please ive had a letter what an answer by jove of course an answer i tell you all the pretty women in the city will know my initials and send after me i only hope they will be pretty and then one may have a good deal of fun i was in at greenes this morning having mockturtle and talking to patty shes not badlooking that little girl only she drops her hs so im like that fellowwhats his namein the peau de chagrin i dont admire my loves in cotton prints when she gave me the letter i left it on my dressingtable but you can see it tomorrow its a horrid red daubedlooking seal and no crest but that she mightnt use for fear of being found out and the writing is disguised but that it would be she says she has the three requisites but wheres the woman that dont think herself sappho and galatea combined and she was nineteen last march poor little devil she little thinks how shell be done im to meet her on the yarmouth road at two and to look out for a lady standing by the first milestone shall we go tom it may lead to something amusing you know though certainly it wont lead to marriage oh well go old fellow said i deuce take you belle what a lucky fellow you are with the women luckier than i want to be yawned belle its a horrid bore to be so set upon one may have too much of a good thing you know at two the day after having refreshed ourselves with a light luncheon at mrs greenes of lobstersalad and pale ale belle gower and i buttoned our gloves and rode leisurely up the road how my heart palpitates said belle stroking his moustaches with a bored air how can i tell you know but what i may be going to see the arbiter of my destiny men have been tricked into all sorts of tomfoolery by their compassionate feelings and thenif she should squint or have a turnup nose good heavens what a fearful idea ive often wondered when ive seen men with ugly wives how they could have been cheated into taking em they couldnt have done it in their senses you know nor yet with their eyes open you may depend they took em to church in a state of coma from chloroform pon my word i feel quite nervous you dont think the girl will have a parson and a register hid behind the milestone do you if she should it wont be legal without a license thanks to the fools who turn hymen into a taxgatherer and wont let a fellow make love without he asks leave of the archbishop of canterbury said gower hallo belle heres the milestone but wheres the lady virgin modesty makes her unpunctual said belle putting up his eyeglass hang modesty swore tom its past two and we left a good quarter of that salad uneaten confound her there are no signs of her said i did she tell you her dress belle not a syllable about it only mentioned a milestone and one might have found a marketwoman sitting on that hallo heres something feminine oh good gracious this cant be it its got a brown stuff dress on and a poke straw bonnet and a green veil no no belle if you married her that would be a case of chloroform but the horrible brown stuff came sidling along the road with that peculiar step belonging to ladies of a certain age characterized by patty greene as tipputting sweeping up the dust with its horrible folds making straight en route for belle who was standing a little in advance of us nineteen good heavens she must have been fifty if she was a day and under her green veil was a chestnut frontyes decidedly a frontand a face yellow as a canadians and wrinkled as madame pipelets made infinitely worse by that sweet maiden simper and assumed juvenility common to vieilles filles up she came towards poor belle who involuntarily retreated step by step till he had backed against the milestone and could get no farther while she smiled up in his handsome face and he stared down in her withered one with the most comical expression of surprise dismay and horror that had ever appeared on our beautys impassive features are youthethel c demanded the maiden of ten lustres casting her eyes to the ground with virgin modesty l c army dear madam i dont quite understand you faltered belle taken aback for once in his life was it not you faltered the fair one shaking out a pockethandkerchief that sent a horrible odor of musk to the olfactory nerves of poor belle most fastidious connoisseur in perfume who advertised for a kindred heart and sympathetic soul really my good lady began belle still too aghast by the chestnut front to recover his selfpossession because simpered his inamorata too agitated by her own feelings to hear his horrible appellative keeping him at bay there with the fatal milestone behind him and the awful brown stuff in front of himbecause i too have desired to meet with some elective affinity some spirittie that might give me all those more subtle sympathies which can never be found in the din and bustle of the heartless world i too have pined for the objects of your searchlove and domestic happiness oh blessed words surely we mightmight we not she paused overcome with maidenly confusion and buried her face in the muskscented handkerchief tom and i where we stood perdus burst into uncontrollable shouts of laughter poor belle gave one blank look of utter terror at the tout ensemble of brown stuff straw poke and chestnut front he forgot courtesy manners and everything else his lips were parted with his small white teeth glancing under his silky moustaches his sleepy eyes were open wide and as the maiden lady dropped her handkerchief and gave him what she meant to be the softest and most tender glance he turned straight round sprang on his bay and rushed down the yarmouth road as if the whole of the dignitaries of the church and law were tearing after him to force him nolens volens into carrying out the horrible promise in his cursed line in the daily what was toms and my amazement to see the maiden lady seat herself astride on the milestone and join her cachinnatory shouts to ours fling her green veil into a hawthorn tree jerk her bonnet into our faces kick off her brown stuff into the middle of the road tear off her chestnut front and yellow mask and perform a frantic wardance on the roadside turf no less a person than that mischievous monkey and inimitable mimic little nell you young demon shouted gower shrieking with laughter till he cried a pretty fellow you are to go tricking your senior officer like this you little imp how can you tell but what i shall courtmartial you tomorrow no no you wont cried little nell pursuing his frantic dance wasnt it prime wasnt it glorious wasnt it worth the kohinoor to see you wont go and peach when ive just given you a better farce than all old buckstones by jove belles face at my chestnut front thisll be one of his prime conquests eh i say old fellows when charles mathews goes to glory dont you think i might take his place and beat him hollow too when we got back to barracks we found belle prostrate on his sofa heated injured crestfallen solacing himself with seltzerandwater and swearing away anything but mildly at that wretched old woman he bound us over to secrecy which with little nells confidence in our minds we naturally promised poor belle to have been made a fool of before two was humiliation more than sufficient for our allconquering blondin for one who had so often refused to stir across a ballroom to look at a court beauty to have ridden out three miles to see an old maid of fifty with a chestnut front the insult sank deep into his soul and threw him into an abject melancholy which hung over him all through mess and was not dissipated till a letter came to him from mrs greenes when we were playing loo in fairlies room that night fairlie was in gay spirits he had called at fern chase that morning and though he had not been able to see geraldine alone he had passed a pleasant couple of hours there playing pool with her and her sisters and had been as good friends as ever with his old playmate well belle said he feeling goodnatured even with him that night did you get any good out of your advertisement did your lady turn out a very pretty one no deuced ugly like the generality yawned poor belle giving me a kick to remind me of my promise little nell was happily about the city somewhere with pretty face or the boy would scarcely have kept his countenance what amusement you can find in hoaxing silly women said fairlie is incomprehensible to me however mens tastes differ happily here comes another epistle for you belle perhaps theres better luck for you there oh i shall have no end of letters i shant answer any more i think its such a deuced trouble diamonds trumps eh said belle laying the note down till he should have leisure to attend to it poor old fellow i dare say he was afraid of another onslaught from maiden ladies come belle said glenville come belle open your letter were all impatience if you wont go i will in your place do my dear fellow take care youre not pounced down upon by a respectable papa for intentions or called to account by a fierce brother with a stubby beard said belle lazily taking up the letter as he did so the melancholy indolence on his face changed to eagerness the deuce the vane crest a note of invitation probably suggested gower would they send an invitation to patty greenes i tell you its addressed to l c said belle disdainfully opening the letter leaving its giant deer couchant intact i thought it very likely i expected it indeedpoor little dear i oughtnt to have let it out aint you jealous old fellows little darling perhaps i may be tricked into matrimony after all id rather a presentiment that advertisement would come to something there you may all look at it if you like it was a dainty sheet of scented creamlaid stamped with the deer couchant such as had brought us many an invitation down from fern chase and on it was written in delicate caligraphy g v understands the meaning of the advertisement and will meet l c at the entrance of fern wood at eleven oclock tomorrow morning there was a dead silence as we read it then a tremendous buzz cheaply as we held women i dont think there was one of us who wasnt surprised at geraldines doing any clandestine thing like this he sat with a look of indolent triumph curling his perfumed moustaches and looking at the little autograph which gave us evidence of what he often boastedgeraldine vanes regard let me look at your note said fairlie stretching out his hand he soon returned it with a brief very complimentary indeed when the men left i chanced to be last having mislaid my cigarcase as i looked about for it fairlie addressed me in the same brief stern tone between his teeth with which he spoke to belle hardinge you made this absurd bet with courtenay did you not is this note a hoax upon him not that i know ofit doesnt look like it you see there is the vane crest and the girls own initials very true he turned round to the window again and leaned against it looking out into the dawn with a look upon his face that i was very sorry to see but it is not like geraldine i began it may be a trick somebody may have stolen their paper and crestits possible i tell you what ill do to find out ill follow belle tomorrow and see who does meet him in fern wood do said fairlie eagerly then he checked himself and went on tapping an impatient tattoo on the shutter you see i have known the family for yearsknown her when she was a little child i should be sorry to think that one of them could be capable of such despite his selfcommand he could not finish his sentence geraldine was a great deal too dear to him to be treated in seeming carelessness or spoken lightly of however unwisely she might act i found my cigarcase his laconic good night told me he would rather be alone so i closed the door and left him the morning was as sultry and as clear as a july day could be when belle lounged down the street looking the perfection of a gentleman a trifle less bored and blase than ordinary en route to his appointment at fern wood a sequestered part of the vane estate where trees and lilies of the valley grew wild and where the girls were accustomed to go for picnics or sketching as soon as he had turned a corner gower and i turned it too and with perseverance worthy a better cause tom and i followed belle in and out and down the road which led to fern wooda flat dusty stony two mileson which in the blazing noon of a hot midsummer day nothing short of satanic coercion or love of geraldine vane would have induced our beauty to immolate himself and expose his delicate complexion i bet you anything tom said i confidently that this is a hoax like yesterdays geraldine will no more meet belle there than all the ordnance office well we shall see responded gower somebody might get the notepaper from the bookseller and the crest seal through the servants but theyll hardly get geraldine there bodily against her will we waited at the entrance of the wood shrouded ourselves in the wild hawthorn hedges while we could still see belleof course we did not mean to be near enough to overhear himwho paced up and down the green alleys under the firs and larches rendered doubly dark by the evergreens brambles and honeysuckles which ripened by the sun forbade the sun to enter he paced up and down there a good ten minutes prying about with his eyeglass but unable to see very far in the tangled boughs and heavy dusky light of the untrimmed wood then there was the flutter of something azure among the branches and gower gave vent to a low whistle of surprise by george hardinge theres geraldine well i didnt think shed have done it you see theyre all alike if they get the opportunity it was geraldine herselfit was her fluttering muslin her abundant folds her waving ribbons her tiny sailor hat and her little veil and under the veil her face with its delicate tinting its pencilled eyebrows and its undulating brightcolored hair there was no doubt about it it was geraldine i vow i was as sorry to have to tell it to fairlie as if id had to tell him she was dead for i knew how it would cut him to the heart to know not only that she had given herself to his rival but that his little playmate whom he had thought truth and honesty and daylight itself should have stooped to a clandestine interview arranged through an advertisement their retreating figures were soon lost in the dim woodland and tom and i turned to retrace our steps no doubt about it now old fellow quoth gower no confound her swore i confound her et pourquoi hasnt she a right to do what she likes of course she has the cursed little flirt but shed no earthly business to go making such love to fairlie its a rascally shame and i dont care if i tell her so myself shell only say youre in love with her too was gowers sensible response im not surprised myself i always said she was an outandout coquette i met fairlie coming out of his room as i went up to mine he looked as men will look when they have not been in bed all night and have watched the sun up with painful thoughts for their companions you have been he began then stopped short unwilling or unable to put the question into words after belle yes it is no hoax geraldine met him herself i did not relish telling him and therefore told it in all probability bluntly and blunderinglytact like talk having they say been given to women a spasm passed over his face herself he echoed until then i do not think he had realized it as even possible yes there was no doubt about it what a wretched little coquette she must have been she always seemed to make such game of belle but fairlie saying something about his gloves that he had left behind had gone back into his room again before i had half done my sentence when belle came back about half an hour afterwards with an affected air of triumph and for once in his life of languid sensations really well contented gower and i poured questions upon him as done up with the toil of his dusty walk and horrified to find himself so lowbred as to be hot he kicked off his varnished boots imbibed seltzer and fanned himself with a periodical before he could find breath to answer us was it geraldine of course it was geraldine he said yawning and will she marry you belle to be sure she will i should like to see the woman that wouldnt responded belle shutting his eyes and nestling down among the cushions and whats more ive been fool enough to let her make me ask her give me some more sherry phil a man wants support under such circumstances the deuce if im not as hot as a ploughboy it was very cruel of her to call a fellow out with the sun at the meridian she might as well have chosen twilight but i say you fellows keep the secret will you she dont want her family to get wind of it because theyre bothering her to marry that old cove mount trefoil with his sixty years and his broad acres and wouldnt let her take anybody else if they knew it shes under age you see but how did she know you were l c fairlie told her and the dear little vain thing immediately thought it was an indirect proposal to herself and answered it of course i didnt undeceive her she raffoles of meitll be almost too much of a good thing im afraid shes deuced prudish too much more than i should have thought shed have been but i vow shed only let me kiss her hand and that was gloved i hate prudes said gower theyve always much more devilry than the openhearted ones videlicetheres your young lady stiff enough only to give you her hand to kiss and yet shell lower herself to a clandestine correspondence and stolen interviewsa condescension i dont think i should admire in my wife love my dear fellow oversteps allwhat dye call emboundaries said belle languidly what a bore i shall never be able to wear this coat again its so ingrained with dust little puss why didnt she wait till it was cooler did you fix your marriageday asked tom rather contemptuously yes i was very weak sighed belle but you see shes uncommonly pretty and theres mount trefoil and lots of men and i fancy that dangerous fellow fairlie after her so we hurried matters weve been making love to one another all these three months you know and fixed it so soon as thursday week of course she blushed and sighed and put her handkerchief to her eyes and all the rest of it en regle but she consented and im to be sacrificed but not a word about it my dear fellows the vanes are to be kept in profoundest darkness and to lull suspicion im not to go there scarcely at all until then and when i do shell let me know when she will be out and im to call on her mother then shell write to me and put the letters in a hollow tree in the wood where im to leave my answers or rather send em catch me going over that road again dont give me joy old boys i know im making a holocaust of myself but deuce take me if i can help itshe is so deuced pretty fairlie was not at mess that night nobody knew where he was i learnt long months afterwards that as soon as i had told him of geraldines identity he still thirsting to disbelieve reluctant to condemn catching at straws to save his idol from being shattered as men in love will do had thrown himself across his horse and torn off to fern dell to see whether or no geraldine was at home his heart beat faster and thicker as he entered the drawingroom than it had done before the lines at ferozeshah or in the giant semicircle at sobraon it stood still as in the far end of the room lying back on a low chair sat geraldine her gloves and sailor hat lying on her lap she sprang up to welcome him with her old gay smile good god that a child like that can be such an accomplished actress thought fairlie as he just touched her hand have you been out today he asked suddenly you see i have prevarication is conviction thought fairlie with a deadly chill over him where did you go love asked mamma to see adela ferrers she is not well you know and i came home through part of the wood to gather some of the anemones i dont mean anemones they are overlilies of the valley she spoke hurriedly glancing at fairlie all the time who never took his iron gaze off her though all the beauty and glory was draining away from his life with every succeeding proof that stared him in the face with its cruel evidence at that minute lady vane was called from the room to give some directions to her head gardener about some flowers over which she was particularly choice and fairlie and geraldine were left in dead silence with only the ticking of the timepiece and the chirrup of the birds outside the open windows to break its heavy monotony fairlie bent over a spaniel rolling the dog backwards and forwards on the rug geraldine stood on the rug her head on one side in her old pretty attitude of plaintiveness and defiance the bright sunshine falling round her and playing on her gay dress and fair haira tableau lost upon the colonel who though he had risen too was playing sedulously with the dog colonel fairlie what is the matter with you how unkind you are today fairlie was roused at last disgusted that so young a girl could be so accomplished a liar and actress sick at heart that he had been so deceived mad with jealousy and that devil in him sent courtesy flying to the winds pardon me miss vane you waste your coquetteries on me unhappily i know their value and am not likely to be duped by them geraldines face flushed as deep a rose hue as the geraniums nodding their heads in at the windows coquetteriesduped what do you mean you know well enough what all i warn you is never try them again on menever come near me any more with your innocent smiles and your lying lips or by heaven geraldine vane i may say what i think of you in plainer words than suit the delicacy of a ladys ears geraldines eyes flashed fire from rosehued as the geraniums she changed to the dead white of the guelder roses beside them colonel fairlie you are mad i think if you only came here to insult me i had better leave i agree with you good morning wherewith fairlie took his hat and whip bowed himself out and throwing himself across his horse tore away many miles beyond norwich i should say and rode into the stableyard at twelve oclock that night his horse with every hair wringing and limb trembling at the headlong pace he had been ridden such a midnight gallop as only mazeppa or a border rider or turpin racing for his life or a man vainly seeking to leave behind him some pursuing ghost of memory or passion ever took before we saw little of him for the next few days luckily for him he was employed to purchase several strings of suffolk horses for the corps and he rode about the country a good deal and went over to newmarket and to the bury horse fair inspecting the cattle glad i dare say of an excuse to get away i feel nervous terribly nervous do give me the seltzer and hock tom they wonder at the fellows asking for beer before their execution i dont and if a fellow wants it to keep his spirits up before hes hanged he may surely want it before hes married for ones a swing and a crash and its all over and done most likely before youve time to know anything about it but the other you walk into so deliberately superintend the sacrifice of yourself as it were like that old cove seneca feel yourself rolling downhill like regulus with all the horrid nails of the domesticities pricking you in every corner see life ebbing away from you all the sunshine of life as poets have it fading sweetly but surely from your grasp and death alias the matrimonial black cap coming down ruthlessly on your devoted heads i feel lowshockingly low pass me the seltzer tom do so spake geraldines sposo that was to be on the evening before his marriageday lying on his sofa in his cashmere dressinggown his gold embroidered slippers and his velvet smokingcap puffing largely at his meerschaum and unbosoming his private sentiments and emotions to the on this score sufficiently sympathetic listeners gower and i i dont pity you said tom contemptuously who had as much disdain for a man who married as for one who bought gooseberry for champagne or cape for comet hock and did not know the differencei dont pity you one bit youve put the curb on yourself you cant complain if you get driven where you dont like but my dear fellow can one help it expostulated belle pathetically when a little winning bewitching attractive little animal like that takes you in hand and traps you as you catch a pony holding out a sieve of oats and coaxing you and sohoing you till shes fairly got the bridle over your head and the bit between your teeth what is a man to do remember that as soon as the bit is in your mouth shell never trouble herself to give you any oats or soho you softly any more but will take the whip hand of you and not let you have the faintest phantom of a will of your own ever again growled the misogamistic tom catch a mans remembering while its any use was belles very true rejoinder after hes put his hand to a little bill hell remember its a very green thing to do but he dont often remember it before i fancy no in things like this one cant help ones self ones time is come and one goes down before fate if anybody had told me that i should go as spooney about any woman as i have about that little girl geraldine id have given em the lie direct i would indeed but then she made such desperate love to me took such a deuced fancy to me you see else after all the women i might have chosenby george i wonder what lady con and the little bosanquet and poor honoria and all the rest of em will say what said gower say poor dear fellow to you and poor girl i pity her to your wife so youre going to elope with miss geraldine a mans generally too ready to marry his daughters to force a fellow to carry them off by stealth besides as bulwer says somewhere gentlemen dont run away with the daughters of gentlemen pooh nonsense alls fair in love or war returned belle going into the hock and seltzer to keep up his spirits you see shes afraid her governors mind being so set on old mount trefoil and his barons coronet they might offer some opposition put it off till she was oneandtwenty you knowand shes so distractedly fond of me poor little thing that shed die under the probation probablyand im sure i couldnt keep faithful to her for two mortal years besides theres something amusing in eloping the excitement of it keeps up ones spirits whereas if i were marched to church with so many mournersi mean groomsmeni should feel i was rehearsing my own obsequies like charles v and should funk it ten to one i should no i like eloping it gives the certain flavor of forbidden fruit which many things besides pure water want to give them a relish lets see hows the thing to be managed asked gower beyond telling me i was to go with you consigned ignominiously to the rumble to witness the ceremony im not very clear as to the programme why as soon as its dawn responded belle with leisurely whiffs of his meerschaum im to take the carriage up to the gate at fern woodthis is what she tells me in her last note she was coming to meet me but just as she was dressed her mother took her to call on some people and she had to resort to the old hollow tree the deuce is in it i think to prevent our meeting if it werent for the letters and her maid we should have been horribly put to it for communicationim to take the carriage as i say and drive up there where she and her maid will be waiting we drive away of course catch the train and cut off to town and get married at the regeneration piccadilly where a fellow i know very well will act the priestly calcraft the thing that bothers me most of all is getting up so early i used to hate it so awfully when i was a young one at the college i like to have my bath and my coffee and my paper leisurely and saunter through my dressing and get up when the days warmed for me early parades one of the crying cruelties of the service i always turn in again after it and regard it as a hideous nightmare i vow i couldnt give a greater test of my devotion than by getting up at six oclock to go after herdeuced horrible exertion im quite certain that my linen wont be aired nor my coffee fit to drink nor perkins with his eyes half open nor a quarter of his wits about him six oclock by george nothing should get me up at that unearthly hour except my dear divine delicious little demon geraldine but shes so deuced fond of me one must make sacrifices for such a little darling with which sublimely unselfish and heroic sentiment the bridegroomelect drank the last of his hock and seltzer took his pipe out of his lips flung his smokingcap lazily on to his skyes head who did not relish the attention and rose languidly to get into his undress in time for mess as belle had to get up so frightfully early in the morning he did not think it worth while to go to bed at all but asked us all to vingtetun in his room where with the rattle of halfsovereigns and the flow of rumpunch kept up his courage before the impending doom of matrimony belle was really in love with geraldine but in love in his own particular way and consoled himself for his destiny and her absence by what i dare say seems to mademoiselle fresh from her perusal of aurora leigh or lucille very material comforters indeed but if truth were told i am afraid mademoiselle would find save that from one or two fellows here and there who go in for love as they go in for pigsticking or tigerhunting with all their might and main wagering even their lives in the sport the auroras and lucilles are very apt to have their charms supplanted by the points of a favorite their absence made endurable by the aroma of turkish tobacco and their last fond admonishing words spoken with such persuasive caresses under the moonlight and the limes against those horrid cards love forgotten that very night under the glare of gas while the hands that lately held their own so tenderly clasp wellnigh with as much affection the unprecedented luck two honors and five trumps mans love is of mans life a thing apart byron was right and if we go no deeper how can it well be otherwise when we have our stud our pipe our pytchley our newmarket our club our coulisses our mabille and our epsom and theyoh heaven help themhave no distraction but a needle or a novel the fates forbid that our agremens should be less but i dare say if they had a vote in it theyd try to get a trifle more so belle put his love apart to keep or to rust whichever you please till six a m that morning when having by dint of extreme physical exertion got himself dressed saw his valet pack his things with the keenest anxiety relative to the immaculate folding of his coats and the safe repose of his shirts and at last was ready to go and fetch the bride his line in the daily had procured him as belle went down the stairs with gower who should come too with his gun in his hand his cap over his eyes and a pointer following close at his heels but fairlie going out to shoot over a friends manor of course he knew that belle had asked for and obtained leave for a couple of months but he had never heard for what purpose and possibly as he saw him at such an unusual hour going out not in his usual travelling guise of a wideawake and a maude but with a delicate lavender tie and a toilet of the most unexceptionable art the purport of his journey flashed fully on his mind for his face grew as fixed and unreadable as if he had had on the iron mask belle guessing as he did that fairlie would not have disliked to have been in his place that morning was too kindhearted and infinitely too much of a gentleman to hint at his own triumph he laughed and nodded a good morning off early you see fairlie going to make the most of my leave tisnt very often we can get one our corps is deuced stiff and strict compared to the guards and the cavalry at least our strictness keeps us from such disgraceful scenes as some of the other regiments have shown up of late answered fairlie between his teeth ah well perhaps so still strictness aint pleasant you know when ones the victim certainly not and therefore we should never be hard upon others i perfectly agree with you theres a good fellow well i must be off ive no time for philosophizing goodbye colonel goodbyea safe journey but i noticed that he held the dogs collar in one hand and the gun in the other so as to have an excuse for not offering that poignee de main which ought to be as sure a type of friendship and as safe a guarantee for good faith as the bedouin arabs salt belle nodded him a farewell and lounged down the steps and into the carriage just as fairlies man brought his mare round fairlie turned on to me with unusual fierceness for generally he was very calm and gentle and impassive in manner where is he gone i could not help but tell him reluctant though i was for i guessed pretty well what it would cost him to hear it he did not say one word while i told him but bent over marquis drawing the dogs leash tighter so that i might not see his face and without a sign or a reply he was out of the barracks across his mares back and rushing away at a mad gallop as if he would leave thought and memory and the curse of love for a worthless woman behind him for ever his man stood looking at the gun fairlie had thrown to him with a puzzled expression is the colonel gone mad i heard him say to himself the devils in it i think he used to treat his things a little carefuller than this as i live hes been and gone and broke the trigger the devil wasnt in it but a woman was an individual that causes as much mischief as any asmodeus belphegor or mephistopheles some fair unknown correspondents assured me the other day in a letter that my satire on women was a monstrous libel all i can say is that if it be a libel it is like many a one for which one pays the highest and which sounds the blackesta libel that is true while his rival rode away as recklessly as though he was riding for his life the gallant bridegroomas the court circular would have itrolled on his way to fern wood while gower very amiably occupying the rumble smoked and bore his position philosophically comforted by the recollection that geraldines french maid was an uncommonly goodlooking coquettish little person they rolled on and speedily the postilion pulled up according to order before the white fivebar gate its paint blistering in the hot summer dawn and the great fernleaves and long grass clinging up round its posts still damp with the six oclock dew five minutes passedten minutesa quarter of an hour poor belle got impatient twenty minutesfiveandtwentythirty belle couldnt stand it he began to pace up and down the turf soiling his boots frightfully with the long wet grass and rejecting all toms offers of consolation and a cigarcase confound it cried poor belle piteously i thought women were always ready to marry i know when i went to turn off lacquers of the rifles at st georges his bride had been waiting for him half an hour and was in an awful state of mind and all the other brides as well for you know they always marry first the girl that gets there first and all the other poor wretches were kept on tenterhooks too lacquers had lost the ring and found it in his waistcoat after all i say tom devil take it where can she be its forty minutes as i live we shall lose the train you know shes never prevented coming surely i think shed let me hear dont you she could send justine to me if she couldnt come by any wretched chance good heavens tom what shall i do wait and dont worry was toms laconic and commonsense advice about the most irritating probably to a lovers feelings that could pretty well be imagined belle swore at him in stronger terms than he generally exerted himself to use but was pulled up in the middle of them by the sight of geraldine and justine followed by a boy bearing his brides dainty trunks on came geraldine in a travellingdress justine following after her with a brilliant smile that showed all her white teeth at monsieur torm for whom she had a very tender friendship consolidated by certain halfsovereigns and french phrases whispered by gower after his dinners at fern chase belle met geraldine with all that tender empressement which he knew well how to put into his slightest actions but the young lady seemed already almost to have begun repenting her hasty step she hung her head down she held a handkerchief to her bright eyes and to belles tenderest and most ecstatic whispers she only answered by a convulsive pressure of the arm into which he had drawn her left hand and a halfsmothered sob from her hearts depths belle thought it all natural enough under the circumstances he knew women always made a point of impressing upon you that they are making a frightful sacrifice for your good when they condescend to accept you and he whispered what tender consolation occurred to him as best fitted for the occasion thanked her of course for all the rapture c c assured her of his lifelong devotionyou know the styleand lifted her into the carriage geraldine only responding with broken sighs and stifled sobs the boxes were soon beside belles valises justine soon beside gower the postilion cracked his whip over his outsider perkins refolded his arms and the carriage rolled down the lane gower was very well contented with his seat in the rumble justine was a very dainty little frenchwoman with the smoothest hair and the whitest teeth in the world and she and monsieur torm were eminently good friends as i have told you though today she was very coquettish and wilful and laughed a propos de bottes at gower say what chaumiere compliments he might ma chere et charmante petite expostulated tom tes moues mutines sont ravissantes mais je tavoue que je prefere tes taistoi becasse cried justine giving him a blow with her parasol and going off into what she would have called eclats de rire mais ecoutemoi justine whispered tom piqued by her perversity je raffole de toi je tadore sur ma parole jehallo what the devils the matter good gracious deuce take it well might tom call on his satanic majesty to explain what met his eyes as he gave vent to all three ejaculations and maledictions no less a sight than the carriagedoor flying violently open belle descending with a violent impetus his face crimson and his hat in his hand clearing the hedge at a bound plunging up to his ankles in mud on the other side of it and starting across country at the top of his speed rushing frantically straight over the heavy grassland as if he had just escaped from hanwell and the whole hue and cry of keepers and policemen was let loose at his heels good heavens by jove belle belle i say stop are you mad whats happened whats the row i saythe devil but to his coherent but very natural exclamations poor tom received no answer justine was screaming with laughter the postilion was staring perkins swearing belle flying across the country at express speed rapidly diminishing into a small black dot in the green landscape while from inside the carriage from geraldine from the deserted bride peals of laughter loud long and uproarious rang out in the summer stillness of the early morning by jupiter but this is most extraordinary the deuce is in it are they both gone stark staring mad asked tom of his cuba or the blackbirds or the hedgecutter afar off or anything or anybody that might turn out so amiable as to solve his problem for him no reply being given him however tom could stand it no longer down he sprang jerked the door open again and put his head into the carriage hallo old boy done green eh pity tisnt the st of april cried geraldine with renewed screams of mirth from the interior eh what what did you say miss vane ejaculated gower fairly staggered by this extraordinary answer of a young girl a lady and a forsaken bride what did i say my dear fellow why that youre done most preciously and that i fancy itll be a deuced long time before your delectable friend tries his hand at matrimony again thats all done oh by george he is done and no mistake look at me sir aint i a charming bride with which elegant language geraldine took off her hat pulled down some false braids pushed her hair off her forehead shook her head like a waterdog after a bath and grinned in gowers astonished eyesnot geraldine but her twinbrother pretty face do you know me now old boy asked the etonian with demoniacal delightdo you know me now havent i chiselled himhavent i tricked himhavent i done him as green as young gooseberries and as brown as that bag do you fancy hell boast of his conquests again or advertise for another wife so you didnt know how i got gary clements of the ten bells to write the letters for me and justine to dress me in geraldines things you know they always did say they couldnt tell her from me ive proved it now ehrather oh by george i never had a better luck and not a creature guesses it not a soul save justine nell and i by jupiter gower if youd heard that unlucky belle go on swearing devotion interminable and enough love to stock all mudies novels but i never dare let him kiss me though my beard is down confound it oh what jolly fun its been gower no words can tell i always said he shouldnt marry her hell hardly try to do it now i fancy what a lark its been i couldnt have done it you know without that spicy little french girlshe did my hair and got up my crinoline and stole geraldines dress and tricked me up altogether and carried my notes to the hollow oak and took all my messages to belle oh jupiter what fun its been if belle isnt gone clean out of his senses its very odd to me when he was going to kiss me and whispered my dearest my darling my wife i just took off my hat and grinned in his face and said aint this a glorious go oh by george gower i think the fun will kill me and the wicked little dog of an etonian sank back among the carriage cushions stifled with his laughter gower staggered backwards against a roadside tree and stood there with his lips parted and his eyes wide open bewildered more than that cool hand had ever been in all his days by the extraordinary finish of poor belles luckless wooing the postilion rolled off his saddle in cachinnatory fits at the little monkeys narrative perkins like a soldier as he was utterly impassive to all surrounding circumstances shouldered a valise and dashed at quick march after his luckless master justine clapped her plump frenchgloved fingers with a million ma fois and mon dieus and o ciels and far away in the gray distance sped the retreating figure of poor belle with the license in one pocket and the weddingring in the other flying as if his life depended on it from the shame and the misery and the horror of that awful sell drawn on his luckless head by that illfated line in the daily while belle drove to his hapless wooing fairlie galloped on and on where he went he neither knew nor cared he had ridden heedlessly along and the grey left to her own devices had taken the road to which her head for the last four months had been so often turnedthe road leading to fern chaseand about a mile from the vane estate lost her left hindshoe and came to a dead stop of her own accord after having been ridden for a couple of hours as hard as if she had been at the grand military fairlie threw himself off the saddle and leaving the bridle loose on the mares neck who he knew would not stray a foot away from him he flung himself on the grass under the cool morning shadows of the roadside trees no sound in the quiet country round him breaking in on his weary thoughts till the musical ring of a ponys hoofs came pattering down the lane he never heard it however nor looked up till the quick trot slackened and then stopped beside him colonel fairlie good heavens geraldine well she said with tears in her eyes and petulant anger in her voice so you have never had the grace to come and apologize for insulting me as you did last week for mercys sake do not trifle with me trifle no indeed interrupted the young lady your behavior was no trifle and it will be a very long time before i forgive it if ever i do staywait a moment how can you ask me when five days ago you bid me never come near you with my cursed coquetries again asked geraldine trying and vainly to get the bridle out of his grasp god forgive me i did not know what i said what i had heard was enough to madden a colder man than i is it untrue is what untrue you know well enough answer me is it true or not how can i tell what you mean you talk in enigmas let me go i will never let you go till you have answered me how can i answer you if i dont know what you mean retorted geraldine half laughing do not jest tell me yes or no are you going to marry that cursed fool what cursed fool your language is not elegant colonel fairlie said geraldine with demure mischief belle would you have met him did you intend to elope with him geraldines eyes always large enough grew larger and a darker blue still in extremest astonishment belleelope with him what are you dreaming are you mad almost said fairlie recklessly have you misled him thentricked him do you care nothing for him answer me for heavens sake geraldine i know nothing of what you are talking said geraldine with her surprised eyes wide open still oblige me by leaving my ponys head i shall be too late home you never answered his advertisement then the very question insults me let my pony go you never met him in fern woodnever engaged yourself to himnever corresponded with him colonel fairlie you have no earthly right to put such questions to me interrupted geraldine with her hot geranium color in her cheeks and her eyes flashing fire i honor the report whoever circulated it far more than it deserves by condescending to contradict it have the kindness to unhand my pony and allow me to continue my ride you shall not go said fairlie as passionately as she till you have answered me one more question can you will you ever forgive me no said geraldine with an impatient shake of her head but a smile nevertheless under the shadow of her hat not if you know it was jealousy of him which maddened me love for you which made me speak such unpardonable words to younot if i tell you how perfect was the tale i was told so that there was no link wanting no room for doubt or hopenot if i tell you what tortures i had endured in losing youwhat bitter punishment i have already borne in crediting the report that you were secretly engaged to my rivalwould you not forgive me then no whispered the young lady perversely but smiling still the geraniums brighter in her cheeks and her eyes fixed on the bridle fairlie dropped the reins let go her hand and left her free to ride if she would away from him will you leave me geraldine not for this morning only remember nor for today nor for this year butfor ever no it was a very different no this time will you forgive me then my darling her fingers clasped his hand closely and geraldine looked at him from under her hat her eyes so like an april day with their tears and their tender and mischievous smile were so irresistibly provocative that fairlie took his pardon for granted and thanked her in the way that seemed to him at once most eloquent and most satisfactory if you wish to know what became of belle he fled across the country to the railway station and spent his leave heaven knows wherein sackcloth and ashes i supposemeditating on his frightful sell we saw nothing more of him he could hardly show in norwich again with all his laurels tumbled in the dust and his trophies of conquest laughingstocks for all the troop he exchanged into the z battery going out to india and i never saw or heard of him till a year or two ago when he landed at portsmouth a much wiser and pleasanter man the lesson joined to the late campaign under sir colin had done him a vast amount of good he had lost his conceit his vanity his affectation and was what nature meant him to bea sensible goodhearted fellow as luck would have it pretty face who had joined the eleventh was there too and fairlie and his wife as well and belle had the good sense to laugh it over with them assuring geraldine however that no one had eclipsed the g v whom he had once hoped had answered his memorable advertisement he has grown wiser and makes a jest of it now it may be a sore point still i cannot saynobody sees it but whether or no in the old city of norwich and in our corps from cadets to colonels nobody forgets the line in the daily who did it and who was done by it holly wreaths and rose chains holly wreaths and rose chains i the colonel of the white favors and cecil st aubyn what are you going to do with yourself this christmas old fellow said vivian of the th hussars the white favors we call them because after edgehill henriette maria gave their colonel a white rosette off her own dress to hang to his swordknot and all the th have like ribbons to this day if youve nothing better to do continued their present lieutenantcolonel come down with me to deerhurst the governorll be charmed to see you my mother has always some nicelooking girls there and as we keep the hounds i can promise you some good hunting with the harkaway i shall be delighted said i who being in the lancers had been chained by the leg at kensington the whole year and of all the woes the most pitiable had not been able to get leave for either the th or the st but while my chums were shooting among the turnips or stalking royals in blackmount forest i had been tied to town a solitary unit in pallmall standing on the forsaken steps of the u s or pacing my hack through the dreary desert of hyde parklike macaulays new zealander gazing on the ruins of london bridge very well continued vivian come down with me next week and you can send your horses with steevens and my stud the governor could mount you well enough but i never hunt with so much pleasure as when im on qui vive so i dare say you like me prefer your own horses i only hope we shant have a confounded black frost but we must take our chance of the weather i think youll like my sisters theyre just about half my age lots of children came in between but were providentially nipped in the bud are they pretty cant say really im too used to them to judge i cant make love to them so i never took the trouble to criticise them but weve always been a goodlooking race i believe i tell you whos staying therethat girl we met in toronto do you remember hercecil st aubyn i should say i did how did she get here shes come to live with her aunt mrs coverdale you know that overdressed widow who lives in hyde park gardens and when she cant afford brighton shuts the front shutters lives in the back drawingroom and says not at home to callers st aubyn is as poor as a rat so i suppose he was glad to send cecil here and the coverdale likes to have somebody wholl draw men to her parties which im sure her champagne will never do its the most unblushing gooseberry ever ticketed veuve clicquot pon my life im delighted to hear it said i the st aubyns superb eyes will make the gooseberry go down men in canada would have swallowed caskwashings to get a single waltz with her all toronto went mad on that score you admired her too old fellow only you werent with her long enough for such a stoic as you are to boil up into anything warmer oh yes i thought her extremely pretty but i thought her a little flirt nevertheless stuff an attractive girl cant make herself ugly or disagreeable or erect a brick wall round herself with iron spikes on the top for fear through looking at her any fellow might come to grief the men followed her and she couldnt help that and she encouraged them and she could help that however i dont wish to speak against her its nothing to me how she kills and slays provided im not among the bag take care you dont get shot yourself ned keep your counsel for your own use syd you put me in mind of the philanthropist who ran to warn his neighbor of the dangers of soot while his own chimney was on fire as how i dont quite see the point of your parable said vivian with an expression of such innocent impassiveness that one would have thought he had never seen her fair face out of her furs in her sledge or admired her small ankles when she was skating on the ontario the winter before a brother of mine who was out there in the rifles wrote and asked me to go and have some buffalohunting and vivian went out with me for a couple of months we had some very good sport in the western woods and plains and his elk and bison horns are still stuck up in vivians rooms at uxbridge with many another trophy of both hemispheres we had sport of another kind too to the merry music of the silvery sledgebells over the crisp snow and the gleaming ice while bright eyes shone on us under delicate lace veils and little feet peeped from under heaps of sable and bearskin and gay voices rang out in wouldbe fear when the horses shied at the shadow of themselves or at the moon shining on the ice who thinks of canada without in fancy hearing the ringing chimes of the gay sledge bells swinging joyous measure into the clear sunshine or the white moonlight in tune with light laughter and soft whispers and careless hearts there we saw cecil st aubyn one of the prettiest girls in toronto then about nineteen my brother harry was mad about her so were almost all the men in the canada rifles and engineers and st that were quartered there and vivian admired her too though in a calmer sort of way perhaps if he had been with her more than a fortnight he might have gone further as it was he left toronto liking her long canadian eyes no more than was pleasant it was as well so perhaps for it would not have been a good match for him st aubyn being a brokendown gambler who having lost a princely fortune at crockys and the bads married at fifty a widow with a little money and migrated to toronto where he was a torment to himself and to everybody else vivian meanwhile was a great matrimonial coup coming of a high county family and being the only son of course there was priceless value set on his life which equally of course he imperilled after the manner of us all in every way he couldin charges and skirmishes yachting hunting and steeplechasingever since some twoandtwenty years ago he joined as a cornet of fifteena man already in muscle and ideas pleasures and pursuits at the present time he had been tranquilly engaged in the house as he represented the borough of cacklebury he spoke seldom but always well and was thought a very promising member his speeches being in bernal osbornes style but he himself cared little about his senatorial laurels and was fervently hoping that there would be a row with russia and that we should be allowed to go and stick croats and make love to bayaderes to freshen us up and make us boys again next week the first in december he and i drove to paddington put ourselves in the express and whisked through the snowcovered embankments whitened fields and holly hedges on the line down to deerhurst if the frost broke up we should have magnificent runs and we looked at the country with a longing eye ever since he was six years old he told me he had gone out with the harkaway hack on christmaseve when the drag met us with the four bays steaming in the night air and the groom warming into a smile at the sight of the colonel the sleet was coming down heavily and the wind blew as keen as a sabres edge the bays dashed along at a furious gallop under vivians hand the frosty road cracked under the wheel the leaders breath was white in the misty night we soon flew through the park gatethough he didnt forget to throw down a sovereign on the snow for the old porteressand up the leafless avenue and bright and cheery the old manorhouse with its score of windows like so many bright eyes looked out upon the winters night by george we did that four miles quick enough said vivian jumping down and shaking the snow off his hair and mustaches the old place looks cheery doesnt it ah there are the girls theyre sure to pounce on me the two girls in question having warm hearts not spoilt by the fashionable world they live in darted across the hall and regardless of the snow welcomed him ardently they were proud of him for he is a handsome dog with haughty aristocratic features and a grand air as stately as a noble about versailles in the polished age dore he shook himself free and went forward to meet his mother whom he is very fond of while the governor a finelooking genial old fellow bade me welcome to deerhurst in the library door i caught sight of a figure in white that i recognised as our belle of the sledge drives she was looking at vivian as he bent down to his mother as soon as she saw me though she disappeared and he and i went up to our rooms to thaw and dress for dinner by the fire talking to blanche vivian stood cecil when we went down to the drawingroom she always makes me think of a sevres or dresden figure her coloring is so delicate and yet brilliant and if you were to see her canadian eyes her waving chestnut hair and her instantaneous radiant coquettish smiles you would not wonder at the toronto men losing their heads about her why cecil you never told me you knew sydney cried blanche as vivian shook hands with the st aubyn where did you meet him how long have you been acquainted why did you never tell me how could i tell colonel vivian was your brother said cecil playing with a little silver cupid driving a barrowful of matches on the mantelpiece till she tumbled all his matches into the fender you might have asked never mind the waxlights said blanche who not having been long out had a habit of saying anything that came into her head when did you see him tell me sydney if she wont oh in canada dear interrupted cecil quickly but it was for so short a time i should have thought colonel vivian would have forgotten my face and name and existence nay miss st aubyn said vivian smiling pardon me but i think you must know your own power too well to think that any man who has seen you once could hope for his own peace to forget you the words of course were flattering but his quizzical smile made them doubtful cecil evidently took them as satire at least youve forgotten anything we talked about at toronto she said rather impatiently for i remember telling you i detested compliments i shouldnt have guessed it murmured vivian stroking his mustaches and you cecil went on regardless of the interruption told me you never complimented any woman you respected so that speech just now doesnt say much for your opinion of me how dare i begin to like you laughed vivian dont you know levinge and castlereagh were great friends of mine poor fellows the sole object of their desires now is six feet of crimean sod if were lucky enough to get out there cecil colored levinges and castlereaghs hard drinking and gloomy aspect at mess were popularly attributed to the witchery of the st aubyn canada while she was in it was as fatal to the service as the cape or the cholera if i talked so romantically colonel vivian with what superb mockery you would curl your mustaches surely the iron hand wasnt that your sobriquet in caffreland does not believe in broken hearts perhaps not but i do believe in some peoples liking to try and break them so do i it is a favorite pastime with your sex said cecil beating the hearthrug impatiently with her little satin shoe i dont think we often attack laughed vivian we sometimes yield out of amiability and we sometimes take out the foils in selfdefence though we are no match for those delicate hands that use their damascus blades so skilfully we soon learn to cry quarter to a dozen different conquerors in as many months then cried cecil with a defiant toss of her head vivian looked down on her as a newfoundland might look down on a small and impetuousminded king charles who is hoping to irritate him just then three other people staying there came in a fat old dowager and a thin daughter who had turquoise eyes and from whom being a great pianist we all fled in mortal terror of a hailstorm of thalberg and hertz and a cousin of syds cossetting a young chap a blondin with fair curls parted down the centre whose brains were small hands like a girls and thoughts centred on dew bouquets and his own beauty but who having a baronetcy with much tin was strongly set upon by the turquoise eyes but appeared himself to lean more towards the canadian as a greater contrast to himself i suppose how do you do cos said vivian carelessly the iron hand very naturally scorned this effeminate patte de velours you here lisped the baronet delighted to see you thought youd killed yourself over a fence or something before this why horace burst in energetic little blanche i have told you for the last month that he was coming down for christmas did you my dear child said cos pon my life i forgot it miss st aubyn my man cleante hes the handiest doghe once belonged to the duc daumale has just discovered something quite newtheres no perfume like it he calls it fleurs des tilleuls and the best of it is nobody can have it if youll allow me everybody seems to make it their duty to forget sydney muttered blanche as the baronet murmured the rest of his speech inaudibly never mind petite i can bear it laughed vivian leaning against the mantelpiece with that look of quiet strength characteristic of both his mind and body cecil overheard the whisper and flushed a quick look at him then turning to cossetting talked over the fleurs des tilleuls as if her whole mind was absorbed in bouquet when dinner was announced vivian troubled himself however to give his arm to cecil and tossing his head back in the direction of the turquoise eyes said to the discomfited horace you sing dont you cosset miss screechington will bore you less than she would me is it then because i bore you less that you do me the honor asked cecil quickly yes said syd calmly or rather to put it more courteously you amuse me more monseigneur je vous remercie said cecil her long almond eyes sparkling dangerously you promote me to the same rank with an opera a hookah a rathunt and a french novel and vivian went on tranquilly i dare say i shall amuse you better than that poor little fool with his lisp and his talk of the toilet and his hands that never pulled in a thoroughbred or aided a rowing match oh were not in the iliad and odyssey days to deify physical strength said cecil who secretly adored it as all women do nor yet among the pawnees to reverence a man according to his scalps though sir horace may not have followed your example and jeopardised his life on every possible occasion he is very handsome and can be very agreeable is it possible you can endure that fop said vivian quickly certainly why not the colonel stroked his moustache contemptuously i should have fancied you more difficile that is all but cos is as you say goodlooking and very well off i wish what that you were less bored that i always wish but i was thinking of cos theremilkposset as little eardley in the troop says they called him at etoni was wishing he could see levinge and castlereagh just as epouvantails to make him turn and flee as the french noblesse did when they saw their cousins and brothers strung up a la lanterne wasnt it very strange blanche was saying to me at the same time that cecil never mentioned sydney ive so often spoken of him told her his troop and all about him he has always been so kind to me though he is eighteen years olderjust twice my age besides i found her one day looking at his picture in the gallery so she must have known it was the same colonel vivian mustnt she captain thornton i should say so have you known her long no we met her at brighton this august with that silly woman mrs coverdale all her artifices and falsehoods annoy cecil so cecil doesnt mind saying shes not rich she knows its no crime cest pire quun crime cest une faute said i dont talk in that way laughed blanche thats bitter and sarcastic like sydney in his grand moods when im half afraid of him i am sure cecil couldnt be nicer if she were ever such an heiress mamma asked her for christmas because she once knew mr st aubyn well and cecil is not happy with mrs coverdale false and true dont suit each other i hope sydney will like herdo you think he does that was a question i could not answer he admired her of course because he could not well have helped it and had done so in canada and he was talking to her now i dare say to force her to acknowledge that he was more amusing than horace cos but he seemed to me to weigh her in a criticising balance as if he expected to find her wantingas if it pleased him to provoke and correct her as one pricks and curbs a beautiful twoyear old just to see its graceful impatience at the check and the glance of its wild eye ii the canadians cold bath warms up the colonel deerhurst was a capital house to spend a christmas in it was the house of an english gentleman with even the dens called bachelors rooms comfortable and luxurious to the last extent a firstrate stud a capital billiard table a good sporting country pretty girls to amuse one with when tired of the pink the best chablis and chateau margaux to be had anywhere and a host who would have liked a hundred people at his dinnertable the whole year round the snow confound it prevented our taking the hounds out for the first few days but we were not bored as one might have expected and our misery was the girls delight who were fervently hoping that the ice might come thick enough for them to skate cecil was invaluable in a countryhouse her resources were as unlimited as houdins inexhaustible bottle she played in french vaudevilles and sheridan knowless comedies acted charades planned tableaux vivants sang gay wild chansons peculiar to herself that made the screechington bravuras and themes more insupportable than ever and what was more managed to infuse into everybody else some of her own energy and spirit she made every one do as she liked but she tyrannised over us so charmingly that we never chafed at the bit and to the other girls she was so goodnatured in giving them the roles they liked in praising and in aiding them that it was difficult for feminine malice though its limits are boundless to find fault with her vivian though he did not relax his criticism of her was agreeable to her as he had been in canada and as he is always to women when he is not too lazy he consented to stand for rienzi in a tableau though he hates doing all those things and played in the proverbs with such a flashing fire of wit in answer to cecil that we told him he beat mathews im inspired he said with a laughing bend of his head to cecil when somebody complimented him she gave an impatient movementshe was accustomed to have such things whispered in earnest not in jest she laughed however are you inspired then to take huons part all the characters are cast but that im afraid i cant play well enough nonsense you cannot think that say you would rather not at once vivian stroked his mustaches thoughtfully well you see it bores me rather and im not christian enough to suffer ennui cheerfully to please other people very well then i will give the part to sir horace said cecil looking through the window at the church spire covered with the confounded snow vivian stroked away at his mustaches rather fiercely this time cos hell ruin the play dress him up as a lord in waiting hell be a dainty lay figure but for anything more hes not as fit as this setter fancy that essenced fairhaired young idiot taking huonhis lisp would be so effective she looked up in his face with one of her mischievous dangerous smiles and put up her hands in an attitude of petition he must have the part if you wont be good and dont spoil the play i have set my mind on its being perfect andi will have such a dress as the countess if you will only do as i tell you cecil in her soft childlike moods could finish any man of course vivian rehearsed love with her that afternoon a play that was to come off on the rd cos sulked slightly at being commanded by her to dress himself beautifully and play the prince of milan to be refused by you lisped horace oh i dare say no pon my life my dear cos youll have plenty of fellowsufferers whispered syd mischievously do you dare to disobey me sir horace cried cecil for shame i should have thought you more of a preux chevalier if you dont order over from boxwood that suit of milan armor you say one of your ancestors wore at flodden and wear it on tuesday you shall never waltz with me again now what do you say nobody can rethitht you murmured cos you do anything with a fellow that you chooth vivian glanced down at him with superb scorn and turned to me what a confounded frost this is the weathercock sticks at the north and old ben says theres not a chance of a change till the new moon qui vive might as well have kept at hounslow to waste all the season like this would make a parson swear if id foreseen it i would have gone to paris with lovell as he wanted me to do i suppose the colonel was piqued to find he was not the only one persuaded into his role he bent over laura caldecotts chair a pretty girl but with nothing to say for herself admired her embroidery and talked with great empressement about it till laura much flattered at such unusual attention after lisping a good deal of nonsense finally promised to embroider a notecase for him if youll be good and use it and not throw it away as you naughty men always do the pretty things we give you simpered miss laura hearts included said syd smiling i assure you if you give me yours i will prize it with turkish jealousy the fair brodeuse gave a silly laugh and vivian whose especial detestation is this sort of lovemaking nonsense went on flirting with her talking the persiflage that one whispers leaning over the back of a phaeton after a dinner at the castle or a day at ascot but never expects to be called to remember the next morning when one bows to the object thereof in the ring and the flavor of the claretcup and the scent of the cigar are both fled with the moonbeams and forgotten cecil gave the colonel and his flirtation a glance and let cossetting lean over the back of her chair and deliver himself of some lackadaisical sentiment taken secondhand out of isidora or the amant de la lune and diluted to be suitable for presentation to her looking up at him with her large velvet eyes or flashing on him her radiant smile till horace pulled up his little stiff collar coaxed his flaxen whiskers looked at her with his halfclosed light eyesand thought himself irresistibleand miss screechington broke the string of the purse she was making and scattered all the steel beads about the floor in the futile hope of gaining his attention blanche went down on her knees and spent twenty minutes hunting them all up but as i helped her i saw the turquoise eyes looked anything but grateful for our efforts though if blanche had done anything for me with that ready kindness and those soft little white hands i should have repaid her very warmly but oh these women these women do they ever love one another in their hearts does not chloris always swear that lelias gazelle eyes have a squint in them and delia hint that daphne who is innocent as a dove is bad style and horridly bold at last cecil got tired of coss drawling platitudes and walked up to one of the windows how is the ice will anybody tell me i am wild to try it aint you blanche if we are kept waiting much longer we will have the carpets up and skate on the oak floors i told her i thought they might try it safely then let us go after luncheon shall we said cecil it is quite sunny now you skate of course sir horace oh to be surecertainly murmured cos wed a quadrille on the serpentine last february talbot and i and some other menlots of people said they never saw it better done but its rather colddont you think so do you expect to find ice in warm weather said vivian curtly from the fire where he was standing watching the commencement of the notecase no but i hate cold said horace looking at his snowy fingers one looks such a figureblue and wet and shivering the house is much the best place in a frost poor fellow said vivian with a contemptuous twist of his mustaches i fear however fete you may be in every other quarter the seasons wont change to accommodate you oh you are a dreadful man drawled cos you dont a bit mind tanning yourself nor getting drenched through nor soiling your hands thank heaven no responded syd im neither a schoolgirl nora fop would you believe it miss st aubyn said the baronet appealingly that manll get up before daylight and let himself be drenched to the skin for the chance of playing a pike and will turn out of a comfortable armchair on a winters night just to go after poachers and knock a couple of men over and think it the primest fun in life i dont understand it myself do you yes said cecil fervently i delight in a mans love for sport for i idolise horses and there is nothing that can beat a canter on a fine fresh morning over a grass country and i believe that a man who has the strength and nerve and energy to go thoroughly into fishing or shooting or whatever it be will carry the same will and warmth into the rest of his life and the hand that is strong in the field and firm in righteous wrath will be the truer in friendship and the gentler in pity cecil spoke with energetic enthusiasm horace stared the screechington sneered laura gave an affected little laugh the colonel swung round from his study of the fire his face lighting up ive seen syd on occasion look as soft as a woman however he said nothing he only took her in to luncheon and was exceedingly kind to her and oblivious of laura caldecotts existence throughout that meal which at deerhurst was of unusual splendor and duration and afterwards when she had arrayed herself in a hat with soft curling feathers and looped up her dress in some inexplicable manner that showed her dainty high heels artistically he took her little skates in his hand and walked down by her side to the pond it was some way to the ponda good sized piece of water that snobs would have called the lake by way of dignifying their possessions with willows on its banks where in summer the sentimental screechington would have reclined tennyson a la main and boats and punts beside it among which was a tub in which blanche confessed to me she had paddled herself across to the saturation of a darling blue muslin and the agonised feelings of her governess only twelve months before a dreadful stiff old thing that governess was said blanche looking affectionately at the tub do you know captain thornton when she went away and i saw her boxes actually on the carriagetop i waltzed round the schoolroom seven times and burnt noel et chapsal in the firei did indeed the way as i say was long to the pond and as cecils dainty high heels and syds swinging cavalry strides kept pace over the snow together they had plenty of time for conversation miss caldecott is looking for you said cecil with a contemptuous glance at the fair laura who between two young dandies was picking her route over the snow holding her things very high indeed and casting back looks at the colonel is she it is very kind of her if you feel the kindness so deeply you had better repay it by joining her vivian laughed not just now thank you we are close to the kennelshark at their bay would you like to come and see them bytheby how is your wolfdogleatherstockings didnt you call him do you remember him said cecil her eyes beaming and her lips quivering dear old dog i loved him so much and he loved me he was bitten by an asp just before i left and papa would have him shot good gracious what is the mattershe is actually frightened at that setter the she of whom cecil so disdainfully spoke was miss caldecott who on seeing a large setter leap upon her with muddy paws and much sudden affection began to scream and rushed to vivian with a beseeching cry of save me save me cecil stood and laughed and called the setter to her here dondashwhat is your name come here good dog that poor young lady has nerves and you must not try them or you will cause her endless expenses in sal volatile and ether but i have no such interesting weaknesses and you may lavish any demonstrations you please on me we all laughed as she thus talked confidentially to the setter holding his feathered paws against her waist while vivian stood by her with admiration in his glance poor laura looked foolish and began to caress a great bulldog who snapped at her she hadnt cecils ways either with dogs or men what a delightful scene whispered cecil to the colonel as we left the kennels you were not half so touched by it as you were expected to be vivian laughed didnt you effectually destroy all romantic effect you can be very mischievous to your enemies cecil colored she is no enemy of mine i know nothing of her but i do detest that mock sentimentality that wouldbe fine ladyism that thinks it looks interesting when it pleads guilty to sal volatile and screams at an honest dogs bark did you see how shocked she and miss screechington looked because i let the hounds leap about me of course but though you have not lived very long you must have learned that you are too dangerous to the peace of our sex to expect much mercy from your own a flush came into cecils cheeks not brought by the wind her feathers gave a little dance as she shook her head with her customary action of annoyance ah never compliment me i am so tired of it i wish i could believe that said syd in a low tone your feelings are warm your impulses frank and true it were a pity to mar them by an undue love for the flattering voices of emptyheaded fools tears of pleasure started into her eyes but she would not let him see it she had not forgotten the caldecott flirtation of the morning enough to resist revenging it she looked up with a merry laugh je mamusevoila tout there is no great harm in it a shadow of disappointment passed over syds haughty face no if you do not do it once too often i have known menand women toowho all their lives through have been haunted by the memory of a slight word a careless look with which unwittingly or in obstinacy they shut the door of their own happiness have you ever heard of the deerhurst ghost no said cecil softly tell it me it is a short story do you know that picture of muriel vivian the girl with the hawk on her wrist and long hair of your color she lived in charless time and was a great beauty at the court there were many who would have lived and died for her but the one who loved her best was her cousin guy the story says that she had plighted herself to him in these very woods at any rate he followed her when she went to join the court and she kept him on luring him with vague promises and flirting with goring and francis egerton and all the other gay gentlemen one night his endurance broke down he asked her whether or no she cared for him he begged as a sign for the rosebud she had in her dress she laughed at him andgave the flower to harry carrew a young fellow in lunsfords babeeaters guy said no more and left her before dawn he shot carrew through the heart took the rosebud from the boys doublet put it in his own breast and fell upon his sword they say muriel lost her senses i dont believe it no coquette ever had so much feeling but if you ask the old servants they will tell you and firmly credit the story too that hers and guy vivians ghosts still are to be seen every midnight at christmaseve the day that he fought and killed little harry carrew he laughed but cecil shuddered what a horrible story but do you believe that any woman ever possessed such power over a man i believe it since i have seen it one of my best friends is now hopelessly insane because a woman as worthless as this dead branch forsook him poor fellow they set it down to a coup de soleil but it was the falsehood of emily rushbrooke that did it but for myself i never should lose my head for any woman i did once when i was a boy but i know better now a wild desperate idea came into cecils mind she contrasted the passionless calm of his face with the tender gentleness of his tone a few moments ago and she would have given her life to see him lose his head for her as he had done for that other how she hated her whoever she had been cecil had seen too many men not to know that syds cool exterior covered a stormy heart and in the longing to rouse up the storm at her incantation she resolved to play a dangerous game the ghost story did not warn her as mephistopheles to faust came horace cos to aid the impulse and cecil turned to him with one of her radiant smiles she never looked prettier than in her black hat the wind had only blown a bright flush into her cheeksthough it had turned laura blue and the screechington redand the colonel looked up at her as he put her skates on with something of the look guy might have given muriel vivian flirting gaily with the roistering cavaliers now sir horace show us some of those wonderful serpentine figures cried cecil balancing herself with the grace of a curlew and whirling here there and everywhere at her will as easily as if she were on a chalked ballroom floor she hadnt skated and sledged on the ontario for nothing more than one man had lost his own balance looking after her cos wasnt started yet one pair of skates were too large another pair too small if hed thought of it hed have had his own sent over he stood on the brink much as winkle of pickwickian memory trembled in wellers grasp cecil looked at him with laughing eyes a shrewd suspicion that he had planted her adorer and that the quadrille on the serpentine was an offspring of the cossetting poetic fancy thrice did the luckless baronet essay the ice and thrice did he come to grief with heels in the air and his dainty apparel disordered at last his canadian sorceress took compassion upon him and declaring she was tired asked him to drive her across the pond cos with an air of languid martyrdom and a heavy sigh as he glanced at his houbigants torn and soiled grasped the back of the chair and actually contrived to start it once started away went the chair and its phaeton after it whether he would or no its occupant looking up and laughing in the dandys heated disconcerted and anxious face all at once there was a crash a plunge and a shout from vivian who was on the opposite bank the chair had broken the ice flung cecil out into the water with the shock while her charioteer by a lucky jump backwards had saved himself and stood on the brink of the chasm unharmed cecils crinoline kept her from sinking she stretched out her little hand with a cryit sounded like vivians name as it came to my ears on the keen north windbut before vivian who came across the ice like a whirlwind could get to her cos valorously determining to wet his wristbands stooped down and holding by the chair which was firmly wedged in put his arm round her and dragged her out vivian came up two seconds too late are you hurt he said bending towards her no said cecil faintly as her head drooped unconsciously on coss shoulder she had struck her forehead on the ice which had stunned her slightly the colonel saw the chestnut hair resting against coss arm he dropped the hand he had taken and turned to the shore bring her to the bank he said briefly i will go home and send a carriage good heavens that that fool should have saved her i heard him mutter as he brushed past me he drove the carriage down himself and under pretext of holding on the horses did not descend from the box while horace wrapped rugs and cloaks round cecil who having more pluck than strength declared she was quite well now but nearly fainted when horace lifted her out and she was consigned by mrs vivian to her bedroom for the rest of the day it is astonishing how we miss cecil remarked blanche at dinner isnt it dull without her sydney i didnt perceive it said the colonel calmly but i am very sorry for the cause of her absence well by jove it sounds unfeeling but i cant say i am murmured horace its something to have saved such a deuced pretty girl as that curse that puppy muttered syd to his champagne glass a fool that isnt fit for her to look at syds and my room in the bachelors wing adjoin each other and as our windows both possess the convenience of balconies we generally smoke in them and hold a little chat before turning in when i stepped out into my balcony that night syd was already puffing away at his pipe perhaps his cavendish was unusually good for he did not seem greatly inclined to talk but leant over the balcony looking out into the clear frosty night with the winter stars shining on the wide white uplands and the leafless glittering trees whats that said he sharply as the notes of a cornet playing and playing badly halevys air quand de la nuit struck on the night air a serenade i suppose a serenade in the snow who is romantic idiot enough for that said vivian contemptuously nearly pitching himself over to see where the cornet came from it came from under cecils windows where a light was still burning the player looked uncommonly like cossetting wrapped up in a cloak with a wideawake on under which the moonlight showed us some fair hair peeping vivian drew back with an oath he did not mean me to hear he laughed scornfully milkposset of course there is no other fool in the house his passion must be miraculously deep to drag him out of his bed into the snow to play some false notes to his ladylove its rather windy dont you think ned good night old fellowand i say dont turn little blanches head with your pretty speeches you and i are bound not to flirt since were sworn never to marry and i dont want the child played with though possibly being a woman shed very soon recover it with which sarcasm on his sister and her sex the colonel shut down the window with a clang and i remained smoking four pipes and a half meditating on his last words for i had been playing with the child and felt inhuman brute the ladies will say that i should be sorry if she did recover it iii showing that lovemaking on holy ground doesnt prosper cecil came down the next morning looking very pretty after her ducking vivian asked her how she was with his general air of calm courtesy helped her to some cold pheasant and applied himself to his breakfast and some talk with a sporting man about the chances of the frost breaking up horace who looked upon himself as a preux chevalier had had his left arm put in a sling on the strength of a bruise as big as a fourpennypiece and appeared to consider himself entitled to cecils eternal gratitude and admiration for having gone the length of wetting his coat sleeves for her do you like music by starlight he whispered with a selfconscious smile after a course of delicate attentions throughout breakfast syd fixed his eyes on cecils steadily but impassively the color rose into her face and she turned to cos with a mischievous laugh very much ifi am not too sleepy to hear it and it isnt a cornet out of tune how cruel murmured horace as he passed her coffee you shouldnt criticise so severely when a fellow tries to please you that poor dear girl really thinks i turned out into the snow last night to give her that serenade observed cos with a languid laugh when we were alone in the billiardroom good isnt it the idea of my troubling myself whose cracked cornet was it then that made that confounded row last night i asked horace laughed again it was rarely he was so highly amused at anything it was cleantes to be sure he dont play badly when his hands are not numbed poor devil of course he made no end of a row about going out into the snow but i made him do it i knew cecil would think it was i women are so vain poor things it was lucky i alone was the repository of his confidence for if vivian had chanced to have been in the billiardroom it is highly probable he would then and there have brained his cousin with one of the cues happily he was out of the reach of temptation in the stables looking after qui vive who had to bide in stall as much to that gallant bays disquiet as to her owners for i dont know which of the two best loves a burst over a stiff country or a fast twenty minutes up wind alone with the hounds when they throw up their heads to the stables by an odd coincidence cecil putting the irresistible black hat on the top of her chestnut braids prevailed on blanche to escort her vowing which was nearly but not quite the truth that she loved the sweet pets of horses better than anything on earth where cecil went laura made a point of going too to keep her enemy in sight i suppose though cecil liking a fast walk on the frosty roads a game of battledore and shuttlecock with blanche when we were out of the house or anything in short better than working with her feet on the fender and the caldecott inanities or screechington scandals in her ear often led laura many an unwelcome dance and brought that luckless young lady to try at things which did not sit well upon her as they did upon the st aubyn who had a knack of doing and doing charmingly a thousand things no other woman could have attempted so as vivian and i and some of the other men stood in the stabledoors smoking and talking over the studs accommodated in the spacious stalls a strong party of four young ladies came across the yard im come to look at qui vive will you show him to me said cecil softly her gentle childlike way was the most telling of all her changing moods but i must do her the justice to say that it was perfectly natural she was no actress with great pleasure said syd very courteously if not overcordially and to qui vives stall cecil went alone in her glory for laura was infinitely too terrified at the sight of the bays strong black hind legs to risk a kick from them even to follow syd helena vivian stayed with her and blanche came with me to visit my hunters cecil is a tolerable judge of a horse she praised qui vives lean head full eye and silky coat with discrimination and qui vive though not the besttempered of thoroughbreds let her pat his smooth sides and kiss his strong neck without any hostile demonstration vivian watched her as if she were a spoilt child who bewitched him but whom he knew to be naughty he could not resist the fascination of her ways but he never altered his calm courteous tone to herthe tone cecil longed to hear change were it even into invectives against her to testify some deeper interest now show me the mount you will give me when the frost breaks up and we take out the hounds said cecil with a farewell caress of qui vive you shall have the grey fouryearold billiardball and he will suit you exactly for he is as light as a bird checks at nothing and will take you safe over the stiffest bullfinch i know you may trust him for he has carried blanche cecil threw back her head oh i would ride anything qui vive himself if he would bear a habit i am not like miss caldecott who catching sight of his dear brown legs vanished as rapidly as if she had seen muriels ghost on christmaseve the colonel smiled you are very unmerciful to poor miss caldecott what has she done to offend you offend me nothing in the world though i heard her lament with miss screechington in the musicroom that i was so fast and such slang style i consider that rather a compliment for i never knew any lady pull to pieces my bonnet or my bouquet or my hat unless it was a prettier one than their own that sounds a vain speech but i dont mean it so the colonel looked down into her velvet eyes she was most dangerous to him in this mood no he said briefly no one would accuse you of vanity though they might pardon me of love of admiration cecil laughed merrily yes perhaps so it is pleasant you know yet sometimes i am tired of it all and i want a more difficult conquest to find a diamond merely like cleopatra to show your estimate of its value by throwing it away a flush of vexation came into her cheeks do you think me utterly heartless she said impetuously no i mean that i often tire of the fulsome compliments the flattery the attention the whirl of society i do like admiration i tell you candidly what every other woman acknowledges to herself but denies to the world but often it is nothing to memere dead sea fruit i care nothing for the voices that whisper it the eyes that express it wake no response in mine and i would give it all for one word of true interest one glance of real vivian looked down on her steadily with his searching eagle eyes out of which when he chose nothing could be read if i dare believe you he said half aloud gentle as his tone was the mere doubt stung cecil to the quick something of the wild desperate feeling of the day previous rose in her heart the same feeling that makes men brave heaven and hell to win their desires worked up in her if she had been one of us just at that moment she would have flinched at nothing being a young lady her hands were tied she could only go to coss stalls with him cos knows as much about horseflesh as i do about the profound female mystery they call shopping and flirt with him to desperation while horace got the steam up faster than he with his very languid motor powers often did being accustomed to be spared the trouble and have all the love made to himan indolence in which the st aubyn who knows how to keep a man well up to hand never indulged him do have some pity on me i heard cos murmuring as she stroked a great brute of his with a head like a fiddlecase and no action at all i assure you miss st aubyn you make me wretched id die for you tomorrow if i only saw how and yet you take no more notice of me sometimes than if i were that colt cecil glanced at him with a smile that would have driven cos distracted if hed been in for it as deep as he pretended i dont see that you are much out of condition sir horace but if you have any particular fancy to suicide the horsepond will accommodate you at a moments notice only dont do it till after our play because i have set my heart on that suit of milan armor pray dont look so plaintive if it will make you any happier i am going for a walk and you may come too blanche dear which way is it to the plantations now poor horace hated a walk on a frosty morning as cordially as anything being altogether averse to any natural exercise but he was sworn to the st aubyn and blanche and i dropping behind them he had a good hour of her fascinations to himself i do not know whether he improved the occasion but cecil at luncheon looked tired and teased i should think after syds graphic epigrammatic talk the baronets lisped nonsense must have been rather trying especially as cecil has a strong leaning to intellect vivian didnt appear at luncheon he was gone rabbitshooting with the other fellows and i should have been with them if i had not thought lounging in the drawingroom reading clytemnestra to blanche with many pauses the greater fun of the two i am keen about sport too but ever since at the age of ten i conceived a romantic passion for my mothers ladysmaida tall and stately young lady who eventually married a retail teadealeri have thought the beaux yeux the best of all games mrs vivian blanche and helena and i want to be very useful if you will let us said cecil one morning she was always soft and playful with that gentlest of all women syds mother what do you smile in that incredulous way for we can be extraordinarily industrious the steam sewingmachine is nothing to us when we choose what do you think we are going to do we are going to decorate the church for christmas to leave it to that poor little old clerk who would only stick two holly twigs in the pulpit candlesticks and fancy he had done a work of high art would be madness and besides it will be such fun if you think it so pray do it dear laughed mrs vivian i cant say i should but your tastes and mine are probably rather different the servants will do as you direct them oh no said cecil we mean to do it all ourselves the gentlemen may help us if they likethose at least who prefer our society to that of smaller animals with lopears and little bushy tails who have a fascination superior sometimes to any of our attractions she flashed a glance at the colonel who was watching her over the top of punch as when i was a boy i have watched the sun though it pained my eyes to do it youre the grand seigneur of deerhurst said cecil turning to him will you be good and order cartloads of holly and evergreens and plenty of the portugal laurel please because its so pretty down to the church and will you come and do all the hard work for me the rabbits would so enjoy a little peace today poor things he smiled in spite of himself and did her bidding with a flush of pleasure on his face i believe at that moment to please her he would have cut down the best timber on the estateseven the old oaks in whose shadow in the midsummer of centuries before guy vivian and muriel had plighted their troth the way to the church was through a winding walk between high walls of yew and the sanctuary itself was a find old norman place whose tout ensemble i admired though i could not pick it to pieces architecturally to the church we all went of course with more readiness than we probably ever did in our lives regardless of the rose chains with which we were very likely to become entangled while white hands weaved the holly wreaths vivian had ordered evergreens enough to decorate fifty churches and had sent over to the neighboring town for no end of ribbon emblazonments and illuminated scrolls on which cecil looked with delight she seemed to know by instinct it was done for her and not for his sisters how kind that is of you she said softly that is like what you were in toronto why are you not always the same for a moment she saw passion enough in his eye to satisfy her but he soon mastered it and answered her courteously i am very glad they please you shall we go to work at once for fear it grow dusk before we get through with it can i do anything to help you murmured cos in her ear she did not want him and laughed mischievously you can cut some holly if you like begin on those large boughs better not cos said the colonel you will certainly soil your hands and you might chance to scratch them and if you did you would never forgive me so i will let you off duty you may go back to the dormeuse and the lys de la vallee if you wish laughed cecil horace looked sulky and curled his blond whiskers in dudgeon while cecil with half a dozen satellites about her proceeded to work with vigorous energy keeping syd however as her head workman and the colonel twisted pillars nailed up crosses hung wreaths and put up illuminated texts as if he had been a carpenter all his life and his future subsistence entirely depended on his adorning deerhurst church in good taste it was amusing to me to see him whom the highest london society the gayest paris life boredwho pronounced the most dashing opera supper and the most vigorous debates alike slowtaking the deepest interest in decorating a little village church i question if eros did not lurk under the shiny leaves and the scarlet berries of those holly boughs quite as dangerously as ever he did under the rose petals consecrated to him i had my own affairs to attend to sitting on the pulpit stairs at blanches feet twisting the refractory evergreens at her direction but i kept an occasional lookout at the colonel and his dangerous canadian for all that they found time as we did for plenty of conversation over the christmas decorations and cecil talked softly and earnestly for once without any mischief she talked of her fathers embarrassments her mothers trials of mrs coverdale with honest detestation of that widows arts and artifices and of her own tastes and ideas and feelings showing the colonel what she did not show generally to her numerous worshippers her heart as well as her mind as she knelt on the altar steps twisting green leaves round the communion rails syd standing beside her his pale bronze cheek flushed and his eyes never left their study of her face as she bent over her work looking up every minute to ask him for another branch or another strip of blue ribbon when it had grown dusk and the church was finished looking certainly very pretty with the dark leaves against its white pillars and the scarlet berries kissing the stained windows cecil went noiselessly up into the organloft and played the christmas anthem vivian followed her and leaning against the organ watched her shading his eyes with his hand she went on playingfirst a miserere then mozarts symphony in e and then improvisations of her ownthe sort of music that when one stands calmly to listen to it makes one feel it whether one likes or not as she played tears rose to her lashes and she looked up at vivians face bending over her in the gloaming love was in her eyes and syd knew it but feared to trust to it his pulses beat fast he leaned towards her till his mustaches touched her soft perfumy hair words hung on his lips but the door of the organloft opened pon my life miss st aubyn thats divine delicious cried cos we always thought that you were divine but we never knew till now that you brought the angels harmony with you to earth for heavens sake play that last thing again i never play what i compose twice said cecil hurriedly stooping down for her hat vivian cursed him inwardly for his untimely interruption but cooler thought made him doubt if he were not well saved some words dictates of hasty passion that he might have lived to repent for guy vivians fate warned him and he mistrusted the love of a flirt if flirt as he fearedfrom her sudden caprices to him her alternate impatience with and encouragement of his cousincecil st aubyn would prove he gave her his arm down the yewtree walk neither of them spoke all the way but he sent a servant on for another shawl and wrapped it round her very tenderly when it came and when he stood in the lighted hall i saw by the stern worn look of his facethe look i have seen him wear after a hard fightthat the fiery passions in him had been having a fierce battle that evening the st aubyn was off her fun said she was tired and disregarding the misery she caused to cos and four other men who figuratively speaking not literally for they went into the dry and comestibles fast enough had lived on her smiles for the last month excused herself to mrs vivian and departed to her dormitory syd gave her her candle and held her little hand two seconds in his as he bid her softly good night at the foot of the staircase i did not get much out of him in the balcony that night and long after i had turned in i scented his cavendish as he smoked heaven knows how many pipes in the chill december air the next day the rd was the night of our theatricals which went off as dashingly as if mr kean with his eternal rrrrichard had been there to superintend them all the country came dowagers and beauties with the odor of belgravia still strong about them people not quite so high who were not the rose but living near it toadied that flower with much amusing and undue worship a detachment of dragoons from the next town whom the girls wanted to draw and the mammas to warn offdragoons being ordinarily better waltzers than speculations all the magnates custos rotulorum sheriff members and magistratesthe two latter portions of the constitution being chiefly remarkable for keenness about hunting and turnips and an unchristian and deadly enmity against all poachers and vagrants rectors who tossed down the still ai with falstaffs keen relish other rectors who came against their principles but preferred fashion to salvation having daughters to marry and sons to start hunting men girls who could waltz in a nutshell dandies of st jamess and veterans of pallmall down for the christmas belles renewing their london acquaintance and recalling that pleasant day at richmond but by jove if i describe all the different species presented to view in that ballroom i might use as many words as an old whip giving you the genealogy of a killing pack in a flying county suffice it there they all were to criticise us and pretty sharply i dare say they did it when they were out of our hearing in their respective clarences broughams dogcarts drags tilburies and hansoms before our faces of course they only clapped their snowy kid gloves and murmured bravissimo with an occasional go it jack and get up the steam old fellow from the young bloods in the background and a shower of bouquets at cecil and blanche from their especial worshippers blanche made the dearest little catherine that ever dressed herself up in blue and silver and when she drew her toyrapier in the greenroom asked me if i could not get her a cornetcy in ours as for cecil she played a ravir as cos in his milan armor whispered with some difficulty as the steel gorget pressed his throat uncomfortably vestris herself never made a more brilliant or impassioned countess she and syd really acquitted themselves in a style to qualify them for london boards and as she threw herself at his feet huonmy husbandlordcanst thou forgive the scornful maid for the devoted wife had cleaved to thee though neer she owned thee lord i thought the st aubyn must be as great an actress as rachel if some of that fervor was not real cecil played in the afterpiece the wonderful woman the colonel didnt and cos being de frontignac syd leaned against one of the scenes and looked on the whole thing with calm indifference externally but much disquietude and annoyance within him he was not jealous of the puppy he would as soon have thought of putting himself on a par with blanches little white terrier but hed come to set a price on cecils winning smiles and to see them given pretty equally to him and to a young fool her inferior in everything save position whom he knew in her inmost soul she must ridicule and despise galled his pride and steeled his heart against her his experience in women made him know that it was highly probable that cecil was playing both at once and that though as he guessed she loved him she would if cos offered first accept the title and wealth and position his cousin equally with himself could give her and such love as that was far from the colonels ideal by george vivian that canadian of yours is a perfect angel said a man in the dragoons who had played ulric shes such a deuced lot ove pluck such eyes such hair such a voice pon my life i quite envy you i suppose you mean to act out the play in reality dont you vivian lying back in an armchair in the greenroom crushed up one of the satin playbills in his hand and answered simply you do me too much honor calvert miss st aubyn and i have no thought of each other if any man had given vivian the lie he would have had him out and shot him instanter nevertheless he told this one with the most unhesitating defiance of truth he did not see cecil who had just come off the stage standing behind him but she heard his words went as white as muriels phantom and brushed past us into her dressing room whence she emerged when her name was called her cheeks bright with their first rouge and her eyes unnaturally brilliant how she flirted with horace that night when the theatricals were over young ladies who wanted to hook the pet baronet whispered over their bouquets how bold and dowagers seeing one of their best matrimonial speculations endangered by the brilliant canadian murmured behind their fans to each other their wonder that mrs vivian should allow any one so fast and so unblushing a coquette to associate with her young daughters vivian watched her with intense earnestness he had given her a bouquet that day and she had thanked him for it with her soft fond eyes and told him she should use it now as she came into the ballroom he looked at the one in her hand it was not his but his cousins he set his teeth hard and swore a bitter oath to himself as huon he was obliged to dance the first dance with the countess but he spoke little to her and indeed cecil did not give him much opportunity for she talked fast and at random on all sorts of indifferent subjects with more than even her usual vivacity and quite unlike the ordinary soft and winning way she had used of late when with him he danced no more with her but daring the waltzes with which he was obliged to favor certain county beauties and all the time he was doing the honors of deerhurst with his calm stately bayardlike courtesy his eyes would fasten on the st aubyn driving the dragoons to desperation waltzing while horace whispered tender speeches in her ear or sitting jesting and laughing half the men in the room gathered round herwith a look of passion and hopelessness tenderness and determination strangely combined iv the colonel kills his fox but loses his head after other game the next day was christmaseve and on the th of december the hounds from time immemorial had been taken out by a vivian for the last few days the frost had been gradually breaking up thank heaven and we looked forward to a good days sport the meet was at deerhurst and it proved a strong muster for the harkaway though not exactly up to the northamptonshire leicestershire mark are a clever steady pack cecil and blanche were the only two women with us for the country is cramped and covered with blind fences and the fair sex seldom hunt with the harkaway but the st aubyn is a firstrate seat and blanche has she tells me ridden anything from the day she first stuck on to her shetland when she was three years old they were both down in time indeed i question if they went to bed at all or did any more than change their ball dresses for their habits as i lifted blanche on to her pet chestnut i heard syd telling cecil that billiardball was saddled thank you said the st aubyn hurriedly i need not trouble you sir horace has promised to mount me vivian bent his head with a strange smile and sprang on qui vive while cecil mounted a showy roan thoroughbred the only good horse cos had in his stud despite the thousands he had paid into trainers and breeders pockets stole awayforward forward screamed vivians fellowmember for cacklebury and holding qui vive hard by the head away went syd after the couple or two of hounds that were leading the way over some pasture land with an oxrail at the bottom of it all the field after him cecils roan flew over the grass land and rose at the oxrail as steadily as qui vive blanches chestnut let himself be kicked along at no end of a pace his mistress sitting down in her stirrups as well as the gallant m f h her father i never do think of anything but the hounds flying along in front of me but i could not help turning my head over my shoulder to see if she was all right and i never admired her so much as when she passed me with a merry laugh five to one i beat you monsieur away we went over the dark ploughed lands and the naked thorn hedges the wide straggling briar fences and the fields covered with stones and belted with blacklooking plantations down went cos with his horse wallowing helplessly in a ditch after considerately throwing him unhurt on the bank syd set his teeth as he lifted qui vive over the prostrate baronet to the imminent danger of that dandy fieldsportsmans life take hold of his head miss st aubyn shouted the m f h but before the words had passed his lips cecil had landed gallantly a little farther down another ten minutes with the hounds streaming over the countrya ten minutes of wild delight worth all the monotonous hours of everyday lifeand qui vive was alone with the hounds we could see him speeding along a quarter of a mile ahead of us and cecils roan was but half a field behind him she was riding jealous of one of the best riders in the queens the m f h just in front of her turned his head once in admiration of her pluck to see her lift her horse at a stakenbound fence but the colonel never looked round away they wentthey disappeared over the brow of a hill blanche shook her reins and struck her chestnut and i sawed my hunters mouth mercilessly with the snaffle no usewe were too late by three minutes confound it they had just killed their fox after twenty minutes burst over a stiff country one of the fastest things i ever saw cecil was pale with overexcitement and upon my word she looked more ready to cry than anything when the m f h complimented her with his genial smile and his cordial well done my dear i never saw anybody ride better i used to think my little blanche the best seat in the country but she must give place to youeh syd miss st aubyn does everything well that she attempts answered the colonel in his calm courteous tone looking nevertheless as stern as if he had just slain his deadliest enemy instead of having seen a fox killed cecil flushed scarlet and cos coming up at that moment a sadly bespattered object for such an adonis to present his coat possessing more the appearance of a bricklayers than any one elses after its bath of white mud she turned to him and began to laugh and talk with rather wild gaiety it so chanced that the fox was killed on horaces land and we being not more than a mile and a half off his house the gallant cos immediately seized upon the idea of having the object of his idolatry up there to luncheon and his uncle and cecil and blanche acquiescing in the arrangement to his house we went with such of the field as had ridden up after the finish cos trotted forward with the st aubyn to show us the way by a short cut through the park and the echoes of cecils laughter rang to vivian in the rear discussing the run with his father a very slapup place was coss baronial hall for the cossettings had combined blood and money far many generations its style and appointments were calculated to back him powerfully in the matrimonial market and that cecil might have it all was fully apparent as he devoted himself to her at the luncheon which made its appearance at a minutes notice as if aladdin had called it up cecil seemed disposed to have it too a deep flush had come up in her cheeks she smiled her brightest smiles on cos she drank his moets bending her graceful head with a laughing pledge to her host she talked so fast so gaily such repartee such sarcasms such jeux de mots that it was well no women were at table to sit in judgment on her afterwards a deadly paleness came over vivians face as he listened to herbut he sat at the bottom of the board where cecil could not see him his father the gayest and besttempered of mortals laughed and applauded her the other men were charmed with a style and a wit so new to them and cos of course was in the seventh heaven the horses were dead beat and coss drag with its four bays very fresh for they were so little worked was ordered to take us back to deerhurst wholl drive said horace will you syd no said his cousin more laconically than politely let me cried cecil i can drive four in hand nothing i like better give me the ribbons interposed the colonel changing his mind if you cant drive them yourself cos as you ought to do no no murmured cos mith st aubyn shall do everything she wishes in my house let her drive them laughed vivian senior blanche has tooled my drag often enough before now before he had finished cecil had sprung up on to the box as lightly as a bird her cheeks were flushed deeper still and her gazelle eyes flashed darker than ever cos mounted beside her blanche and i in the back seat the m f h syd and the two other men behind the bays shook their harness and started off at a rattling pace cecil tooling them down the avenue with her little gauntleted hands as well as if she had been fourinhand forester of the queens bays or any other crack whip how she flirted and jested and laughed and shook the ribbons till the bays tore along the stony road in the dusky winters afternooneven blanche though a game little lady herself looked anxious cecil asked horace for a cigar and struck a fusee and puffed away into the frosty air like the wildest young cantab at trinity it didnt make her sick for she and blanche had had two queens out of vivians case and smoked them to the last ash for fun only the day before and she drove us at a mad gallop into deerhurst park past the dark trees and the gleaming water and the trooping deer and pulled up before the hall door just as the moon came out on christmaseve we were all rather fast at deerhurst so blanche got no scolding from her mamma who like a sensible woman never put into their heads that things done in the glad innocency of the heart were wrong and cecil as soon as she had sprung down snatched her hand from cos and went up to her own room the colonels lips were pressed close together and his forehead had the dark frown that guy wears in his portrait it had been done with another so it was all wrong but oh syd my friend if the dry that was drunk and the drag that was tooled and the weed that was smoked had been yours wouldnt it have been the most charming caprice of the most charming woman that night at dinner a letter by the afternoons post came to the colonel it was on her majestys service and his mother asked him anxiously what it was only to tell me to join soon said he carelessly giving me a sign to keep the contents of a similar letter i had just received to myself which i should have done anyhow as i had reason to hope that the disclosure of them would have quenched the light in some bright eyes beside me ordered off at last thank god said syd handing his father the letter as soon as the ladies were gone theres a train starts at isnt there for town you and i ned had better go tonight you dont look so charmed old fellow as you did when you went out to scinde i say dont tell my sisters there is no need to make a row in the house governor youll prepare my mother i must bid her goodby i did not view the crimea with the unmingled devilmecare delight with which i had gone out under fighting napier nine years before for blanches sunshiny face had made life fairer to me and to obey syd and go without a farewell of her was really too great a sacrifice to friendship but he and i went to the drawingrooms chatted and took coffee as if nothing had chanced till he could no longer stand seeing cecil still excited singing chansons to cos who was leaning enraptured over the instrument and he went off to his own room the other girls and men were busy playing the race game blanche and i were sitting in the back drawingroom beside the fire and the words that decided my destiny were so few that i cite them as a useful lesson to those novelists who are in the habit of making their heroes while waiting breathless to hear their fate recite off at a cool canter four pages of the neatestturned sentences without a single breakdown or a single pullup to see how the lady takes it blanche i must bid you goodby tonight blanche turned to me in bewildered anxiety i must join my troop perhaps i may be sent to the crimea i could go happily if i thought you would regret me brutally selfish that was to be sure but she did not take it so she looked as if she was going to faint and for fear she should trusting to the engrossing nature of the race game in the further apartment i drew nearer to her will you promise to give yourself to nobody else while i am away my darling blanches eyes did promise me through their tears and this brief scene occupying the space of two minutes twisted our fates into one on that eventful christmaseve while i was parting with my poor little blanche in the library vivian was bidding his mother farewell in her dressingroom his mother had the one soft place in his heart steeled and made skeptical to all others by that fatal first love of which he had spoken to cecil possibly some of her sons bitter grief was shown to her on that sad christmaseve at all events when he left her dressingroom he had the tired haggard look left by any conflict of passion as he came down the stairs to come to the dogcart that was to take us to the station the door of blanches boudoir stood open and in it he saw cecil the fierce tide of his love surged up subduing all his pride and he paused to take his last sight of the face that would haunt him in the long night watches and the rapid rush of many a charge she looked up and saw him that look overpowered all his calmness and resolve he turned and bent towards her every feature quivering with the passion she had once longed to rouse his hot breath scorched her cheek and he caught her fiercely against his heart in an iron embrace pressing his burning lips on hers god forgive you i have loved you too well women have ever been fatal to my race he almost threw her from him in the violence of feelings roused after a long sleep in another moment he was driving the dogcart at a mad gallop past the old church in which we had spent such pleasant hours its clock tolled out twelve strokes as we passed it and on the quiet village and the weirdlike trees and the tall turrets of deerhurst the christmas morning dawned vivian continued so utterly enfeebled and prostrate that there was but one chance for himreturn homewards i was going to england with despatches and syd at his mothers entreaty let himself be carried down to a transport and shipped for england he was utterly listless and strengthless although the voyage did him a little good he did not care where he went so he stayed in town with me while i presented myself at the horse guards and war office and then we travelled down together to deerhurst oddly enough it was christmaseve again when we drove up the old avenue the snow was falling heavily and lay deep on the road and thick on the hedges and trees the meadows and woods were white against the dark hushed sky and the old church and its churchyard cedars were loaded too with the clouds christmas gift to me at least the english scene was very pleasant after the heat and dirt and minor worries of gallipoli and constantinople the wide stretching country with its pollards and holly hedges and homesteads the cattle safe housed the yule fire burning cheerily on the hearths the cottages and farms nestling down among their orchards and pasturelands all was so heartily and thoroughly english they seemed to bring back days when i was a boy skating and sliding on the mere at home or riding out with the harriers lighthearted and devilmecare as a boy might be coming back to hear the poor governors cheery voice tell me i was one of the old stock and to toss down a bumper of rhenish with a timehonored christmas toast the crackle of the crisp snow the snort of the horses as they plunged on into the darkening night and the red firelight flickering on the lattice windows of the cottages we passed were so many welcomes home and i doublethonged the offwheeler with a vengeance as i thought of soft lips that would soon touch mine and a soft voice that would soon whisper my best io triumphe the lodgegates flew open we passed the old oaks and beeches the deer trooping away over the snow as we startled them out of their rest we were not expected that night and my man rang such a peal at the bell as might have been heard all over the quiet park another minute and blanche and i were together again and alone in the library where we had parted just twelve months before of course for the time being we neither knew nor cared what was going on in the other rooms of the house the colonel had gone to rest himself on the sofa in the diningroom half an hour had elapsed perhaps when a wild cry rang through the house startling even us absorbed though we were in our teteatete blanches first thought was of her brother she ran out through the hall and up the staircase and i followed her at the top of the stairs leaning against the wall breathing fast and his face ashy white stood syd and at his feet in a dead faint lay cecil st aubyn i caught hold of blanches arm and held her back as she was about to spring forward i thought their meeting had much best be uninterrupted for if cecils had been mere flirtation i fancied the colonels return could scarcely have moved her like this vivian stood looking down on her all the passion in him breaking bounds he could not stand calmly by the woman he loved he did not wait to know whether she was his or anotherswhether she was worthy or unworthy of himbut he lifted her up and pressed her unconscious form against his heart covering her lips with wild caresses waking from her trance she opened her eyes with a terrified stare and gazed up in his face then tears came to her relief and she sank down at his feet again with a pitiful cry forgive meforgive me weak as syd was he found strength to raise her in his arms and whisper as he bent over her if you love me i have nothing to forgive the snow fell softly without over the woods and fields and the winds roared through the old oaks and whistled among the frozen ferns but christmaseve passed brightly enough to us at home within the strong walls of deerhurst i am sure that all moores pictures of paradise seemed to me tame compared to that drawingroom with its warmth and coziness and luxuries with the waxlights shining on the silver of the english tea equipage pleasant to eye and taste let one love campaigning ever so well after the roast beans of the commissariat and the firegleams dancing on the soft brow and shining hair of the face beside me i doubt if vivian either ever spent a happier christmaseve as he lay on the sofa in the back drawingroom with cecil sitting on a low seat by him her hand in his and the canadian eyes telling him eloquently of love and reconciliation they had such volumes to say as soon as she knew that wild farewell of his preceded his departure to the crimea cecil always impulsive had written to him on the instant telling him how she loved him detailing what she had heard in the greenroom confessing that in desperation she had done everything she could to rouse his jealousy assuring him that that same evening she had refused coss proposals and beseeching him to forgive her and come back to her that letter vivian had never had six months from that time by the way it turned up after a journey to india and melbourne following a cousin of his colonel of a line regiment she in her haste having omitted to put his troop on the address and cecil whose feeling was too deep to let her mention the subject to blanche or helena made up her mind that he would never forgive her and being an impressionable young lady had on the anniversary of christmaseve been comparing her fate with that of muriel in the ghost legend and on seeing the colonels unexpected apparition had fainted straight away in the overexcitement and sudden joy of the moment such was cecils story and vivian was content with it and gladly took occasion to practise the christmas duties of peace and love and pardon he had the best anodyne for his wounds now and there was no danger for him since cecil had taken the place of the scutari nurses no crimean heroes as they call us in the papers were ever more feted and petted than were the colonel and i christmas morning dawned the sun shining bright on the snowcovered trees and the christmas bells chiming merrily and as we stood on the terrace to see the whole village trooping up through the avenue to receive the gifts left to them by some old vivian long gone to his rest with his forefathers under the churchyard cedars syd looked down with a smile into cecils eyes as she hung on his arm and whispered i will double those alms love in memory of the priceless gift this christmas has given me ah thornton and i little knew when we came down for the hunting how fast you and blanche would capture us with yourholly wreaths and rose chains silver chimes and golden fetters silver chimes and golden fetters i waldemar falkenstein and valerie lestrange a quarter to twelve by heaven if my luck dont change before the year is out i vow ill never touch a card in the next exclaimed one of several men playing lansquenet in harry godolphins rooms at knightsbridge there were seven or eight of them some with long rentrolls others within an ace of the queens bench the poor devils losing in the long run much oftener and more recklessly than the rich fellows all of them playing high as that beau joueur of the guards godolphin always did luck had been dead against the man who spoke ever since they had deserted the messroom for the cartes in the privacy of harrys rooms if fortune is a woman he ought to have found favor in her eyes his age was between thirty and thirtyfive his figure with grace and strength combined his features nobly and delicately cut his head like cannings one of great intellectual beauty and by the flash of his large dark eyes and the additional paleness of his cheek it was easy to see he was playing high once too often five minutes passedhe lost still ten minutes luck was yet against him a little french clock began the silver chimes that rang out the old year the twelfth stroke sounded the new year was come and waldemar falkenstein rose and drank down some cognaca ruined man a happy new year to you and better luck falkenstein cried godolphin drinking his toast with a ringing laugh and a foaming bumper of chambertin what shall i wish you the richest wife in the kingdom a cabal that will break all the banks for mistletoe to win the oaks or for your eyes to be opened to your sinful state as the parson phrases itwhich eh thank you harry laughed falkenstein like the old spartans we can laugh while the wolf gnaws our vitals you remind me of what my holyminded brother wrote to me when i broke my shoulderbone down at melton last season my dear waldemar i am sorry to hear of your sad accident but all things are ordered for the best and i trust that in your present hours of solitude your thoughts may be mercifully turned to higher and better things queer style of sympathy wasnt it i preferred yours when you sent me adelaide meran and that splendid hock i wasnt allowed to touch i should say so but catch the pharisees giving anybody anything warmer than texts and counsels that cost them nothing said tom bevan of the blues apropos of pharisees have you heard that old cash is going to build a chapelofease in belgravia to endow that young owl gus with as soon as he can pull himself through his greats it is thought that the dear bella will be painted as st catherine for the altarpiece shell strychnine herself if were all so hardhearted as to leave her to st catharines nightcap laughed falkenstein why dont you take up with her old fellow said a man in godolphins troop not the sangue puro youd say rather sallied with xxx but what does that signify youve quarterings enough for two much good the quarterings do me no thank you said falkenstein bitterly im not going to sell myself though my dear friends would insinuate that i was sold already to a gentleman who never quits hold of his bargains ive fetters enough now too heavy by half to add matrimonial handcuffs to them right old boy said harry the cashranger hops and vats even done in the brightest parvenu or would scarcely look well blazoned on the royal gules come sit down where are you going hes going to eulalie browns i bet said bevan nonsense waldemar throw her over and stay and take your revengeits so early no thank you said falkenstein briefly by the way i suppose you all go to cashrangers tomorrow make a point of it answered godolphin i feel im sinning against my order to visit him but really his lafittes so goodim sorry you will leave us waldemar but i know i might as well try to move the marble arch as try to turn you indeed i never set up for a roman harry the deuce take this pipe it wont light good night to you all and leaving them drinking hard laughing loud and telling grivois tales before they sat down to play in all its delirious delight he sprang into a hanson and drove not to eulalie browns petit souper but to his own rooms in duke street st jamess falkensteins governor some twoscore years before had got in mauvaise odeur in vienna for some youthful escapade at court powerful as his princely family was had been obliged to fly the country and coming over here entered himself at the bar and setting himself to work with characteristic energy had wonderful to relate made a fortune at it a fine gallant courtly ancien noble was the count haughty and passionate at times after the manner of the house fond of his younger son waldemar who at school had tanned boys twice his size rode his pony in at the finish smoked swam and otherwise conducted himself till all the rest of the boys worshipped him though i believe the masters generally attributed to him more diablerie than divinity but of late unluckily his father had been much dominated over by waldemars three sisters ladies of a chill and high church turn of mind and by his brother who in early life had been a prize boy and a sap and received severe buffetings from his junior at football and now being much the more conventional and unimpeachable of the two took his revenge by carrying many tales to the old count of his wilder sontales to which falkenstein gave strong foundation for he was restless and reckless strikingly original and above the common herd too impatient to take any meddling with his affairs and too proud to explain where he was misjudged and though he held a crack government place good pay and all but a sinecure he often spent more than he had for economy was a deadletter to him and if any man asked him a loan he was too generous to say no life in all its phases he had seen from the time he left school and you know mon ami we cannot see life on a groatat least through the bouquet of the wines at vefours and the brilliance of the gaslight in casinos and redoutes the fascinations of play were over himthe iron hand of debt pressed upon him altogether as he sat through the first hours of the new year smoking and gazing on the flickering fire gleams there was not much light either in his past or future keenly imaginative and susceptible blase and skeptical though he was the weight of the old year and of many gone before it weighed heavily on his thoughts scenes and deeds of his life that he would willingly have blotted out rose before him vague regrets unformed desires floated to him on the midnight chimes the old year was drifting away on the dark clouds floating on to the sea the new year was dawning on the vast human life swarming in the costly palaces and crowded dens around him the past was past ineffaceable and relentless the future lay hid in the unborn days and falkenstein his pipe out his fire cold and black took a sedative and threw himself on his bed to sleep heavily and restlessly through the struggling morning light of the new year james cashranger esq of lowndes square was a millionnaire and the million owed its being to the sale of his entire which was of high celebrity being patronised by all the messes and clubs shipped to all the colonies blessed by all the h e i cs shouted by all the potmen as beerrrhow and consumed by all england generally but cashrangers soul soared above the snobisms of malt and jack and a la jourdain of bourgeois celebrity he would have let any dorante of the beau monde fleece him through thick and thin and en effet gave dinners and drums unnumbered to men and women who like godolphin went there for the sake of his lafitte and quizzed him mercilessly behind his back the first day harry dined there with nine other spirits worse than himselfcashranger having begged him to bring some of his particular chumshe looked at the eleventh seat and asked with consummate impudence who it was for why really my dear colonel it is forfor myself faltered the luckless brewer ohahi see drawled harry you mistook me i said id dine herei didnt say id dine with you that however was four or five years before now godolphin having proclaimed his cook and cellar worth countenancing and his wife the relict of a lieutenant in the navy being an admirable adept in the snobs art of pushing plenty of exclusive dandies and extensive fine ladies crushed up the stairs on new yearsnight to one of cashrangers numerous at homes among them late enough came falkenstein these sort of crushes bored him beyond measure but he wanted to see godolphin about some intelligence he had had of an intended illegitimate use of the twitch to mistletoe that sweet little chestnut who stood favorite for the oaks he soon paid his devoir to madame who wasnt quite accustomed even yet to all this grandeur after her early struggles on halfpay and to her eldest daughter the bella aforesaid a showy flaunting girl with a peony color and went on through the rooms seeking harry stopping however for a word to every pretty woman he knew for though he began to find his game grow stale he and the beau sexe have a mutual attraction little those women guessed as they smiled in his handsome eyes and laughed at his witty talk and blushed at his soft voice how heartily sick he was of their frivolities and how often disappointment and sarcasm lurked in his mocking words to be blase was no affectation with falkenstein it was a very earnest reality as with most of us who have knocked about in the world not only from the variety of his manifold experiences but from the trickery and censure and cold water with which the world had treated him you here old fellow said bevan of the blues meeting him in the musicroom where some artistes were singing traviata airs you dont care for this row do you come along with me and ill show you something that will amuse you better show me godolphin and ill thank you i didnt come to staydid you no horrid bore aint it but since you are here you may as well take a look at the dearest little actress i ever saw since i was a boy and bewitched by leontine fay sit down bevan went on as they entered a room fitted up like a theatre there its that one with blue eyes got up like a watteaus huntress isnt she a brilliant little thing very she plays as well as dejazet who is she dont know can you tell us forester shes old cashs niece said forester not taking his eyes off the stage come as a sort of companion to the beloved bella dangerous companion i should say for theres no comparing the two whats her name violavioletno valerie lestrange lestrange of the th ran away with cashs sister god knows why horrid low connexion and no money she went speedily to glory and he drank himself to death two years ago in lahore i remember him a big fellow fourteen stone pounded bully batson once at moseley and there wasnt such another hard hitter among the fancy as bully when he departed this life of course his daughter was left to her own devices with scarcely a rap to buy her bonnets clever little animal she is too she wrote those proverbs theyre now playing full of dash and spice aint they especially when you think a girl wrote em introduce me as soon as theyre over said falkenstein leaning back to study the young actress and author who was an engaging study enough being full of grace and vivacity with animated features mobile eyebrows darkblue eyes and chestnut hair anything original would be as great a wonder as to buy cavendish in regentstreet that wasnt birdseye valeries original enough for anybodys money hark how shes firing away at egerton pretty little soft voice she has i do like a pretty voice for a woman said forester clapping softly with many a murmured bravisima youre quite enthusiastic smiled falkenstein pity you havent a bouquet to throw at her dont you poke fun at me you cynic growled forester ive seen you throw bouquets at much plainer women and the bouquets and the women were much alike in morning lightfaded and colorless on their artificial stalks as soon as the gas glare was off them hold your tongue juvenal laughed forester or i vow i wont introduce you youll begin satirising poor little val as soon as youve spoken to her oh i can be merciful to the weak dont i let you alone forester laughed waldemar as the curtain fell the proverbs were over and having put herself in ballroom style the author came among the audience he amused himself with watching how she took her numerous compliments and was astonished to detect neither vanity nor shyness and to hear her turn most of them aside with a laugh she was quite as attractive off as on the stage especially with the aroma of her sparkling proverbs hanging about her and falkenstein got his introduction and consigning godolphin and mistletoe to futurity waltzed with her and found her dancing as full of grace and lightness as an andalusians or arlesiennes falkenstein cared little enough for the saltatory art but this waltz did not bore him and when it was over regardless of some dozen names written on her tablets he gave her his arm and they strolled out of the ballroom into a cooler atmosphere he found plenty of fun in her as he had expected from her proverbs and sat down beside her in the conservatory to let himself be amused for half an hour do you know many of the people here she asked him is there anybody worth pointing out there ought to be in four or five hundred dwellers in the aristocratic west i know most of them personally or by report but they are all of the same stamp like the petals of that camellia some larger and some smaller but all cut in the same pattern most of them apostles of fashion martyrs to debt worshippers of the rising sun all of them created by art from the young ladies who owe their roses and lilies to breidenbach to the cidevant jeunes hommes who buy their figures in bond street and their faces from isidore all of them actorsand pretty good actors toofrom that pretty woman yonder who knows her milliner may imprison her any day for the lace she is now drawing round her with a laugh to that sleek old philanthropist playing whist through the doors there whose guinea points are paid by the swindle of half england she laughed lend me your lorgnon i should like to see around me as you do wait twenty years you will have it there are two glasses to itexperience and observation but your glasses are smoked are they not said valerie with a quick glance at him for you seem to me to see everything en noir he smiled when i was a boy i had a claude glass but they break very soon or rather as you say grow dark and dim with the smoke of society but you ask me about these people you know them do you not as they are your uncles guests she shook her head i have been here but a week or two for the last two years i have been vegetating among the fens with a maiden aunt of poor papas and did you like the country like it cried valerie i was buried alive everything was so dreadfully punctual and severe in that house that i believe the very cat had forgotten how to purr breakfast at eight drive at two dinner at five prayers at ten cant you fancy the dreary diurnal round with a pursy old rector or two and three or four highdried county princesses as callers once a quarter luckily i can amuse myself but oh you cannot think how i sickened of the monotony how i longed to live at last i grew so naughty i was expelled may i inquire your sins asked falkenstein really amused for once she laughed at the remembrance i read notredame against orders and i rode the fat old mare round the paddock without a saddle i saw no harm in it as a child i read and rode everything i came near but the roughriding was condemned as unfeminine and any french book were it even the genie du christianisme or the petit careme would be regarded by aunt agatha who doesnt know a word of the language as a powder magazine of immorality and infidelity cest la profonde ignorance qui inspire le ton dogmatique laughed falkenstein but surely you have been accustomed to society no never but i am made for it i fancy said valerie with an unconscious compliment to herself when i was with the dear old tenth i used to enjoy myself but i was a child then the officers were very kind to megentlemen always are much more so than ladiespour cause thought waldemar as she went onbut ever since then i have vegetated as i tell you in much the same still life as the anemones in my vase yet you could write those proverbs said he involuntarily she laughed and colored oh i have written ever since i could make a b c and i have not forgotten all i saw with the old tenth but come tell me more of these people i like to hear your satire i am glad you do said falkenstein with a smile for only those who have no foibles to hit have a relish for sarcasm do you think messaline and lelie had much admiration for la bruyeres periods however well turned or justly pointed but those whom the caps did not fit probably enjoyed them as you and i do all satirists from martial downwards most likely gain an enemy for each truth they utter for in this bal masque of life it is not permitted to tear the masks off our companions do you wear one asked valerie quickly i fancy like monte cristo your pleasure is to usurper les vices que vous navez pas et de cacher les vertus que vous avez virtues if you knew me better you would know that i never pretend to any if you compare me to monte cristo say rather that i preche loyalement legoisme laughed falkenstein upon my word we are talking very seriously for a ballroom i ought to be admiring your bouquet miss lestrange or petitioning for another waltz dont trouble yourself i like this best said valerie playing with the flowers round her and i ought to have my own way for this is my birthday new yearsday indeed then i am sure i wish you most sincerely the realisation of all your ideals and desires which to the imaginative author of the proverbs will be as good as wishing her aladdins lamp smiled falkenstein she smiled too and sighed and about as improbable as aladdins lamp did you see the old year out last night yes he answered briefly for the remembrance of what he had lost watching it out was not agreeable to him there was a musical party here continued valerie but i got away from it for i like to be alone when the past and the future meetdo not you no your past is pure your future is bright mine are not so i dont want to be stopped to contemplate them nor are mine indeed but the death of an old year is sad and solemn to me as the death of a friend and i like to be alone in its last hour i wonder she continued suddenly what this year will bring i wonder where you and i shall be next new yearsnight falkenstein laughed not merrily i shall be in kensal green or the queens bench very likely why do you look astonished miss lestrange one is the destination of everybody in these rooms and the other probably of onehalf of them dont speak so bitterlydont give me sad thoughts on my birthday oh how tiresome cried valerie interrupting herself there comes major dorwood to claim you yes id forgotten him entirely i promised to waltz with him an hour ago what the devil brought you here to interrupt us thought falkenstein as the guardsman lisped a reproof at valeries cruelty and gave her his arm back to the ballroom waldemar stopped her however engaged her for the next and sauntered through the room on her other side he waltzed a good deal with her paying her that sort of attention which falkenstein knew how to make the softest and subtlest homage a woman could have amused himself he amused her with his brilliant and pointed wit so well that valerie lestrange told him when he bid her good night that she had never enjoyed any birthday so much well said bevan as they drove away from lowndes square did you find that wonderful little lestrange as charming a companion as actress you ought to know for youve been after her all night like a ferret after a rabbit yes said falkenstein taking out a little pet briarwood pipe i was very pleased with her shes worth no more than the others probably au fond but shes very entertaining and frank shell tell you anything poor child she cant be overcomfortable in cashs house shes a lady by instinct that odious ostentation and snobbish toadying must disgust her besides bella is not very likely to lead a girl a very nice life who is partially dependent on her father and infinitely better style than herself the devil no that flaunting flirting overdressed cashranger girl is my detestation shell soon find means to worry littil valerie women have a great spice of the mosquito in em and enjoy nothing more than stinging each other to death well she must get forester or dorwoodsome man who can afford itto take compassion upon her all of them finish so when they can the rich ones marry for a title and the poor ones for a home said the count stirring up his pipe heres my number thank you for dropping me and good night old fellow good night pleasant dreams of your author and actress aux longs yeux bleus waldemar laughed as he took out his latchkey im afraid i couldnt get up so much romance you and i have done with all that tom confound it i never saw godolphin after all well i must go and breakfast with him tomorrow ii falkenstein breaks lances with the longs yeux bleus he did breakfast with godolphin not however before he had held a small but disagreeable levee to one or two rather impatient callers whom he couldnt satisfy and a certain amadeus levi who having helped him to the payment of those debts of honor incurred in harrys rooms held him by golden fetters as hard to unclasp as the chains that bound prometheus he shook himself free of them at last drove to knightsbridge and had a chat with godolphin over coffee and chibouques went to his two or three hours diplomatic work in the deeds and chronicles office and when he came out instead of going to his club as usual thought he might as well call on the cashrangers and turned his steps to lowndes square valerie lestrange was sitting at a davenport done out of her watteau costume into very becoming english morning dress he had only time to shake hands with her before bella and her mamma set upon him miss cashranger had a great admiration for him and though his want of money was a drawback the royal gules of his blazonments joined to his manifold attractions fairly dazzled her and she held him tight talking over the palace concerts till a dowager and her daughter and a couple of men from hounslow being ushered in he was at liberty and sitting down by valerie gave her a book she had said the night before she wished to read goethes autobiography oh thank youhow kind you are not at all laughed falkenstein to merit such things i ought to have saved your life at least what are you doing here writing some more proverbs i hope to give me a part in one she shook her head nothing half so agreeable i am writing dinner invitations and answering belles letters why cant she answer them herself my motto here is ich dien she answered with a flush on her cheeks bella turned languidly round and verified her words val puppets scratching at the door let him in will you waldemar rose and opened the door for a little slatecolored greyhound and while bella lisped out her regrets for his trouble smiled a smile that made miss cashranger color and looked searchingly at valerie to see how she took it she turned a grateful radiant look on him and whispered je maffranchirai un jour et comment she raised her mobile eyebrows dieu sait comme actrice comme feuilletonnistejai mes reves monsieurmais pas comme institutrice cela me tuerait bientot je le crois said falkenstein briefly as he took up the autobiography and began to talk on it i dont like goethe for one thing said valerie he loved a dozen women one after the other that i would pardon him most men do so but i dont believe he really loved any one of them oh yes he did quite enough at least to please himself he wasnt so silly as to go in for a neverending heartburning heartbreaking absorbing passion we dont do those things go in for it repeated valerie contemptuously i suppose if he had been of the nature to feel such he couldnt have helped it i can help going near the fire cant i if i dont wish to be burnt yes but a coal may fly out of the fire and set you in flames when you are sitting far away from it then i ought to wear asbestos said waldemar with a merry quizzical smile you authors and poets and artists think the world well lost and all for love but we rational people who know the world find it quite the contrary those are very pretty ideas for your proverbs but they dont suit real life we when were boys worship some parterre divinity till we see her some luckless day inebriate with eaudecologne or more unpoetic porter are cured and disenchanted wait ten years with christines and minna herzliebs in the interim and wind up with a rich widow who keeps us straight and heads our table you fresh from the schoolroom fasten on some lachrymose curate or flirting dragoon as the object of your early romances walk with him under the limes work him a smokingcap and write him tender little notes till mamma whispers her hope that mr a or b is serious and you balancing like a sensible girl a or bs tangible settlements with the others intangible lovespeeches forsake the limes forswear the notes and announce yourself as sold thats the love of our day miss lestrange and very wise and love cried valerie with supreme scorn you dont know the common a b c of love you might as well call gilt leatherwork pure gold falkenstein laughed heartily well theres a good deal more leatherwork than gold about in the world isnt there a good deal more granted but there is some gold to be found i should hope not without alloy it cant be worked you know it cant be worked for the base purposes of earth but it may be found still undefiled before mens touch has soiled it so i believe in some hearts undefiled by the breath of conventionality and cant may lie the true love of the poets lasting and knowing not change ah youre too ideal for me cried waldemar smiling at her impetuous earnestness you are all enthusiasm imagination effervescence i am not she answered impatiently i can be very practical when i like i made myself the loveliest wreath yesterday quite as pretty as bella buys at mitchells for five times the sum mine cost me that was very realistic wasnt it no that exercised your fancy you wouldnt dowhat do you call itplain work with half the gusto now would you valerie made a moue mutine expressive of entire repudiation of such employment i thought so laughed falkenstein you idealists are like the fire in the grate yonder you flame up very hot and bright for a moment but the sparks fly upward and expire and if theyre not fed with some fresh fuel they soon die out into lifeless cinders on the contrary said valerie quickly we are like wood fires and burn red down to the last ash mr falkenstein come and look at this little ghirlandaio said bella turning round with an angry light in her eyes it is such a gem papa bought it the other day waldemar rose reluctantly enough to inspect the ghirlandaio manufactured in a back slum and smoked into proper antiquity to pigeon under the attractive title of an old master the brewer and his species and found miss cashrangers ignorant dilettantism very tame after valeries animated arguments and gesticulation but he was too old a hand at such game not to know how to take advantage of even an enemys backhanded stroke and he turned the discussion on art to an inspection of valeries portfolio over whose croquis and pastels and watercolors he lingered as long as he could till the clock reminded him that it was time to walk on into eaton square where he was going to dine at his fathers the governor excepted falkenstein had little rapport with his family his brother was as chilly disagreeable in private life as he was popularly considered irreproachable in public and as pragmatical and uncharitable as your immaculate individuals ordinarily are his sisters were cold conventional women as utterly incapable of appreciating him as of allowing the odor of his latakia in their drawingroom and so it chanced that waldemar a favorite in every other house he entered received but a chill welcome at home a prophet has no honor in his own country and the hearth where a mans own kin are seated is too often the one to nurture the cockatrices eggs of illnature and injustice against him thank heaven there are others where the fire burns brighter and the smiles are fonder for him it were hard for some of us if we were dependent on the mercies of our own family the old count gave him this night but a distant welcome for maximilian was there to damn his brother with faint praise and had been pouring into his fathers ear tales of poor waldemars losses at play all that falkenstein said his sisters took up contradicted and jarred upon till he fairly out of patience lapsed into silence only broken by a sarcasm deftly flung at maximillian to floor him completely in his orthodoxy or ethics he was glad to bid the governor good night and leaving them to hold a congress over his skepticism radicalism and other dangerous opinions he walked through the streets and swore slightly with his pipe between his teeth as he opened his own door since my father prefers max to me let him have him thought waldemar smoking and undressing himself if people choose to dictate to me or misjudge me let them go and if they have not penetration enough to judge what i am i shall not take the trouble to show them but nevertheless as he thus resolved falkenstein smoked hard and fast for he was fond of the old count and felt keenly his desertion for steel himself as he might egotist as he might call himself waldemar was quick in his susceptibilities and tenacious in his attachments since falkenstein had got intimate with valerie lestrange in one ball you are pretty sure that week after week did not lessen their friendship he was amused and past memories of women he had wooed and won and left certain passages in his life where such had reproached him not always deservedly never presented themselves to check him in his new pursuit it is pleasant to a naturalist to study a butterfly pinned to the wall the rememberance that the butterfly may die of the sport does not occur to him or at least never troubles him so falkenstein called to lowndes square and lent her books and gave her a little skye of his and met her occasionally by accident on purpose in kensington gardens where valerie according to mrs cashrangers request sometimes took one of her cousins a headstrong young demon of six or seven for an early walk to which early walks valerie made no objection preferring them to the drawingrooms of no and liking them you may guess none the less after seeing somebody she knew standing by the pond throwing in sticks for his retriever and falkenstein had sat down with her under the bushes by the water and talked of all the things in heaven and earth while julius adolphus ran about and gobbled at the china geese and wetted his silk stockings unreproved he made no love to her not a bit he talked of it theoretically but never practically but he liked to talk to her to argue with her to see her demonstrative pleasure in his society to watch her coming through the trees and find the longs yeux bleus gleam and darken at his approach all this amused him pleased him as something original and out of the beaten track she told him all she thought and felt she pleased him and beguiled him from his darker thoughts and she began to reconcile him to human nature which with faria he had learnt to class into les tigres et les crocodiles a deux pieds it was well he had this amusement for it was his only one he was going to the bad as we say debts and entanglements imperceptibly gathered round him held him tight and only in valeries lively society lively for when with him she was as happy as a bird could exercise his dark spirit you remember the vow he made when the silver chimes rang in the new year so did not he we cannot be always medes and persians madam to resist every temptation and keep unbroken every law though you sitting in your cushioned chair in unattacked tranquillity can tell us easily enough we should be one night when he was dining with bevan tom produced those two little ivory fiends whose rattle is in the ear of watchful deans and proctors as the singing of the rattlesnake and whose witchery is more wily and irresistible than the witchery of woman no beaux yeux whether of the cassette or of ones first love ever subjugate a man so completely as the fascinations of play once yielded to the charm the circe that clasps us will not let us go falkenstein though in much he had the strong will of his race had no power to resist the beguilements of his omphale he played again and again and five times out of seven lost well falkenstein cried godolphin after five games of ecarte at a pony a side three of which falkenstein had lost i heard max lamenting to old straitlace in the lobby the other night that you were going to the devil only the irreproachable member phrased it in more delicate periods quite true said falkenstein with a short laugh if for devil you substitute queens bench well were en route together old fellow interrupted tom bevan and with all your sins youre a fat lot better than that brother of yours who i believe dont know latakia from maryland jesse egerton told me the other day that his wife has an awful life of it but whod credit it of a man who patronises exeter hall and gave the shoeblacks only yesterday such unlimited supply of weak tea buns and strong texts who indeed max is such a moral man sneered falkenstein though he has done one or two things in his life that i wouldnt have stooped to do but you may sin as much as you like as long as you sin under the rose john bull takes his vices as a ten pound voter takes a bribe he stretches his hand out eagerly enough but he turns his eyes away and looks innocent and is the first to point at his neighbor and cry out against moral corruption melvilles quite right that there is an eleventh commandmentthou shalt not be found outwhose transgression is the only one society visits with impunity true enough laughed jimmy fitzroy thank heaven nobody can accuse us of studying the law and the prophets overmuch by the way old fellow whos that stunning little girl you were walking with by the serpentine yesterday morning when i was waiting for the metcalfe who promised to meet me at twelve and never came till halfpast onethe most unpunctual woman going any new game shes a governess aint she shed some sort of brat with her but shes deuced good style anyhow thats little lestrange laughed godolphin the beloved bellas cousin hes met her there every day for the last three months i dont know how much further the affair may have gone or if my dear harry your imagination is running away with you said falkenstein impatiently i never made an appointment with her in my life shes not the same style as mrs metcalfe oh the jesuitism of the most candid men on occasion he never made an appointment with her because it was utterly unnecessary he knowing perfectly that he should find her feeding the ducks with julius adolphus any morning he chose to look for her all friendship is it then laughed godolphin stick to it my boy if you can take care what you do though for to carry her off to duke street would give max such a handle as he would not let go in a hurry and to marry though that of course will never enter your wildest dreams with anybody of the cashrangers race were it the heiress instead of the companion would be such a comedown to the princely house as would infallibly strike you out of count ferdinands will waldemar threw back his head like a thoroughbred impatient of the punishing the princely house as you call it is not so extraordinarily stainless but leave valerie alone she and i have nothing to do with other and never shall have i have enough on my hands in all conscience without plunging into another love affair i did hear continued godolphin that forester proposed to her but i dont suppose its true hed scarcely be such a fool falkenstein looked up quickly but did not speak i think it is true said bevan and moreover i fancy she refused him for he used to cry her up to the skies and now hes always snapping and sneering at her which is beastly ungenerous but after the manner of many fellows one would think you were an old woman tom believing all the tales you hear said godolphin shed better know you disclaim her falkenstein that she maynt waste her chances waiting for you waldemar cast a quick annoyed contemptuous glance upon him you are wonderfully careful over her interests he said sharply but i never heard that having her on your lips harry ever did a woman much good pass me that whisky conrad will you the next morning however though he disclaimed her waldemar about ten took his stick whistled his dog and walked down to kensington gardens under the beeches just budding their first leaves he saw what he expected to seevalerie lestrange she turnedeven at that distance he thought he saw the longs yeux bleus flash and sparkledropped the biscuits she was giving the ducks to the tender mercies of julius adolphus and came to meet him spit the little skye he had given her welcoming him noisily spit is as pleased to see you as i am said valerie laughing we have both been wondering whether you would come this morning i am so glad you have for i have been reading your pollnitz memoirs and want to talk to you about them you know i can talk to no one as i can to you you do me much honor said falkenstein rather formally he was wondering in his mind whether she had refused forester or not what a cold distant speech it is very unkind of you to answer me so what is the matter with you count waldemar she always called him by the title he had dropped in english society she had a fervent reverence for his historic antecedens and besides as she told him one day she liked to call him something no one else did matter with me nothing at all i assure you he answered still distantly you are not like yourself at all events persisted valerie you should be kind to me i have so few who are the tone touched him he smiled but did not speak as he sat down by her poking up the turf with his stick count waldemar said valerie suddenly brushing spits hair off his bright little eyes do tell me hasnt something vexed you nothing new answered falkenstein with a short laugh the same entanglements and annoyances that have been netting their toils round me for many yearsthat is all i am young enough as time counts yet i give you my word i have as little hope in my future and i know as well what my life will be as if i were fourscore hush dont say so said valerie with a gesture of pain you are so worthy of happiness your nature was made to be happy and if you are not fate has misused you cruelly fate there is no such thing i have been a fool and my folly is now working itself out i have made my own life and i have nobody but myself to thank for it i dont know that circumstances temptation education opportunity association often take the place of the parcae and gild or cut the threads of our destiny no i dont accept that doctrine said falkenstein always much sterner judge to himself than anybody would have been to him what i have done has been with my eyes open i have known the price i should pay for my pleasures but i never paused to count it i never stopped for any obstacle and for what i desired i would like the men in the old legends have sold myself to the devil now of course i am hampered with ten thousand embarrassments you are young you are a woman you cannot understand the reckless madness which will drink the wine today though ones life paid for it tomorrow screened from opportunity fenced in by education position and society you cannot know how impossible it is to a man whose very energies and strength become his tempters to put a check upon himself in the vortex of pleasure round him yes interrupted valerie i can feeling for you i can sympathise in all things with you had i been a man i should have done as you have done drunk the ambrosia without heeding its cost go oni love to hear you speak of yourself and i know your real nature count waldemar into whatever errors or hasty acts repented of in cooler moments the hot spirit of your race may have led you falkenstein was pleased despite himself half amused half saddened he turned it off with a laugh by heaven i wish they had made a brewer of mei might now be as rich and free from care as your uncle you a brewer cried valerie her father a poor gentleman had left her his aristocratic leanings what an absurd idea all the old falkensteins would come out of their crypts and chanceries and cloisters to see the coronet surmounting the beer vats he smiled at her vehemence the coronet i had better have full pockets than empty titles for shame cried valerie yes bark at him spit dear he is telling stories you do not mean it you know you are proud of your glorious name who would not rather be a falkenstein on a hundred a year than a cashranger on a thousand i wouldnt said waldemar wilfully if i had money i could find oblivion for my past and hope for my future if i had money what loads of friends would open their purses for me to borrow the money theyd know i did not need as it is if i except poor tom bevan whos as hard up as i am and whos a goodhearted singleminded fellow and likes me i believe i havent a friend godolphin welcomes me as a companion a bon vivant a good card player but if he heard i was in the queens bench or had shot myself hed say poor devil i am not surprised as he lighted his pipe and forgot me a second after so they would all i dont blame them but i do cried valerie her cheeks burning they are wicked and heartless and i hate them all oh count waldemar i would not do so i would not desert you if all the world did he smiled he was accustomed to her passionate ebullitions poor child i believe you would be truer than the rest he muttered half aloud as he rose hastily and took out his watch i must be in downing street by eleven and it only wants ten minutes if you will walk with me to the gates i have something to tell you about your ms iii scarlet and white makes a hit and falkenstein feels the weight of the golden fetters tom will you come to the theatre with me tonight said falkenstein as they lounged by the rails one afternoon in may the theatre what for whos that girl with a scarlet tie on that roan there i dont know her face the ballet is the only thing worth stirring a step for in town which theatre is it i am going to see the new piece pomps and vanities is bringing out and i want you as a sort of claqueur very well ill come said tom who regarded falkenstein who had been his school and formfellow still rather as a highlandman his chief but certainly the first night of a play is the very last i should select but if you wish it theres that roan coming round again good action hasnt it obedient to his chiefs orders bevan brushed his whiskers settled his tie or rather let his valet do it for him and accompanied waldemar to one of the crackup theatres where pomps and vanities as the manager was irreverently styled by the habitues of his greenroom reigned in a state of scenic magnificence very different to the days when garrick played macbeth in wig and gaiters bevan asked no questions he was rather a silent man and probably knew by experience that he would most likely get no answers unless the information was volunteered so settling in his own mind that it was the debut of some protegee of falkensteins he followed him to the door of a private box waldemar opened it and entered in it sat two women one a middleaged ladylikelooking person the other a young one in whom as she turned round with a radiant smile and gave falkenstein her hand bevan recognised valerie lestrange keep up your courage whispered waldemar as he took the seat behind her and leaned forward with a smile tom stared at them both it was high dutch to him but being endowed with very little curiosity and a lions share of british immovability he waited without any impatience for the elucidation of the mystery and seeing the count and valerie absorbed in earnest and lowtoned conversation he first studied the house and finding not a single decentlooking woman he dropped his glass and studied the playbill the bill announced the new piece as scarlet and white queer title thought bevan a little consoled for his selfimmolation by seeing that rosalie rivers a very pretty little brunette was to fill the soubrette role the curtain drew up tom looking at valerie instead of the stage fancied she looked very pale and her eyes were fixed not on the actors but on falkenstein the first act passed off in ominous silence an audience is often afraid to compromise itself by applauding a new piece too quickly then the story began to develop itselfwit and passion badinage and pathos were well intermingled it turned on the love of a catholic girl a fille dhonneur to catherine de medicis for a huguenot vicomte de valere a friend of conde and coligny the despairing love of the woman the fierce struggle of her lover between his passion and his faith the intrigues of the court the cruelty and weakness of charles neuf were all strikingly and forcibly written the actors being warmly applauded as the plot thickened and the audience became interested played with energy and spirit and when the curtain fell the success of scarlet and white was proclaimed through the house very good playvery good indeed said tom approvingly i hope youve been pleased miss lestrange valerie did not hear him she was trembling and breathless her blue eyes almost black with excitement while falkenstein bent over her his face more full of animation and pleasure than bevan had seen it for many a day well thought tom forester did say little val was original i should think that was a polite term for insane i suppose falkensteins keeper at that minute the applause redoubled pomps and vanities had announced scarlet and white for repetition and from the pit to the gods there was a cry for the author falkenstein bent his head till his lips touched her hair and whispered a few words she looked up in his face do you wish me certainly his word was law she rose and went to the front of the box a burning color in her cheeks smiles on her lips and tears lying under her lashes the devil waldemar do you mean thatthat little thing began bevan falkenstein nodded and tom for once in his life astonished forgot to finish his sentence in staring at the author probably the audience also shared his surprise in seeing her young face and girlish form in lieu of the anticipated member of the garrick or new bourcicault with inspiration drawn from cavendish and cognac for there was a moments silence and then they received her with such a welcome as had not sounded through the house for years she bowed two or three times to thank them then falkenstein knowing that though she had no shyness she was extremely excitable drew her gently back to her seat behind the curtain your success is too much for you he said softly no no said valerie passionately utterly forgetful that any one else was near her but i am so glad that i owe it all to you it would be nothing to me as you know unless it pleased you and it came to me through your hands falkenstein gave a short quick sigh and moved restlessly you would like to go home now wouldnt you he said after a pause she assented and he led her out of the box poor victimised tom following with her duenna who was the daily governess at no as their cab drove away valerie leaned out of the window and watched falkenstein as long as she could see him he waved his hand to her and walked on into regent street in silence hallo waldemar began bevan at length so your protegees turning out a star do you mean that she really wrote that play falkenstein nodded well its more than i could do but what the deuce have you got to do with it for a man who says he wont entangle himself with another love affair you seem pretty tolerably au mieux with her how did it all come about simply enough answered falkenstein of course i havent known her all these months without finding out her talents she has a passion for writing and writes well as i saw at once by those new years nights proverbs she has no money as you know she wants to turn her talents to account and didnt know how to set about it shed several conversations with me on the subject so i took her play looked it over and gave it to pomps and vanities he read it to oblige me and put it on the stage to oblige himself as he wanted something new for the season and was pretty sure it would make a hit do the cashrangers know of it no that is why she asked the governess to come with her tonight that stingy old pomps wouldnt pay her much but she thinks it an el dorado and i shall take care she commands her own price next time i count on a treat on enlightening miss bella yes shell cut up rough by george i quite envy you your young genius she isnt mine said falkenstein bitterly she might be if you chose poor little thingyes but love is too expensive a luxury for a ruined man even if the devil take this key why wont it unlock youre off to half a dozen parties i suppose tom and where are you going nowhere what going to bed at halfpast ten there is no particular sin in going to bed at halfpast ten is there said waldemar impatiently i havent the stuff in me for balls and such things im sick of them goodnight old fellow he went upstairs to his room threw himself on his bed and lighting his pipe lay smoking and thinking while the abbey clock tolled the hours one after another the longs yeux bleus haunted him for waldemar had already too many chains upon him not to shrink from adding to them the golden fetters of a fresh passion and marriage unless a rich one was certain to bring about him all his entanglements he resolved to seek her no more to check the demonstrative affection which like esmeralda a la fois naive et passionnee she had no thought of concealing from him and which as falkensteins conscience told him he had done everything to foster what is a man worth if he hasnt strength of will he muttered as he tossed on his bed and yet poor little valerie pshaw all women learn quickly enough to forget some ten days after he was calling in lowndes square true as yet to his resolution he had avoided the teteatete walks in the gardens and valerie keenly felt the change in his manner though in what he did for her he was as kind as ever the successful run of scarlet and white the praises of its talents its promises of future triumphsall the admiration which despite bellas efforts to keep her back the yeux bleus excitedall were valueless if as she vaguely feared she had lost count waldemar the play had made a great sensation and the cashrangers had taken a box the night before as they made a point of following the lead and seeing everything though they generally forswore theatres as not quite ton pah these people qui se couchent roturiers et se levent nobles they paint their lilies with such superabundant coloring that we see at a glance the flowers come not out of a conservatory but out of an atelier they were out as it chanced and valerie was alone she received him joyously for unhappy as she was in his absence the mere sight of his face recalled her old spirits and falkenstein in all probability never guessed a tithe she suffered because she had always a smile for him oh count waldemar she cried why have you never been to the gardens this week if you only knew how i miss you i have had no time he answered coldly you could make time if you wished said valerie passionately you are so cold so unkind to me lately have i vexed you at all vexed me miss lestrange certainly not she was silent chilled despite herself why do you call me miss lestrange she said suddenly you know i cannot bear it from you what should i call you valerie she answered softly he got up and walked to the hearthrug playing with spit and puppet with his foot and for once hailed as a relief the entrance of bella in an extensive morning toilet fresh from shopping she looked rapidly and angrily from him to valerie and attacked him at once seeing her cousins vivacity told she went in for the same stakes with but slight success being a young lady of the heavy artillery stamp with no light action about her oh mr falkenstein she began that exquisite playyouve seen it of course captain boville told me i should be delighted with it and so i was dont you think it enchanting it is very clever answered falkenstein gravely val missed a great treat continued bella nothing would make her go last night however she never likes anything i like i should love to know who wrote it some people say a woman but i would never believe it the witty raillery and unselfish devotion of the heroine might be dictated by a womans head and heart but the passion and vigor and knowledge of human nature indicate a masculine genius replied waldemar valerie gave him such a grateful rapturous glance that had bella been looking might have disclosed the secret but she was studying her dainty gloves and went on could it be westland marstonsterling coyne falkenstein shook his head if it were they would put their name on the playbills you naughty man i do believe you could tell me if you chose are you not now in the authors confidence the corner of falkensteins mouth went up in an irresistible smile as he telegraphed a glance at the author well perhaps i am bella clapped her hands with enchanting gaiety then tell me this moment i am in agonies to know it is no great mystery smiled falkenstein i fancy you are acquainted with the unknown you dont mean it cried bella in a state of ecstasy have you written it then im afraid i cant lay claim to the honor who can it be oh do tell me how enchanting cried miss cashranger i am wild to hear somebody i know you say is itis it captain tweed no it isnt laughed falkenstein elliot tweedidiot tweed as they all call himwho was hanging after bella abhorred all caligraphy and wrote his own name with one e mr dashaway then dash never scrawled anything but i o us lord flippertygibbett perhaps wrong again flip took up a pen once too often when he signed his marriage register to have any leanings to goose quills charlie montmorency then reads nothing but his bettingbook and bells life dear me how tiresome who can it be wait a moment let me see is it major powell guess again he wouldnt write save in indian fashion with his tomahawk on his enemies scalps how provoking cried bella exasperated stop is it mr beauchamp no he scribbles for sixandeightpences too perseveringly to have time for anything except ruining his clients dr montressor then try once more his prescriptions bring him too many guineas for him to waste ink on any other purpose how stupid i am perhapsperhaps yet no it cant be because hes at the cape and most likely killed poor fellow could it be cecil green falkenstein laughed you neednt go so far as kaffirland try a little nearer home think over the ladies you know the ladies then it is a woman cried bella well i should never have believed it who can she be how i shall admire her and envy her a lady can it be darling flora no if your pet friend can get through an invitationnote of four lines the exertion costs her at least a dram of sal volatile how wicked you are murmured miss cashranger delighted after the custom of women to hear her friend pulled to pieces is it mrs lushington then wrong again the lushington has so much business on hand inditing rosehued notes to twenty men at once and wording them differently for fear they may ever be compared that shes no time for other composition lady mechlin perhapsshe is a charming creature falkenstein shook his head never could learn the simplest rule of grammar when she was engaged to mechlin she wrote her loveletters out of henrietta temple and flattered him immensely by their pathos was there ever such a sarcastic creature cried bella reprovingly her interest rather flagged since no man was the incognito author well let me see there is rosa templeshe is immensely intellectual but immensely orthodox every minute of her life is spent in working slippers and bible markers for interesting curates it is to be hoped one of them may reward her some day though i believe till they do propose she is in the habit of advocating priestly celibacy by way of assertion of her disinterestedness no miss cashranger the talented writer of scarlet and white is not only of your acquaintance but your family my family almost screamed bella good gracious mr falkenstein is it dear papa oror augustus the idea of the brewer fat and round and innocent of literature as one of his own teams or of his son just plucked for his smalls at cambridge for spelling caesar sesar sitting down to indite the pathos and poetry of scarlet and white was so exquisitely absurd that waldemar forgetting courtesy lay back in his armchair and laughed aloud the contagion of his ringing laugh was irresistible valerie followed his example and their united merriment rang in the astonished ears of miss cashranger who looked from one to the other in wrathful surprise as soon as he could control himself falkenstein turned towards her with his most courteous smile you will forgive our laughter i am sure when i tell you what i am certain must give you great pleasure that the play you so warmly and justly admire was written by your cousin bella stared at him her face scarlet all the envy and reasonless spite within her flaming up at the idea of her cousins success valerievalerie she stammered is it true i had no idea she ever thought of no said falkenstein roused in his protegees defence i dare say you are astonished as every one else would be that any one so young and comparatively speaking so inexperienced as your cousin should have developed such extraordinary talent and power oh of courseto be sureyes said bella her lips twitching nervously mamma will be astonished to hear of these new laurels for the family i congratulate you valerie i never knew you dreamt of writing much less of making so public a debut nor should i ever have been able to do so unless my way had been pioneered for me said valerie resting her eyes fondly on waldemar he stayed ten minutes longer chatting on indifferent subjects then left making poor little val happy with a touch of his hand and a smile as kind as of old you horrid deceitful little thing began bella bursting with fury as the door closed on him never to mention what you were doing i cant bear such sly people i hate my dear bella dont disturb yourself said valerie quietly if you had testified any interest in my doings you might have known them as it was i was glad to find warmer and kinder friends in waldemar falkenstein i suppose sneered bella white with rage a nice friend you have certainly a man whom everybody knows may go to prison for debt any day leave him alone said valerie haughtily unless you speak well of him in my presence you shall not speak at all oh indeed laughed bella nervously how very much interested you are in him more than he is in you im afraid dear hes famed for loving and leaving pray how long has this romantic affair been on the tapis hes met her every day in the gardens cried julius adolphus just come in with that fatal apropos of enfans terribles much oftener the result of mechancete than of innocence hes met her every day bella while i fed the ducks bella rose inflated with fury and summoning all her dignity i suppose valerie you know the sort of reputation you will get through these morning assignations valerie bent over spit with a smile of course it is nothing to me continued bella spitefully but i shall consider it my duty to inform mamma valerie fairly laughed out do your duty by all means and continued bella a third time i dare say she will find some means to put a stop to this absurd friendship with an unmarried and unprincipled man valerie was roused she lifted her head like a little pythoness and her blue eyes flashed angry scorn tell your mamma what you please butlisten to me bellaif you venture to harm him in any way with your pitiful venom i girl as i am will never let you go till i have revenged myself and him bella like most bullies was a terrible coward there was an earnestness in valeries words and a dangerous light in her eyes that frightened her and she left the room in silence while valerie leaned her forehead on spits silky back and cried bitterly tears that for her life she wouldnt have shed while her cousin was there the next time falkenstein called at lowndes square the footman told him not at home and waldemar swore mentally as he turned from the door for though he could keep himself from seeking her it was something new not to find her when he wished shes like all the rest he thought bitterly shes used me and now shes gone to newer friends i was a fool to suppose any woman would do otherwise theyll tell her i cant marry of course shell go over to dorwood or some of those confounded fools that are dangling after her so in his skeptical haste judged falkenstein on the strength of a single not at home due to cashranger malice and the fierce throbs the mere suspicion gave him showed him that he loved valerie too much to be able to deceive himself any longer with the assurance that his feelings towards his protegee was simple friendship he knew it but he was loth to give way to it he had long held as a doctrine that a man could forget if he chose he had been wearied of so many been disappointed in so much he had had idols of the hour in which their first gloss off he had found no beauty he could not tell it might not be the same with valerie warm and passionate as a southern haughty and reserved as a northern he held many a bitter conflict in his solitary vigils at night over his pipe after evenings spent in society which no longer amused him or excitement with which he vainly sought to drown his cares when he did meet valerie out which was rarely as he refused most invitations now his struggle against his illtimed passion made his manner so cold and capricious that valerie who could not divine the workings of his heart began despite her vehement faith in him and conviction that he was not wholly indifferent to her to dread that bella might be right and that as he had left others so would he leave her he gave her no opportunity of questioning him as to his sudden change for when he did call in lowndes square bella and her aunt always stationed themselves as a sort of detective police and falkenstein now never sought a teteatete one evening she met him at a dinnerparty with undisguised delight she watched his entrance and waldemar seeing her radiant face thought in his haste she is happy enough what does she care for me if he had looked at her after he had shaken hands carelessly with her and turned away to talk to another woman he would have discovered his mistake but when do we ever discover half our errors before it is too late she signed to him to come to her under pretext of looking at some croquis and whispered hurriedly count waldemar what have i donewhy do you never come to see me you are so changed so altered i was not aware of it but i never see you in the gardens now you never talk to me you never call on me i have other engagements valerie breathed hard between her set teeth that are more agreeable to you i suppose you should not have accustomed me to what you intended to withdraw when it ceased to amuse you i am not so capricious your kindness about my play it was no kindness i would have done the same for any one she looked at him fixedly general kindness is no kindness said valerie passionately if you would do for a mere acquaintance what you would do for your friend what value attaches to your friendship i attach none to it said the count coldly valeries little hands clenched hard she did not speak lest her selfpossession should give way and just then dorwood came to give her his arm in to dinner and at dinner valerie demonstrative and candid as she was was gay and animated for she could wear a mask in the bal dopera of life as well as he and though she could not believe the coldness he testified was really meant she felt bitterly the neglect of his manner before others at sight of which bellas small eyes sparkled with malicious satisfaction iv some golden fetters are shaken off and others are put on mrs boville told me last night that waldemar falkenstein is so dreadfully in debt that she thinks hell have to go into courtdont they call it lisped bella the next morning be arrested or bankrupt or something dreadful should you think it is true i know its true said idiot tweed who was there having a little music before luncheon hes confoundedly hard up poor devil but i thought he was in such a good positionso well off said bella observing with secret delight that her cousins head was raised and that the pen with which she was writing had stopped in its rapid gallop ah so one thinks of a good many fellows answered the guardsman or at least you ladies do who dont look at a mans ins and outs and the fifty hundred things there are to bother him lots of peoplehouseholders and all that sort of thingthat one would fancy worth no end go smash when nobodys expecting it and mr falkenstein really is embarrassed the guardsman laughed outright that is a mild term miss cashranger i heard down at windsor yesterday from a man that knows his family very well that if he dont pay his debts this week amadeus levi will arrest him i dare say he will jews do when they cant bleed you any longer and think your family will come down handsomely but they say the old count wont give falkenstein a rap so most likely hell cut the country that afternoon on his return from the deeds and chronicles office whose slow redtapeism ill suited his impatient and vigorous intellect waldemar sat down deliberately to investigate his affairs it was true that amadeus levis patience was waning fast his debts of honor had put him deep in that worthys books and falkenstein as he sat in his lodgings with the august sun streaming full on the relentless figures that showed him with cruel mathematical ruthlessness that he was fast chained in the golden fetters of debt leaned his head upon his arms with the bitter despair of a man whose own hand has blotted his past and ruined his future the turning of the handle of his door roused him from his reverie he looked up quickly a lady wants to speak to you sir said the servant who waited on him what name shed rather not give it sir very well said falkenstein consigning all women to the devil show her up resigning himself to his fate he rose leaning his hand on the arm of the chair he started involuntarily as the door opened again valerie she looked up at him half hesitatingly count waldemar dont be angry with me angry no heaven knows but her face and her voice were fast thawing his chill reserve and he stopped abruptly you wonder why i have come here valerie went on singularly shyly for her butbut i heard that youyou have much to trouble you just now is it true true enough heaven knows thenthen said valerie with all her old impetuosity let me do something for youlet me help you in some wayyou who have done everything for me who have been the only person kind to me on earth do let medo not refuse me i would die to serve you he breathed fast as he gazed on her expressive eyes it was a hard struggle to him to preserve his selfcontrol no one can help me he answered hurriedly i have made my own fateleave me to it i will not cried valerie passionately do not send me awaydo not refuse me what happiness would there be for me so great as serving youyou to whom i owe all the pleasure i have known take them count waldemarpray take them they have often told me they are worth a good deal and i will thank heaven every hour for having enabled me to aid you ever so little she pressed into his hands a jewelcase falkenstein could not answer her he stood looking down at her his lips white as death she mistook his silence for displeasure and laid her hands on his arm do not be offendeddo not be annoyed with me they are my ownan old heirloom of the lestranges that only came to me the other day take them count waldemar do for heavens sake i spoke passionately to you last night i have been unhappy ever since if you will not take them i shall think you have not yet forgiven me he seized her hands and drew her close to him good heavens do you love me like this she did not answer but she looked up at him that look shivered to atoms falkensteins resolves and cast his pride and prudence to the winds he pressed her fiercely against his heart he kissed her again and again bitter tears rushing to his burning eyes valerie valerie he whispered wildly my fate is at its darkest will you share it she leaned her brow on his shoulder trembling with hysterical joy you do care for me then she murmured at last oh thank heaven in the delirium of his happiness in the vehemence of feelings touched to the core by sight of the intense love he had awakened falkenstein poured out on her all the passion of his impetuous and reserved nature and in the paradise of the moment forgot every cloud that hung on his horizon valerie he whispered at length i have now nothing to offer you i can give you none of the riches and power and position that other men can she stopped him putting her hands on his lips hush i shall have everything that life can give me in having your love my darling heaven bless you cried falkenstein passionately but think twice valeriepause before you decide i am a ruined manembarrassments fetter me on every side tomorrow for aught i know i may be arrested for debt i would not lead you into what in older years you may regret regret cried valerie clinging to him how can i ever regret that i have won the one heaven i crave if you love me life will always be beautiful in my eyes and count waldemar i can work for youi can help you be it ever so little i cannot make much money now but you have said that i shall gain more year after year only let me be with you let me know your sorrows and lighten them if i can and i could ask no greater happiness falkenstein bent over her and covered with caresses the lips that to him seemed so eloquent he had no words to thank her for a love that to his warm and solitary heart came like water in the wilderness the sound of voices gay and laughing on the stairs startled him that is bevan and godolphin i forgot they were coming for me to go down to the castle good heavens they mustnt see you here love to jest about you over their messtables stay said falkenstein hastily as the men entered the front room wait here a moment they cannot see you in this window and i will come to you again hallo old fellows said he passing through the foldingdoors youre wonderfully punctual tom i always give you half an hours grace but i suppose harrys such an awful martinet that he kept you up to time for once all the credits due to my mare laughed godolphin she did the distance from knightsbridge in four minutes and i dont think musjid himself could beat that are you ready i say because were to be at the castle by six and fitz dont like waiting for his turbot give me a brace of seconds and i shall be with you said waldemar make haste theres a good fellow by george said harry catching sight of the jewelcase for a fellow whos so deucedly hard up youve been pretty extravagant in getting those diamonds waldemar who are they forrosalie rivers or the deloraine or that last love of yours that wonderful little lestrange falkensteins brow grew dark he snatched the case from the table with a suppressed oath and went back to the inner room slamming the foldingdoors after him godolphin lounged to the window looking on the street where he stood for five minutes whistling a te o cara the devil whats that fellow about he said yawning how impatient bonbons growing why dont that fool roberts drive her up and down by jove come here tom whos that girl falkensteins now putting into a cab thats what he wanted his brace of seconds for confound that portico i cant see her face and women dress so much alike now theres no telling one from another what an infernal while he is bidding her goodby i shall know another time what his two seconds mean there the cabs off at last thank heavenvery pretty falkenstein he began as the count entered thats your game is it i think you might have confided in your bosom friend who is the fair one come make a clean breast of it falkenstein shook his head my dear harry spare your words dont you know of old that you never get anything out of me unless i choose oh yes confound you i know that pretty well one question thoughwas she pretty do you suppose i entertain plain women no never was such a man for the beaux yeux it looked uncommonly like little lestrange but i dont suppose she could get out of the durance vile of lowndes square to come and pay you a teteatete call well are you ready now because bonbons tired of waiting and so are we a man in love makes an abominable friend a man in love with himself makes a worse one said waldemar which hit harry in a vulnerable spot godolphin being generally chaffed about the affection he bore his own person that was the little lestrange wasnt it asked godolphin as they leaned out of the window after dinner apart from the others yes said waldemar curtly but i beg you to keep silence on it to every one to be sure ive kept plenty of your confidences i had no idea youd push it so far of course you wont be fool enough to marry her falkensteins dark eyes flashed fire i shall not be fool enough to consult or confide in any man upon my private affairs godolphin shrugged his shoulders with commiseration and left waldemar alone in his window falkenstein called in lowndes square the morning after and had an interview with old cash in the library of gaudy books that were never opened and told him concisely that he loved his niece andthat ever i should live to record itthat little snob with not two ideas in his head who couldnt if put to it tell you who his own grandfather was and who owed his tolerance in society to his banking account refused an alliance with the refined intellect and the blue blood of one of the proud courtly historic falkensteins hed been tutored by his wife and said his lesson properly refusing to sanction any such connexion of course his niece must act for herself waldemar bowed himself out with all his haughtiest highbreeding he knew valerie would act for herself but the insult cut him to the quick he threw himself into the train and went down to fairlie his governors place in devonshire determining to sacrifice his pride and ask his father to aid him in his effort for freedom in the drawingroom he found his sister virginia a cold proud woman of the world she scarcely let him sit down and inquire for the governor before she pounced on him waldemar i have heard the most absurd report about you most reports are absurd yes of course but this is too ridiculous what do you think it is i am sure i cant say that you are going to marry well well you take it very quietly if you were going to make a good match i should be the first to rejoice but they say that you are engaged to some niece of that odious vulgar parvenu cashranger the brewer that little bold thing who wrote that play that made a noise a little while ago pray set me at rest at once and say it is not true i should be very sorry if it were not his sister looked at him in haughty horror waldemar you must be mad if you were rich it would be intolerable to stoop to such a connexion but laden with debts as you are to disgrace the family with such disgrace repeated falkenstein scornfully she would honor any family she entered you talk like a boy of twenty said virginia impatiently to load yourself with a penniless wife when you are on the brink of ruinto introduce to us the niece of a lowbred pushing plebeianto give your name to a bold manoeuvring girl who has the impudence to take her stand before a crowded theatre hold broke out waldemar fiercely you might thank heaven virginia if you were as frankhearted and as free from guile as she is she thinks no ill and therefore she is not like you fine ladies on the constant qui vive lest it should be attributed to her i have found at last a woman too generous to be mistrustful too fond to wait for the worlds advantages and moreover untainted by the breath of your conventionalities and pride and cant virginia threw back her head with a curl on her lip you are mad as i said before i suppose you do not expect me to countenance your infatuation he shrugged his shoulder really whether you do or not is perfectly immaterial to me virginia was silent pale with anger for they were all pardonably enough proud she turned with a sneer to josephine a younger and less decided woman just entering josephine you are come in time to be congratulated on your sisterinlaw is it true murmured josephine aghast oh my dear waldemar pause consider how dreadful for usa person who is so horribly connected the mans beer wagon is now standing at the door oh do reflecta girl whose name is before the public by talent that would grace a queen interrupted waldemar rising impatiently you waste your words you might know that i am not so weak as to give up my sole chance of happiness to please your pitiful prejudices very well i shall never speak to her said virginia between her teeth that you will do as you please you will be the loser but waldemar do consider began josephine your womens tongues would drive a man mad muttered falkenstein tell me where my father is in his study answered virginia briefly and in his study falkenstein found him he saw at once that something was wrong by his reception but he plunged at once into his affairs showing him plainly his position and asking him frankly for help to discharge his debts count ferdinand heard him in silence waldemar he answered after a long pause you shall have all you wish i will sign you a check for the amount this instant if you give me your word to break off this miserable affair falkensteins cheek flushed with annoyance he had expected sympathy from his father or at least toleration that is impossible you ask me to give up the one thing that binds me to lifethe one love i have given methe one chance of redeeming the future that lies in my grasp i am not a boy led away by a passing caprice i have known and tried everything and i can judge what will make my happiness what unfortunate prejudice have you all formed against my poor little valerie enough said his father sternly i address you as a man of the world and a man of sense you answer me with infatuated folly i give you your choice my aid and esteem in everything you can desire or the madmans gratification of the illplaced caprice of the hour falkenstein rose as haughtily as the count virtually then you give me no choice i am sorry i troubled you with my concerns i know whose interference i have to thank for it and am only astonished you are so easily influenced said falkenstein setting his teeth hard as he closed the door for his fathers easy desertion of him hit him hard and he attributed it rightly enough to maximilian who industriously gathering every grain of evil report against his brother had taken such a character of valeriewhom unluckily he had seen coming out of duke streetdown to fairlee that his father vowed to disinherit him and his sisters never to speak to him the doors both of his own home and lowndes square were closed to him and in his adversity the only one that clung to him was valerie if he had been willing to ask them none of his friends could have helped him godolphin with l a year spent every shilling on himself tom bevan but that he stood for a pocket borough of his governors would have been in quod long ago and for the others men very willing to take your money at ecarte are not very willing to lend you theirs when you can play ecarte no longer amadeus levi grew more and more importunate down on him at once as falkenstein knew would come the jews griffes if he took any such unprofitable step as a marriage for love and with all the passion in the world mesdemoiselles a man thinks twice before he throws himself into the insolvent court one night nolens volens decision was forced on him he had seen valerie that morning in the pantheon and they had parted to meet again at a ball one of the lingering stragglers of the past season about twelve he dressed and walked down duke street looking for a cab to take him to park lane under a lamp at the corner standing reading he saw a man whom he knew by sight and whose errand he guessed without hesitation he paused unnoticed close beside him he stood a moment and glanced over his shoulder he saw a warrant for his own apprehension at levis suit the man looking to make sure of the dress never raised his eyes falkenstein walked on hailed a hansom in regent street and in a quarter of an hour was chatting with his hostess where is miss lestrange he asked carelessly she was waltzing with tom a moment ago answered mrs eden if you run after her so i shall believe report but is anything the matter falkenstein how ill you look too much champagne laughed waldemar ive been dining with gourmet and all the falkensteins inherit the desire of obtaining that gentlemanlike curse the gout its not the gout mon ami smiled mrs eden break your engagement and waltz with me he whispered ten minutes after to valerie i have none i kept them all free for you he put his arm round her and whirled her into the circle count waldemar you are not well has anything fresh occurred she asked anxiously as she felt the quick throbs of his heart and saw the dark circles of his eyes and the deepened lines round his haughty mouth not much dearest i will tell you in a moment she was silent and he led her through the different rooms into mrs edens boudoir which he knew was generally deserted and there holding her close to him but not looking into her eyes lest his strength should fail him he told her that he must leave england and asked her if he should go alone she caught both his hands and kissed them passionately no no do not leave metake me with you wherever it be oh that i were rich for your sake i who would die for you can do nothing to help you he pressed her fiercely to him oh valerie heaven bless you for your love that renders the darkest hour of my life the brightest but weigh well what you do my darling i am utterly ruined i cannot insure you from privation in the future perhaps not from absolute want if i make money much must go in honor year by year to the payment of my debts by instalments i shall take you from all the luxuries and the society that you are formed for do not sacrifice yourself blindly sacrifice myself interrupted valerie oh waldemar if it is no sacrifice to you let me be with you wherever it be and if you have cares and toil and sorrow let me share them i will write for you work for you do anything for you only let me be with you he pressed his lips to hers silent with the tumult of passion happiness delirious joy regret remorse that arose in him at her words my guardian angel be it as you will he said at length i must be out of england tomorrow valerie will you come with me as my wife early on sunday morning falkenstein was married and out of his host of friends and relatives and acquaintance honest tom bevan was the only man who turned him off as tom phrased it and bid him good bye with few words but much regret concealed after the manner of britons for the loss of his old chum toms congratulations were the only ones that fell on valeries ear in the empty church that morning but i question if valerie ever noticed the absence of the marriage paraphernalia so entirely were her heart and eyes and mind fixed on the one whom she followed into exile they were out of london before their part of it had begun to lounge down to their late breakfasts and as they crossed the channel and the noon sun streamed on the white line of cliffs falkenstein holding her hands in his and looking down into her eyes forgot the follies of his past the insecurity of his future the tale of his ruin and his flight that would be on the tongues of his friends on the morrow and only remembered the love that came to him when all others forsook him v the silver chimes ring in a happy new year one december evening falkenstein sat in his lodgings in vienna the wood fire burnt brightly and if its flames lighted up a room whose appanages were rather different to the palace his grandfather had owned in the imperial city they at least shone on waving hair and violet eyes that were very dear to him and helped to teach him to forget much that he had forfeited from england he had come to vienna where as he had projected his uncle one of the cabinet had been able to help him to a diplomatic situation for which his keen judgment and varied information fitted him and in austria his name gave him at once a brevet of the highest nobility of course the knowledge that he was virtually outlawed and that he was deep in the debt of such sharps as amadeus levi often galled his proud and sensitive nature but valerie knew how to soften and to soothe him and under her caressing affection or her ready vivacity the dark hours passed away he was smoking his favorite briarwood pipe with valerie sitting at his feet reading him some copy just going to her publishers in england and little spit not forgotten in their flight lying on the hearth when a deep english voice startled them singing out here you are at last i give you my word ive been driving over this blessed city two hours to find you tom cried falkenstein captain bevan echoed valerie springing to her feet while spit began barking furiously bevan shook hands with them heartily glad to see his friend again though of course he grumbled more about the snow and the stupidity of the viennese than anything else very jolly rooms youve got said he at last and pon my life you look better than ive seen you do a long time waldemar madame has done wonders for you madame laughed and glanced up at falkenstein who smiled half sadly she has taught me how to find happiness tom i wish you may get such a teacher thank you so do i if my time ever comes but geniuses aux longs yeux bleus are rare in the world but youre wondering why im here aint you i was flattering myself you were here to see us well of course and very glad to see you too but im come in part as your governors messenger valerie saw him look up quickly a flush on his face my father yes that rascalyou know i always said he was good for nothing a fool that couldnt smoke a queen without being sicki mean your brother maximillianwas at the bottom of the counts row with you last week i was dining at old fitzs and your father and sisters were there and when the women were gone i asked him when hed last heard of you of course he looked tempestuous and said never happily im not easily shut up so i told him it was a pity then for if he did hed hear you were jollier than ever and i said your wife was well i wont say what for fear we spoil this young lady and make her vain of herself the old boy turned pale and said nothing but two days after i got a line from him saying he wasnt quite well would i go down and speak to him i found him chained with the gout and he began to talk about you i like that old man waldemar i do uncommonly he said hed been too hasty but that it was a family failing and that max had brought him suchwell such confounded liesabout valerie that he would have shot you rather than see you give her your name now he wants to have you back id nothing to do so i said id come and ask you to forgive the poor old boy and come and see him for he isnt well i know you will falkenstein because you never did bear malice oh yes he will murmured valerie tears in her eyes i separated you waldemar you will let me see you reconciled my darling yes poor old governor and falkenstein stopped and smoked vigorously for kindness always touched him to the heart bevan looked at him and was silent i say he whispered when he was a moment alone with valerie i didnt tell waldemar because i thought youd break it to him less blunderingly than i should but the old counts breaking fast i doubt if hell live another week bevan was right in another week falkenstein stood by the deathbed of his father he had a long interview with him alone in which the old count detailed to him the fabricated slanders with which his brother had blackened valeries name with all his old passion he disowned the son capable of such baseness and constituted waldemar his sole heir save the legacies left his daughters he died in waldemars arms the night they arrived in england with his last word to him and valerie whom despite virginias opposition he insisted on seeing falkensteins sorrow for his father was deep and unfeigned like his character but his guardian angel as he used to call her was there to console him and under the light of her smile sorrow could not long pursue him on his brother always his own enemy and now the traducer of the woman he loved waldemars wrath fell heavily and would to a certainty have found some means of wreaking itself but for the last wishes of his father as it was he took a nobler yet a more complete revenge the day of the funeral when they were assembled for the reading of the will maximilian unconscious of his doom came with his gentle face and tender melancholy air to inherit as he believed fairlie and all the personal property stunned as by a spent ball horrorstruck disbelieving his senses he heard his younger brother proclaimed the heir it was a serious thing to him moreover forfor a man of large expenses and great ostentationhis own means were small to secure every shilling he had schemed and planned and lied and now every shilling was taken from him like the dog of aesopian memory trying to catch two pieces of meat he had lost his own after the last words were read waldemar stood a moment irresolute then he lifted his head his dark eyes bright and clear his mouth fixed and firm a proud calm displacing his old look of passion and of care he went up to his brother with a generous impulse and held out his hand maximilian from our boyhood you never liked me and of late you have done me a great wrong but i am willing to believe that you did it from a mistaken motive and by me at least it shall never be recalled my father in his wish to make amends for the one harsh act of his life to me has made a will which i know you consider unjust i cannot dispute his last desire that i should inherit fairlie but i can do what i know he would sanctiondivide with you the wealth his energy collected take the half of the property as if he had left it to you and over his grave let us forget the past on the last day of the year so eventful to them both falkenstein and valerie drove through the park at fairlie the role of a country gentleman would have been the last into which waldemar with his independent opinions and fastidious intellect would have sunk but he was fond of the place from early associations and he came down to take possession the tenantry and servants welcomed him heartily for they had often used to wish that the wild highspirited child who rode his shetland over the country at a headlong pace and if he sometimes teased their lives out always gave them a kind word and merry laugh had been the heir instead of the one to whom they applied the old proverb still and ill the tenantry had been dismissed the dinner finished even the briarwood pipe smoked out and in the wide elizabethan window of the library falkenstein stood looking on the clear bright night and watching the old year out you sent the deed of gift today to maximilian said valerie clasping both her hands on his arm yes he does not take it very graciously but perhaps we can hardly expect that from a man who has been disinherited i question if i should accept it at all but you could never have wronged another as he wronged you cried valerie oh waldemar i think i never realised fully till the day you took your generous revenge how noble how good how above all others you are he smiled and put his hand on her lips good noble silly child those words may do for some spotless gahlahad or folko not for me who a month ago was in debt to some of the greatest blackguards in town who have yielded to every temptation given way to every weakness not with the excuse of a boy new to life but willfully and recklessly knowing both the pleasures and their pricei who but for your love and my fathers should now be a solitary exile paying for my past follies with be quiet interrupted valerie with her passionate vivacity as different as was mirabeau juge par sa famille et mirabeau juge par le peuple are you judged by your enemies and judged by those who love you granted you have had temptations follies errors so has every man of high spirit and generous temper and i value you far more coming out of a fiery furnace with so much of pure gold that the flames could not destroy than if you were some ascetic pharisee who has never succumbed because he has never been tempted and born with no weaknesses is born with no warmer virtues either falkenstein laughed as he looked down at her you little goose well at least you have eloquence valerie if not truth on your side and your sophistry is dear to me as it springs out of your love but it is not sophistry she cried with an energetic stamp of her foot if you will not listen to philosophy concede at least to fact which is most worthy of my epithetsnoble and goodwaldemar falkenstein or maximillian and yet maximillian has been quiet and virtuous from his youth upwards and always wins white balls from the ballot of society well you shall have the privilege of your sexthe last word smiled waldemar more especially as the last word is on my side hark interrupted valerie quiet and subdued in a second the clock is striking twelve silently with her arms round his neck they listened to the parting knell of the old year stealing quietly away from its place among men from the church towers through england tolled the twelve strokes with a melancholy echo telling a world that its dead past was laid in a sealed grave and the stone of never more was rolled to the door of the sepulchre the old year was gone with all its sins and errors its golden gleams and midnight storms its midsummer days of sunshine for some its winter nights of starless gloom for others its last knell echoed and then from the old grey belfries in villages and towns over the stirring cities and the sleeping hamlets over the quiet meadows and stretching woodlands and grand old forest trees rang the silver chimes of the new year it shall be a happy new year to you my darling if my love can make it so whispered waldemar as the musical bells clashed out in wild harmony under the winter stars she looked up into his eyes i must be happy since it will be passed with you do you remember waldemar the night i saw you first my telling you new yearsday was my birthday and wondering where you and i should spend the next i liked you strangely from the first but how little i foresaw that my whole life was to hang on yours as little as i foresaw when after heavy losses at godolphins i watched the old year out in my chambers a tired ruined hopeless aimless man with not one on whom i could rely for help or sympathy in my need that i should stand here now free clear from debt with all my old entanglements shaken off my old scores wiped out my darker errors forgotten my worst enemy humbled and my own future bright oh valerie heaven bless you for the love that followed me into exile he drew her closer to him as he spoke and as he felt the beating of the heart that was always true to him and the soft caress of the lips that had always a smile for him falkenstein looked out over the wide woodland that called him master glistening in the clear starlight and as he listened to the silver chimesjoyous herald of the newborn yearhe blessed in his inmost heart the golden fetters of love slander and sillery slander and sillery i the lion of the chaussee dantin ma mere est a paris mon pere est a versailles et moi je suis ici pour chanter sur la paille lamour lamour la nuit comme le jour humming this popular if not overrecherche ditty a man sat sketching in pastels one morning in his rooms at numero rue des mauvais sujets chaussee d antin paris the band of the national guard the marchands crying coco the charlatans puffing everything from elixirs to leadpencils the empress and mme dalve passing in their carriage the tramp of some zouaves just returned from algerianothing in the street below disturbed him he went sketching on as if his life depended on the completion of the picture he was a man about thirtythree middle height and eminently graceful he was half bohemian half english and the animation of the one nation and the hauteur of the other were by turns expressed on his chiselled features as his thoughts moved with his pencil the stamp of his good blood was on him his face would have attracted and interested in ever so large a crowd he was very pale and there was a tired look on his wide powerful forehead and in his long dark eyes and a weary line or two about his handsome mouth as if he had exhausted his youth very quickly and indeed to see life as he had seen it is somewhat a fatiguing process and apt to make one blase before ones time the rooms in which he sat were intensely comfortable and very provocative to a quiet pipe and idleness to be sure if one judged his tastes by them they were not probably to use the popular jargon healthy for they had nothing very domestic or john halifaxish about them and were certainly not calculated to gratify the eyes of maiden aunts and spinster sisters there were fencingfoils pistols tobaccoboxes of every style and order from balletgirls to terriers heads there were three or four cockatoos and parrots on stands chattering bits of quartier latin songs or imitating the cries in the street below there were cards diceboxes albums a rire meerschaums lorgnons pink notes no end of de kocks and lebruns books and all the etcaeteras of chambres de garcon strewed about and there were things toopictures statuettes fauteuils and a breakfastservice of sevres and silverthat du barry need not have scrupled to put in her petite bonbonniere at luciennes so busy was he sketching and singing messieurs les etudiens montez a la chaumiere that he never heard a knock at his door and he looked up with an impatient frown on his white broad forehead as a man entered sans ceremonie mon dieu ernest cried his friend what the devil are you doing here with your pipe and your pastels when ive been waiting at tortonis a good halfhour and at last out of patience drove here to see what on earth had become of you my dear fellow i beg you a thousand pardons said vaughan lazily i was sketching this and you and your horses went clean out of my head i honestly confess and your breakfast too it seems said de concressault glancing at the table is it madame de melusine or the little bluette whose portrait absorbs you so much no by jove its a prettier woman than either of em if shes like that take me to see her this instant what glorious gold hair i adore your countrywomen when theyve hair that color where did you get that face is she a duchess or a danseuse a little actress youre going to patronise or a millionnaire youre going to marry i cant tell you laughed vaughan ive not an idea who she may be i saw her last evening coming out of the francais and picked up her bouquet for her as she was getting into her carriage the face was young the smile very pretty and bright and as they daguerreotyped themselves in my mind i thought i might as well transfer them to paper before newer beauties chased them out of it diable and you dont know who she is however well soon find out that gold hair mustnt be lost but get your breakfast pray ernest and let us be off to poor armands sale thats the way we mourn our dead friends said vaughan with a sneer pouring out his coffee armand is jesting laughing and smoking with us one day the next hes pitched out of his carriage going down to asnieres and all we think of isthat his horses are for sale if i were found in the morgue tomorrow your first emotion emile would be vaughans de lorme will be sold i must go and bid for it directly de concressault laughed as he looked up at a miniature of marion de lorme once taken for the marquis of gordon i fancy mon garcon therell be too many sharks after all your possessions for me to stand any chance true enough said vaughan and i question if theyll wait till my death before they come down on em but i dont look forward i take life as it comes vogue la galere at least ive lived not vegetated and humming his refrain lamour lamour la nuit comme le jour he lounged down the stairs and drove to a sale in the faubourg st germain where one of his paris chums a virtuoso and connoisseur had left endless meubles to be sold by his duns and knocked down to his friends vaughan was quite right he had lived and at a pretty good pace too when he came of age a tolerably good fortune awaited him but it had not been long in his hands before he contrived to let it slip through them hed been brought up at sainte barbe after being expelled from rugby knew all the best of the jeunesse doree and could not endure any place after paris where his life was as sparkling and brilliant as the foam off a glass of champagne wild and careless high spirited and lavish in his opera suppers his cabaret dinners his trois freres banquets his lansquenet parties his bouquets for baronnes and his bracelets for ballerinas ernest gained his reputation as a lion andruined himself too poor old fellow his place down in surrey had mortgages thick on every inch of its lands and the money that kept him going was borrowed from those modern satans money lenders at the usually ruinous interest but still ernest was wont to say with great philosophy ive had ten years swing of pleasure does every man get as much as that and should i have been any happier if id been a good boy and a country squire sat on the bench amused my mind with turnips and married some bishops daughter whod have marched me to church forbidden cigars and buried me in family boots certainly that would not have been his line and so in natural horror at it he dashed into a diametrically opposite one and after the favor he had shown him from every handsome woman that drove through longchamp wore diamonds at the tuileries and supped with dominos noirs at bals dopera and the favor he showed to cards the courses and the coulisses few bishops would have imperilled their daughters souls by setting them to hunt down this wicked lion especially as the poor lion now wasnt worth the trapping if he had been there would have been hue and cry enough after him i dont doubt but the gordon cummings of the beau sexe rarely hunt unless its worth their while and they can bring home splendid spoils to make their bosom friends mad with envy and ernest despite his handsome face his fashionable reputation and the aroma of conquest that hung about him they used to say he never wooed ever so negligently but he won was assuredly neither an eligible speculation nor a marrying man and was an object rather of terror to english mammas steering budding young ladies through the dangerous vortex of french society with a fierce chevaux de frise of british prejudices and a keen british eye to business if ernest was of no other use however he was invaluable to his uncles aunts and male cousins as a sort of scapegoat and epouvantail to be held up on high to show the unwary what they would come to if they followed his steps it was so pleasant to them to exult over his backslidings and cutting him mercilessly up into little bits hold condemnatory sermons over every one of the pieces dans ladversite de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvons toujours quelque chose qui ne nous deplait pas and vaughans friends like the rest of us pharisees dearly loved to glance at the publican especially if he was handsomer cleverer or any way better than themselves and thank god loudly that they were not such men as he ernest was a hardened sinner however he laughed put the channel between him and them and went on his ways without thinking or caring for their animadversions by jove emile said he as they sat dining together at leiters i should like to find out my goldenhaired sylphide she was english by her fair skin and though im not very fond of my compatriotes especially when theyre abroad i think touring john bull detestable wrapped up in his treble plaid of reserve still i should like to find her out just for simple curiosity i assure you shed the prettiest foot and ankle i ever saw not excepting even bluettes ma foi thats a good deal from you she must be found then voyons shall we advertise in the moniteur employ the secret police or call at all the hotels in person to say that youre quite ready to act out soulies lion amoureux if you can only discover the petite bourgeoise to play it with you vaughan laughed as he drank his demitasse lion amoureux thats an anomaly were only in love just enough pour nous amuser and of us albin says very rightly si vous connaissiez quelques meilleurs vous porteriez bientot cette ame ailleurs very well then if you dont know of anything better lets hunt up this incognita if she went to the francais shes most likely at the odeon tonight said de concressault shall we try allons said vaughan rising indolently as he did most things but its rather silly i think there are bright smiles and pretty feet enough in paris without ones setting off on a wildgoose chase after them they were playing the last act of la calomnie as vaughan and de concressault took their places put up their lorgnons and looked round the house he swore a few mental diables and sacres as his gaze fell on faces old or ugly or too brunes or too blondes or anything but what he wanted at last without moving his glass he touched de concressaults arm there she is emile in the fourth from the centre in a white opera cloak with pink flowers in her hair i see her mon ami said emile i found her out two seconds ago see how well you sketch but i wouldnt spoil your pleasure in discovering her mon dieu ernest shes looking at you and smiles as if she recognised you was there ever so lucky a lauzun vaughan could have laughed outright to see by the brightness of the girls expression that she knew the saviour of her bouquet again for though he was accustomed to easy conquests such naive interest in him at such short notice was something new to him he didnt take his lorgnon off her again and she was certainly worth the honor with her soft lustrous gold hair the eyes that defy definitionblack in some lights violet in othersa widearched forehead promising plenty of brains and a rayonnante animated joyous expression quite refreshing to anybody as bored and blase as vaughan and de concressault as soon as the last piece was over vaughan slipped out of his loge and took up his station at the entrance he didnt wait in vain the golden hair soon came on the arm of a gentlemanmiddle aged as vaughan noticed with a sensation of satisfaction she glanced up at him as she passed he looked very handsome in the gas glare vaughan perhaps was too sensible a fellow to think of his pose but even we have our weaknesses under certain circumstances as well as the crinolines luckily for him he chanced to have in his pocket a gold serpent bracelet he had bought that morning for some fair dame or demoiselle he stopped her and held it out to her i beg your pardon mademoiselle he said in french but i think you dropped this she looked up at him with the sunniest of smiles as she answered in a pure accent no monsieur thank you it does not belong to me the middleaged man glanced sideways at him with true british suspicioni dare say a pickpocket a rouge and fieschi were all mixed up in his mind as embodied in the graceful figure and bold glance of the lion he drew the girl on looking much like a heavy cloud with a bright sun ray after it but she half turned her head over her shoulder to give him a farewell smile which ernest returned with ten per cent interest anglais said emile concisely malheureusement said ernest as briefly as he pushed his way into the air and saw the gold hair vanish into her carriage he went quickly up to the cocher ou demeurentils mon ami he whispered slipping a fivefranc piece into his hand the man smiled a lhotel de londres monsieur no au premier the devil pourquoir ne allez pas said an unmistakably english voice from the interior of the voiture the man set off at a trot ernest sprang into his own trap au chateau rouge may as well go there eh emile what a deuced pity la chevelure doree is english i wish she were a danseuse an actress a fleuristeanything one could make his own introduction to confound it theres the heavy father im afraid in the case and some rigorous mamma or vigilant beguine of a governess but to judge by the young ladys smiles shell be easy game unless shes tremendously fenced in with which consolatory reflection vaughan leaned back and lighted a cheroot en route to spend the night as he had spent most of them for the last ten years till the fan had begun to be more bore than pleasure ii nina gordon have you been to the hotel de londres ernest said de concressault as vaughan lounged into tortonis next day where emile and three or four other men were drinking seltzer and talking of how cerisette had beaten vivandiere by a neck at chantilly or the sport to which a frenchman takes much more naturally of how well riviere played in the prix dun bouquet what a belle taille la de servans had and what a fool senecterre had made of himself in the duel about madame viardot of course i have said vaughan the name is gordongeneral name enough in england they were gone to the expiatoire the portiere told me there is the heavy father as i feared and a quasigoverness acting duenna theyre travelling with another family whose name i could not hear the woman said cetait beaucoup trop dur pour les levres i dare say theyre some brummagem peoplesome fudge family or otheron their travels confound it poor ernest laughed de concressault some gold hair has bewitched him and instead of finding it belongs to a danseuse or a married woman or a fleuriste of the palais royal or something attainable he finds it turn into an unapproachable english girl with no end of outlying sentries round her wholl fire at the first familiar approach it is a hard case said de kerroualle a dashing fellow in one of the regiments de famille never mind mon ami contre fortune bon coeur you know itll be more fun to devastate one of our countrymens inviolate strongholds than to conquer where the white flags already held out halloa heres a compatriot of yours id bet look at his sanctified visage and stiff chokera church of england man eh the devil muttered vaughan turning round deuce take him its my cousin ruskinstone what in the world does he do in paris the man he spoke of was the rev eusebius ruskinstone the deans warden of the cathedral of faithandgrace a tall thin young clerical of eight or nineandtwenty with goodness enough it was generally supposed in his little finger to make up for all ernests sins scarlet though they were he had just sat down and taken up the carte to blunder through potage au duc de malakoff fricassee de volaille a la princesse mathilde and all the rest of it when his eye lit on his graceless cousin and a vinegar asperity spread over his bland visage vaughan rose with a lazy grace immensely bored within him my dear ruskinstone what an unanticipated pleasure i never hoped vanity fair would have had power to lure you into its naughty peepshows and roundabouts the rev eusebius reddened slightly he had once stated strongly his opinion that poor paris was pandemonium how do you do he said giving his cousin two fingers it is a long time since we saw you in england england doesnt want me said ernest dryly i dont fancy i should be very welcome at faithandgrace should i the dear chapter would probably consign me to starvation for my skeptical notions as calvin did castellio but what has brought you to paris are you come to fight the jesuits in a conference or to abjure the wardenship and turn over to them eusebius was shocked at the irreverent tone but there was a satirical smile on his cousins lips that he didnt care to provoke i am come he said stiffly partly for health partly to collect materials for a work on the gurgoyles and rose mouldings of mediaeval architecture and partly to oblige some friends of mine pardon me here they come vaughan lifted his eyes expecting nothing very delectable in ruskinstones friends to his astonishment they fell on his beauty of the francais with the outlying sentries of father governess and two other women the wardens maiden sisters stiff manierees and prudish like too many englishwomen the young lady of the francais was a curious contrast to them she started a little as she saw vaughan and smiled brilliantly on the spur of that smile ernest greeted his cousins with a degree of empressement that they certainly wouldnt have been honored by without it they were rather frightened at coming in actual contact with such a monster of iniquity as a paris lion who theyd heard had outjuand don juan and gave him but a frigid welcome mr gordon had doubtless heard too of vaughans misdemeanors for he looked stoical and acidulated as he bowed but the young girls eyes reconciled ernest to all the rest as she frankly returned a look with which he was wont to win his way through womens hearts midst the hum of ball rooms in the soft teteatete in boudoirs and over the sparkling sillery of petits soupers so for the sake of his new quarry he disregarded the cold looks of the others and made himself so charming that nobody could withstand the fascination of his manner till their dinner was served and then telling his cousins he would do himself the pleasure of calling on them the next day he left the cafe to drive over to gentilly to inspect a grey colt of de kerroualles la chevelure doree is quite as pretty by daylight ernest said de concressault bon dieu it is such a relief to see eyes that are not tinted and a skin whose pink and white is not born from the mysterious rites of the toilet vaughan nodded with his manilla between his teeth that cousin of yours is queer style mon garcon said kerroualle how some of those islanders contrive to iron themselves into the stiffness and flatness they do is to me the profoundest enigma but what church of england meaning lies hid in his coattails they are for all the world like our reverends peres what is it for high church next door shop to yours you know our ecclesiastics are given to balancing themselves on a tight rope between their mother and their sister till they tumble over into their sisters open armsthe catholics say into salvation the protestants into damnation into neither i myself opine poor simpletons ruskinstone is fearfully architectural the sole things hell see here will be facades gurgoyles and clerestories and his soul knows no warmer loves than stone dolls as newton calls them i say gaston what do you think of my love of the francais isnt she chic isnt she mignonne isnt she spirituelle yes assented de kerroualle prettier than either bluette or madame de melusine would allow orrelish ernest frowned ive done with bluette shes a pretty face butah bah one cant amuse oneself always with a little paysanne for shes nothing better after all and im half afraid the melusine begins to bore me better not tell her so mon ami said de kerroualle shed be a nasty enemy pooh a woman like that loves and forgets sans doute but they also sometimes revenge poor little bluette you may safely turn over but madame la baronne wont so easily be jilted vaughan laughed oh im not going to break her heart dont you know gaston on a bien de la peine a rompre meme quand on ne saime plus i shouldnt have said you found it so smiled de concressault for you change your loves as you change your gloves la chevelure doree will be the next eh poor little thing said ernest bitterly i wish her a better fate he went to call on la chevelure doree nevertheless the morning after and found her in the salon alone greatly to his surprise and pleasure nina gordon was pretty even in the morningas byron saysand she was much more she was fascinating and as perfectly demonstrative and natural as any peasant girl out of the meadows of arles ignorant of the magic words toilette cosmetique and crinoline she received him with evident pleasure and perfect unreserve which even this daring and skeptical lion could not twist or contort into boldness and began to talk fast and gaily do i like paris she said in answer to his question oh yes or at least i should if i could see it differently i detest sightseeing crowding ones brains with pictures statues palaces holy families jostling polinchinelle races mixing up with grand masses versailles clouding st cloudthe trianon rattled through in five minutesall in inextricable muddle i should like to see paris at leisure with some one with whom i had a rapport my thoughts undisturbed and my historical associations fresh and fervent i wish i were honored with the office of your guide said ernest smiling do you think you would have a rapport with me she smiled in return yes i think i should i cannot tell why but as it is my warmest souvenir of conde is chilled by the offer of an ice and my tenderest thought of louise de la valliere is shivered with the suggestion of dinner vaughan laughed bravo thought he thank god this is no tame english icicle i would give much he said to be able to take my cousins place and show you paris we would have no such vulgar gastronomical interruptions we would go through it all perfectly i would make you hear the very whispers with which la valliere under the old oaks of st germain unknowingly told her love to louis in the forest glades of st cloud you should see cinqmars and the royal hunt riding out in the chasse de nuit in the gloomy walls of the prisons you should hear andre chenier reciting his last verses and see egalite completing his last toilet the glittering cotillons on the terraces of versailles the fierce canaille surging through the salons of the tuileries the templars dying in the green meadows at the back of st antoinethey should all rise up for you under my incantations positively ernest bored and blase accustomed to look at paris through the gaslights of his lions life warmed into romance to please the eyes that now beamed upon him ah that would be delightful said the girl her eyes sparkling mr ruskinstone you know is terrible to me for he goes about with ruskin in one hand murray in the other and a phrasebook or two in his pocket of course he wants it as hes a classical scholar and no matter whatever associations cling around a place only looks at it in regard to its architectural points i beg your pardon she said interrupting herself with a blush i forgot he was your cousin but really that constant cold stone does tease me so at that moment the heavy father as ernest irreverently styled the tall pompous head of one of the first banks in london who was worth a million if he was worth a sou entered and the rev eusebius after him who had been spending a lively morning taking notes among the catacombs he was prepared to be as cold as a refrigerator and the banker to follow his example at finding this bete noire of the chaussee dantin teteatete with nina but ernest had a sort of haughty high breeding and careless dignity which warned people off from any liberties with him and gordon remembered that he knew paris and its haute volee so well that he might be a useful acquaintance if kept at arms length from nina and afterwards dropped unlucky man he actually thought his weak muscles were strong enough to cope with a lions vaughan took his leave after offering his box at the operacomique to mr gordon and drove to the jockey club pondering much on this new species of the beau sexe he was too used to women not to know at a glance that she had nothing bold about her and yet he was too skeptical to credit that a girl could possibly exist who was neither a coquette nor a prude as soon as the door closed on him his friends began to open their batteries of scandal how sad it is to see life wasted as my cousin wastes his said the warden balancing a paperknife thoughtfully with a depressed air frittered away on mere trifles as valuless and empty as soapbubbles but not alas so innocent what do you mean nina asked quickly what do i mean miss gordon repeated eusebius reproachfully what can i mean but the idle whirl of gaiety the vitiating pleasures the debts and the vices which are to be laid at poor ernests door ever since we were boys together and he was expelled from rugby for going to coventry fair and staying there all night he has been going rapidly down the road to ruin he looks very comfortable in his descent smiled the young lady pray why after all shouldnt horses operas and manillas be as legitimate objects to set ones affections upon as norman arches and gregorian chants he has his dissipations you have yours chacun a son gout the warden had his reasons for conciliating the young heiress so he made a feeble effort to smile you know as well as i that you do not think what you say miss gordon were it merely vaughans tastes that were in fault it would not be of such fearful consequence but unfortunately it is his principles he is utterly without any said miss selina ruskinstone who ten years before had been deeply and hopelessly in love with ernest and never forgave him for not reciprocating the passion he is a skeptic a gambler a spendthrift and a more heartlessless flirt never lived averred miss augusta who hated the whole of ernests sexeven the chapterpour cause gentlemen cant help seeming flirts sometimes some women pay such attention to them said nina with a mischievous laugh poor mr vaughn i hope hes not as black as he is painted his physiognomy tells a different tale he is just my ideal of ernest maltravers how kind his eyes are have you ever looked into them selina miss ruskinstone gave an angry sneer vouchsafing no other response my dear nina how foolishly you talk about looking into a young mans eyes frowned her father i am surprised to hear you her own eyes opened in astonishment why maynt i look at them it is by the eyes that like a dog i know whom to like and whom to avoid and pray does your prescience guide you to see a saint in a ruined lion of the chaussee dantin sneered selina with another contemptuous sniff not a saint im not good enough to appreciate the race laughed nina but i do not believe your cousin to be all you paint him or at least if circumstances have led him into extravagance i have a conviction that he has a warm heart and a noble character au fond we will hope so said the warden meekly with an expression which plainly said how vain a hope it was i think we have wasted a great deal too much conversation on a thankless subject said selina with asperity dont you think it time mr gordon for us to go to the louvre that day as they were driving along the boulevards they passed ernest with bluette in his carriage going to the pre catalan they all knew her from having seen her play at the odeon selina and augusta turned down their mouths and turned up their eyes gordon pulled up his collar and looked a brutus in spectacles nina colored and looked vexed triumph glittered in eusebiuss meek eyes but he sighed a pastors sigh over a lost soul iii le lion amoureux the morning after as they were going into the exposition des beaux arts they met vaughan and no ghost would have been more unwelcome to the warden than the distingue figure of his fashionable cousin nina was the only one who looked pleased to recognise him and she as she returned his smile forgot that the evening before it had been given to bluette are you coming in too she asked i was not but i will with pleasure said ernest and into the exhibition with them he went to ruskinstones wrath and gordons annoyance vaughan was a connoisseur in art the warden knew no more than what he took verbatim from the god of his idolatry mr john ruskin it was very natural that nina should listen to the friend of ingres and vernet instead of to the secondhand worshipper of turner vaughan by instinct dropped his customary tone of complimentcompliment he never used to women he delighted to honorand talked so charmingly that nina utterly forgot the luckless eusebius and started when a low sweet voice said close beside her what ernest you here she turned and saw a woman about eightandtwenty dressed in perfection of taste with an exquisite figure and a face of brunette beauty the rouge most undiscoverable and the eyes artistically tinted to make them look larger which heaven knows was needless she darted a quick look at vaughans companion which nina gave back with a dash of hauteur a shade came over his face as he answered her greeting will you not introduce me to your friend said the new comer she is of your nation i fancy and you know i am entetee of everything english ernest looked rather gloomy at the compliment but turning to nina begged to introduce her to madame de melusine the gay handsome baronne taking in all the english girls points as rapidly as a groom at tattersalls does a twoyearolds was chatting volubly to nina when the others came up gordon though wont to boast that he belonged to the aristocracy of money was always ready to fall in the dust before the noblesse of blood and was gratified at the introduction remembering to have read in the moniteur the name of de melusine at the ball at the tuileries and the widow was very charming even to the professedly stoical eyes of a brutus of sixtytwo she soon floated off however with her party giving vaughan a gay a ce soir and requesting to be allowed the honor of calling on the gordons is she a great friend of yours asked nina when she and he were a little in advance of the others i have known her some time and you are very intimate i suppose as she called you by your christian name he smiled a smile that puzzled nina oh we soon get familiar here where are you going to see her again this evening she persevered playing with her parasol fringe at her own housea house that will charm you by the way it once belonged to bussy rabutin and it has all louis quatorze furniture is it a dinnera ball no an opera suppershe is famed for her sillery and her mots ten to one i shall not go what amuses one once palls with repetition i dont understand that said nina quickly what i like i like pour toujours pauvre enfant you little know life muttered ernest ah miss gordon you are at the happy age when one can believe in the feelings and friendships and all the charming little romances of existence but i have passed it and so that i am amused for a moment so that something takes time off my hands i look no further and expect no more i know well enough the champagne will cease to sparkle but i drink it while it foams and dont trouble myself to lament over it quimporte when one bottles empty there is another ah it is such women as madame de melusine who have taught you that doctrine cried nina with an energy that rather startled ernest though his nerves were as strong as any mans in paris my romances as you term them still i believe sleep in your heart but the world you live in has stifled them do you think amusement will always be enough for youdo you think you will never want something better than your empty champagne foam i hope i shall not mademoiselle said vaughan bitterly for i am certain i do not believe in it and am quite sure i should never get it leave me to the roses of my tritericae they are all i shall ever enjoy and they at the best are withered nina love interrupted selina coming up with much amiability i was obliged to come and tell you not to be quite so energetic all the people in the room are looking at you i dare say they are said vaughan calmly it is not often the parisians have the pleasure of seeing beauty unaffected and fascinations careless of their own charms nature selina is unhappily as rare one side the channel as the other and we men appreciate it when we do see it when vaughan parted from them soon after he swore at himself for three things first for having driven bluette en plein jour through the boulevards though he had driven bluette and such as bluette a thousand times before secondly for having been so weak as to introduce madame de melusine to the gordons and thirdly for havinghe the thoroughpaced lion whose manual was rochefoucauld and tutor in love de kockactually talked romance as if he were werter or paul flemming or some other sentimental simpleton vaughan to his great disgust felt a fit of blue devils stealing on him hurled one or two rose notes waiting for him into the fire with an oath smoked half a dozen manillas fiercely and then to get excitement went to a dinner at the rocher de cancale played ecarte with a beau joueur went to an opera suppernot to the de melusinesthen to mabille and came home at seven in the morning after a night such as would have raised every hair off brutuss head given a triumphant glitter to the wardens small blue eyes and possibly even staggered the hot faith of his young champion pauline de melusine was as good as her wordshe did call on the gordonsand brutus stoic though he was was well pleased for the baronne though her nobility only dated from the restoration and was not received by the exclusive legitimists of the old faubourg st germain had a very pleasant set of her own and figured among the nouvelle noblesse and bourgeois decores who fill the vacant places of the de rochefoucauld the de rohan and the montmorency in the imperial salons of the tuileries where once the noblest blood in europe was gathered it is painful to me to frequent ernests society the warden was wont to say for every word he utters impresses me but more sadly with the conviction of his lost state but we are commanded to be in the world though not of it and if i shun him how can i hope to benefit him true and as your cousin it would scarcely be charitable to avoid him entirely terrible as we know his habits to be but there is no necessity to be too intimate and i do not wish nina to be too much with him the banker was accustomed to answer anglice vaughan gets us good introductions and makes paris pleasant to us well use him while we want him when we dont we will give him his conge thats the reading of most of our dear friends compliments and caresses isnt it vaughan knew perfectly well that they would like to make a catspaw of him and was the last man likely to play that simple and certainly not agreeable role unless it suited him but he had reasons of his own for forcing gordon to be civil and obliged to him despite the prejudices of that english and therefore of course opinionated gentleman it amused him to mortify eusebius whom he saw at a glance was bewitched with the prospect of ninas dot and it amused him very much to see ninas joyous laughter as he leaned over her chair at the opera comique to hear her animated satire on madame de melusine for whom knowing nothing of her the young lady had conceived hot aversion and to listen to her enthusiasm when she poured out to him her vivid imaginings gradually the cafes and the boulevards and the boudoirs missed ernest while he accompanied nina through the glades of st cloud or down the seine to asnieres or up the slopes of pere la chaise in his new pursuit and often at night he would leave the coulisses or a lansquenet or the gaslights of the maison doree and the closerie des lilas to watch her thorough enjoyment of a vaudeville her fervent feeling in an opera or to waltz with her at a ball and note her glad recognition of him to this girl ernest opened his heart and mind as hebeing a reserved proud and skeptical manhad never done to any one there was a sympathy and confidence between them and she learned much of his inner nature as she talked to him soft and low under the forest trees of fontainebleau such talk as could not be heard in bluettes boudoir under the waxlights of the quartier breda or in the flow of the sillery at la melusines soupers all this was new to the tired lion and amused him immensely la chevelure doree was twisting the golden meshes of its net round him as de concressault told him one day nonsense said ernest have i not two loves already on my hands more than i want dethrone them and promote la petite vaughan turned on his friend with his eyes flashing bon dieu do you take her for a balletgirl or a grisette well if you dont like that marry her then mon cher you will satisfy your fancy and get cinquante mille francs de renteat a sacrifice of course but que veuxtu there is no medal without its reverse though a lion marie is certainly an anomaly an absurdity and an intense pity taistoi said ernest impatiently tu es fou caught in the toils of a wretched intrigante in the power of any tailor in the rue vivienne any jeweller in the palais royal my money spent on follies my life wasted in play the turf and worthless women i have much indeed to offer to a young girl who has wealth beauty genius and heart all the more reason why you should make a good coup said emile calmly after listening with pitying surprise to his friend in his new mood you have a handsome face a fashionable reputation and a good name bah you can do anything as for your life all women like a mauvais sujet and unless the de melusine turn out a brinvilliers i dont see what you have to fear when i want your counsel emile i will ask it said vaughan shortly but as i have no intention of going in for the prize there is no need for you to bet on the chance of the throw comme tu veux said the parisian shrugging his shoulders that homme de paille your priestly cousin will take her back to the english fogs and make her a much better husband than youd ever be mon garcon vaughan moved restlessly the idiot if i thought so the devil take you emile why do you talk of such things at that minute nina was sitting by one of the windows of their hotel watching for ernest with a bouquet he had sent her on a table by her side and the rev eusebius was talking in a very low tone to her father she caught a few words last nightvaughan at the freres provencauxa souper au cabinetmademoiselle celine premiere danseusequite terrible c c nina flushed scarlet and turned round if you blame your cousin mr ruskinstone why were you there yourself the warden colored too with him as with a good many foreign air relaxed the severity of the decalogue and what was sin at home where everybody knew it was none at all abroadunder the rose some dear pharisees will not endanger their souls by a carpetdance in england but if a little bird followed them in their holiday across the channel it might chance to see them disporting under a domino noir i had been he stammered to see as you know a beautiful specimen of the arcboutant in a ruined chapel of the carmelites some miles down the seine it was very late and i was very tired so turned into the freres provencaux to take some little refreshment and i there saw my unhappy cousin in society which ought miss gordon to disqualify him for yours it is very painful to me to mention such things to you i never thought you overheard then if it is very painful to you nina burst in impetuously her bouche de rose as de kerroualle called it curving haughtily why are you ceaselessly raking up every possible bit of scandal that you can against your cousin his life does not clash with yours his acts do not matter to you his extravagance does not rob you i used to fancy charity should cover a multitude of sins but it seems to me that nowadays clergymen like dr watts naughty dogs only delight to bark and bite you are cruelly unjust answered the warden in those smooth tones that irritate one much more than hard swearing i have no other wish than christian kindness to poor ernest if in my place as pastor i justly condemn his errors and vices it is only through a loving desire to wean him from his downward course your love is singularly vindictive said his vehement young opponent her cheeks hot and her eyes bright no good was ever yet done to a man by proclaiming his faults right and left i should like you much better mr ruskinstone if you said candidly i dont like my cousin and i have never forgiven him for thrashing me at rugby and playing football better than i did eusebius winced at this little touch up of his bygone years but he smiled a benign superior pitying smile such petitesses i thank heaven are utterly beneath me and i should have fancied miss gordon was too generous to suppose them god forbid that i should envy poor vaughan his dazzling qualities i sorrow over him as a relative and a precious human soul but as a minister of our holy church i neither can nor will countenance his gross violations of all her divinest laws with which peroration the warden with a sigh took up a work on the early english piscini and aspersoria and became immersed therein poor mr vaughan cried nina impatiently probably he is too wise to concern himself about what people buzz in his absence or else he need be cased in mail to avoid being stung to death with the musquito bites of scandal gordon came down on her with his heavy artillery silence nina you do not know what you are defending i fear that no slander can darken mr vaughans character more than he merits a gamblera rouea lover of married woman of dancinggirls murmured eusebius in an aside meant like those on the stage to tell killingly with the audience nina flushed as scarlet as the camellias in her bouquet and put up her head with a haughty gesture here comes the subject of your vituperation mr ruskinstone so you can repeat your denunciations and favor him with a sermon in personunless indeed the secular recollections of rugby intimidate the religious arm i fear something as irreverent as little devil rose to the wardens pious lips as he flashed a fierce glance at her from his paleblue eyes for he loved not her but the splendid dot which the banker was sure to pay down if his soninlaw were to his taste he caught his cousins glance as he came into the salons and in the superb scorn gleaming in ernests dark eyes eusebius saw that they were not merely enemies butrivals a warden with church principles all the cardinal virtues strict morality and money and a lion with paris principles if any great fascinations debts entanglements and an empty purse which will win with nina for the cup and gordon for the umpire iv mischief qui cherchezvous petite the speaker was la melusine and the hearer was nina who considerably resented the halfpatronising half mocking yet intensely amiable manner the widow chose to assume towards her gordon was stricken with warm admiration of madame and never inquired into her morality only too pleased when she condescended to talk to or invite him they had met at a soiree at some intimate friends of vaughans in the champs elysees ernest was a favorite wherever he went and the goodnatured french people at once took up his relatives to please him he was not there himself but the baronnes quick eyes soon caught and construed her restless glances through the crowded rooms je ne cherche personne madame said nina haughtily dressed simply in white tulle with the most exquisite flowers to be had out of the palais royal in the famous golden hair which gleamed in the gaslight like sunshine she aroused the serpent which lay hid in the roses of madames smiles pauline laughed softly and flirted her fan nay nay mignonne those soft eyes are seeking some one who is it ah it is that mechant monsieur vaughan nestce pas he is very handsome certainly but on dit an village quargire est volage madames own thoughts possibly suggest the supposition of mine said nina coldly comme ces anglaises sont impolies thought the baronne no indeed she said laughing carelessly i know ernest too well to let my thoughts dwell on him he is charming to talk to to waltz with to flirt with but from anything further dieu nous garde lauzun himself were not more dangerous or more unstable you speak as bitterly madame as if you had suffered from the fickleness said nina with a contemptuous curl of her soft lips sweet temper as she was she could thrust a spear in her enemys side when she liked madames eyes glittered like a rattlesnakes ninas chance ball shot home but madame was a woman of the world and could mask her batteries with a skill of which nina with her impetuous abandon was incapable she smiled very sweetly as she answered no petite i have unhappily seen too much of the world not to know that we must never put our trust in those charming mauvais sujets at your age i dare say i should not have been proof against your countrymans fascinations but now i know just how much his fondest vows are worth and i have been deaf to them all for i would not let my heart mislead me against my reason and my conscience ah petite you little guess what the traitor word love means here in paris we women grow accustomed to our fate but the lesson is hard sometimes you have been reading mes confidences lately asked nina with a sarcastic flash of her brilliant eyes how cruel do you suppose i can have no emotions except i learn them secondhand through lamartine or delphine gay you are very satirical miss gordonhow strange said the baronne interrupting herself your bouquet is the facsimile of mine look de kerroualle sent you that i fancy you know he raffoles of you i was very silly to use mine but mr vaughan sent me such a pretty note with it that i had not the resolution to disappoint him poor ernest and madame sighed softly as if bewailing in her tender heart the woes her obduracy caused the blood flamed up in ninas cheeks and her hand clenched hard on ernests flowers they were the facsimiles of the widows delicate pink blossoms mixed with white azalias is he here tonight do you know madame continued i dare say not he is behind the coulisses most likely celine the new danseuse from the fenice makes her debut tonight here comes poor gaston to petition for a valse be kind to him pray she herself went off to the ballroom and the effect of her exordium was to make nina very disagreeable to poor de kerroualle whom she really liked and who was entete about her not long afterwards nina saw in the distance vaughans haughty head and powerful brow and her silly little heart beat as quick as a pigeons just caught in the trap he was talking to the widow look at our young english friend pauline was saying how she is flirting with gaston and de lafitolle and de concressault certainly when your englishwomen do coquet they go further than any of us estce possible said ernest raising his eyebrows mechant cried madame with a chastising blow of her fan but do you know i admire the petite very much i believe all really beautiful women had that rare golden hair of herslucrezia borgia i could never bear grisi as lucrezia for that very reason la cenci the duchess of portsmouth aenoneand helen i am sure netted paris with those gold threads dont you think it is very lovely i do indeed said vaughan with unconscious warmth madame laughed gaily but there was a disagreeable glitter in her eye what fickle already ah well i give you full leave and example madame said ernest as he bowed and left her side glad to have struck the first blow of his freedom from this handsome tyrant who was as capricious and exacting as she was clever and captivating but fetters made of fairer roses were over ernest now and he never bethought himself of the probable vengeance of that bitterest foe a woman who is piqued tout beau thought pauline as she saw him waltzing with nina mais je vous donnerai encore lechec et mat mon brave joueur did you give madame de melusine the bouquet she carries this evening asked nina as he whirled her round no said ernest astonished why do you ask because she said you did answered nina never accustomed to conceal anything and besides it is exactly like mine infernal woman muttered ernest how could you for a moment believe that i would have so insulted you i didnt believe it said nina lifting her frank eyes to his but how very late you are have you been at the ballet his face grew stern did she tell you that yes but why did you go there instead of coming to dance with me do you like those danseuses better than you do me what was celines or anybodys debut to you ernest smiled at the native indignation of the question never think that i do not wish to be with you buti wanted oblivion and one cannot shake off old habits did you miss me among all those other men that you have always round you how unkind that is whispered nina indignantly you know i always do he held her closer to him in the waltz and she felt his heart beat quicker but she got no other answer that night nina stood before her toilettetable putting her flowers in water and some hot tears fell on the azalias i will have faith in him she cried passionately though all the world be witness against him i will believe in him whatever his life may have been his heart is warm and true they shall never make me doubt it her last thoughts were of him and when she slept his face was in her dreams while ernest with some of the wildest men of his set smoked hard and drank deep in his chambers to drive away if he could the fiends of regret and passion and the memory of a young radiant impassioned face which lured him to an unattainable future nina dearest said selina ruskinstone affectionately the morning after i hope you will not think me unkindyou know i have no wish but for your goodbut dont you think it would be better to be a little moremore reserved a little less free with mr vaughan explain yourself more clearly said nina tranquilly do you wish me to send to turkey for a veil and a guard of bashibazouks or do you mean that mr vaughan is so attractive that he is better avoided like a mantrap or a maelstrom dont be ridiculous retorted augusta you know well enough what we mean and certainly you do run after him a great deal too much you are so very demonstrative sighed selina and it is so easily misconstrued it is not feminine to court any man so unblushingly ninas eyes flashed and the blood colored her brow i am not afraid of being misconstrued by mr vaughan she said haughtily gentlemen are kinder and wiser judges in those things than our sex i wouldnt advise you to trust to ernests tender mercies sneered augusta my dear child remember his principles sighed selina his lifehis reputation leave both him and me alone retorted nina passionately i will not stand calmly by to hear him slandered with your vague calumnies you preach religion often enough practice it now and show more common kindness to your cousin i do not say charity for i am sick of the cant word and he is above your pity you think me utterly lost because i dance and laugh and enjoy my life but bad as my principles are i should be shockedyes selina and i should think i merited little mercy myself were i as harsh and bitter upon any one as you are upon him how can you judge himhow can you say what nobility and truth and affectionthat will shame your own cold pharisaismmay lie in his heart unrevealedhow can you dare to censure him in the door of the salon listening to the lecture his young champion was giving these two blue opinionated and strongly pious ladies stood ernest his face even paler than usual and his eyes with a strange mixture of joy and pain in them nina colored scarlet but went forward to meet him with undisguised pleasure utterly regardless of the sneering lips and averted eyes of the miss ruskinstones he had come to go with them to st germain and with a dexterous manoeuvre took the very seat in the carriage opposite nina that eusebius had planned for himself but the warden was no match for the lion in such affairs and being exiled to the barouche with gordon and augusta took from under the seat a folio of the stones of venice and read sulkily all the way my dear fellow said vaughan when they reached st germain dont you think you would prefer to sit in the carriage and finish that delightful work to coming to see some simple woods and terraces if you would pray dont hesitate to say so i am sure miss gordon will excuse your absence the solicitous courtesy of ernests manner was boiling oil to the fire raging in the wardens gentle breast and eusebius besides was not quick at retorts i am not guilty of any such bad taste he said stiffly though i do discover a charm in severe studies which i believe you never did no never said ernest laughing my genius does not lie that way and ive no vacant bishopric in my minds eye to make such studies profitable even you you know light of the church as you are want recreation sometimes confess now the chansons a boire last night sounded pleasant after long months of faithandgrace services eusebius looked much as i have seen a sleek tomcat who bears a respectable character generally surprised in surreptitiously licking out of the creamjug he had the night before when he was popularly supposed to be sitting under adolphe monod tasted rather too many petits verres up at the pre catalan utterly unconscious of his cousins proximity the pureminded soul thus cruelly caught looked prayers of piteous entreaty to vaughan not to damage his milkwhite reputation by further revelation of this unlucky detour into the broad road and ernest who always kindhearted never hit a man when he was down contented himself with saying ah well we are none of us pure alabaster though some of the sepulchres do contrive to whiten themselves up astonishingly my father poor man once wished to put me in the church do you think i should have graced it selina i cant say i do sneered selina you think i should disgrace it very probably i am not good at canting and giving nina his arm the warden being much too confused to forestall him he whispered when is that atrocious saint going to take himself over the water couldnt we bribe his diocesan to call him before the arches court surely those long coats so like the little wooden men in noahs ark and that straightened hair so mathematically parted down the centre look perverted enough to warrant it nina shook her head unhappily he is here for six months for ill healththe sickleave of clergymen who wish for a holiday and are too holy to leave their flock without an excuse to society vaughan laughed then sighed six monthsand you have been here four already eusebius hates me cordiallyall my english relatives do i believe we do not get on together they are too cold and conventional for me i have some of the warm bohemian blood though god knows ive seen enough to chill it to ice by this time but it is not chilledso much the worse for me muttered ernest tell me he said abruptlytell me why you took the trouble to defend me so generously this morning she looked up at him with her frank beaming regard because they dare to misjudge you and they know nothing and are not worthy to know anything of your real self he pressed his lips together as if in bodily pain and what do you know have you not yourself said that you talk to me as you talk to no one else answered nina impetuously besidesi cannot tell why but the first day i met you i seemed to find some friend that i had lost before i was certain that you would never misconstrue anything i said and i felt that i saw further into your heart and mind than any one else could do was it not very strange she stopped and looked up at him ernest bent his eyes on the ground and breathed fast no no he said at last yours is only an ideal of me if you knew me as i really am you would cease to feel thethe interest that you say he stopped abruptly facile as he was at pretty compliments and versed in tender scenes as he had been from his schooldays the longing to make this girl love him and his struggle not to breathe love to her deprived him of his customary strength and nonchalance i do not fear to know you as you are said nina gently i do not think you yourself allow all the better things that there are in you people have not judged you rightly and you have been too proud to prove their error to them you have found pleasure in running counter to the prudish and illiberal bigots who presumed to judge you and to a world you have found heartless and false you have not cared to lift the domino and mask you wore vaughan sighed from the bottom of his heart and walked on in silence for a good five minutes promise me nina he said at length with an effort that no matter what you hear against me you will not condemn me unheard i promise she answered raising her eyes to his brighter still for the color in her checks it was the first time he had called her nina miss gordon said eusebius hurriedly overtaking them pray come with me a moment there is the most exquisite specimen of the flamboyant style in an archway thank you for your good intentions said nina pettishly but really as you might know by this time i never can see any attractions in your prosaic and matteroffactfact study it might be more profitable than than thinking of la valliere and poor bragelonne and all the gay glories of the exiled bourbons laughed nina very likely but romance is more to my taste than granite you would never have killed yourself like bragelonne for the beaux yeux of louise de la beaumesurblanc would you i trust said eusebius stiffly that i should have had a deeper sense of the important responsibilities of the gift of life than to throw it away because a silly girl preferred another you are very impolitic said ernest with a satirical smile no lady could feel remorse at forsaking you if you could get over it so easily he would get over it easily laughed nina you would call her delilah and all the scripture bad names order mr ruskins new work turn your desires to a deanship marry some bishops daughter with high ecclesiastical interest and console yourself in the bosom of your mother churcheh mr ruskinstone you are cruelly unjust sighed eusebius you little know the charms of architecture no and i never shall answered his tormentor humming the queen of the roses and waltzing down the forest glade where they were walking how severe you look she said as she waltzed back is that wrong too miriam danced before the ark and jephthas daughter the warden appeared not to hear certainly his mode of courtship was singular ernest he said turning to his cousin as the rest of the party came up i had no idea your sister was in paris i have not seen her since she was fourteen i should not have known her in the least margaret is in india with her husband answered vaughan what are you dreaming of where have you seen her i saw her in your chambers answered the warden slowly i passed three times yesterday and she was sitting in the centre window each time pshaw you dreamt it in your sleep last night margarets in vellore i assure you i saw her said the warden softly or at least i saw some lady whom i naturally presumed to be your sister ernest who had not colored for fifteen years and would have defied man or woman to confuse him flushed to his very temples you are mistaken he said decidedly there is no woman in my rooms eusebius raised his eyebrows bent his head smiled and sighed more polite disbelief was never expressed the miss ruskinstones would have blushed if they could as they could not they drew themselves bolt upright and put their parasols between them and the reprobate nina whose hand was still in vaughans arm turned white and flashed a quick upward look at him then with a glance at eusebius as fiery as the eternal wrath that that dear divine was accustomed to deal out so largely to other people she led ernest up to her father who being providentially somewhat deaf had not heard this byplay and said to her cousins horror papa dear mr vaughan wants you to dine with him at tortonis tonight to meet m de vendanges you will be very happy wont you ernest pressed her little hand against his side and thanked her with his eyes gordon was propitiated for that day he was not likely to quarrel with a man who could introduce him to son altesse monseigneur le duc de vendanges v more mischiefand an end in a little cabinet de peinture in a house in the place vendome apart from all the other people who having come to a dejeuner were now dispersed in the music rooms boudoirs and conservatories sat madame de melusine talking to gordon flatteringly beguilingly bewitchingly as that accomplished widow could the banker found her charming and really under her blandishments began to believe poor old fellow that she was in love with him ah bytheby cher monsieur began madame when she had softsoaped him into a proper frame of mind i want to speak to you about that mignonne nina you cannot tell you cannot imagine what interest i take in her you do her much honor madame replied her bourgeois gentilhomme always stiff however enraptured he might feel internally the honor is mine smiled pauline yes i do feel much interest in her there is a sympathy in our natures i am certain andand monsieur gordon i cannot see that darling girl on the brink of a precipice without stretching out a hand to snatch her from the abyss precipiceabyssnina good heavens my dear madame what do you mean cried gordona fire an elopement and the smallpox all presenting themselves to his mind no no repeated madame with increasing vehemence i will not permit any private feelings i will not allow my own weakness to prevent me from saving her it would be a crime a cruelty to let your innocent child be deceived and rendered miserable for all time because i lack the moral courage to preserve her monsieur i speak to you as i am sure i may as one friend to another and i am perfectly certain that you will not misjudge me answer me one thing no impertinent curiosity dictates the question do you wish your daughter married to mr vaughan married to vaughan exclaimed the startled banker id sooner see her married to a crossing sweeper she never thought of such a thing impossible absurd shell marry my friend ruskinstone as soon as she comes of age marry vaughan a fellow without a penny pauline laid her soft jewelled hand on his arm my dear friend he thinks of it if you do not and i am much mistaken if dear nina is not already dazzled by his brilliant qualities your countryman is a charming companion no one can gainsay that but alas he is a roue a gambler an adventurer who while winning her young girls affections has only in view the wealth which he hopes he will gain with her it is painful to me to say this and tears stood in madames long velvet eyes we were good friends before he wanted more than friendship while poor de melusine was still living and his true character was revealed to me it would be false delicacy to allow your darling nina to become his victim for want of a few words from me though i know if he were aware of my interference the inference he would basely insinuate from it but you whispered madame brushing the tears from her eyes and giving him an angelic smile i need not fear that you would ever misjudge me never i swear most generous of women said the banker kissing the snowwhite hand very clumsily too ill tell the fellow my mind directlyan unprincipled gambling non non je vous en prie monsieur cried the widow really frightened for this would not have suited her plans at all you would put me in the power of that unscrupulous man he would destroy my reputation at once in his revenge but what am i to do said the poor gulled banker ninas a will of her own and if she take a fancy to this confounded leave that to me said la baronne softly i have proofs which will stagger her most obstinate faith in her lover meanwhile give him no suspicion go to his supper on tuesday andyou are asked to vauvenay accept the invitationand conclude the fiancailles with monsieur le ministre as soon as you can butbut madame stammered this new jourdain to his enchanting dorimene vauvenay is an exile i shall not see you there ah silly man laughed the widow i shall be only two miles off i am going to stay with the salvador they leave paris in three weeks listenyour daughter is singing the swallows her voice is quite as good as ristoris three hours after madame held another teteatete in that boudoir this time the favored mortal was vaughan they had had a pathetic interview of which the pathos hardly moved ernest as much as the widow desired you love me no longer ernest she murmured the tears falling down her cheeksher rouge was the product of high art and never washed offi see it i feel it your heart is given to that english girl i have tried to jest about it i have tried to affect indifference but i cannot the love you once won will be yours to the grave ernest listened a satirical smile on his lips i should feel more grateful he said calmly if the gift had not been given to so many it will be a great deal of trouble to you to love us all to our graves and your new friend gordon do you intend cherishing his grey hairs too till the gout puts them under the sod she fell back sobbing with exquisite abandon no deserted calypsos pose was ever more effective ernest ernest that i should live to be so insulted and by you nay madame end this vaudeville said he bitterly i know well enough that you hate me or why have you troubled yourself to coin the untruths about me that you whispered to miss gordon ah have you no pity for the first mad vengeance dictated by jealousy and despair murmured pauline once there was attraction in this face for you ernest have some compassion some sympathy well as he knew the worth of madames tears ernest chivalric and generous at heart was touched forgive me he said gently and let us part you know now pauline that she has my deepest my latest love it were disloyalty to both did we meet again save in society farewell then murmured pauline think gently of me ernest for i have loved you more than you will ever know now she rose and as he bent towards her kissed his forehead then floating from the room passed the reverend eusebius standing in the doorway looking in on this parting scene the widow looked at herself in her mirror that night with a smile of satisfaction cest bien en train she said half aloud le fou de penser quil puisse me braver je ne laime plus cest vrai mais je ne veux pas quelle reussisse nina went to bed very happy ernest had sat next her at the dejeuner and afterwards at a ball had waltzed often with her and with nobody else and his eyes had talked love in the waltzes though his tongue never had ernest went to his chambers smoked hard half mad with the battle within him and took three grains of opium which gave him forgetfulness and sleep he woke tired and depressed to hear the gay hum of life in the street below and to remember he had promised nina to meet them at versailles it was sunday morning in england of course gordon would have gone up to the sanctuary listened to mr bellew frowned severely on the cheap trains and after his claret read edifying sermons to his household but in paris there would be nobody to admire the piety and the grandes eaux only play once a week you knowon sundays so his sabbath severity was relaxed and down to versailles he journied there must be something peculiar in continental air for it certainly stretches our countrymens morality and religion uncommonly it is only up at jerusalem that our pharisees worship eusebius dare not gohed be sure to meet a brotherclerical who might have reported the dereliction at homeso that vaughan despite gordons cold looks kept by ninas side though he wasnt alone with her and when they came back in the wagon the banker slept and the duenna dozed and he talked softly and low to hernot quite love but something very like itand as they neared paris he took the little hand with its delicate jouvin glove in his and whispered remember your promise i can brave and have braved most things but i could not bear your scorn that would make me a worse man than i have been if as some folks would tell you such a thing be possible it was dark but i dare say the moonbeams shining on the chevelure doree showed him a pair of truthful trusting eyes that promised never to desert him the day after he had by dint of tact and strategy planned to spend entirely with nina he was going with them to the races at chantilly then to the gaite to see the first representation of a vaudeville of a friend of his and afterwards he had persuaded gordon to enter the lions den and let nina grace a petit souper at no rue des mauvais sujets chaussee dantin the weather was delicious the raceground full if not quite so crowded as the downs on derby day ernest cast away his depression he gave himself up to the joy of being loved his wit had never rung finer nor his laugh clearer than as he drove back to paris opposite nina he had never felt in higher spirits than after having given carte blanche to a cordon bleu for the entertainment he looked round his salons luxurious as eugene sues and perfumed with exotics from the palais royal and thought of one rather different in style to the women that had been wont to drink his sillery and grace his symposia he knew well enough she loved him and his heart beat high as he put a bouquet of white flowers into a gold bouquetiere to take to her on his loverlike thoughts the voice of one of his parrotsernest had almost as many pets as there are in the jardin des plantesbroke in screaming bluette bluette sacre bleu elle est jolie bluette bluette the recollection was unwelcome vaughan swore a sacre bleu too diable she mustnt hear that francois put that bird out of the way he makes a such a confounded row the parrot fond of him as all things were that knew him sidled up arching its neck and repeating what de concressault had taught it fi donc ernest tu es volage tu ne maimes plus tu aimes pauline devil take the bird thought its master even hell be witness against me and as he went down stairs to his cab a chorus of birds shouting tu aimes pauline followed him and while he laughed he sighed to think that even these unconscious things could tell her how little his love was worth he forgot all but his love however when he leaned over her chair in the gaites and saw that strenuously as de concressault and de kerroualle sought to distract her attention and many as were the lorgnons levelled at the chevelure doree all her thoughts and smiles were given to him ernest had never even in his careless boyhood felt so happy as he did that night as he handed her into gordons carriage and drove to the chaussee dantin and though gordon sat there heavy and solemn looming like an iceberg on ernests golden future vaughan forgot him utterly and only looked at the sunshine beaming on him from radiant eyes that skeptic in her sex as he was from experience he felt would always be true to him the carriage stopped at no rue des mauvais sujets he had given her one or two dinners with the senecterre the de salvador and other fine ladiesgrand affairs at the freres provencaux that would have satisfied brillatsavarinbut she had never been to his rooms before and she smiled joyously in his face as he lifted her outthe smile that had first charmed him at the francais he gave her his arm and led her across the salle bending his head down to whisper a welcome gordon and selina and several men followed selina felt that it was perdition to enter the lions den but a fat old vicomte on whom shed fixed her eye was going and the femmes de trente ans that balzac champions risk their souls rather than risk their chances when the day is far spent and good offers grow rare ernests abyssinian mute subordinate to that grand gentleman m francois ushered them up the stairs making furtive signs to his master which vaughan was too much absorbed to notice francois in all his glory flung open the door of the salon in the salon a sight met ernests eyes which froze his blood more than if all the dead had arisen out of their graves on the slopes of pere la chaise the myriad of waxlights shone on the rooms fragrant with the perfume of exotics gleamed on the suppertable gorgeous with its gold plate and its flowers lighted up the aviary with its brilliant hues of plumage and showed to full perfection the snowy shoulders raven hair and rosehued dress of a woman lying back in a fauteuil laughing as de cheffontaine a man but slightly known to ernest leaned over her fanning her on a sofa in an alcove reclined another girl young fair and pretty the amber mouthpiece of a hookah between her lips and a couple of young fellows at her feet the brunette was bluette who played the soubrette roles at the odeon the blonde was celine gamelle the new premiere danseuse bluette rose from the depths of her amber satin fauteuil with her little petillant eyes laughing and her small plump hands stretched out in gesticulation mechant comme tu es tard ernest nous avons ete ici si longtempsdix minutes au moins and dis is you leetler new ingleesh friend how do you do my dear nina white as death shrank from her clinging with both hands to ernests arms as pale as she vaughan stood staring at the actress his lips pressed convulsively together the veins standing out on his broad high forehead the bold lion hunted into his lair for once lost all power all strength gordon looked over ninas shoulder into the room he recognized the women at a glance and with his heavy brow dark as night he glared on ernest in a silence more ominous than words or oaths and snatching ninas arm from his he drew her hand within his own and dragged her from the room ernest sprang after him good god you do not suppose me capable of this stay one instant hear me let us pass sir thundered gordon or by heaven this insult shall not go unavenged nina nina cried ernest passionately do you at least listenyou at least will not condemn nina wrenched her hands from her father and turned to him a passion of tears falling down her face no no have i not promised you with a violent oath gordon carried her to her carriage it drove away and ernest his lips set his face white and a fierce glare in his dark eyes that made bluette and celine tremble entered his salons a second time so bitter an anguish so deadly a wrath marked in his expressive countenance that even the frenchmen hushed their jests and the women shrunk away awed at a depth of feeling they could not fathom or brave the fierce anathemas of gordon the christian lamentations of eusebius the sneers of selina the triumphs of augusta all these vials of wrath were poured forth on ernest in poor little ninas ears the whole of the next day she had but one voice among many to raise in his defence and she had no armor but her faith in him gordon vowed with the same breath that she should never see vaughan again and that she should engage herself to ruskinstone forthwith eusebius poured in at one ear his mild milkandwater attachment and in the other details of ernests scene in the boudoir with madame de melusine or at least what he had seen of it i e her parting caress selina rang the changes on her immodesty in loving a man who had never proposed to her and augusta drew lively pictures of the eternal fires which were already being kept up below ready for the lions reception against all these furious batteries nina stood firm all their sneers and arguments could not shake her belief all her fathers commandsand when he was roused the old banker was very fiercecould not move her to promise not to see ernest again or alter her firm repudiation of the wardens proposals the thunder rolled the lightning flamed the winds screamed all to no purpose the little reed that one might have fancied would break stood steady the day passed and the next passed and there were no tidings of ernest ninas little loyal heart despite its unhesitating faith began to tremble lest it should have wrecked itself but then she thought of his eyes and she felt that all the world would never make her mistrust him on the surlendemain the de melusine called gordon and eusebius were out and nina wished her to be shown up ill as the girl felt she rose haughtily and selfpossessed to greet madame as announced by her tall chasseur with his green plume the widow glided into the room pauline kissed her lightly there are no end of judases among the dear sex and though something in ninas eye startled her she sat down beside her and began to talk most kindly most sympathisingly she was chagrinee desolee that her chere nina should have been so insulted every one knew m vaughan was quite entete with that little horrid coarse thing bluette but it was certainly very shocking men were such demons the affair was already repandue in paris everybody was talking of it ernest was unfortunately so well known he could not be in his senses she almost wished he was mad it would be the only excuse for him wild as he was she should scarcely have thought c c c ah chere enfant madame went on at the finish you do not know these meni do i fear you have been dazzled by this naughty fellow he is very attractive certainly if so though it will be a sharp pang it will be better to know his real character at once voyez donc he has been persuading you that you were all the world to him while at the same time he has been trying to make me believe the same see only two days ago he sent me this she held out a miniature nina who hitherto had listened in haughty silence gave a sharp cry of pain as she saw vaughans graceful figure stately head and statuelike features but before the widow could pursue her advantage nina rallied threw back her head and said her soft lips set sternly if you repulsed his love why was he obliged to repulse yours why did you tell him on saturday night that you had loved him more than he would ever know now the shot eusebius had unconsciously provided struck home madame was baffled her eyes sank under ninas and she colored through her rouge you have played two roles madame said nina rising and not played them with you usual skill excuse my english illbreeding if i ask you to do me the favor of ending this comedy certainly mademoiselle if it is your wish answered the widow now smiling blandly if it please you to be blind i have no desire to remove the bandage from your eyes seulement je vous prie de me pardonner mon indiscretion et jai lhonneur mademoiselle de vous dire adieu with the lowest of reverences madame glided from the room and as the door closed nina bowed her head on the miniature left behind in the deroute and burst into tears scarcely had la melusines barouche rolled away when another visitor was shown in and nina brushing the tears from her cheeks looked up hurriedly and saw a small woman finely dressed with a shetland veil on through which her small black eyes roved listlessly mademoiselle she said in very quick but very bad english i is come to warn you against dat ver wrong man mr vaughan i have like him helas i have like him too vell but i do not vish you to suffer too nina knew the voice in a moment and rose like a little empress though she was flushed and trembling i wish to hear nothing of mr vaughan if this is the sole purport of your visit i shall be obliged by your leaving me but mademoiselle i have told you i wish to hear nothing interposed nina quietly ver vell maamselle den read dat it is a copy and i got de original she laid a letter on the sofa beside nina two minutes after bluette joined her friend celine gamelle in a fiacre and laughed heartily clapping her little plump hands ah mon dieu celine comme elle est fiere la petite je ne lui ai pas dit un seul motelle ma arretee si vite si vite mais la lettre fera notre affaire nest pas oui oui the letter unfolded in ninas hand it was a promise of marriage from ernest vaughan to bluette lemaire voiceless and tearless nina sat gazing on the paper first she rose gasping for breath then she threw herself down sobbing convulsively till she heard a step caught up the miniature and letter dreading to see her father and instead saw ernest pale worn deep lines round his mouth and eyes standing in the doorway involuntarily she sprang towards him ernest pressed her to heart and his hot tears fell on the chevelure doree as he bent over her murmuring you have not deserted me god bless you for your noble faith at last he put her gently from him and leaning against the mantelpiece said with an effort between his teeth nina i came to bid you farewell and to ask your forgiveness for the wrong i have done you nina caught hold of him much as malibran seized hold of elvino leave me leave me no no you cannot mean it i have no strength for it now i see you said ernest looking down into her eyes and the bold reckless lion shivered under the clinging clasp of her little hands i need not say i was not the cause of the insult you received the other night pauline de melusine was the agent women willing to injure me the actors in it but there is still much for you to forgive tell me at once what have you heard of me she silently put the miniature and letter in his hand the blood rushed to his very temples and sinking his head on his arms his chest rose and fell with uncontrollable sobs all the pentup feelings of his vehement and affectionate nature poured out at last and you have not condemned me even on these he said at length in a hoarse whisper did i not promise she murmured but if i told you they were true she looked at him through her tears and put her hand in his tell me nothing of your past it can make no difference to my love let the world judge you as it may it cannot alter me ernest strained her to him kissing her wildly god bless you for your trust would to god i were more worthy of it i have nothing to give you but a love such as i have never before known but most would tell you all my love is worthless and my life has been one of reckless dissipation and of darker errors still until you awoke me to a deeper loveto thoughts and aspirations that i thought had died out for ever painful as it is to confess hush interrupted nina gently confess nothing with your past life i can have nothing to do and i wish never to hear anything that it gives you pain to tell you say that you love me now and will never love anotherthat is enough for me ernest kissed the flushed cheeks and eloquent lips and thanked her with all the fiery passion that was in him and his heart throbbed fiercely as he put her promise to the test no my darling priceless as your love is to me i will not buy it by concealment i will not sully your ears with the details of my life god forbid i should but it is only due to you to know that i did give both these women the lovetokens they brought you love it is desecration of the name but i knew none better then three years ago bluette lemaire first appeared at the odeon she is illiterate coarse heartless but she was handsome and she drew me to the coulisses i was infatuated with her though her ignorance and vulgarity constantly grated against all my tastes one night at her petit souper i drank more sillery than was wise i have a stronger head than most men perhaps there was some other stimulant in it at any rate she who was then poor and is always avaricious got from me a promise to marry her or to pay twenty thousand francs three months after i gave it i cared no more for her than for my old glove france is too wise to have breach of promise cases and give money to coarse and vengeful women for their pretended broken hearts but i had no incentive to create a scene by breaking with her and so she kept the promise in her hands what pauline de melusine is you can judge twelve months ago i met her at vichy the love she gave me and the love i vowed her were of equal valuethe love of paris boudoirs that i sent her that picture only two days ago is of course false on my word as a man of honor since the moment i felt your influence upon me i have shunned her now my own love you know the truth will you send me from you or will you still love and still forgive in an agony of suspense he bent his head to listen for her answer tears rained down her cheeks as she put her arms round his neck and whispered why ask are you not all the world to me i should love you little if i condemned you for any errors of your past i know your warm and noble heart and i trust to it without a fear there is no doubt between us now oh my prudent and conventional young ladies standing ready to accuse my poor little nina are you any wiser in your generation you who have had all nature taken out of you by finishing whose heads are crammed with societys laws and whose affections are measured out by rule who would have been cold and dignified and read ernest a severe lesson and sent him back hopeless and hardened to go ten times worse than he had gone beforebelieve me that impulse points truer than the world and that the dictates of the heart are better than the regulations of society take my word for it that love will do more for a man than lectures and faith in him be more likely to keep him straight than all your moralising and before you judge him severely for having drunk a little too deep of the sillery of life remember that his temptations are not your temptations nor his ways your ways and be gentle to dangers which society and custom keep out of your own path the stern thorn crows you offer to us when we are inclined to ask your absolution are not the right means to win us from the rose wreaths of our bacchanalia nina as you see loved her lion too well to remember dignity or take her stand on principle and gallantly did the young lady stand the bombardment from all sides that sought to break her resolutions and crush her misplaced affections gordon chanced to come in that day and light upon ernest and the fury into which he worked himself ill beseemed so respectable a pharisee vaughan kept tranquilly haughty and told the banker calmly that he thanked god he had his daughters love and his money he would never have stooped to accept gordon forbade him the house and carried nina back to england but before she went they had a parting interview in which ernest offered to leave her free but such freedom would have been worse than death to nina and before they separated she told him that in three months more she should be of age and then come what might she would be his if he would take her without wealth take her he would have done from the arms of satanus himself but to disentangle himself from all his difficulties was a task that beat the augean stables hollow the three months of his probation he worked hard he sold off all his pictures his stud and his meubles he sold what cost him a more bitter pang his encumbered estates in surrey he paid off all his debts bluettes twenty thousand francs included and shaking himself free of the accumulated embarrassments of fifteen years he crossed the water to claim his last love no poor little huguenot was ever persecuted for her faith more than poor little nina for her engagement every relative she had thought it his duty to write admonitory letters plentifully interspersed with texts eusebius and his l a year and his perspective bishopric were held up before her from morning to night the banker whose deception in the melusine had turned him into sharper vinegar than before told her with chill stoicism that she must of course choose her own path in life but that if that path led her into the chaussee dantin she need never expect a sou from him for all his property would be divided between her two brothers but nina was neither to be frightened nor bribed she kept true to her lover and disinherited herself they were married a week or two after ninas majority and gordon knew it though he could not prevent it they did not miss the absence of bridesmaids bishop dejeuner and the usual fashionable crowd it was a marriage of the heart you see and did not want the trappings with which they gild that bitter pill so often swallowed nowadaysa mariage de convenance nina as she saw further still into the wealth of deep feeling and strong affection which at her touch she had awoke in his heart felt that money and friends and the worlds smile were well lost since she had won him and ernesternests sacrifice was greater for it is not a little thing young ladies for a man to give up his accustomed freedom and luxuries and careless vie de garcon and to have to think and work for another even though dearer than himself but he had long since seen so much of life had exhausted all its pleasures so rapidly that they palled upon him and for some time he had vaguely wanted something of deeper interest of warmer sympathy unknown to himself he had felt the besoin detre aimea want the trash offered him by the women of his acquaintance could never satisfyand his warm passionate nature found rest in a love which though the strongest of his life was still returned to him fourfold after some months of delicious far niente in the south of france they came back to paris though anything but rich he was not absolutely poor after he had paid his debts and the necessity to exertion rousing his dormant talents the lion turned litterateur he was too popular with men to be dropped because he had sold his stud or given up his petits soupers the romance of their story charmed the parisians and though behind his back they sometimes jested about the lion amoureux there were not a few who envied him his young love and the sunshine that shone round them in his inexpensive appartement garni ernest was singularly happyand suddenly he became the star of the literary as he had been of the fashionable world his mots were repeated his vaudevilles applauded his feuilletons adored the world smiled on nina and her lion it made little difference to themthey had been as contented when it frowned but it made a good deal of difference across the channel gordon began to repent ernests family was high his austrian connexions very aristocratic there would be something after all in belonging to a man so well known be successful ami lecteur and all your relatives will love you besides he had found out that it is no use to put your faith in princes or clergymen eusebius had treated him very badly when he found he could not get nina and her money and spoke against the poor banker everywhere calling him with tender pastoral regret a worldly egyptian a dives a whitened sepulchre and all the rest of it probably too stoic though he was he missed the chevelure doree at any rate he wrote to her stiffly but kindly and settled two thousand a year upon her vaughan was very willing she should be friends with her father but nothing would make him draw a sou of the money so ninathe only sly thing she ever did in her lifeafter a while contrived to buy back the surrey estate and gave it to him with no end of prayers and caresses on the jour de lan and you do not regret my darling smiled ernest after wishing her the new years wishes having forgiven me for once drinking too much sillery and all the other naughty things of my vie de garcon regret interrupted nina vehementlyregret that i have won your love live your life share your cares and joys regret that my existence is one long day of sunshine oh why ask you know i can never repay you for the happiness of my life rather can i never repay you said vaughan looking down into her eyes for the faith that made you brave calumny and opposition and cling to my side despite all i was heartsick of the world and you called me back to life i was weary of the fools who misjudged me and i let them think me what they might ah how happy you make me cried nina i should have been little worthy of your love if i had suffered slander to warp me against you or if any revelations you cared enough for me to make of your past life had parted us love is not love that alters where it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove there monsieur she said throwing her arms round him with a laugh while happy tears stood in her eyesthere is a grand quotation for you mind and take care ernest that you never realise the ruskinstone predictions and make me repent having caught and caged such a terrible thing as a hunted paris lion sir galahads raid sir galahads raid an adventure on the sweet waters for the punishment of my sins may the gods never again send me to pera that i might have plenty on my shoulders i am frankly willing to concede all i protest is that when one submissively acknowledges the justice of ones future terminating in tophet it comes a little hard to get purgatory in this world into the bargain purgatory lies perdu for one all over the earth i have had fifty times more than my share already and the gout still remains an untried experience a gehenna grimly waiting to avenge every morsel of white truffle and every glass of comet claret with which i innocently solace my frail mortality purgatoryi have been chained in it fifty times et vous when you rush to a chancellerie with the english arms gorgeous above its doorway on the spur of a frightfully mysterious and autocratic telegram that makes it life or death to catch the train for england in ten minutes and have time enough to smoke about two dozen very big cheroots cooling your heels in the bureau and then hear when properly tortured into the due amount of frantic agony for the intelligence to be fully appreciated that his excellency is gone snipeshooting to and that the first secretary is in his bath and has given orders not to be disturbed your informant languidly pricking his cigar with his toothpick and politely intimating by his eyebrows that you and your necessities may go to the deucewhats that when you are doing the sanitary at weedon by some hideous conjunction of evil destinies in the very ducal week itself and thinking of the rush with which tom alcroft will land the filly or the close finish with which fordham will get the cup while you are not there to see are sorely tempted to realize the parisian vision of anglo suicide and load the appletrees with suspended human fruitwhats that when having got leave and established yourself in cosy huntingquarters with some cattle not to be beat in stay blood and pace close to a killing pack that never score a blank day there falls a bitter black frost locking the country up in iron bonds and making every bit of ridge and furrow like a sheet of glasswhats that bah i could go on ad infinitum and cite circles of purgatory in which mortal man is doomed to pass his time beside which dantes caina antenora and ptolomea sink into insignificance but of all purgatories chiefest in my memory ispera pera in the old crimean timepera the beautiful suburb of fond fictionpera with the dirt the fleas the murders the mosquitoes the crooked streets the lying greeks the stench the hubbub the dulness and the everlasting bono johnny call a dog hervey and i shall love him said johnson so dear was his friend to himcall a dog johnny and i shall kick him so abominable grew that word in the eternal turkish jabber tell me o prettiest softestvoiced most beguiling feminine aeothen in as romantic periods as you will of birdlike feluccas darting over the bosphorus of curled caiques gliding through fragrant waterweeds of arabian nights reproduced when up through the darkness peals the roll of the drums calling the faithful to prayers of the nights of ramadan with the starry clusters of light gleaming all down stamboul and flashing fireflylike through the dark citron grovestell me of it as you will i dont care you may think me a goth ce mest bien egal and you were not in cavalry quarters at pera i wasnt exacting i did not mind having ants in my jam nor centipedes in my boots nor a shirt in six months nor bacon for a luxury that strongly resembled an old file rusted by seawater nor any little trifle of that sort up in the front all that is in the fortune of war but i confess that pera put me fairly out of patience specially when a certain trusty friend of mine who has no earthly fault that i wot of except that of perpetually looking at life through a claude glass which is the most aggravating opticism to a dispassionate and unblinded mind that the world holds would poetize upon it or at least on the east in general which came pretty much to the same thing the sun poured down on me till conscience probably i remembered the scriptural threat to the wicked their brains shall boil in their skulls like potssir galahad as i will call him would murmur to himself with his cheroot in his teeth manfreds salut to the sun looking as lovingly at it as any eagle mosquitoes reduced me to the very borders of madnesssir galahad would placidly remark how buckland would revel here in all those gorgeous beetles a greek told crackers till i had to doublethong him like a puppysir galahad would shout to me to let the fellow alone he looked so deuced picturesque he must have him for a study i made myself wretched in a ticklish caique the size of a cockleshell where when one was going full harness to the great effendis it was a moral impossibility to be doubled without ones sash swinging into the water ones sword sticking over the side and the liveliest sensation of cramp pervading ones bodysir galahad blandly indifferent would discourse with superb ruskin obscurity of tone and coloring and harmonized light while he looked down the golden horn for he was a little artmad and painted so well that if he had been a professional the hanging committee would have shut him out to a certainty now he was a good fellow a beau sabreur who had fetched some superb back strokes in the battery at balaclava who could send a line spinning and land his horse in a gentleman riders race and pot the big game and lead the first flight over northamptonshire doubles at home as well as a man wants to do but i put it to any dispassionate person whether this persistent poetism of his flying in the face of facts and of fleas was not enough to make anybody swear in that mosquitopurgatorio of pera sir galahad was a capital fellow and the men would have gone after him to the death the fair frank handsome face a little womanish perhaps was very pleasant to look at and he got the victoria not long ago for a deed that would suit arthurs table but in pera i avow he made me swear hard and if he would just have set his heel on his claude glass cursed the turks and growled refreshingly i should have loved him better he was philosophic and he was poetic and the combination of temperaments lifted him in a mortifying altitude above ordinary humanity that was baked broiled grumbling savage bitten fleeced and holding its own against miserable rats greeks and bono johnnies with an aristides thieving its last shirt and a pisistratus getting drunk at its casebottle that sublime serenity of his in pera ended in making me unholy and ungenerous if he would but have sworn once at the confounded country i should have borne it but he never did and i longed to see him out of temper i pined and thirsted to get him disenchanted tout vient a point a qui sait attendre they say a motto by the way that might be written over the horse guards for the comfort of gloomy souls when in the words of the psalmist promotion cometh neither from the south nor from the east nor from the westby which lament one might conclude david of israel to have been a sufferer by the purchasesystem delicious said sir galahad sending a whiff of turkish tobacco into the air one morning after exercise when he and i having ridden out a good many miles along the sweet waters turned the horses loose bought some grapes and figs of an old turk dispossessed him of his bit of cocoamatting and flung ourselves under a planetree and the fellow looked round him through his raceglass at the cypress woods the mosques and minarets the almond thickets the soft creamy distance as he called it in his argot datelier and the greek fishermen near drawing up a net full of silvery prismatic fishes with a relish absolutely exasperating exasperatingwhen the sun was broiling ones brain through the linen and there wasnt a drop of bass or soda and b to be got for love or money and one thought thirstily of days at home in england with the birds whirring up from the stubble in the cool morning and the cold punch uncorked for luncheon under the home woods fringing the open one wants hunt to catch that bit of color murmured sir galahad luxuriously eying a mutilated janissarys tomb covered with scarlet creepers hunt be hanged said i meaning no disrespect to that eminent preraphaelite whose light of the world i took at first sight to be a policeman going his night rounds and come out in his shirt by mistake by the way it is a droll idea to symbolize the light of the world by a watchman with a dark lantern lux in tenebras with a vengeance give me the sweet shady side of pall mall and the devil may take the sweet waters whats the feast of bairam beside the derbyday or your confounded coloring beside a welldone cutlet whats lemonade by brighton tipper and a veiled bundle by a pretty blonde and an eternity of stamboul by an hour of piccadilly sir galahad smiled superior and shied a date at me goth cant you be content to feed like the patriarchs and live an idyl no id rather feed like a parisian and live an idler eat grapes if you choose i agree with brillatsavarin and dont like my wine in pills my good fellow youre all prose and youre all poetry youre as bad as that pretty little commissariat girl who lisped me to death last night at the embassy with platitudes of bosh about the poetry of marriage the deuce said sir galahad with a whistle that must be like most other poetry nowadaysuncommon dull prose sliced up in uneven lengths didnt you tell her so couldnt i should have pulled the string for a showerbath of sentiment when a womans bolted on romance you only make the pace worse if you gall her with the curb of common sense when romance is in reasons outexcuse the personality he didnt hear me he was up like a retriever who scents a wild duck or a waterrat among the sedges for sweeping near us with soft gliding motion as pretty as a toy and as graceful as a swan came a caique with the wife of a pacha of at least a hundred tails in it to judge by the costliness of her exquisite attire now women were not rare but then they were always veiled which is like giving a man a nugget he mustnt take out of the quartz a case of champagne he mustnt undo a coverside he is never to beat a trout stream in which he must never fling a fly and sir galahad whose loves were not i admit quite so saintly as arthurs code exacted lost his head in a second as the caique drifted past us and raising herself on her cushions the leilah duda or salya within it glanced toward the myrtle screen that half hid us with the divinest antelope eyes in the world and letting the silver gauze folds of her veil float half aside showed us the beautiful warm bloom the proud lips and the chestnut tresses braided with pearls and threaded with gold of your genuine circassian beauty shade of don juan what a face it was a yataghan might have been at his throat a bowstring at his neck eunuchs might have slaughtered and pachas have impaled him galahad would have seen more of that loveliness headlong he plunged down the slope crushing through the almond thickets and scattering the green treefrogs right and left the caique was just rounding past as he reached the waters edge and the beautys veil was drawn in terror of her guard but as the little cockleshell pretty and ticklish as a nautilus was moored to a broad flight of marble stairs the circassian turned her head towards the place where the unbeliever stood in the sunlighther eyes were left her and with them women speak in a universal tongue then the green lattice gate shut the white impenetrable walls hid her from sight and sir galahad stood looking down the sweet waters in a sort of beatific vision in love for the th time in his life and certainly he had never been in love with better reason for is there anything on earth so divine as your antelopeeyed and goldhaired circassian i shall be inside those walls or know the reason why said he whom two gazelle eyes had fired and captured there by the side of the sunny sweet waters where the lazy air was full of syringa and rose odors and there was no sound but the indolent beating of the tired oars on the ripples which reason you will rapidly find i suggested in a knock on the head from the faithful well a very picturesque way of coming to grief to go off the scene in the sickwards from raki and fruit would be commonplace and humiliating but to die in a serail stabbed through and through by greeneyed jealousy would be piquant and refreshing to the last degree do you really think theres a chance of it said galahad rather anxiouslythe eager wistful anxiety of a man who athirst for the forest hears of the rumored slot of an outlying deerwhile he shouted the greek fishermen to him and learned after sore travail through a slough of mixed italian turkish and albanian that the white palace with its green lattice and its hanging gardens belonged to a rich merchant of constantinople and that this veiled angel was the favorite of his harem leilah derran a recent purchase in circassia and the queen of the anderun the old rascal swore galahad in his wrath which was not however i think caused by any particular christian disgust at polygamy a fat old sinner ill be bound who sits on his divan puffing his chibouque and stuffing his sweetmeats as yellow as beppo and as round as a ball bah what pearls before swine its enough to make a saint swear those heavenly eyes and galahad went into a somewhat earthly reverie colored with a thirsty jealousy of the purchaser and the possessor of this circassian gazelle as he rode reluctantly back towards pera the circassian was in his head and did not get out again he let himself be bewitched by that lovely face which had flashed on him for a second and began to feel himself as aggrieved by that innocent and unoffending turkish lord of hers as if the unlucky gentleman had stolen his own property the antelope eyes had looked softly and hauntingly sad moreover i demonstrated to him that it was nothing more than the way that the eyelashes drooped but nobody in love very few people out of it have any taste for logic he was simply disgusted with my realism and saw an instant vision for himself of this loveliest of slaves captive in a bazaar and sold into the splendid bondage of the harem as into an inevitable fate mournful in her royalty as a nightingale in a cage stifled with roses and as little able to escape as the bird a vision which intoxicated and enraptured sir galahad who in the teeth of every abomination of pera had been content to see only what he wished to see and had maintained that the execrable east to make it the east of hafiz and all the poets only wantedavailable haidees hang it i think its nothing but hades said an aide overhearing that statement one night as we stumbled out of a halfcafe halfgamblingbooth pandemonium into the crooked narrow pitchdark street where dogs were snarling over offal jackals screaming turkish bands shrieking cannon booming out the hour of prayer women yelling alarms of fire a zouave was spitting a greek by way of practice and an irishman had just potted a dalmatian in as brawling rowing pestiferous unodorous an earthly gehenna as men ever succeeded in making sir galahad was the least vain of mortals nevertheless being as wellbeloved by the maidens and young widows for his fair handsome face as harold the goldhaired he would have been more than mortal if he had not been tolerably confident of killing and luxuriously practised in that pleasant pastime that if he could once get the antelope eyes to look at him they would look lovingly before long he was in comfortable security but how to get into a presence which it was death for an unbeliever and a male creature to approach was a knottier question and the difficulty absorbed him there were several rather telling englishwomen out there with whom he had flirted faute de mieux at the cavalry balls we managed to get up in pera at the embassy costumeball on board yachtdecks in the harbor and in picnics to therapia or the monastery but they became as flavorless as twicetold tales and twicewarmed entremets beside the new piquance the delicious loveliness the divine difficulty of this captive circassian that he had no more earthly business to covet her than he had to covet the unlucky turkish traders lumps of lapislazuli and agate never occurred to him the stones didnt tempt him you see but the beauty did that those rich soft unrivalled eastern charms merely born to bloom and drop should be caged from the world and only rejoice the eyes of a fat old opiumsoddened stamboul merchant seemed a downright reversal of all the laws of nature a tampering with the balance of just apportionment that clamored for redress but like most other crying injustice the remedy was hard to compass day after day he rode down to the same place on the sweet waters on the chance of the caiques passing and sure enough the caique did pass nine times out of ten and when opportunity served for such a hideous oriental crime not to be too perilous the silver gauze floated aside unveiling a face as fair as the morning or when that was impossible the eyes turned on him shyly and sadly in their lustrous appeal as though mutely bewailing such cruel captivity those eyes said as plainly as language could speak that the lovely favorite plaintively resisted her bondage and thought the frank with his long fair beard and his six feet of height little short of an angel of light though he might be an infidel givenhot languid days nothing to do sultry air heavy with orange and rose odors and those silent passages repeating themselves every time that leilah derrans caique glided past the myrtle screen where her giaour lay perdu the result is conjectural though they had never spoken a word they had both fallen in love voiceless amourettes have their advantageswhen a woman speaks how often she snaps her spell for instance when the lips are divine but the utterance is slangy when the mouth is adorably rosebud but what it says is most horrible horsy a tender pity too gave its spur to his passion he saw that all queen of the serail though she might be this fettered gazelle was not happy in her rosechains and to galahad who had a wonderful twist of the knighterrant and lived decidedly some eight centuries too late no wiliest temptation would have been so fatal as this he swore to get inside those white inexorable walls and he kept his oath one morning the latticed door stood ajar with the pomegranates and the citrons nodding through the opening he flung prudence to the winds and peril to the devil and entered the forbidden ground where it was death for any man save the fat omar himself to be found the fountains were falling into marble basins the sun was tempered by the screen of leaves the lories and hummingbirds were flying among the trumpetflowers altogether a most poetic and pleasant place for an erratic adventure more so still when as he went farther he saw reclining alone by the mosaic edge of a fountain his lovely circassian unveiled with a cry of terror she sprang to her feet graceful as a startled antelope and casting the silver shroud about her head would have fled but the scream was not loud enough to give the alarmperhaps she attuned it soand flight he prevented such turkish as he had he poured out in passionate eloquence his love declaration only made the more piquant by the knowledge that in a trice the gardens might swarm with the mussulmans guards and a scimitar smite his head into the fountain but the danger he disdained la belle leilah remembered rebuke him she did not nor yet call her eunuchs to rid her of this terrible giaour but the antelope eyes filled with piteous tears and she prayed him begoneif he were seen here in the gardens of the women it were his death it were hers her terror at the infidel was outweighed by her fear for his peril how handsome he was with his blue eyes and fair locks after the bald blackbrowed yellow obese little omar let me see again the face that is the light of my soul and i will obey thee thou shalt do with thy slave as thou wilt whispered galahad in the most impassioned and poetical turkish he could muster thinking the style of hafiz understood better here than the style of belgravia while the almondeyed leilah trembled like a netted bird under his look and his touch conscious pretty creature that were it once known that a giaour had looked on her poison in her coffee or a sullen plunge by night into the bosphorus would expiate the insult to the honor of omar a master whom she piteously hated she let her veil float aside nevertheless blushing like a seashell under the shame of an unbelievers gazea genuine blush that is banished from europehis eyes rested on the lovely youth of her face his cheek brushed the loose train of her amber dropping hair his lips met her own then with a startled stifled cry his coy gazelle sprang away lost in the aisles of the roses and galahad quitted the dangerous precincts in safety so far not quite clear whether he had been drinking or dreaming and of conviction that pera had changed into paradise for he was in love with two things at once a romance and a woman and an anchorite would fairly have lost his head after the divine dawn of beauty in leilah derran the morrow of course found him at the same place at the same hour hoping for a similar fortune but the lattice door was shut and defied all force he was just about to try scaling the high slippery walls by the fibres of a clinging figtree when a negress the sole living thing in sight beckoned him a hideous abyssinian enough for a messenger of eros a grinning goodnatured black who had been bought in the same bazaar and of the same owner as the lovely circassian to whose service she was sworn she told him by scraps of turkish and signs that leilah had bidden her watch for and warn him that it were as much as both their lives were worth for him to be seen again in the womens gardens or anywhere near her presence that the merchant omar was a monster of jealousy and that the rest of the harem jealous of her supremacy and of the unusual liberty her ascendancy procured her would love nothing so well as to compass her destruction further meeting with her infidel lover she pronounced impossible unless he would see her consigned to the bosphorus an ice avalanche of intelligence which falling on the tropical eden of his passion had the effect as it was probably meant that it should have of drowning the lingering remnant of prudence and sanity that had remained to him after his lips had once touched the exquisite easterns under the circumstances the negress was his sole hope and chance he pressed her into his service and made her mercury and mediatrix in one she took his messages sent in the only alphabet the pretty gazelle could read i e flowers plotted against her owner with true eastern finesse wrought on the circassians tenderness for the giaour and her terrified hatred of her grim lord omar and threw herself into the intrigue with the avidity of all womanhood be it black or be it white for anything on the face of the earth that has the charm of being forbidden the affair was admirably en train and galahad was profoundly happy he was deliciously in lovea pleasant spice as difficult to find in its full flavor as it is to bag a sand grouseand had an adventure to amuse him that might very likely cost him his head and might fairly claim to rise into the poetic the only reward he received or ever got for that matter for the balaclava brush where he cut down three gunners and had a ball put in his hip had been a cavil raised by a critic not there of doubt whether he had ever ridden inside the lines at all but his circassian would have recompensed him at once for a score of years of chersonnesus campaigning and unprofessional chroniclers he was perfectly happy and his soft careless couleur de rose enjoyment of the paradise was aggravating to beholdwhen one was in pera and the heat broiled alive every mortal thing that wasnt a negro and bass was limited and there were no dailies and one thought even lovingly and regretfully of the old beastly shells that had at least this merit that they scattered bores when they burst old fellowwant something to do he asked me one day i nodded being silent and savage from having had to dance attendance on the sultan at an embassy reception peace to his manes now but i know i wished him heartily in eblis at that time come with me tonight then if you dont mind a probability of being potted by a true believer went on leilah derrans lover going into some golden water soyer had sent me for the big game like it of all things but you know im tied by the leg here galahad laughed oh i only want you an hour or two ive got six days leave for the pigs and the deer but the hills wont see much of me im going to make a raid in the rosegardens it may be hot work so i thought you would like it of course i did and asked the programme which sir galahad as lucidly as a man utterly in love can tell anything unfolded to me fortune favored him it was the night of the feast of bairam when all the world of turkey lights its lamps and turns out he had got leave under pretext of a shooting trip into roumelia but the game he was intent on was the captive circassian who in the confusion and tintamarre attendant on bairam was to escape to him by the rosegardens and being carried off as swiftly as syrian stallions could take them would be borne away by her infidel lover on board a yacht belonging to a man whom he knew who was cruising in the bosphorus which would steam them away down the dardanelles before the turk had a chance of getting in chase nothing could be better planned for everybody but the luckless mussulman who was to be robbedand the whole thing had a fine flavor about it of dash and difficulty of piquance and poetry of mediaeval errantry and oriental coloring that put leilahs giaour most deliciously in his element setting apart the treasure that he would carry off in that rich soft antelopeeyed brighthaired circassian loveliness which made all the dreams in lalla rookh and don juan look pale so his raid was planned and i agreed to go with him to cover the rear in case of pursuit which was likely enough to be hot and sharp for the moslems for all their apathy lack the philosophic gratitude which your british husband usually exhibits towards his despoilerbut then to be sure an englishman cant make a fresh purchase unless hes first robbed of the old night came and the nights i am forced to admit have a witching charm of their own in the east that the west never knows the commander of the faithful went to prayer with the roar of cannon and the roll of drums pealing down the golden horn and along the cypressclad valleys the mosques and minarets starred and circled with a myriad of lamps gleamed through the dark foliage and were mirrored in the silvery sheet of the waves the caiques as they swept along left tracks of light in the phosphorlit waves and while the chant of the muezzin rang through the air the children of allah from one end of the bosphorus to the other held festival on the most holy eve of bairam a splendid night for a lyric of swinburnesa superb scene for an amorous adventure and as we mingled amongst the crowds of the faithful swarming with their painted lanterns their wild music their gorgeous colors their booming guns in street and caique on land and sea sir galahad though an infidel had certainly entered the seventh heaven he had never been more intensely in love in his life and if the fates should decree that the dogs of islam should slay him at her feet in the sanctuary of her roseparadise he was ready to say in his pet poets words with the last breath of his lips it was ordained to be so sweet and best comes now beneath thine eyes and on thy breast still kiss me care not for the cowards care only to put aside thy beauteous hair my blood will hurt in the night of the feast all the world was astir franks and moslems believers and unbelievers and we made our way through the press unwatched to where omars house was illumined the cressets and wreaths and stars of light sparkling through the black foliage under the walls hidden by a group of planes we fastened the stallions in readiness and galahad at the latticed door gave the signal word kef low whispered the door unclosed and true to her tryst in the silvery bosphorus moonlight crouching in terror and shame was the veiled and trembling circassian but not in peace was her capture decreed to be made scarce had the door flown open when the shrill yell of allah hu allah hu rung through the air and from the dark aisles of the gardens poured mussulmans slaves and eunuchs the turk with a shoal at his back giving the alarm with hideous bellowings while their drawn scimitars flashed in the white starlight and their cries filled the air with their din make off while i hold the gate i shouted to galahad who catching leilah derran in his arms before the moslems could be nigh us held her close with one hand while with his right he levelled his revolver as i did and backedfacing the turks at sight of the lean shining barrels the moslems paused in their rush for a secondonly a second the next shouting to allah till the minarets gave back the echo they sprang at us their curled naked yataghans whirling above their heads their jetty eyeballs flaming like tigers on the spring our days looked numberedi gave them the contents of one barrel and in the moments check we gained the outside of the gardens the swarm rushed after us their shots flying wide and whistling with a shrill hiss harmlessly past we reserved further fire not wishing to kill if we could manage to cut our way through without bloodshed and backed to the planetrees where the horses were waiting there was a moments blind but breathless struggle swift and indistinct to remembrance as a flash of lightning the turks swarmed around us while we beat them off and hurled them asunder somehow omar sprang like a rattlesnake on to his spoiler his yataghan circling viciously in the air to crash down upon galahads skull who was encumbered by the clinging embrace of his stolen circassian i straightened my left arm with a remnant of science that savored more of old cambridge than of crimean custom the moslem went down like an ox and keeping the yelling pack at bay with the levelled deathdealer i threw myself into saddle just as galahad flung himself on his stallion and the syrians fleet as arab breeding could make them tore down the beach in the rich eastern night while the balls shrieked through the air past our ears and the shouts of our laughter with the salute of a ringing english cheer in victorious farewell answered the howls of our distant and baffled pursuers sir galahads raid was a triumph on we went through the hot fragrant air through the silvery moonlight through the deep shade of cypress and pine woods on we went through gorge and ravine and defile through stretches of sweet wild lavender of shining sands of trampled rosefields with the phosphorlit sea gleaming beside us and the islam feast of bairam left far distant behind on and onwhile the glorious night itself was elixir and one shouted to the starry silence robert brownings grand challenge how good is mans life the mere living how fit to employ all the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy that ride was superb we never drew rein till some ten miles farther on where we saw against the clear skies the dark outline of the yacht with a blue light burning at her masthead the signal selected then galahad checked the good syrian who had proved pace as fleet as the wild pigeon blue is ever vouched in the desert and bent over his prize who through that long ride had been held close to his breast with her arms wound about him and the beautiful veiled face bowed on his heart the moon was bright as day and he stooped his head to uplift the envious veil and see the radiant beauty that never again would be shrouded and to meet once more the lips which his own had touched before but in one single caress he bowed his head and i thought that my disinterested ungrudging friendship made the friendships of antiquity look small whenan oath that chilled my blood rang through the night and over the seas startling the echoes from rock and hill the veiled captive reeled from the saddle with a wailing scream hurled to earth by the impetus with which his arms loosed her from him and away into the night without word or sign plunging headlong down the dark defile riding as men may ride from a field that reeks with death far out of sight into the heart of the black dank woods his syrian bore sir galahad and lo in the white moonlight against the luminous sea slowly there rose before me unveiled and confessedthe negress the history of that night we never learnt whether leilah derran herself played the cruel trick on her giaour lover but this he always scouted whether omar himself was a man of grim humor whether the abyssinian having betrayed her mistress was used as a decoybird dressed like the circassian to lure the infidels into the rosegardens where the faithful intended to dispatch them hastily to eblisno one knows we could never find out the negress escaped me before my surprise let me stay her and the fray made the place too hot for close investigation nor do i know where galahad tore in that wild nightride whose spur was the first maddened pain and rage of shame that his life had tasted i never heard where he spent the six days of his absence but when he joined us again six weeks in the sickwards would not have altered him more all he said to me was one piteous phrasefor gods sake dont tell the fellowsand i never did i liked him well enough not to make chaff of him unholily had i thirsted to see him disenchanted ungenerously had i pined to see him goaded out of temper i had my wish and i dont think i enjoyed it i saw him at last in passion that i had much to do to tame down from a deadly vengeance that would have rung through the allied armies and i saw him loathe the east curse romance burn all the poets with hafiz at their head and shun a womans beauty like the pestilence to this day i believe that the image of leilah derran haunts his memory and that a certain remorse consumes him for his lost gazelle whom he always thought paid penalty for their love under the silent waves of the bosphorus with those lost ones whose souls according to the faith of stamboul flit ceaselessly above its waters in the guise of its whitewinged unrestful seagulls he is far enough away just nowin which of the deathpots where we are simmering and fritting away in little wretched driblets men and money that would have sufficed caesar or scipio to conquer an empire matters not to his story when he reads this he will remember the bitterest night of his life and the fiasco that ended sir galahads raid redeemed redeemed an episode with the confederate horse bertie winton had got the gold vase the sovereign one of the best horses that ever had a dash of the godolphin blood in him had led the first flight over the ridgeandfurrow cleared the fences trying as the shirethorn could make them been lifted over the stiffest doubles and croppers passed the turningflags and been landed at the straight runin with the stay and pace for which his breed was famous enrapturing the fancy who had piled capfuls of money on him and getting the soldiers blue riband from the guards who had stood crackers on little benyons mountben who is as pretty as a girl with his petites mains blanches riding like any professional now i take itand i suppose there are none who will disagree with methat there are few things pleasanter in this life than to stand in the crisp winters morning winner of the grand military having got the gold vase for the old corps against the best mounts in the service life must look worth having to you when you have come over those black barren pastures and rugged ploughed lands where the field floundered helplessly in grief with brixworth brook yawning gaunt and wide beneath you and the fresh cold north wind blowing full in your teeth and have ridden in at the distance alone while the air is rent by the echoing shouts of the surging crowd and the best ridingmen are left nowhere behind life must look pleasant to you if it had been black as thunder the night before nevertheless where bertie winton sat having brought the sovereign in winner of the g m with that superb bays head a little drooped and his flanks steaming but scarce a hair turned while the men who had won pots of money on him crowded round in hot congratulation and he drank down some curacoa punch out of a pocketpistol with his habitual soft low languid laugh he had that in his thoughts which took the flavor out of the curacoa and made the sunny cheery winters day look very dull and gray to him for bertie sitting there while the cheers reeled round him like mad with a singularly handsome reckless face long tawny moustaches tired blue eyes and a splendid length and strength of limb knew that this was the last day of the old times for him and that he had sailed terribly near the wind ofdishonor he had been brought to envisager his position a little of late and had seen that it was very bad indeedas bad as it could be he had run through all his own fortune from his mother a good one enough and owed almost as much again in bills and one way and another he had lost heavily on the turf gamed deeply travelled with the most expensive adventuresses of their day startled town with all its worst crim cons had every vice under heaven save that he drank not at all and now having shot a russian prince at baden the august before about lillah lis had received on the night just passed from the horse guards a hint which was a command that his absence was requested from her majestys servicea mandate which politely though inexorably couched would have taken a more forcible and public form but for the respect in which his father old lion winton as he was called was held by the army and the authorities and bertie who for fiveandthirty years had never thought at all except on things that pleasured him and such bagatelles as barriere duels abroad delicatelyspiced intrigues bills easily renewed the cru of wines and the siege of women found himself pulled up with a rush and face to face with nothing less than ruin im up a tree melcombe he said to a man of his own corps that day as he finished a great cheroot before mounting badly well yes itll be smash this time i suppose bother thats hard lines its rather a bore he answered with a little yawn as he got into the saddle and that was all he ever said then or afterwards on the matter but he rode the sovereign superbly over the barren wintry grassland and landed him winner of the blue riband for all that though black care for the first time in his life rode behind him and weighted the race poor bertie nobody would have believed him if he had said so but he had been honestly and truly thinking for some brief time past whether it would not be possible and worth while for him to shake himself free of this life of which he was growing heartily tired and make a name for himself in the world in some other fashion than by winging russians importing new dancers taking french women to the bads scandalizing society and beggaring himself he had begun to wonder whether it was not yet after all too late and whether ifwhen down had come the request from the horse guards for him to sell out and the rush of all his creditors upon him and away forever went all his stray shapeless fancies of a possible better future andconsolation or aggravation whichever it behe knew that he had no one save himself to thank for it for no man ever had a more brilliant start in the race of life than he and none need have made better running over the course had he only kept straight or put on the curb as he went downhill poor bertie you must have known many such lives or i cant tell where your own has been spent lives which began so brilliantly that none could rival them and which endedgod help themso miserably and so pitifully that you do not think of them without a shudder still poor bertiea man of a sweeter temper a more generous nature a more lavish kindliness never lived he had the most versatile talents and the gentlest manners in the world and yet here he was having fairly come to ruin and very nearly to disgrace it was little wonder that his father looking at him and thinking of all he might have been and all he might have done was lashed into a terrible bitterness of passionate grief and hurled words at him of a deadly wrath in the morning that followed on the grand military fiery as his comrades the napiers of a stern code as a soldier and a lofty honor as a man haughty in pride and swift to passion old sir lionel was stung to the quick by his sons fall and would have sooner by a thousandfold have followed him to his grave than have seen him live to endure that tacit dismissal from the service of the countrythe deepest shame in his sight that could have touched his race i knew you were lost to morality but i did not know till now that you were lost to honor said the old lion with such a storm of passion in him that his words swept out acrid and unchosen in a very whirlwind i knew you had vices i knew you had follies i knew you wasted your substance with debtors and gamblers like yourself on courtesans and gamingtables in parisian enormities and vaunted libertinage but i did not think that you were so utterly a traitor to your blood as to bring disgrace to a name that never was approached by shame until you bore it berties face flushed darkly then he grew very pale the indolence with which he lay back in an ecartechair did not alter however and he stroked his long moustaches a little with his habitual gentle indifferentism it is all over pray do not give it that tremendous earnestness he said quietly nothing is ever worth that and i should prefer it if we kept to the language of gentlemen the language of gentlemen is for gentlemen retorted the old man with fiery vehemence his heart was cut to the core and all his soul was in revolt against the degradation to his name that came in the train of his heirs ruin when a man has forgot that he has been a gentleman one may be pardoned for forgetting it also you may have no honor left for your career to shame i haveand by god sir from this hour you are no son of mine i disown youi know you no longer go and drag out all the rest of a disgraced life in any idleness that you choose if you were to lie dying at my feet i would not give you a crust bertie raised his eyebrows slightly soit but would it not be possible to intimate this quietly a scene is such very bad stylealways exhausting too the languid calmness the soft nonchalance of the tone were like oil upon flame to the old lions heart lashed to fury and embittered with pain as it was a heavier oath than print will bear broke from him with a deadly imprecation as he paced the library with swift uneven steps it had been better if your style had been less and your decency and your honor greater one word more is all you will ever hear from my lips the title must come to you that unhappily is not in my hands to prevent it must be yours when i die if you have not been shot in some gambling brawl or some bagnio abroad before then but you will remember not a shilling of money not a rood of the land are entailed and by the heaven above us every farthing every acre shall be willed to the young children you are disinherited sirdisowned for everif you died at my feet now go and never let me see your face again as he spoke bertie rose the two men stood opposite to each othersingularly alike in form and feature in magnificence of stature and distinction of personal beauty save that the tawny gold of the old lions hair was flaked with white and that his blue eyes were bright as steel and flashing fire while the younger mans were very worn his face too was deeply flushed and his lips quivered while his sons were perfectly serene and impassive as he listened without a muscle twitching or even a gleam of anxiety coming into his eyes they were of different schools bertie heard to the end then bowed with a languid grace it will be fortunate for lady wintons children make her my compliments and congratulations goodday to you their eyes met steadily oncethat was all then the door of the library closed on him bertie knew the worst he was face to face with beggary as he crossed the hall the entrance to the conservatories stood open he looked through paused a moment and then went in on a low chair buried among the pyramids of blossom sat a woman reading aristocrat to the core and in the earliest bloom of her youth for she was scarcely eighteen beautiful as the morning with a delicate thoroughbred beauty dark lustrous eyes arched pencilled brows a smile like sunshine and lips sweet as they were proud she was ida deloraine a ward of sir lionel and a cousin of his young second wifes bertie went up to her and held out his hand lady ida i am come to wish you goodbye she started a little and looked up goodbye are you going to town yesa little farther will you give me that camellia by way of bon voyage a soft warmth flushed her face for a moment she hesitated slightly toying with the snowy blossom then she gave it him he had not asked it like a love gage he took it and bowed silently over her hand you will find it very cold said lady ida with a trifle of embarrassment nestling herself in her dormeuse in her warm bright nest among the exotics he smileda very gentle smile yes i am frozen out adieu he paused a moment looking at herthat brilliant picture framed in flowers then without another word he bowed again and left her the woman he had learned too late to love and had lost by his own folly for ever frozen out what could he meanthere is no frost thought lady ida left alone in her hothouse warmth among the white and scarlet blossoms a little startled a little disappointed a little excited with some vague apprehension she could not have told why while bertie winton went on out into the cold gray winters morning from the old northamptonshire hall that would know him no more with no end so likely for him as that which had just been prophesieda shot in a gambling hell facilis descensus averniand he was at the bottom of the pit well the descent had been very pleasant bertie set his teeth tight and let the waters close over his head and shut him out of sight he knew that a man who is down has nothing more to do with the world save to quietly acceptoblivion it was a hot summer night in secessia the air was very heavy no wind stirring the dense woods crowning the sides of the hills or the great fields of trodden maize trampled by the hoofs of cavalry and the tramp of divisions the yellow corn waved above the earth where the dead had fallen like wheat in harvesttime and the rice grew but the richer and the faster because it was sown in soil where slaughtered thousands rotted unsepulchred and unrecorded the shadows were black from the reared mountain range that rose frowning in the moonlight and the stars were out in southern brilliancy shining as calmly and as luminously as though their rays did not fall on graves crammed full with dead on flaming homesteads crowded sickwards poisonous waters that killed their thousands in deadly rivalry with shot and shell and vast battalions sleeping on their arms in wheatfields and by riverswamps in opposing camps and before beleaguered cities where brethren warred with brethren and virginia was drenched with blood there was no sound save now and then the challenge of some distant picket or the faint note of a trumpetcall the roar of a torrent among the hills or the monotonous rise and fall from miles away in the interior of the negroes funeral song old joemore pathetic somehow when you catch it at night from the far distance echoing on the silence as you sit over a watchfire or ride alone through a ravine than many a grander requiem it was close upon midnight and all was very still for they were in the heart of the south and on the eve of a perilous enterprise coined by a bold brain and to be carried out by a bold hand it was in the narrow neck of a valley pent up between rocky shelving ridges anywhere you will between maryland and georgiafor he who did this thing would not care to have it too particularly drawn out from the million other deeds of derringdo that the mighty story of the great war has known and buried eight hundred confederate horse some of stuarts cavalry had got driven and trapped and caged up in this miserable defile misled and intercepted with the dense mass of a federal army marching on their rear within them by bare fifteen miles and the forward route through the crammed defile between the hills by which alone they could regain lees forces dammed up by a deep rapid though not broad river by a bridge strongly fortified and barricaded and on the opposite bank by some federal corps a couple of thousand strong well under cover in riflepits and earthworks thrown up by keen woodsmen and untiring trenchdiggers it was close peril deadly as any that secessia had seen here in the hot still midnight with the columns of the federal divisions within them by eight hours march stretching out and taking in all the land to the rear in the sweep of their semicircular wings while in front rose black and shapeless in the deep gloom of the rocks above the barricades upon the bridge behind which two thousand rifles were ready to open fire at the first alarm from the federal guard and alone without the possibility of aid caged in among the trampled corn and maize that filled the valley imprisoned between the two federal forces as in the iron jaws of a trap the handful of southern troopers stood resolute to sell their lives singly one by one and at a costly price and perish to a man rather than fall alive into the hands of their foes when the morning broke they would be cut to pieces as the chaff is cut by the whirl of the steamwheels they knew that well they looked at it steadily it had no terrors for them the cavaliers of old virginia so that they died with their face to the front there was but one chance left for escape aid there could be none and that chance was so desperate that even to themreckless in daring living habitually between life and death and ever careless of the issueit looked like madness to attempt it but one among them had urged it on their considerationurged it with passionate entreaty pledging his own life for its success and they had given their adhesion to it for his name was famous through the confederacy he had won his spurs at manasses at antietam at chancellorsville he had been in every headlong charge with stuart he had been renowned for the most dashing border raids and conspicuous staff service of any soldier in secessia he had galloped through a tempest of the enemys balls and swept along their lines to reconnoitre riding back through the storm of shot to lee as coolly as though he rode through a summer shower at a review and his words had weight with men who would have gone after him to the death he stood now the only man dismounted in true virginia uniform a rough ridingcoat crossed by an undressed chamois belt into which his sabre and a brace of revolvers were thrust a broad spanish sombrero shading his face great hessians reaching above his knee and a long silken goldencolored beard sweeping to his waista keen reconnoitrer a daring raider a superb horseman and a soldier heart and soul when he had laid before them the solitary chance of the perilous enterprise that he had planned each man of the eight hundred had sought the post of danger for himself but there he was inexorablewhat he had proposed he alone would execute the federals were ignorant of their close vicinity for their near approach had been unheard the trodden maize and rice and the angry foaming of the torrent above deadening the sound of their horses hoofs and the unionmen satisfied that the rebels were entrapped beyond escape were sleeping securely behind their earthworks the passage of the river blockaded by their barricade while the southerners were drawn up close to the head of the bridge in sections of threes screened by the intense shadow of the overhanging rocks shadow darker from the brilliance of the full summer moon that shining on the enemys encampment and on the black boiling waters thundering through the ravine was shut out from the defile by the leaning pinecovered walls of granite it was terribly still that awful silence only filled with the splashing of the water and the audible beat of the federal sentinels measured tramp as they were drawn up there by the bridgehead and though they had cast themselves into the desperate effort with the recklessness of men for whom death waited surely on the morrow it looked a madmans thought a madmans exploit to them as their leader laid aside his sword and pistols and took up a small barrel of powder part of some ammunition carried off from some sappers and miners stores in the raid of the past day the sight of which had brought to remembrance a stray halfforgotten story told him in boyhood of one of soults armythe story on which he was about to act now for gods sake take care whispered the man nearest him and though he was a veteran who had gone through the hottest of the campaign since bulls run his voice shook and was husky as he spoke the other laughed a littlea slight soft languid laugh all right my dear fellow he whispered back theres nothing in it to be alarmed at a frenchman did it in the peninsula you know only if i get shot or blown up and the alarm be given do you take care to bolt over and cut your way through in the first of the rush thats all then without more words he laid himself down at full length with a cord tied round his ankle that they might know his progress and the cask of gunpowder swathed in green cloth that it should roll without noise along the ground and creeping slowly on his way propelling the barrel with his head and guiding it by his hands was lost to their sight in the darkness by the string as it uncoiled through their hands they could tell he was advancing that was all the chances were as a million to one that his life would pay the forfeit for that perilous and daring venture a single shot and he would be blown into the air a charred and shapeless corpse one spark on that rolling mass that he pushed before him and the explosion would hurl him upward in the silent night mangled dismembered blackened lifeless but his nerve was not the less cool nor did his heart beat one throb the quicker as he crept noiselessly along in the black shade cast by the parapet of the bridge with the tramp of the guard close above on his ear and rifles ready to be levelled on him from the covered earthworks if the faintest sound of his approach or the dimmest streak of moonlight on his moving body told the federals of his presence he had looked death in the teeth most days through the last five years it had no power to quicken or slacken a single beat of his pulse as he propelled himself slowly forward along the black rugged uneven ground and on to the passage of the bridge as coolly as fearlessly as he would have crept through the heather and bracken after the slot of a deer on the moorside at home he heard the challenge and the tramp of the sentinel on the opposite bank he saw the white starlight shine on the barrels of their breechloaders as they paced to and fro in the stillness filled with the surge and rush of the rapid waters beneath him shrouded in the gloom he dragged himself onward with slow and painful movement stretched out on the ground urging himself forward by the action of his limbs so cautiously that even had the light been on him he could scarcely have been seen to move or been distinguished from the earth on which he lay eight hundred lives hung on the coolness of his own if he were discovered they were lost and without haste without excitation he drew himself along under the parapet until he came to the centre of the bridge placed the barrel close against the barricades uncovered the head of the cask and took his way back by the same laborious tedious way until he reached the virginian troopers gathered together under the shelving rocks a deep hoarse murmur rolling down the ranks the repressed cheer they dared not give aloud welcomed him and the dauntless daring of his act man after man pressed forward entreating to take his place to share his peril he gave it up to none and three times more went back again on that deadly journey until sufficient powder for his purpose was lodged under the federal fortifications on the bridge two hours went by in that slow and terrible passage then for the last time he wound a saucisson round his body serpentwise and with that coil of powder curled around him took his way once more in the same manner through the hot dark heavy night and those left behind in the impenetrable gloom ignorant of his fate knowing that with every instant the crack of the rifles might roll out on the stillness and the ball pierce that deathsnake twisted round his limbs and the rocks echo with the roar of the exploding powder blasting him in the rush of its sheet of fire and stones sat mute and motionless in their saddles with a colder chill in their bold blood and a tighter fear at their proud hearts than the cavaliers of the south would have known for their own peril or than he knew for his another halfhour went byan eternity in its long drawnout suspensethen in the darkness under the rocks his form rose up amongst them readyready the low whisper passed all but inaudible from man to man he took back his sabre and pistols and thrust them into his belt then stooped struck a slow match and laid it to the end of the saucisson whose mouth he had fastened to the barrels on the bridge and rapidly as the lightning flung himself across the horse held for him and fell into line at the head of the troop there was a moment of intense silence while the fire crept up the long stick of the match then the shrill hissing snakelike sound that none who have once heard ever forget rushed through the quiet of the night and with a roar that startled all the sleeping echoes of the hills the explosion followed the columns of flame shooting upward to the starlit sky and casting their crimson lurid light on the black brawling waters on the rugged towering rocks on the gnarled trunks of the lofty pines and on the wild picturesque forms and the bold swarthy spanishlike faces of the confederate raiders with a shock that shook the earth till it rocked and trembled under them the pillar of smoke and fire towered aloft in the hush of the midnight blasting and hurling upward in thunder that pealed back from rock to rock lifeless bodies mangled limbs smouldering timbers loosened stones dead men flung heavenward like leaves whirled by the wind and iron torn up and bent like saplings in a storm as the mass of the barricades quivered oscillated and fell with a mighty crash while the night was red with the hot glare of the flame and filled with the deafening din the federals sleeping under cover of their intrenchments woke by that concussion as though heaven and earth were meeting poured out from pit and trench from salient and parallel to see their fortifications and their guard blown up while the skies were lurid with the glow of the burning barricades and the ravine was filled with the yellow mist of the dense and rolling smoke confused startled demoralized they ran together like sheep vainly rallied by their officers some few hundred opening an aimless desultory fire from behind their works the rest rushing hither and thither in that inextricable intricacy and nameless panic which doom the best regiments that were ever under arms when once they seize them charge shouted the confederate leader his voice ringing out clear and sonorous above the infernal tempest of hissing roaring shrieking booming sound with that resistless impetus with which they had over and over again broken through the granite mass of packed squares and bristling bayonets the southerners raising their wild warwhoop thundered on to the bridge which strongly framed of stone and iron had withstood the shock as they had foreseen and while the fiery glare shone and the seething flame hissed on the boiling waters below swept full gallop over the torn limbs the blackened bodies the charred wood the falling timbers the exploding powder with which the passage of the bridge was strewn and charged through the hellish din the lurid fire the heavy smoke at a headlong pace down into the federal camp a thousand shots fell like hail amongst them but not a saddle was emptied not even a trooper was touched and with their line unbroken and the challenge of their warshout pealing out upon the uproar they rode through the confusion worse confounded and cutting their way through shot and sabre through levelled rifles and through piled earthworks with their horses breathing fire and the roar of the opening musketry pealing out upon their rear dashed on never drawing rein down into the darkness of the front defile and into the freshness of the starry summer night saved by the leader that they loved andfree tarnation cheeky thing to do guess they aint wise to rile us that way said a federal general from vermont as they discussed this exploit of the eight hundred at the federal headquarters a splendid thing said an english visitor to the northern camp who had come for a six months tour to see the war for himself having been in his own time the friend of paget and vivian and londonderry the comrade of picton of mackinnon and of arthur wellesley a magnificent thing i remember bouchard did something the same sort of thing at amarante but not half so pluckily nor against any such odds whos the fellow that led the charge id give anything to see him and tell him what i think of it how will napier would have loved him by george whos the dd rebel jed said the general taking his ginsling think hes an englishman wed give ten thousand dollars for him alive or dead hes fifty devils in one that i know responded the colonel of artillery thus appealed to a gentlemanlike quiet man educated at west point god bless the fellow im glad hes english said the english visitor heartily forgetting his federal situation and companions who is he perhaps i know the name should say you would its the same as your ownwinton bertie winton they call him maybe hes a relative of yours the blood flushed the englishmans face hotly for a second then a stern dark shadow came on it and his lips set tight i have no knowledge of him he said curtly havent you now thats curious some said he was a son of yours pursued the colonel the old lion flung back his silvery mane with his haughtiest imperiousness no sir hes no son of mine lion winton sat silent the dark shadow still upon his face for five years no rumor even had reached him of the man he had disowned and disinherited he had believed him deadshot as he had predicted after some fray in a gamingroom abroad and now he heard of him thus in the warnews of the american camp his denial of him was not less stern nor his refusal to acknowledge even his name less peremptory because with all his wrath his bitterness his inexorable passion and his fierce repudiation of him as his son a thrill of pleasure stirred in him that the man still liveda proud triumph swept over him through all his darker thoughts at the magnificent dash and daring of a deed wholly akin to him bertie a listless man about town a dilettante in pictures wines and women spending every moment that he could in paris gentle as any young beauty always bored and never roused out of that habitual languid indolent indifferentism which the old man fiery and impassioned himself as the napiers held the most damnable effeminacy with which the present generation emasculates itself had been incomprehensible antagonistic abhorrent to him bertie the leader of the eight hundred the reckless trooper of the virginian horse the head of a hundred wild night raids the hero of a score of brilliant charges the chief in the most daring secret expeditions and the most intrepid cavalry skirmishes of the south was far nearer to the old lion who had in him all the hot fire of crawfords school with the severe simplicity of wellingtons stern creeds he is true to his blood at last he muttered as he tossed back his silky white hair while his blue flashing eyes ranged over the far distance where the southern lines lay with something of eager restlessness he is true to his blood at last there was fighting some days later in the shenandoah valley longstreets corps with two regiments of cavalry had attacked sheridans divisions and the struggle was hot and fierce the day was warm and a brilliant sun poured down into the green cornland and woodland wealth of the valley as the southern divisions came up to the attack in beautiful precision and hurled themselves with tremendous elan on the right front of the federals who covered by their hastily thrownup breastworks opened a deadly fire that raked the whole confederate line as they advanced men fell by the score under the murderous mitraille but the ranks closed up shoulder to shoulder without pause or wavering only maddened by the furious storm of shot as the engagement became general and the white rolling clouds of smoke poured down the valley and hid conflict and combatants from sight the thunder of the musketry pealing from height to height while in many places men were fighting literally face to face and hand to hand in a deathstrugglerare in these days when the duello of artillery and the rivalry of breechloaders begins decides and ends most battles on longstreets left two squadrons of virginian cavalry were drawn up waiting the order to advance and passionately impatient of delay as regiment after regiment were sent up to the attack and were lost in the whirling cloud of dust and smoke and they were kept motionless in reserve at their head was bertie winton unconscious that on a hill to the right with a group of federal commanders his father was looking down on that struggle in the shenandoah bertie was little altered save that on his face there was a sterner look and in his eyes a keener and less listless glance but the old languid grace the old lazy gentleness were there still they were part of his nature and nothing could kill them in him in the five years that had gone by none whom he had known in europe had ever heard a word of him or from him he had cut away all the moorings that bound him to his old life and had sought to build up his ruined fortunes like the penniless soldier that he was by his sword alone so far he had succeeded he had made his name famous throughout the states as a bold and unerring cavalry leader and had won the personal friendship and esteem of the chiefs of the southern confederacy the five years had been filled with incessant adventures with ever present peril with the din of falling citadels with the rush of headlong charges with daring raids in starless autumn nights with bivouacs in trackless western forests with desertthirst in parching summer heats with winters of such frozen roofless misery as he had never even dreamedfive years of ceaseless danger of frequent suffering of habitual renunciation but five years of lifereal vivid unselfishand bertie was a better man for them what he had done at the head of eight hundred was but a sample of whatever he did whenever duty called or opportunity offered in the service of the south and no man was better known or better trusted in all lees divisions than bertie winton who sat now at the head of his regiment waiting longstreets orders an aide galloped up before long the general desires you to charge and break the enemys square to the left colonel bertie bowed with the old pall mall grace turned and gave the word to advance like greyhounds loosed from leash the squadrons thundered down the slope and swept across the plain in magnificent order charging full gallop riding straight down on the bristling steel and levelled rifles of the enemys kneeling square they advanced in superb condition in matchless order coming on with the force of a whirlwind across the plain midway they were met by a tremendous volley poured direct upon them half their saddles were emptied the riderless chargers tore snorting bleeding terrified out of the ranks the line was broken the virginians wavered halted all but recoiled it was one of those critical moments when hesitation is destruction bertie saw the danger and with a shout to the men to come on he spurred his horse through the raking volley of shot while a shot struck his sombrero leaving his head bare and urging the animal straight at the federal front lifted him in the air as he would have done before a fence and landed him in the midst of the square down on the points of the levelled bayonets with their fierce warcheer ringing out above the sullen uproar of the firing his troopers followed him to a man charged the enemys line broke through the packed mass opposed to them cut their way through into the centre and hewed their enemies down as mowers hew the grass longstreets work was done for him the federal square was broken never again to rally but the victory was bought with a price as his horse fell pierced and transfixed by the crossed steel of the bayonets a dozen rifles covered the confederate leader their shots rang out and bertie winton reeled from his saddle and sank down beneath the press as his own southerners charged above him in the rush of the onward attack on an eminence to the right through his raceglass his father watched the engagement his eyes seldom withdrawn from the virginian cavalry where for aught he knew one of his own blood and name might bememories of salamanca and quatre bras of moodkee and ferozeshah stirring in him while the fire of his dead youth thrilled through his veins with the tramp of the opposing divisions and he roused like a warhorse at the scent of the battle as the white shroud of the smoke rolled up to his feet and the thunder of the musketry echoed through the valley through his glass he saw the order given to the troopers held in reserve he saw the magnificent advance of that charge in the morning light he saw the volley poured in upon them and he saw them under that shock reel stagger waver and recoil the old soldier knew well the critical danger of that ominous moment of panic and of confusion then as the confederate colonel rode out alone and put his horse at that leap on to the line of steel into the bristling square a cry loud as the virginian battleshout broke from him for when the charger rose in the air and the sun shone full on the uncovered head of the southern leader he knew the fair english features that no skies could bronze and the fair english hair that blew in the hot wind he looked once more upon the man he had denied and had disowned and as bertie winton reeled and fell his father all unarmed and noncombatant as he was drove the spurs into his horses flanks and dashing down the steep hillside rode over the heaps of slain and through the pools of gore into the thick of the strife with his charger dead under him beaten down upon one knee his swordarm shivered by a bullet while the blood poured from his side where another shot had lodged bertie knew that his last hour had come as the impetus of the charge broke above himas a great wave may sweep over the head of a drowning manand left him in the centre of the foe kneeling there while the air was red before his sight that was fast growing blind from the loss of blood and the earth seemed to reel and rock under him he still fought to desperation his sabre in his left hand he knew he could not hold out more than a second longer but while he had strength he kept at bay his life was not worth a moments purchasewhen with a shout that rang over the field the old lion rode down through the carnage to his rescue his white hair floating in the wind his azure eyes flashing with warfire his holsterpistol levelled spurred his horse through the struggle trampled aside all that opposed him dashed untouched through the crossfire of the bullets shot through the brain the man whose rifle covered his son who had reeled down insensible and stooping raised the senseless body lifted him up by sheer manual strength to the level of his saddlebow laid him across his holsters holding him up with his right hand and while the federals fell asunder in sheer amazement at the sudden onslaught and admiration of the old mans daring plunged the rowels into his horse and breaking through the reeking slaughter of the battlefield rode back thus laden with his prisoner through the incessant fire of the cannonade up the heights to the federal lines if you were to lie dying at my feethis father remembered those words that had been spoken five years before in the fury of a deadly passion as bertie lay stretched before him in his tent the blood flowing from the deep shotwound in his side his eyes closed his face livid and about his lips a faint and ghastly foam had he saved him too late had he too late repented his heart had yearned to him when in the morning light he had looked once more upon the face of his son as the virginian horse had swept on to the shock of the charge and all of wrath of bitterness of hatred of dark implacable unforgiving vengeance were quenched and gone for ever from his soul as he stooped over him where he lay at his feet stricken and senseless in all the glory of his manhood he only knew that he loved the manhe only knew that he would have died for him or died with him bertie stirred faintly with a heavy sigh and his left hand moved towards his breast old sir lion bent over him while his voice shook terribly like a womans bertie my god dont you know me he opened his eyes and looked wearily and dreamily around he did not know what had passed nor where he was but a faint light of wonder of pleasure of recognition came into his eyes and he smileda smile that was very gentle and very wistful i am glad of thatbefore i die let us part friendsnow they will tell you i haveredeemedthe name the words died slowly and with difficulty on his lips and as his fathers hand closed upon his in a strong grasp of tenderness and reconciliation his lids closed his head fell back and a deepdrawn labored sigh quivered through all his frame and lion winton bowing down his grand white crest wept with the passion of a woman for he knew not whether the son he loved was living or deadhe knew not whether he was not at the last too late three months further on lady ida deloraine sat in her warm bright nest among the exotics gazing out upon the sunny lawns and the green woodlands of northamptonshire highest names and proudest titles had been pressed on her through the five years that had gone but her loveliness had been unwon and was but something more thoughtful more brilliant more exquisite still than of old the beautiful warmth that had never come there through all these years was in her cheeks now and the nameless lustre was in her eyes which all those who had wooed her had never wakened in their antelope brilliancy as she sat looking outward at the sunlight for in her hands lay a camellia withered colorless and yellow and eyes gazed down upon the marvellous beauty of her face which had remembered it in the hush of virginian forests in the rush of headlong charges in the glare of bivouac fires in the silence of nightpickets and in the din of falling cities and berties voice as he bent over her was on her ear that flower has been on my heart night and day and since we parted i have never done that which would have been insult to your memory i have tried to lead a better and a purer life i have striven to redeem my name and my honor i have done all i could to wash out the vice and the vileness of my past through all the years we have been severed i have had no thought no hope except to die more worthy of you but nowoh my godif you knew how i love you if you knew how my love alone saved me his words broke down in the great passion that had been his redemption and as she lifted her eyes upward to his own soft with tears that had gathered but did not fall and lustrous with the light that had never come there save for him he bowed his head over her and as his lips met hers he knew that the redeemed life he laid at her feet was dearer to her than lives more stainless but less nobly won our wager our wager or how the major lost and won i introduces major telfer of the th dashaway hussars the softest of loungingchairs an unexceptionable hubblebubble bought at benares the last bells life the morning papers chocolate milled to a t and a breakfast worthy of francatelliwhat sensible man can ask more to make him comfortable all these was my chum hamilton telfer major th dashaway hussars enjoying and yet he was in a frame of mind anything but mild and genial the deuce take the whole sex said he stroking his moustache savagely theyre at the bottom of all the mischief going the idea of my father at seventyfive with hair as white as that poodles making such a fool of himself when here am i at sixandthirty unmarried its abominable its disgusting a girl of twenty taking in an old man of his age for the sake of his money but are you sure telfer said i that the affairs really on the tapis sure yes said the major with immeasurable disgust i never saw her till last night but the governor wrote no end of rhapsodies about her and as i came upon them he was taking leave of her holding her hand in his and saying i may write to you may i not and the young hypocrite lifted her eyes so bewitchingly oh yes i shall long so much to hear from you she colored when she saw mewell she might if she thinks shell make a fool of my father and reign paramount at torwood give me a motherinlaw sixteen years younger than myself and fill the house and cumber the estates with a lot of wretched little brats shell find herself mistaken for ill prevent it if i live dont be too sure of that said i from what i know of violet tressillian shes not the sort of girl to lure her quarry in vain of course shell try hard answered telfer she comes of a race that always were poor and proud shes an orphan and hasnt a sou and to catch a man like my father worth l a year with the surety of a good dower and jointure house whenever he die is one of the best things that could chance to her but ill be shot if she ever shall manage it nous verrons i bet you my roan filly calceolaria against your colt jockeyclub that before christmas is out violet tressillian will be violet telfer done cried the major stirring his chocolate fiercely youll lose vane calceolaria will come to my stables as sure as this mouthpiece is made of amber whenever this scheming little actress changes her name it shant be to the same cognomen as mine i say its getting deuced warmone must begin to go somewhere what do you say to going abroad till

worldly possessions already in sherry and seltzer and iced punch and if i go where its warmer still i shall be utterly beggared essellau is in swabia as you ought to know by this you goth its marc von edenburghs place and a very jolly place too i can tell you the sports firstrate there and the pigsticking really splendid hes just written to ask me to go and take any fellows i like as hes got some english peoplesome friends of his mothers a drawback thati wonder who they are will you come vane i can promise you some fun if only at the trenteetquarante tables in pipesandbeersbad oh yes ill come said i i hope the english wont be some horrid snobs hes picked up at some of the balls wholl be scraping acquaintance with us when we come back no fear said telfer marcs as english as you or i and knows the good breed when he sees them hed keep as clear of the smith brown and robinson style as we should its settled then youll come all right i wish i could settle that confounded violet too first i hope nothing will happen while im in essellau i dont think it can the tressillian leaves town today with the carterets and the governor must stick here till parliament closes and its sure to be late this year with which consolatory reflection the major rose stretched himself yawned sighed stroked his moustache fitted on his lavender gloves and rang to order his tilbury round telfer was an only son and when he heard it reported that his father intended to give him a bellemere in a young lady as attractive as she was poor who if she caught him would probably make a fool of the old gentleman in the widest sense of the word he naturally swore very heartily and anything but relished the idea hamilton telfer senior had certainly been a good deal with violet that season and violet a girl poor as a rat and beautiful as semele talked to him and sang to him and rode with him more than she did with any of us so people talked and talked and said the old member would get caught and the major when he heard it waxed fiercely wroth at the folly his parent had fallen into while hed been off the scene down at dover with his troop but like a wise man said nothing knowing both by experience and observation that opposition in such affairs is like a patent vesta among hayricks telfer was a particular chum of mine wed lounged about town and shot on the moors and campaigned in india together and i dont believe there was a better soldier a cooler head a quicker eye or a steadier hand in the service than he was he was sixandthirty now and had seen life pretty well i can tell you for there was not a getatable corner of the globe that he hadnt looked at through his eyeglass tall and muscular with a stern handsome face with the prospect of torwood where theres some of the best shooting in england i give you my word and l a year telfer was a great card in the matrimonial line but hadnt let himself be played as yet for the petty trickery the women used in trying to get him dealt to them disgusted him and small wonder men liked him cordially women thought him cold and sarcastic and he was much more genial i admit at mess or at lansquenet or in the smokingroom of the u s than he was in boudoirs and ballrooms as the mere knowledge that mammas and their darlings were trying to hook him made him get on his stilts at once i dont feel easy in my mind about the governor said he as we drove along to the southeastern station a few days after on our way to essellau as i was bidding him goodbye this morning soames brought him a letter in a womans hand heaven knows he may have a score of fair correspondents for anything i care but if i thought it was the tressillian devil take her and the devil wont have had a prettier prize since proserpine was stolen said i no confound it i saw she was handsome enough swore the major disgusted and a pretty face always did make a fool of my father according to his own telling well thank god i dont take that weakness after him i never went mad about any woman youve just as much control over love if you like as over a quiet shooting pony and if it dont suit you to gallop you can rein up and give over the sport any man whos anything of a philosopher neednt fall in love unless he likes were you never in love then old boy i asked of course i have been ive made love to no end of women in my time but when one love was died out i took another as i take a cigar and never wept over the quenched ashes you need never fall in love unless its convenient and as to caring for a girl who dont care for you thats a contemptible weakness and one i dont sympathize with at all come along or the train will be off he went up to the carriages opened a door shut it hastily and turned away with the frigid bow with which telfer in common with every other briton can say go to the devil as plainly as if he spoke by jove said i whats that eccentric move did you see the medusa in that carriage or a baby something quite as bad said he curtly i saw the tressillian and her aunt for heavens sake lets get away from them id rather have a special train if it cost me a fortune than travel with that girl boxed up for four hours in the same compartment with such a little intrigante calm your mind old fellow if shes aiming at your governor she wont hit you she cant be your wife and your motherinlaw both laughed fred walsham a goodnatured little chap in the carabiniers a friend of von edenburgh who was coming with us ill see her shot before shes either said telfer fiercely stroking his moustache hush the deuce hold your tongue said walsham giving him a push for past us so close that the curling plumes in her hat touched the majors shoulder floated the little intrigante in question whod come out of her carriage to see where a pug of hers was put shed heard all we said confound it for her head was up her color bright and she looked at telfer proudly and disdainfully with her dark eyes flashing telfer returned it to the full as haughtily for he never shirked the consequences of his own actions pon my life they looked like a great stag and a little greyhound challenging each other and violet swept away across the platform youve made an enemy for life telfer said walsham as we whisked along so much the better if im a rock ahead to warn her off a marriage with the governor rejoined the major smoking as he always did under the officials very noses i hope i shant come across her again if the tressillian and i meet we shall be about as amicable as a rat and a beagle take a weed fred i do it on principle to resist unjust regulations why shouldnt we take a pipe if we like a man whose olfactory nerves are so badly organized as to dislike cavendish is too great a muff to be considered as ill luck would have it when we crossed to dover who should cross too but the tressillian and her partyaunt cousins maid courier and pug telfer wouldnt see them but got on the poop as far away as ever he could from the spot where violet sat nursing her dog and reading a novel provokingly calm and comfortable to the envious eyes of all the malades around her good heavens said he was anything ever so provoking just because that girls my particular aversion she must haunt me like this if shed been anybody i wanted to meet i should never have caught a glimpse of her for mercys sake vane if you see a black hat and white feather anywhere again tell me and well change the route immediately change the route we did for going on board the steamer at duesseldorf there on the deck stood the tressillian telfer turned sharp on his heel and went back as he came ill be shot if i go down the rhine with her lets cut across into france cut across we did but we stopped at brussels on our way and when at last we caught sight of the tops of the firtrees around essellau telfer took a long whiff at his pipe with an air of contentment i should say were safe now shell hardly come pigsticking into the middle of swabia ii violet tressillian essellau was a very jolly place with thick woods round it and the river beersbad running in sight and his pretty sister the comtesse virginie his good wines and good sport made von edenburghs a pleasant house to visit at marc himself who is in the austrian service he was winged at montebello the other day by a rascally zouave but he paid him off for it as i hope his countrymen will eventually pay off all the bonapartists for their galimatiasmarc himself was a jolly fellow a good host a keen shot and a capital ecarte player and made us enjoy ourselves at essellau as he had done before hunting and shooting with telfer down at torwood ive some countrywomen of yours here telfer said marc after wed talked over his english loves given him tiding of duchesses and danseuses and messages from no end of pretty women that hed flirted with the christmas before theyre some friends of my mothers and when they were at badenbaden last year virginie struck up a desperate young lady attachment with one of them are they goodlookingbecause if they are they may be drysalters daughters and i shant care interrupted fred telfer stroked his moustache with a contemptuous smilehe wouldnt have looked at a drysalters daughter if shed had all the beauty of amphitrite come and see said marc virginie will think youre neglecting her atrociously horribly bored to be going to meet some englishwomen who might turn out to be smiths or joneses and would to a dead certainty spoil all his pleasure in pigsticking shooting and ecarte by flirting with him whether he would or no the major strode along corridors and galleries after von edenburgh when at length we reached the salon where virginie and her mother and friends were telfer lifted his eyes from the ground as the door opened started as if hed been shot and stepped back a pace or two with an audible if that isnt the very devil there in a low chair sat the tressillian graceful as a sphakiote girl with a toilet as perfect as her profile dark hair like waves of silk and dark eyes full of liquid light that when they looked irresistible could do anything with any man that they liked violet certainly looked as unlike that unlucky ogre and scapegoat the devil as a young lady ever could but worse than a score of demons was she in poor telfers eyes to have come out to essellau only to be shut up in a countryhouse for a whole month with his pet aversioncertainly it was a hard case and the fierce lightning glance he flashed on her was pardonable under the circumstances but nobodys more impassive than the major ive seen him charge down into the sikhs with just the same calm quiet expression as hed wear smoking and reading a novel at home so he soon rallied bowed to the tressillian who gave him an inclination as cold as the north pole shook hands with her aunt and cousins three women i hate the mammas the most dexterous of manoeuvrers and the girls the arrantest of flirts and then sat down to a little quiet chat with virginie von edenburgh whos pretty intelligent and unaffected though shes a belle at the viennese court telfer was pleasant with the little comtesse hed known her from childhood and she was engaged to the colonel of marcs troop so that telfer felt quite sure shed no designs upon him and talked to her sans gene though to have wholly abstained from bitterness and satire would have been an impossibility to him with the obnoxious tressillian seated within sight once he fixed her with his calm gray eyes she met them with a proud flashing glance telfer gave back the defiance and guerre a outrance was declared between them it was plain to see that they hated one another by instinct and i began to think calceolaria wasnt so safe in my stables after all for if the major set his face against anything his father who pretty well worshipped him would never venture to do it in opposition hed as soon think of leaving torwood to the country to be turned into an infirmary or a museum that whole day telfer was agreeable to the von edenburgh distantly courteous to the carterets and utterly oblivious of the very existence of the tressillian when we were smoking together after dinner he began to unburden himself of his mighty wrath where the deuce did you pick up that girl marc asked he as we stood looking at the sun setting over the woods of essellau and crimsoning the western clouds what girl asked marc that confounded tressillian answered the major gloomily i told you the carterets were friends of my mothers and last year when the tressillian came with them to baden virginie met her and they were struck with a great and sudden love for one another after the insane custom of women but why on earth telfer do you call her such names i think her divine her eyes are something i wish her eyes had been at the devil before shed bewitched my poor father with them said telfer pulling a rose to pieces fiercely i give you my word marc that if i didnt like you so well id go straight off home tomorrow here have i been turning out of my route twenty times on purpose to avoid her and then she must turn up at the very place i thought i was sure to be safe from her its enough to make a man swear i should say and not overmildly either but whats she done cried von edenburgh thinking i dare say that telfer had gone clean mad refused youjilted youwhat is it refused me i should like to see myself giving her the chance said the major with intense scorn no but shes done what id never forgivetried to cozen the poor old governor into marrying her shes no money you know and no home of her own but for all that for a girl of twenty to try and hook an old man of seventyfive to cheat him into the idea that hes made a conquest and chisel him into the belief that shes in love with himfaugh the very idea disgusts one what sort of a wife would a woman make who could act such a lie as he spoke a form swept past him and a beautiful face full of scorn and passion gleamed on him through the demilumiere by jove youve done it now telfer said walsham she was behind us i bet you gathering those roses her hands are full of them and she took that means of showing us she was within earshot you have set your foot in it nicely certainly ce mest bien egal said telfer haughtily if she hear what i say of her so much the better its the truth that a young girl whod sell herself for money as soon as shes got what she wanted will desert the man whos given it to her and i like my father too well to stand by and see him made a fool of the tressillian and i are open foes nowwell see which wins and a very fair foe you have too thought i as i looked at violet that night as she stood in the window a wreath of lilies on her splendid hair and her impassioned eyes lighting into joyous laughter as she talked nonsense with von edenburgh isnt she firstrate style in spite of your prejudice i said to telfer whod just finished a game at ecarte with de tintiniac one of the best players in europe if the major has any weakness ecarte is one of them he just glanced across with a sarcastic smile well got up of course so are all actresseson the stage then he dropped his glass and went back to his cards and seemed to notice the splendid tressillian not one whit more than he did her pup whether his discourteous speeches had piqued violet into showing off her best paces or whether its a natural weakness of her sex to shine in all times and places that they can certain it was that i never saw the tressillian more brilliant and bewitching than she was that night waltzing with von edenburgh singing with me talking fun with fred or merely lying back in her chair playing lazily with her bouquet she was eminently dangerous in whatever she did and there wasnt a man in the castle who didnt gather round her except her sworn foe the major even de tintiniac that old campaigner at the green tables who has long ago given over any mistress save hazard glanced once or twice at the superb eyes beaming with the droit de conquete but telfer never looked up from his cards telfer and she parted with the chilliest of good nights and met again in the morning with the most frigid of good mornings and to that simple exchange of words was their colloquy limited for an entire fortnight unless id been witness of it i wouldnt have credited that any two people could live for that space of time in the same countryhouse and keep so distant nobody noticed it for there were no end of guests at essellau and the tressillian had so many liege subjects ready to her slightest bidding that the majors lesemajeste wasnt of such consequence but when day after day came and he spent them all boarhunting shooting fishing or playing rougeetnoir and roulette at the gamingtables in pipesandbeersbad and when he was in the drawingrooms at essellau she saw him amusing and agreeable and unbending to every one but herself i dont know anything of womans nature if i didnt see violets delicate cheek flush and her eyes flash whenever she caught the majors cool contemptuous depreciating glance much harder to her sex to bear than spoken ridicule or open war occasionally he cast a sarcasm quick sharp and relentless as a minie ball at her which she fired back with such riflepowder as she had in her flask but the return shot fell as harmlessly as it might have done on achilless breast a man is very silly to marry he was saying one evening to marc since as emerson says from the beginning of the world such as are in the institution want to get out and such as are out want to get in violet sitting near at the piano turned half round if all others are of my opinion major telfer you will never be tempted for no one will be willing to enter it with you the shot fell short telfer neither smiled nor looked annoyed but answered tranquilly possibly but my time is to come when i own torwood ladies will be as kind to me as they are now to my father for it is wonderful what a charm to renew youth reform rakes buy love and make the beast the beauty is un peu de poudre dor in the eyes of the beau sexe the tressillian flushed scarlet but soon recovered herself i have heard she said pulling her bouquet to pieces with impatience that when people look through smoked glass the very sun looks dusky and so i suppose through your own moral perceptions you view those of others you know what de la fayette wrote to madame de sable quelle corruption il faut avoir dans lesprit pour etre capable dimaginer tout cela it does not follow answered telfer impassively de la fayette was quite wrong suard was nearer the truth when he said that rochefoucauld a peint les hommes comme il les a vus il nappartenait qua un homme dune reputation bien pure et bien distinguee doser fletrir ainsi le principe de toutes les actions humaines and major telfer is so unassailable himself that he can mount his pedestal and censure all weaker mortals said violet sarcastically your judgments are perhaps not always as infallible as the gods you are gone very wide of the original subject miss tressillian answered telfer coldly i was merely speaking of that common social fraud and falsehood a mariage de convenance which as i shall never sin in that manner myself i am at liberty to censure with the scorn i feel for it he looked hard at her as he spoke the tressillians eyes answered the stare as haughtily some may not be all mariages de convenance that you choose to call such it does not necessarily follow because a girl marries a rich man that she marries him for his money there may be love in the case but the world never gives her the grace of the doubt what hardy hypocrisy thought telfer shed actually try to persuade me to my face that she was in love with the poor old governor and his gout pardon me he said with his most cynical smile in attributing disinterested affection to ladies i think quelque disposition quait le monde a mal juger il fait plus souvent grace au faux merite quil ne fait injustice au veritable the tressillians soft lips curved angrily she turned away and began to sing again at walshams entreaty telfer got up and lounged over to virginie with whom he laughed talked waltzed and played chess for the rest of the evening iii from which it would appear that it is sometimes well to begin with a little aversion after this split telfer and the tressillian were rather further off each other than before and whenever riding and driving at dinner or in lionizing they came by chance together he avoided her silently as much as ever he could without making a parade of it violet could see very well how cordially he hated her and womanlike i dare say mine and edenburghs and walshams and all her devoted friends admiration was valueless as long as her vowed enemy treated her with such careless contempt one morning the two foes met by chance telfer and i after a late night over at pipesandbeersbad with lansquenet cheroots and cognac had betaken ourselves out to whip the beersbad whose fish for all their boiling by the hot springs are firstrate i can assure you telfer tells you he likes fishing but i never see that he does much more than lie full length under the shadiest tree he can find with his cap over his eyes and his cigar in his mouth doing the dolce lazily enough a threepound trout had no power to rouse him and hes lost a salmon before now in the tweed because it bored him to play it shade of old izaak is that liking fishing but few things ever did excite him except it was a charge or a kaffir scrimmage and then he looked more like a concentrated tempest than anything else and woe to the turban that his sabre came down upon that part of the stream wed tried first had been whipped before us or the fish wouldnt bite and i who havent as much patience as i might have went up higher to try my luck telfer declined to come he was comfortable he said and out of the sun he preferred indiana and his cheroot to catching all the fish in the beersbad so i bid him goodbye and left him smoking and reading at his leisure under the lindentrees i went further on than i had meant up round a bend of the river and was too absorbed in filling my basket to notice a storm coming up from the west till i began to find myself getting wet to the skin and the lightning flying up and down the hills round essellau i looked for the major as i passed the limetrees but he wasnt there and i made the best of my way back to the castle supposing hed got there before me but i was mistaken ive seen nothing of him said marc hes stalking about the woods i dare say admiring the lightning thats more than the poor tressillian does i bet she went out by herself i believe just before the storm to get a waterlily she wanted to paint and hasnt appeared since by jove if telfer should have to play knighterrant to his pet aversion what fun it would be marc had his fun for an hour afterwards when the storm had blown over up the terrace steps came violet and the major they werent talking to each other but they were actually walking together and the courtesy with which he put a dripping rosebranch out of her path with his stick was something quite new it seems that telfer disliking disagreeable sensations and classing getting wet among such had arisen when the thunder began to growl and slowly wended his way homewards but before he was halfway to essellau the rain began to drip off his moustache and seeing a little marble temple the parthenon turned into a summerhouse close by he thought he might as well go in and have another weed till it grew finer go in he did and hed just smoked half a cigar and read the last chapter of indiana when he looked up and saw the tressillians pug looking a bedraggled and miserable object at his feet and the tressillian herself standing within a few yards of him if telfer had abstained from a few fierce mental oaths he would have been of a much more pacific nature than he ever pretended to be and i dont doubt that he looked hauteur concentrated as he rose at his enemys entrance violet made a movement of retreat but then thought better of it it would have seemed too much like flying from the foe so with a careless bow she sank on one of the seats took off her hat shook the raindrops off her hair and busied herself in sedulous attentions to the pug the major thought it incumbent on him to speak a few sentences about the thunder that was cracking over their heads violet answered him as briefly and telfer putting down his cigar with a sigh sat watching the storm in silence not troubling himself to talk any more as she bent down to pat the pug she caught his eyes on her with a cold critical glance he was thinking how pure her profile was and how exquisite her eyes andof how cordially he should hate her if his father married her her color rose but she met his look steadily which is a difficult thing to do if youve anything to conceal for the majors eyes are very keen and clear her lips curved with a smile half amused half disdainful what a pity major telfer she said with a silvery laugh that you should be condemned to imprisonment with one who is unfortunately such a bete noire to you as i am i assure you i feel for you if i were not coward enough to be a little afraid of that lightning i would really go away to relieve you from your sufferings i should feel quite honored by the distinction of your hatred if i didnt know you on principle dislike every woman living is your judgment always infallible beyond a little surprise in his eyes telfers features were as impassive as ever far from it he answered quietly i merely judge people by their actions the tressillians luminous eyes flashed proudly an unsafe guide major telfer you cannot judge of actions until you know their motives i know perfectly well why you dislike and avoid me you listened to a foolish report and you heard me giving your father permission to write to me those are your grounds are they not telfer for once in his life was astonished but he looked at her fixedly and were they not just ones no said violet vehementlyno they were most rankly unjust and it is hard indeed if a girl who has no friends or advisers that she can trust may not accept the kindness and ask the counsels of a man fiftyfive years older than herself without his being given to her as a lover and the worlds whispering that she is trying to entrap him you pique yourself on your clearsightedness major telfer but for once your judgment failed you when you attributed such mean and mercenary motives to me and supposed because as you so generously stated i had no money and no home i must necessarily have no heart or conscience but be ready to give myself at any moment to the highest bidder and take advantage of the kindness of your nobleminded generoushearted father to trick him into marriage she stopped fairly out of breath with excitement telfer was going to speak but she silenced him with a haughty gesture no now we are started on the subject hear me to the end you have done me gross injusticean offence the tressillians never forgivebut for my own sake i wish to show you how mistaken you were in your hasty condemnation at the beginning of the season i was introduced to your father he knew my mother well in her girlhood and he said i reminded him of her he was very kind to me and i who have no real friend on earth of course was grateful to him for i was thankful to have any one on whom i could rely you know probably as well as i do that there is little love lost between the carterets and myself though by my fathers will i must stay with them till i am of age i have one brother a boy of eighteen he is with his regiment serving out in india and the climate is killing him by inches though he is too brave to try and get sick leave your father has been doing all he can to have him exchanged the letters i have had from him have been to tell me of his success and to say that arthur is gazetted to the buffs and coming home overland there is the head and front of my offending major telfer a very simple explanation is it not perhaps another time you will be more cautious in your censure a faint flush came over the majors bronzed cheek he looked out of the portico and was silent for a minute the knowledge that he has wronged another is a keen pang to a proud man of an honor almost fastidious in his punctilio of right he swung quickly round and held out his hand to her i beg your pardon i have misjudged you and i am thoroughly ashamed of myself for it he said in a low voice when the major does come down from his hauteur and let some of his winning cordial nature come out no woman living unless she were some animated medusa could find it in her heart to say him nay his frank selfcondemnation touched violet despite herself and without thinking she laid her small fingers in his proffered hand then the tressillian pride flashed up again she drew it hastily away and walked out into the air pray do not distress yourself she said with an effort not successful to seem perfectly calm and nonchalant it is not of the slightest consequence we understand each others sentiments now and shall in future be courteous in our hate like two of the french noblesse complimenting one another before they draw their swords to slay or to be slain it has cleared now so i will leave you to the solitude i disturbed come floss and calling the pug after her violet very gracefully swept down the steps but with a stride the major was at her side nay miss tressillian he said gently it is true ive given you cause to think me as rude as orson or caliban but i am not quite such a bear as to let you walk home through these woods alone violet made an impatient movement pray dont trouble yourself we are close to the castle andpardon me but truthtelling seems the order for the dayi much prefer you in your open enmity to your simulated courtesy we have been rude to each other for three weeks in another one you will be gone so it is scarcely worth while to begin politeness now as you please said telfer coldly hed made great advances and concessions for him and was far too english when repulsed to go on making any more but he was astonishedextremely sofor hed been courted and sought since he was in jackets and couldnt make out a young girl like the tressillian treating him so lightly he walked along beside her in profound silence but though neither of them spoke a word he didnt leave her side till she was safe on the terrace at essellau the major was very grave that night at dinner and occasionally he looked at violet with a strange inquiring glance as the young lady in the most brilliant of spirits fired away french repartees with von edenburgh and de tintiniac her face absolutely rayonnant in the gleam of the wax lights i thought the spirits were a little too high to be real late at night as he and i and marc were smoking on the terrace before turning in telfer constrained himself to tell us of the scene in the summerhouse hed abused her to us common honor he said obliged him to tell us the truth about her i am sorry said he slowly between the whiffs of his meerschaum if there is one thing i hate it is injustice i was never guilty of misjudging anybody before in my life that i know of and i give you my word i experienced a new sensationi absolutely felt humbled before that girls great flashing truthful eyes to think that id been listening to report and judging from prejudice like any silly gossiping woman it seems to have made a great impression on you telfer laughed marc has your detestation of violet changed to something as warm but more gentle shall we have to say the love wherewith he loves her is greater than the hate wherewith he hated her not exactly answered the major calmly with a supercilious twist of his moustaches but i like pluck wherever i see it and shes a true tressillian iv in which the major provokes a quarrel in behalf of the fair tressillian well telfer said i two mornings after if you want to be at the moor by the th we must start soon this is the th it will be sharp work to get there as it is what do you think of not going at all said telfer laying down the revue des deux mondes with a yawn we are very well here marc bothers me tremendously to stay on another month and the shootings as good as we shall get at glenattock what do you say vane just as you like i answered the pigs are as good as the grouse for anything i know they put me in mind of getting my first spear at burampootra i only thought you wanted to be off out of sight of the tressillian he laughed slightly oh the young ladys no particular eyesore to me now i dont regard her in the light of a bellemere well shall we stop here then comme vous voulez i dont care no philosopher ever moves when hes comfortable said the major laughing ill write and tell montague he can shoot over glenattock if he likes i dare say he can find some men wholl keep him company and fill the box i say old fellow ive won calceolaria but i shant have her because i consider the bet drawn our wager was laid on the supposition that the tressillian wished to marry the governor but as she never has had the desire ive neither lost nor won well well wait and see said i christmas isnt come yet here comes violet she looks well dont she confess now prejudice apart that you admire her nolens volens telfer looked at her steadily as she came into the billiardroom in her hat and habit as shed been riding with lucy carteret marc and de tintiniac yes he said slowly under his breath she is very good style i admit lucy carteret challenged telfer to a game she has a tall svelte figure and knows she looks well at billiards he played lazily and let her win easily enough paying as little attention to the agaceries and glances she lavished upon him as if hed been an automaton when theyd played it out he went up to the tressillian who was talking to marc in the window and to my supreme astonishment asked her to have a game thank you no answered violet coldly it is too warm for billiards this was certainly the first time the major had ever been refused in any of his overtures to her sex and i believe it surprised him exceedingly he bent his head and soon after he went for a walk in the rosery with lucy carteret whom he hates we always hate those manoeuvring maniere girls who are everlastingly flinging bait after us whether or no we want to nibble and just in proportion as they fixatrice and crinoline and cosmetique to hook us will leave us to die in the sun when theyve once trapped us into the basket that night when telfer sat down to ecarte violet was singing in another room out of which her voice came distinctly to us i noticed he didnt play quite as well as usual i dont suppose he could be listening though for he doesnt care for music and still less for the tressillian mademoiselle said de tintiniac going up to her afterwards you can boast of greater conquests than orpheus he only charmed rocks but you have distracted the two most inveterate joueurs in europe telfer looked annoyed violet laughed pardon me if i doubt your compliment if you were so kind as to listen to me i have not enough vanity to think that your opponent would yield to what he would think such immeasurable weakness you are not magnanimous miss tressillian said telfer in a low tone leaning down over the piano you are ceaselessly reminding me of a hasty prejudice unjustly formed of which i have told you i am heartily ashamed a hasty prejudice repeated violet i beg your pardon major telfer i think ours is a very strong and lasting enmity as mutual as it is well founded dont contradict me you know you could have shot me with as little remorse as a partridge but can you never forget continued telfer impatiently that my enmity as you please to term it was grafted on erroneous opinions and false reports and will you never credit that when i see myself in the wrong i am too just to others to continue in it the tressillian laugheda mischievous provoquant laugh no i believe neither in sudden conversions nor sudden friendships pray do not trouble yourself to be just to me you see i did not droop and die under the shadow of your wrath oh no said telfer with a sardonic twist of his moustaches one would not accuse you of too much softness miss tressillian she colored and the pride of her family flashed out of her eyes the tressillians are all deucedly proud and would die sooner than yield an inch if by softness you mean weakness you are right she said haughtily as i have told you we never forgive injustice telfer frowned if there was one thing he hated more than another it was a woman who had anything hard about her he smiled his chilliest smile those are harsh words from a ladys lipsnot so becoming to them as something gentler you remind me miss tressillian of a young panther i once had beautiful to look at but eminently dangerous to approach much less to caress everybody admired my panther but no one dared to choose it for a pet with this uncourteous allegory the major turned away leaving violet to make it out as best she might it was good fun to watch the tressillians face i only standing near had caught what he said for he had spoken very low first she looked haughty and annoyed then a little troubled and perplexed she sat quiet a minute playing thoughtfully with her bracelets then shook her head with a movement of defiance and began to sing a venetian barcarole with more elan and spirit than ever by jove telfer said i as we sat in the smokingroom that night your wouldhavebeen motherinlaw has plenty of pluck shed have kept you in good training and made a better boy of you its quite a loss to your morals that your father didnt marry her telfer didnt look best pleased he stretched himself full length on one of the divans and answered not i shouldnt be surprised if with all her beauty she hangs on hand said walsham for she hasnt a rap you know her governor gamed it all away and shes certainly a bit of a flirt i dont think so said telfer shortly oh by george dont you but i do cried fred why she takes a turn at us all from old de tintiniac with his padded figure and coulisses compliments to marc young and beautiful as the novels saybut well spare his blushesfrom vane there with his long rentroll to poor me who she knows goes on tick for my weeds and gloves she flirts with us all one after the other except you whom she dont dare to touch tell me where you get your noli me tangere armor telfer and ill adopt it tomorrow for the girls make such desperate love to me i know some of them will propose before long telfer smoked vigorously during freds peroration and his brow darkened i do not consider miss tressillian a flirt he said slowly shes too careless in showing you her weak points to be trying to trap you what i call a coquette is a woman who is all things to all men whose every languishing glance is a bait and whose every thought is a conquest and pray how can you tell but what the tressillians naturalness and carelessness may be only a superior bit of acting the highest art you know is to imitate nature so close that you cant tell which is which laughed walsham telfer didnt seem to relish the suggestion but went on smoking fiercely not that i want to speak against the girl fred went on shes very amusing and well enough i dare say if she werent so devilish proud you seem rather inconsistent said telfer impatiently first you accuse her of being too free and then blame her for being too reserved walsham laughed if im inconsistent youre a perfect weathercock a month ago you were calling violet every name you could think of and now you snap us all off short if we say a word against her telfer looked haughty enough to extinguish fred upon the spot fred being a small lively little chap with not the slightest dignity about him i know little or nothing of miss tressillian but as i was the first to prejudice you all against her it is only common honor to take her part when i think her unjustly attacked fred gave me a wink of intense significance but remonstrated no further for telfer had something of the dark look upon him that our men knew so well when he led them down to the slaughter at alma and balaklava i tell you continued the major after a little silence that i am disgusted with myself for having listened to whispers and reports and believed in them just because they suited the bias of my prejudice it didnt matter to me whom my father married as far as money went for beyond l or so it must all come in the entail but i couldnt endure the idea of his being chiselled by some becky sharp or blanche armory and i made up my mind that the tressillian was of that genre ive changed my opinion now i dont think she either is an actress or an intrigante and i should be a coward indeed if i hesitated to say so out of common justice to a young girl who has no one to defend her bravo my boy said walsham i thought the tressillians bright eyes wouldnt let you hate her long youre quite right though pon my life it is really horrid how women contrive to damage each other if theres an unlucky girl who has made the best match of the seasonshe might be an angel from heavenher bosomfriends would manage gently to spread abroad the interesting facts that shes a dreadful flirt has a snub nose is an awful temper had a balletgirl for her mamma or something detrimental an attractive woman is the target for all her sex to shoot their sneers at and if the poor thing isnt so riddled with arrows that shes no beauty left it isnt her sisters fault i believe you said telfer my gauge of a womans fascinations is the amount of hatred all the others bear her it often amuses me to hear the tone that ladies take in talking of some girl whom we admire shes a charming creaturea darlingtheir particular friend but theres always a but to neutralize the praise and with their honeyed hatred they contrive to damn the luckless object irretrievably if another mans a good shot or whip or billiardplayer were not spiteful to him for it we think him a good fellow and like him the better but the dear beau sexe cannot bear a rival and never rest while one of their acquaintance has diamonds a carat larger dresses a trifle more costly has finer horses or more conquests the only style of friend i ever heard women speak well of is some plain and timorous individual goodnatured to foolery and weak as water who never comes in their orbit and whom we never look at and then what a darling she is and how eloquently they will laud her to the skies despising her miserably all the while for not having been born pretty true enough marc began why do the carterets treat the tressillian so disagreeablyonly because though without their fortune she makes ten times their coups and get themselves up how they may they know none of us care to waltz with them if shes in the room lets drink her health in marcobrunnenshes magnificent eyes and firstrate style said i and a deuced pretty foot cried fred et une taille superbe added de tintiniac just come in en verite elle est chouette cette violette anglaise so we chanted the tressillians praises telfer drank the toast in silencei thought with a frown on his brow at the freedom with which we discussed his fair foe little countess virginies wedding was to come off in another month and marc begged us so hard to stay on till then that telfer seeming very willing i consented though it would be the first september i had ever spent out of the english open since i was old enough to know partridges from pheasants the tressillian being virginies pet friend after young ladies custom of contracting eternal alliances which ordinarily terminate in a quarrel about the shade of a ponceau ribbon or a mauve flower or a cornets eyes some three months after the signing and sealing thereof was of course to be one of the filles dhonneur so as i said to telfer hed have time for a few more battles before the two enemies parted to meet againnobody could tell when i began to think that the major had really been wounded and that his opponents bright eyes wouldnt let him come out of the fight wholly scathless as i saw him leaning against the wall at a ball in the redoute at pipesandbeersbad watching violet with great earnestness as she whirled round in a deux temps bewitching as was her wont all the frequenters of the bad rich english dyspeptics povertystricken princes austrian diplomats come to cure their hypochondria french decores to try their new cabals and martingales british snobs to indulge the luxury of grumblingall of them found some strange attraction in the violette anglaise violet sank on a seat after her valse telfer quietly displaced a young dragoon from lucca and sat down by her i am going to stay on another month miss tressillian are you not sorry to hear it he said with a smile but i thought a little anxiety in his eyes the color flushed over her face and she answered with a laugh not quite a real one of course i am very sorry i would go away myself to let you enjoy your last week in peace if i were not engaged to virginie cannot you get me leave of absence from her i know you would throw your whole heart into the petition telfer curled his moustaches impatiently truth has come out of her well at last he said with a dash of bitterness and has disguised herself in miss tressillians tulle illusion violet colored brighter still well she said quickly was it not your decision that we should never waste courtesy on one another was not your own desire guerre a outrance no answered telfer his brow darkening that i certainly must deny i did you injustice and i offered you an apology no man could do more than acknowledge he was in the wrong i offered you the palmbranch once you were pleased to refuse it i am not a man miss tressillian to run the chance of another repulse my friendship is not so cheap that i shall intrude it where it is undesired he spoke with a laugh but his eyes had a grave anger in them that violet didnt quite relish she looked a little bit frightened up at him the proud brilliant tressillian was as pale and quiet as a little child after a good scolding but she soon rallied and flashed up haughtier than ever major telfer you make one great errorone very common to your sex you drop us one day and take us up the next and then think that we must be grateful to you for the supreme honor you do us you are cold to us absolutely rude as long as it pleases your lordly will and then at the first word of courtesy and kindness you expect us to rise and make you a reverence in the utmost humiliation and thanksgiving you menand violet began destroying her bouquet with immense energytreat us exactly as a cat will treat a mouse you yourself for instance in a moments hasty judgment construed all my actions by the light of your own unjust suspicions and believing everything no matter how unfounded spoke against me to all your acquaintance and treated me with as you must admit but scanty courtesy for one whom i have heard piques himself on his high breeding and now when you discover that your suspicions had no foundation and your hatred no grounds you wonder that i find it difficult to be as grateful as you seem to think i should be for your having so kindly misjudged me as the young lady gave all this forth with much vehemence and spirit telfers lips set and the blood forced itself through the bronze of his cheeks he bent towards her till his moustache touched her hair you have no mercy violet tressillian he said between his teeth take care that no one is as pitiless to you in return she started and her bouquet fell to the ground telfer gave it her back without looking at her and turned round to an austrian with his usual impassive air do you know where de tintiniac is staumgaurn in the roulette room all right i am going there now he did go there and ive a notion that the croupier of pipesandbeersbad made something that night out of the majors preoccupation violet meanwhile was waltzing with staumgaurn and a dozen others but looked rather whitenot using any rouge but what nature had given herand by the end of the evening her bouquet had utterly come to grief days went on till a fortnight of our last month had gone and telfer to my sorrow not surprise for i always thought the tressillian was a dangerous foe and that like ringwood hed find himself unhorsed by a woman grew grave and stern haunted with ten times more recklessness than usual and threw away his guineas at the redoute in a wild way quite new with him for though he liked play pour samuser he had too much control over his passions ever to let play get ascendancy over him i used to think he had the strongest passions and the strongest will over them of any man i knew but now a passion least undesired and most hopeless of any that ever entered his soul seemed to have mastered him not that he showed it with the tressillian he was simply distantly courteous but i who was on the qui vive for his first sign of being conquered saw his eyebrows contract when somebody was paying her desperate court and his glance lighten and flash when she passed near him they had never been alone since the night of the ball and violet was too proud to try for a reconciliation even if shed cared for one one night we were at a ball at the prince humbugandschwerinns the tressillian had been waltzing with all her might and had all the men in the room humbugandschwerinn himself included round her telfer leaned against a console ten minutes watching her and then abruptly left the ballroom and did not return again he came instead into the cardroom and sat down to ecarte with de tintiniac and lost two games at ten napoleons a side generally he played very steadily never giving his attention to anything but the game but now he was listening to what a knot of men were saying who were laughing chatting and sipping coffee while they talked aboutthe tressillian i mark the king and play said telfer his eyes fixed fiercely on a young fellow who was discussing violet much as hed have discussed his new danish dog or english hunter he was jack snobley lord featherweights son who was doing the grand a confounded young parvenu vulgar as his cottonspinning ancestry could make him who could appreciate the tressillian about as much as he could danneckers ariadne which work of art he pronounced in my hearing a pretty girl but the dawg very badly donetoo much like a cat i take your three to two continued telfer his brow lowering as he heard the young fool praising and criticising violet with small ceremony the major had the haughtiest patrician principles and to hear a snob like this sandyhaired honorable speaking of the woman he chose to champion as he might have done of some ballerina or chaumiere belle was rather too much for telfers selfcontrol when the game was done he rose and walked quietly over to where snobley stood he looked him down with that cold haughty glance that has cowed men bolder than lord featherweights hopeful offspring and said a word or two to him in a low tone which caused that gentleman to flush up red and look fierce with all his might whats the girl to you that i maynt speak as i choose of her he retorted the sillery of which hed taken a good deal too much working up in his weak brain ive heard that she jilted you and that was why youve been setting them all against her and saying she wanted to hook your old governor the sillery must have indeed obscured jacks reason with a vengeance to make him venture this very elegant and refined speech with the major most fastidious in his ideas of good breeding and most direful in his wrath of any man i ever knew telfers cheek turned as white with passion as the bronze would let it his gray eyes grew almost black as they stared at the young snob he was so supremely astonished that this illbred boy had actually dared thus to address him mr snobley he said with his chilled and most ironical smile and his quietest most courteous voice you must learn good manners before you venture to parley with gentlemen allow me to give you your first lesson and stooping as if to a very little boyyoung snobley was a good foot shorter than hethe major struck him on the lips with his lefthand french kid glove it was a very gentle blowit would scarcely have reddened the tressillians delicate skinbut on the hon jack it had electric effect he was beginning to swear to look big to talk of satisfaction insult and all the rest of it but telfer laughed bent his head told him he was quite ready to satisfy him to any extent he required and turning away sat down to ecarte calm and impassive as ever and pleased greatly with himself for having silenced this silly youth the affair was much less exciting to him than it was to any other man in the room its too great an honor for him the young brute for me to be called out by him as if he were one of us i hate snobs lord featherweights grandfather was butler to mine and he himself was a cottonspinner in lancashire and then this little contemptible puppy dares to telfer finished his sentence with a puff of smoke from his meerschaum as he sat in his bedroom after the ball into which sanctuary i had followed him to talk a little before turning in to discuss the tressillian said i but that surprises me less old fellow than that you should champion her whats it for has hate turned to the other thing have you come to think that though shed make a very bad motherinlaw shed make a charming wife pon my life if you have hush dont jest i knew by the tone of those three little monosyllables that the major was done forcaught conquered and fettered by his dangerous foe telfer sat silent for some minutes looking out of the window where the dawn was rising over the hills with a settled gloom upon his face then he rose and began swinging about the room with his firm cavalry tread his arms crossed on his chest and his head bent down by heaven vane he said at length in a tone low but passionate and bitter i have gone on like a baby or a fool playing with tools till they have cut me against my will against my judgment against reason hope everything i have lingered in that girls fascinations till i am bound by them hand and foot i cannot deceive myself i cannot shut the truth out it was not honor nor chivalry nor friendship that made me tonight insult the man who spoke jestingly of her it was lovelove as mad as reckless as misplaced as ever cursed a man and drove him to his ruin he paused breathing hard with his teeth set then broke out again i who held love in such disdain who have so long kept my passions in such strong control who thought no woman had the power to move me against my willi love at last despite myself though i know that she is pitiless that nothing i have said has been able to touch her into softer feeling and that mad as my passion is for her if her nature be as hard and haughty as i fear i dare not if i could make her my wife no vane no he went on hastily as i interrupted she does not love me she has no gentler feeling in her i thought she had but i was mistaken i tried her several times but she will never forgive my first injustice to her and to one with so little softness in her nature i dare not trust my peace it were a worse hell even than that i now endure to have her with me loving her as i do and feel that her cold heart gave no response to mine to possess her glorious beauty and yet know that her love and her soul were dead in their chill pride to me he paused again and leaned against the window his chest heaving and hot tears standing in his haughty eyes wrung from the very anguish of his soul the pride that had never before bent to any human thing was now cast in the dust before a woman who never did and probably never would love him in return v the duel and its consequences the contemptible young puppy for whom telfer considered the honor of a ball from his pistol a great deal too good in the morning sent heavysides of the th a chum of his found up at the bad to claim satisfaction the valor produced in him by sillery over night having been kept up since by copious draughts of cognac and seltzer having signified to heavysides that the major would do mr snobley the favor of shooting him in the retired valley of koenigshoehle at sunrise the next day i went to tell telfer who had a hearty laugh at the young fellows challenge id give him something to shoot me through the heart said he bitterly but i dont suppose he will hes practised at pigeons not at men probably i wont hurt him much but a little lesson will do him good mind nobody in the house gets wind of the affair though i make a fool of myself in her defence there is no need that she or others should know it but if the boy should do for me tell her vanetell her said the major shading his eyes with his hand that i have learnt to love her as i never dreamt i should love any woman and that i do not blame her for the just lesson she has read me for the rudeness and the unjust prejudice i indulged in so long towards her she retaliated fairly upon me and god forbid that she should have one hour of her life embittered through remorse for me his voice sank into a whisper as he spoke then with an effort he forced himself into calmness and went to play billiards with marc this was the man who three months before had told me with such contemptuous decision that we need never fall in love unless its convenient and as to caring for a girl who doesnt care for us that was a weakness with which he couldnt sympathize at all late that night telfer and i coming down the stairs met the tressillian going up them to her room the major stopped her and held out his hand with a softened light in his eyes will you not bid me goodbye i may not see you again there was a sadness in his smile bitterly significant to me but very likely she didnt see it not having any key to it as i had violet turned pale and i fancied her lips twitched but it might be the flickering of the light of the staircase lamps on her face at any rate being a young lady born and bred in good society she put her hand in his with a simple what are you going away perhaps at any rate let us part in peace the proud man laughed as he said it though he was enduring tortures violet heard the laugh and didnt see the straining anxiety in his gaze she drew her hand rapidly away certainly bon voyage major telfer and good night she answered carelessly and with a graceful bend the tressillian floated on up the stairs with the dignity of a young empress telfer looked after the white gossamer dress and the beautiful head with its wreath of scarlet flowers and an iron sternness settled on his face all hope was gone now she could not have parted with him like this if she had cared for him one straw more than for the flowers in her hair yet in the morning he was going to risk his life for her ah well ive always seen that in love theres one of the two who gives all and gets nothing in the morning by five oclock in the valley of koenigshoehle a snug bit of pasture land between two rocks where no gendarme could pounce upon us young snobley made his appearance to enjoy the honor of being a target for one of the best shots in europe snobley had a good deal of swagger and wouldbe dash and made a great show of pluck which your man of true pluck never does telfer stood talking to me up to the last minute took his pistol carelessly in his hand and without taking any apparent aim fired if telfer made up his mind to shoot off your fifth waistcoatbutton your fifth waistcoatbutton would be irrevocably doomed and therefore having determined to himself to lodge a bullet in this young puppys left wrist in the left wrist did the ball lodge snobley was satisfied very amply satisfied i fancy by his looks hed fired and sent his shot right into the trunk of a chestnut growing some seven yards off his opponent to heavysides supreme scorn thatll teach him not to talk of young ladies in his mabille slang said telfer lighting his cigar i hope the little snob may be the better for my lesson now i am en route ill go over to pipesandbeersbad breakfast at the hotel de france and go and see humbugandschwerinn he wants me to look at some english racers brookes has just sent him over make my excuses at essellau and i say vane see if you cant get us away in a day or two have some call home or something for i shall never stand this long with which not overclear speech the major mounted his horse and cantered off towards the bad i rode back went to my own room had some chocolate read pigault le brun and about noon seeing virginie the tressillian and several others out on the terrace went to join them marc slipped his arm through mine and drew me aside i say vane whats all this about telfer striking some fellow for talking about the tressillian staurmgaurn was over here just now and told me there was a row in the cardroom at humbugandschwerinns between telfer and another englishman i knew nothing about it is it true so far true i answered that telfer put a ball in the youths wrist at seven oclock this morning and serve him right toohes an impudent young snob by jove cried marc what in the world made him take the tressillians part have the beaux yeux really made an impression on the most unimpressionable of men the devil they have said i crossly but i wish shed been at the deuce first for hes too good a fellow to waste his best years pining after a pair of dark eyes marc shrugged his shoulders cest vrai but were all fools some time or other the idea of telfers chivalry i declare its quite like the old days of froissart and comminesfighting for my ladys favor and away he went singing those two famous lines from alcyonee pour meriter son coeur pour plaire a ses beaux yeux jai fait la guerre aux rois je laurais faite aux dieux and i thought to myself that if the tressillian proved a de longueville i could find it in my soul to shoot her without remorse but as i turned away from marc i came upon her looking pale and ill enough to satisfy anybody the color flushed into her cheeks as she saw me we spoke of the weather the chances of storm flosss new collar and other trifles then she asked me bending over her little dog is captain staurmgaurns news true that your friend hashas been quarrelling with a young englishman yes i answered i wonder staurmgaurn told you it is scarcely a topic to interest ladies telfer has given the young gentleman a wellmerited lesson have they fought she asked breathlessly laying her hand on my arm and looking as white as a ghost yes they have said i and he fought miss tressillian for one who gave him a very cold adieu last night her head drooped she trembled perceptibly and the color rushed back to her cheeks is he safe she asked in the lowest of whispers quite i answered quickly as de tintiniac lounged up to us and i left my words like a prudent diplomatist to bear fruit as best they might i wondered if she cared for him or if it was merely a girls natural feeling for a man who had let himself be shot at rather than hear a light word spoken of her but they were both so deuced proud heavens special intervention alone seemed likely to bring them together the major didnt come home from pipesandbeersbad till between two and three that night and hes told me since that being un peu fou with his selfwilled and vehement passion never went to bed at all but sat and walked about his room smoking unable to sleep in a frame of mind that when sane a few months before he would have pronounced spoony and contemptible in the lowest degree at eight he strode forth into the park brushing off the dew with his impatient steps glad of the fresh morning air upon his brow which was as burning as our first headache from that cursed punch of joness the day after our first wine which acute suffering any gentleman who ever tasted that delicious melange of rum and milk and lemons will keenly recall among other passedaway passages of his green youth telfer strode on and on over the molehills and through the ferns down this slope and up that under the oaks and lindens and firtrees gleaming red beneath the october sun with very little notion of where he was going or what he was doing a great staghound of marcs following at his heels the path he took without thinking led him to the top of a rock overhanging the beersbad where that historic stream was but a few yards in width and here telfer lying down with his head against a planetree struck a fusee and lighted a cigarfor a weeds a pleasant companion in any stage of existence if were happy we smoke in the fulness of our hearts and build airy castles on each fragrant cloud and if were unhappy we smoke to console ourselves and draw in with each whiff philosophy and peace so the major smoked and thought till a bark from the staghound made him look up on the top of the cliffs on the other side of the stream looking down into the valleys below with her head turned away from him stood violet tressillian and at the sight of that graceful figure with its indescribable highbred air i dont doubt the majors once unimpressive heart beat faster than it had ever done in a charge or a skirmish she was full twenty feet above him and the rocks on which she stood sloped precipitately down to a ledge exactly opposite that on which he lay smokinga ledge in reality but a few inches wide but to which the treacherous boughs and ferns waving over it gave a semblance of a firm broad footinga semblance which like a good many other things one meets with it utterly failed to carry out when you came to try it violet not seeing telfer lying perdu among the grass at the foot of his planetree walked along to the edge of the cliff her eyes on the ground so deep in thought that she never noticed the river beneath but began to descend the slope little floss coming with exceeding trepidation after her telfer sprang up to warn her violet violet go back go back oh my god do you not hear his passionate tones startled her never dreaming he was there she looked hurriedly up her foot slipped unable to stay her descent she came down the steep cliff with an impetus which to a certainty would send her over the narrow ledge into the river belowa fall of full thirty feet to see her perish thus before his eyesdie thus while he stood calmly by a whole age of torture was crowded into the misery of that one brief moment there was but one way to save her he sprang across the gulf that parted them while the river in its straitened bed hissed and foamed beneath him and standing on the narrow ledge where there seemed scarce footing for a dog he caught her as she fell in his iron grasp as little swayed by the shock as the rock on which he stood holding her tight to him with one arm he swung himself down by the other to a less dangerous position on a flat plateau of cliff and leaning against one of the lindentrees on its summit he bent over her his eyes dim and his pulses beating with the emotions he had controlled while he wanted cool thought and firm nerve to save her but over which he had no more power now he pressed her to his heart forgetting pride and doubt and fear and violet by way of answer only burst into a passion of tears who would have recognized the proud brilliant tressillian in the pale trembling woman who sobbed on his breast with the abandon of a child and who at his passionate kisses only blushed like a wild rose telfer evidently thought the transformation complete for he forgot all his reserve resolutions and hauteur and poured out the tenderest love for a girl who three months before he had wished at the devil and the tressillian was conquered at last she was pitiless no longer and having vanquished him was womanlike ready to be a slave to her captive and her eyes were never more dangerous than now when shy and softened they looked up through their tears into telfers what old de tintiniac said of her was true that all her beauty wanted to make it perfect was for her to be in love so at least i thought when several hours afterwards i met them coming across the park and i knew by the gleam of the majors eyes that he had lost calceolaria and won violet how strange it is laughed telfer that evening when they were alone in the conservatory that you and i who so hated each other should now be so dear to one another oh violet how ashamed i have been since of my unjustifiable prejudices my abominable discourtesy you were dreadfully rude said the tressillian smiling and judged me very cruelly by all the false reports that women chose to gossip of me but you are wrong i never hated you your father had spoken of you as so generous so noble so chivalrous a soldier so kind a son that i was prepared to admire you immensely and when you looked so sternly on me at our first introduction and i overheard your bitter words about me at the station i really was never more vexed and disappointed in my life and then a demon entered into me and i thoughtforgive me hamiltonthat i would try to make you repent your hasty judgment and recant your prejudices but i could not always fight you with the coolness i wished your indifference began to pique me more and more wounds from you ranked as they did from no one else and something besides pride made me feel your neglect so keenly i had meantyes i must tell you all and the tressillian in her soft repentance looked telfer thought more bewitching than in her most brilliant momentsi had wished she went on in a whisper with her color bright to make you regret your injustice to conquer your stubborn pride and to revenge myself on you for all the wrong you had done me in thoughts and words but you see i wasnt so strong as i fancied i thought i could fence with the buttons on but i was mistaken andandwhen i heard that you had fought for me i knew then that and violet stopped with a smile and a sigh the sigh for the past i suppose and the smile for the present well nous sommes quittes dearest smiled telfer thank heaven we no longer need reproach each other too many elevate the one they love into an ideal of such superhuman excellence that at the first shadow of mortality they see their poor idol is shivered from its pedestal but we have seen the worst side of each others character violet and henceforth love shall cover all faults and subdue all pride between us telfer kept his word they had had their last quarrel and buried their last suspicion before their marriage and were not like the generality doves first and tigers after the governor of course was charmed that a match on which he had secretly set his heart had brought itself about so neatly without his interference he had begun to despair of his sons ever giving torwood a mistress and the diamonds he gave violet in the excess of his pleasure brought her no end of female enemies for they were some of the finest water in the kingdom seldom indeed has slander been productive of such good fruits for rarely very rarely does that upastree put forth any but dead sea apples violet tressillian was violet telfer before the christmas recess but i considered the bet drawn so telfer and i exchanged the roan filly and the colt and calceolaria in the torwood stables and jockey club in my stalls stand witnesses to this day of our wager and how the major lost and won our country quarters our country quarters i remember well the day that we that is the th lancers were ordered down to layton rise savage enough we all were to quit p for that detestable country place many and miserable were the tales we raked up of the ennui we had experienced at other provincial quarters sadly we dressed for lady dashwoods ball the last soiree before our departure and then the bills and the billetsdoux that rained down upon our devoted heads however by some miracle we escaped them all and on a bright april morning we were en route for this layton rise this terra incognita as grumpy and as seedy as ever any poor demons were but there was no help for it so leaving we flattered ourselves a great many hearts the heavier for this order from the horse guards we as i said set out for layton rise the only bit of good news that provoking morning had brought was that my particular chum drummond fane a captain of ours who had been cutting about on leave from constantinople to kamtchatka for the last six months would join us at layton fane was really a good fellow a perfect gentleman ca va sans dire as he was one of ours intensely plucky knew i believe every language under the sun and as he had been tumbling about in the world ever since he went to eton at eight years old had done everything seen everything and could talk on every possible subject he was a great favorite with ladies i always wonder they did not quite spoil him i have seen a young lady actually neglect a most eligible heir to a dukedom that her mamma had been at great pains to procure for her if this fascinating younger son were by for fane was the younger son of the earl of avanley and would of course every one said one day retrieve his fortunes by marriage with some heiress in want of rank he has been my great friend ever since i a small youth spoiled by having come into my property while in the nursery became his fag at eton and when i bought my commission in the th of which he was a captain our intimacy increased but revenons a nos moutons on the road we naturally talked of layton wondering if there was any one fit to visit anybody that gave good dinners if there was a pack of hounds a billiardroom or any pretty girls suddenly the honorable ennuye lestrange threw a little light on the matter by recollecting now he thought of it he believed that was where an uncle of his lived his name was aspiaspinallno aspeden had he any cousins was the inquiry he yally could not remember so we were left to conjure up imaginary miss aspedens more handsome than their honorable cousin who might relieve for us the monotony of country quarters the sun was very bright as we entered layton rise the clattering and clashing that we made soon brought out the inhabitants and lying in the light of a spring day it did not seem such a very miserable little town after all our mess was established at the one good inn of the one good street of the place and i and two other young subs fixed our residence at a grocers where a card of lodgings to let furnished was embordered in vineleaves and roses as i was leaning out of the window smoking my last cigar before mess with sydney and mounteagle stretched in equally elegant attitudes on equally hard sofas i heard our grocer a sleek little methodist addressing some party in the street withi fear me i have done evil in admitting these young servants of satan into mine habitation well nathan replied a quaker thou didst it for the best and verily these officers seem quiet and gentlemanly youths gentlemanlike i should say we were ratherbut quiethow we shouted over the innocent friends mistake here the voices again resumed doubtless when the aspedens return there will be dances and devices of the evil one and quelps will make a good time of it however the custom of ungodly men i would not take were it offered so these aspedens were outconfound it but the clock struck six so flinging the remains of my cigar on the quakers broadbrimmed hat adorned with which ornament he walked unconsciously away we strolled down to the messroom a few hours later some of them met in my room and having sent out for some cards which the grocer kindly wrapped in a tract against gambling we had just sat down to loo when the door was thrown open and captain fane announced a welcome addition fane by all thats gloriouswell young one how are you were the only salutations that passed between two men who were as true friends as any in england fane was soon seated among us and telling us many a joke and tale and so said he were sent down to ruralize mounteagle you are lood any one you know here not a creature i am awfully afraid we shall be found dead of ennui one fine morning ill thank you for a little more punch fitzspur said sydney i suppose as usual fane he continued you left at the very least twelve dozen german princesses italian marchesas and french countesses dying for you my dear fellow replied fane you are considerably under the mark ill take miss paget but really if women will fall in love with you how can you help it and if you will flirt with them how can they help it i see fane your heart is as strong as ever i added laughing of course answered the gallant captain disinterested love is reserved for men who are too rich or too poor to mind its attendant evils the first i must say very rarely profit by the privilege no i steel myself against all bright eyes and dancing curls not backed by a good dowry heiresses though somehow are always plain i never could do my duty and propose to one though of course whenever i do surrender my liberty which i have not the smallest intention of at present it will be to somebody with at least fifty thousand a year hearts trumps mount yeshurrah pagets lood at lasthere my dear let us have lots more punch said mounteagle addressing the female domestic who was standing openmouthed at the glittering pool of halfsovereigns i will spare the gentle readerif i may flatter myself that i entertain a few sucha recital of the conversation which followed and which was kept up until the very very small hours also i will leave it to her imagination to picture how we spent the next few days how we found out a few families worth visiting how we inspired the layton youths with a vehement passion for smoking billiards and the cavalry branch of the service and how we and our gay uniforms and our prancing horses were the admiration of all the young damsels in the place one morning after parade fane and i having nothing better to do lighted our cigars and strolled down one of those shady lanes which almost reconcile one to the countryout of the london season seeing the gate of a park standing invitingly open we walked in and threw ourselves down under the trees now we are in for it said fane if we are trespassing and any adventurousminded gamekeeper appears whose park is this mr aspedens ennuye told me its rather a nice place i replied and that castle of which mine eyes behold the turrets afar off he asked lord lintons i believe the father of jack vernon of the rifles you know i answered indeed i never saw the old gentleman but i remember his daughter beatricewe had rather a desperate flirtation at badenbaden shes a showylooking girl said the captain stretching himself on the grass why did you not allow her the sublime felicity of becoming lady beatrice fane i asked laughing my dear fellow she had not a sou that old marquis is as poor as a churchmouse you forget that i am only a younger son with not much besides my pay and cannot afford to marry anywhere i like i am not in your happy position able to espouse any pretty face i may chance to take a fancy to it would be utter madness in me do you think i was made for a little house one maidservant dinner at noon and six small children very much obliged to you but love in a cottage is not my style fred besides jaime a vivre garcon added fane et moi aussi said i really the girls one meets seem all tarlatan and coquetry i have never seen one worth committing matrimony for hear him cried fane here is the happy owner of wilmot park at the advanced age of twenty despairing of ever finding anything more worthy of his affection than his moustaches oh what will the boys come to next but eureka here comes a pretty girl if you like who on earth is she he exclaimed raising his eyeglass to a party advancing up the avenue who really seemed worthy the attention pulling at the bridle of a donkey what wouldnt go with all her might was indeed a pretty girl her hat had fallen off and showed a quantity of bright hair and a lovely face with the largest and darkest of eyes and a mouth now wreathing with smiles unconscious of our vicinity on she came laughing and beseeching a little boy seated on the aforesaid donkey and thumping thereupon with a large stick not to be so cruel and hurt poor dapple at this juncture the restive steed gave a vigorous stride and toppling its rider on the grass trotted off with a selfsatisfied air but fane intending to make the rebellious charger a means of introduction caught his bridle and led him back to his discomfited master the young lady who was endeavoring to pacify the child looked prettier than ever as she smiled and thanked him but the gallant captain was not going to let the matter drop here so turning to the youthful rider he asked him to let him put him on the naughty donkey again master tommy acquiesced and armed with his terrible stick allowed himself to be mounted certainly fane was a most unnecessary length of time settling that child but then he was talking to the young lady whom he begged to allow him to lead the donkey home oh no she was quite used to dapple she could manage him very well and they were going farther so poor fane had nothing for it but to raise his hat and gaze at her through his eyeglass until some trees hid her from sight pon my word thats a pretty girl said he at length i wonder who she can be however i shall soon find out have another weed fred there was to be a ball that night at the assembly rooms which we were assured only the best families would attend for layton was a very exclusive little town in its way some of us who were going were standing about the messroom recalling the many good balls and pretty girls of our late quarters when fane who had declined to go as he said he had a horror of bad dancing bad perfumes bad ventilation and bad champagne and really could not stand the concentration of all of them which he foresaw that night to our surprise declared his intention of accompanying us i suppose fane you hope to see your heroine of the donkey again asked sydney precisely was fanes reply or if not to find out who she is but here comes ennuye got up no end to fascinate the belles of layton the aspedens are home i saw em today were the words of the honorable cornet as he lounged into the room my uncle seems rather a brick and hopes to make the acquaintance of all of you he will mess with us tomorrow have you any belles cousinesare they going tonight we inquired yaas i saw one shes rather pretty said lestrange dark eyesgolden hairabout eighteen demanded fane eagerly not a bit of it replied the cornet curling his moustache and contemplating himself in the glass with very great satisfaction hairs as dark as mine and eyesyally i forget but lets have loo or whist or something we need not go for ages so down we sat and soon nothing was heard but two by honors and the trick game and game c until about twelve when we rose and adjourned to the ballroom no sooner had we entered the room than fane exclaimed theres my houri by all thats glorious and looking lovelier than ever by jove that girls too good for a country ballroom and there in truth waltzing like a sylph was as sydney called her the heroine of the donkey the dance over we saw her join a party at the top of the room consisting of a handsome but passee woman a lovely hebelike girl with dancing eyes and a number of gentlemen with whom they seemed to be keeping up an animated conversation ennuye is with themhe will introduce me said fane as he swept up the room i watched him bow and after talking a few minutes lead off his houri for a valse and disengaging myself from a cambridge friend whom i had met with i professed my intention of following his example what who did you say that girl at the top there why man thats my cousin mary and the other lady is my most revered aunt mrs aspeden did you not know i and ennuye were related yally i forget how exactly he continued mimicking the cornet but do you want to be introduced to her come along then so following my friend who was a trinityman of the name of cleaveland i soon made acquaintance with mrs aspeden and her daughter mary who is he i heard mrs aspeden ask in a low tone of tom cleaveland as i led off mary to the valse a very good fellow was the goodnatured cantabs reply with lots of tin and a glorious place the shooting at wilmot is really bien said his aunt as she took lord lintons arm to the refreshmentroom satisfied i suppose on the strength of my lots of tin that i was a safe companion for her child i found mary aspeden a most agreeable partner for a dance she was lively agreeable and a coquette i felt sure women with those dancing eyes always are and i thought i could not do better than amuse myself by getting up a flirtation with her what an intensely good opinion i had of myself then so i condescended to dance though it was not almacks and actually permitted myself to be amused strolling through the rooms with mary aspeden on my arm we entered one in which was an alcove fitted up with a visavis sofa whoever planned that layton ballroom had a sympathy in the bottom of his heart for teteatete and here fane was seated talking to his houri with the soft voice and winning smiles which had gained the heart or at least what portion of that member they possessed of so many london belles and which would do their work here most assuredly there is my cousin florenceah she does not observe us who is the gentleman with her said miss aspeden my friend captain fane i replied you have heard of their rencontre this morning indeed is he tommys champion of whom he has done nothing but talk all day and of whom i could not make florence say one word asked mary you must know our donkey is the most determined and resolute of animals if she will she will you may depend upon it she continued do you honor those most untrue lines upon ladies by a quotation i asked i do not think they are so very untrue laughed mary except in confining obstinacy to us poor women and exempting the lords of the creation the scotch adage knows better a wilful man you know the rest quite well i replied but another poets lines on you are far more true ye are stars of the i commenced mary my love let me introduce you to lord craigarven said mrs aspeden coming up with lord lintons heirapparent at the same time i was introduced to mr aspeden a hearty englishman loving his horses his dogs and his daughter and as much the inferior of his aristocraticlooking wife in intellect as he was her superior in heart when we parted that night he gave fane and me a most hospitable general invitation and what was more an especial one for the next night as we walked home i the grey o the morning i asked fane who his houri was a niece of mr aspedens and cousin to your friend cleaveland was the reply those aspedens really seem to be uncle and aunt to every one she is staying there now so is tom cleaveland said i but pray are your expectations quite realized is she as charming as she looks this miss florence aspeden added fane yes quite but here are my quarters so good night old fellow we had soon established ourselves as amis de la maison at woodlands the aspedens place and found him as his nephew had stated rather a brick and her daughter and niece something more all of us especially fane and i spent the best part of our time there lounging away the days between the shady lanes the little lake and the music or billiardrooms fane seemed entirely to appropriate florence and to fascinate her as he had fascinated so many others i really felt angry with him for as tom cleaveland had candidly told me that poor florie had not a rapher father had run through all his property and left her an orphan and a very poor one tooof course fane could not marry her but would i feared ride away some day like the gay dragoon heartwhole himselfbut would she come out as scatheless poor mounteagle too was getting quite spooney about florence and owing to fane she paid him no more heed than if he had been an old driedup indianized major he poor fellow followed her about everywhere asked her to dance in quite an insane manner and made the most horrible revokes in whist and mistakes in pool that can be imagined by george she is pretty and no mistake said sydney as florence rode past us one day as we were sauntering down layton looking charmingly en amazone pretty i should rather think so she is more beautiful than any other woman upon earth cried mounteagle yally well i cant see that replied ennuye she has tolerably good eyes but she is too petite to please me ah the adjutants girls have rendered lestrange difficile he cannot expect to meet their equals in a hurry said fane in a very audible aside poor ennuye was silencednay he even blushed the adjutants girls recalled an episode in which the gallant cornet had shone in a rather verdant light fane had effectually quieted him i wonder if florence aspeden will marry mount i remarked to fane when the others had left us she does not seem to pay him much heed yet but still the devil no cried fane in an unusually energetic manner i would stake my life she would not have such a muff as that if he owned half the titles in the peerage you seem rather excited about the matter i observed it would not be such a bad match for her for you know she has no tin but i am sure with your opinion on lovematches you would not counsel mount to such a step of course not replied fane in his ordinary cool tones a man has no right to marry for love except he is one of those fortunate individuals who own half a county or some country doctor or parson of whom the world takes no notice there may be a few exceptions but yet he continued with the air of a person trying to convince himself against his will did you ever see a love match turn out happily it is all very well for the first week but the roses wont bloom in winter and then the cottage walls look ugly then a fellow cannot live as he did en garcon and all his friends drop him and altogether it is an act no wise man would perpetrate but i shall forget to give you a message i was intrusted with they are going to get up some theatricals at woodlands i have promised to take sir thomas clifford the piece is the hunchback and they want you to play modus to mary aspedens helen do old fellow acting is very good fun with a pretty girl like the julia you will have i suppose i said very well i will be amiable and take it mary will make a firstrate helen come and have a game of billiards will you cant replied the gallant captain i promised to go in half an hour withwith the aspedens to see some waterfall or ruin or something and the time is up so au revoir monsieur many of ours were pressed into the service for the coming theatricals and right willingly did we rehearse a most unnecessary number of times many merry hours did we spend at woodlands and i sentimentalized away desperately to mary aspeden but somehow or other always had an uncomfortable suspicion that she was laughing at me she never seemed the least impressed by all my gallantries and pretty speeches which was peculiarly mortifying to a moustached cornet of twenty who thought himself irresistible i began too to get terribly jealous of tom cleaveland who by right of his cousinship arrived at a degree of intimacy i could not attain one morning fane and i who were going to dine there that evening the miss aspedens and of course that tom cleaveland were sitting in the drawingroom at woodlands fane and florence were going it at some opera airs what passionate emphasis that wicked fellow gave the loving italian words as his rich voice rolled them out to her accompaniment the detestable trinityman had been discoursing away to mary on boatracing outriggers bumping and heaven knows what and i was just taking the shine out of him with the description of a shipwreck i had had in the mediterranean when mary who sat working at her broderie and provokingly giving just as sweet smiles to the one as to the other interrupted me with goodness florie there is mr mills coming up the avenue he is my cousins admirer and admiration she added mischievously as the door opened and a little man about forty entered there was all over him the essence of the country you saw at once he had never passed a season in london his very boots proclaimed he had never been presented and we felt almost convulsed with laughter as he shook hands with us all round and attempted a most empresse manner with florence beautiful weather we have now remarked mrs aspeden she is indeed answered the little squire with a gaze of admiration at florence fane who was leaning against the mantelpiece looking most superbly haughty and unapproachable shot an annihilating glance at the small man which would have quite extinguished him had he seen it the country is very pretty in june said mrs aspeden hazarding another original remark lovelytoo lovely echoed mr mills with a profound sigh at which the country must have felt exceedingly flattered glorious creature your new mare is mr mills cried the cantab splendid style she took the fences in yesterday wilkins may well say she is the belle of the county continued mr mills dreamily i beg your pardon what did you say my mother took the fences well no she never hunts pray tell mrs mills i am very much obliged for the beautiful azalias she sent me interposed florence with her sweet smile ii am sure anything we have you are welcome to iiallow me and the poor squire stooping for florences thimble upset a tiny table on which stood a vase with the azalias in question on the back of a little bull of a spaniel who yelled and barked and flew at the squires legs who for his part became speechless from fright reddened all over and at last stammering out that he wanted to see mr aspeden and would go to him in the grounds rushed from the room we all burst out laughing at this climax of the poor little mans misery i will not have you laugh at him so said florence at length i know him to be truly good and charitable for all his peculiarities of manner it is but right miss aspeden should defend a soupirant so charming in every way said the captain his moustache curling contemptuously oh flories made an outandout conquest and no mistake cried tom cleaveland florence did not heed her cousin but looked up in fanes face utterly astonished at his sarcastic tones no man could have withstood that look of those large beautiful eyes and fane bent down and asked her to sing roberto oh tu che adoro yes that will just do robert is his name pity he is not here to hear it robert mills oh tu che adoro sang the inexorable cantab as he walked across the room and asked mary to have a game of billiards for once i had the pleasure of forestalling him but he nevertheless came and marked for us in a very amiable manner how well you play mary said he really stunningly for a woman do you know beauchamp of kings won three whole pools the other day without losing a life indeed said mary what good fun it is to see mr mills play he holds his queue as if he were afraid of it i say mary said cleaveland you dont think that florence will marry that contemptible little wretch do you hang it i should be savage if she had not better taste theres a cannon she has better taste replied mary in a low tone as mrs aspeden and fane entered the room i never could like mrs aspedenpeace be with her now poor womanbut there was such a want of delicacy and tact and such open manoeuvring in all she did which surprised me clever woman as she was no sooner had she approached the billiardtable that day than she began florence was called away from her singing to a conference with her uncle andwith somebody else i fancy fane darted a keen look of inquiry at her poor dear girl being left so young an orphan i have always felt such a great interest and affection for her and i shall rejoice to see her happily settled asas i trust there is a prospect of now she continued could she mean florence aspeden had engaged herself to mr mills a roguish smile on marys face reassured me but fane walked hastily to the window and stood with folded arms looking out upon the sunny landscape inveterate flirt that he was his pride was hurt at the idea of a rival and such a rival winning in a game in which he deigned to have ever so small a stake ever such a passing interest the dinner passed off heavilyvery heavilyfor gay woodlands for the gallant captain and florence were both of them distraits and genes and he hardly spoke to the poor girl oh wicked fane we sat but little time after the ladies had retired and tom and mr aspeden going after some horse or other fane and i ascended to the drawingroom alone it was unoccupied and we sat down to await them i amusing myself with teaching master tommy the young heir of woodlands some comic songs wherewith to astonish his nurse pretty considerably and fane leaning back in an armchair with florences dog upon his knee in that for him most extraordinary thing a brown study suddenly some voices were heard in the next room florence it is your duty recollect aunt i can recollect nothing save that it would be far far worse than death to me to marry mr mills i hold it dread sin to marry a man for whom one can have nothing but contempt once for all i cannoti will not here the voice was broken with sobs fane had raised his head eagerly at the commencement of the dialogue but now recollecting that we were listeners rose and closed the door i did not say a word on the conversation we had just heard for i felt out of patience with him for his heartless flirtation so taking up a book on italy i looked over the engravings for a little time and then tommy having been conveyed to the nursery in a state of rebellion i reminded fane of a promise he had once made to accompany me to rome the next winter and asked him if he intended to fulfil it really my dear fellow i cannot tell what i may possibly do next winter i hate making plans for the future we may none of us be alive then said he in an unusually dull strain for him i half fancy i may exchange into some regiment going on foreign service but lhomme propose you know by the by poor castleton his elder brother is very ill at brussels yes i was extremely sorry to hear it in a letter i had from vivian this morning i replied he is at brussels also and mentions a belle there lady adeliza fitzhowden with whom he says the world is associating your name is it true fane les on dit font la gazette des fous cried the captain impatiently stroking florences little king charles i saw lady adeliza at paris last january but i would not marry herno not if there were no other woman upon earth i thought fred really you were too sensible to believe all the scandal raked up by that gossiping vivian i do hope you have not been propagating his most unfounded report asked my gallant friend in quite an excited tone at this moment the ladies entered florence with her dark eyes looking very sad under their long lashes but they soon brightened when fane seated himself by her side and began talking in a lower tone and with even more tendresse than ever i had the pleasure of quite eclipsing tom cleaveland i thought as i turned over the leaves of marys music and looked unutterable things which however i fear were all lost as mary would look only at the notes of the piano and i firmly believe never heard a word i said how florence blushed as fane whispered his soft good night she looked so happy poor girl and he heartless demon talked of going into foreign service by the by what put that into his head i wonder the night of our grand theatricals at length arrived and we were all assembled in the library converted for the time into a greenroom mounteagle was repeating to himself for the hundredth time his part of lord tinsel i in my modus dress which i had a disagreeable idea was not becoming was endeavoring to make an impression on the nottobe impressed mary and florence was looking lovelier than ever in her rich oldfashioned dress when fane entered and bending offered her a bouquet of rare flowers she blushed deeply as she took it oh fane fane what will you have to answer for we were waiting the summons for the first scene when to marys horror i suddenly exclaimed that i could not play good heavens why not was the general inquiry why i said i never thought of it until now but certainly modus ought to appear without moustaches and hang it i cannot cut mine off take my life but spare my moustaches cried mary in tragic tones certainly though mr wilmot you are right modus ought not to be seen with the characteristic musktoshes as nurse calls them of an english officer what is to be done please sir will you come major vaughan says the group is agoing to be set for the first scene and you are wanted sir was a flunkeys admonition to fane who went off accordingly after advising me to add a dishevelled beard to my tenderly caredfor moustaches which would seem as if modus had entirely neglected his toilette there was a general rush for part books a general cry for things that were not forthcoming and a general despair on the parts of the youngest amateurs at forgetting their cues just when they were most wanted fane when he came off the stage after the first scene leant against a pillar to watch the pretty one between julia and helen so near that he must have been seen by the audience and presented a most handsome and interesting spectacle i dare say for young ladies to gaze at fixing his eyes on florence whose rendering of the part was really perfect as she uttered these words helen im constancy he unconsciously muttered aloud i believe it so do i i could not help saying and therefore more shame to whoever wins such a heart to throw it away beneath her feet a dukea duke might lay his coronet i quoted are you in love yourself fred laughed the captain then stroking his moustaches thoughtfully for some minutes he said at last as if with an effort you are right young one and yet if i was right what need was there for him to throw such passion into his partwhat need was there for him to say with such empressement those words a willing pupil kneels to thee and lays his title and his fortune at thy feet if he intended to go into foreign service why did he not go at once though i confess it seemed strange to me why fanethe courted the flattered the admired faneshould wish to leave england reader mind the gallant captain is a desperate flirt and i do not believe he will go into foreign service any more than i shall but i am afraid he will win that poor girls heart with far less thought than you buy your last little darling french bonnet and when he is tired of it will throw it away with quite as little heed but i was not so much interested in his flirtation as to forget my own still i was obliged to confess that mary aspeden did not pay me as much attention as i should have wished i danced the first dance with her after the play was overi forgot to tell you we were very much applaudedand tom cleaveland engaging her for the next i proposed a walk through the conservatories to a sentimental young lady who was my peculiar aversion but to whom i became extremely devoue for i thought i would try and pique mary if i could the light strains of dance music floated in from the distance and the air was laden with the scent of flowers and many a teteatete and partie carree was arranged in that commodious conservatory half hidden by an orangetree florence aspeden was leaning back in a gardenchair close to where we stood looking out upon the beautiful night her fair face was flushed and she was nervously picking some of the blossoms to pieces before her stood mounteagle speaking eagerly i was moving away to avoid being a hearer of his lovespeech as i doubted not it was but my companion with many youngladyish expressions of adoration of the sublime moonlight begged me to stay one moment that she might see the dear moon emerge like a swan from that dark beautiful cloud and in the pauses of her ecstatics i heard poor mounts voice in a tone of intense entreaty at that moment fane passed he glanced at the group behind the orangetrees and his face grew stern and cold and his lips closed with that iron compression they always have when he is irritated his eyes met florences and he bowed haughtily and stiffly as he moved on and his upright figure with its stately head was seen in the room beyond high above any of those around him a heavy sigh came through the orange boughs and her voice whispered ii am very sorry but oh do look at the moonbeams falling on that darling little piece of water mr wilmot exclaimed my decidedly moonstruck companion is there no hope cried poor mount none and the lowwhispered knell of hope came sighing over the flowers i thought how little she guessed there was none for her poor florence oh this night i could gaze on it forever though it is saddening in its sweetness do not you think asked my romantic demoiselle ah what a pretty valse they are playing may i have the pleasure of dancing it with you i felt myself obliged to ask although intensely victimized thereby as i hate dancing and wonder whatever idiot invented it miss chesney considering her devotion to the moon consented very joyfully to leave it for the pleasures of a valse a deux temps as we moved away i saw that florence was alone and apparently occupied with sad thoughts she i dare say was grieving over fanes cold bow and poor mount had rushed away somewhere with his great sorrow fane came into my room next morning while i was at breakfast having been obliged to get up at the unconscionable hour of ten to be in time for a review we were to have that day on layton common for the glorification of the country around the gallant captain flung himself on my sofa and after puffing away at his cigar for some minutes came out with any commands for london i am going to apply for leave and i think i shall start by the express tomorrow whats in the wind now i asked is lord avanley unwell no the governors all right thank you i am tired of rural felicity that is all replied fane i must stay for this review today or the colonel would make no end of a row he is a testy old boy i rather think i shall set out or exchange into the heavies what in the world have you got into your head fane i asked utterly astonished to see him diligently smoking an extinguished cigar i am sorry you are going to leave us the th will miss you old fellow and what will the aspedens say to losing their preux chevalier by the way speaking of them poor mount received his conge last night i expect what are you sure what did you say demanded fane stooping to relight his cigar i told him what i had overheard in the conservatory oh wellah indeedpoor fellow ejaculated the captain but theres the buglecall i must go and get into harness and i followed his example turning over in my mind as i donned my uniform what might possibly have induced fane to leave layton rise so suddenly was it at last pity for florence and if it were would not the pity come too late layton rise looked very pretty and bright under the combined influence of beauty and valor that is the correct style is it not the aspedens came early and drew up their carriages close to the flagstaff fanes eyeglass soon spied them from our distant corner of the field and as we passed before the flagstaff he bent low to his saddle with one of those fascinating smiles which have gone deep to so many unfortunate young ladies hearts again i felt angry with him as i rode along thinking of that girl her whole future most likely clouded for ever and he going away tomorrow to enjoy himself about in the world quite reckless of the heart he had broken and but in the midst of my sentimentalism i was startled by hearing the sharp voice of old townsend our colonel who was a bit of a martinet asking poor ennuye what he lifted his hand for there was a bee upon my nose colonel well sir and if there were a whole hive of bees upon your nose what right have you to raise your hand on parade stormed the colonel there was a universal titter and poor ennuye was glad to hide his confusion in the charge which was sounded on we dashed our horses at a stretching gallop our spurs jingling our plumes waving in the wind and our lances gleaming in the sunlight hurrah there is no charge in the world like the resistless english dragoons on we went till suddenly there was a piercing cry and one of the carriages in which the ponies had been most negligently left broke from the circle and tore headlong down the common at the bottom of which was a lake one young lady alone was in it it was impossible for her to pull in the excited little grays and unless they were stopped down they would all go into it but as soon as it was perceived fane had rushed from the ranks and digging his spurs into his horse galloped after the carriage breathless we watched him we would not follow for we knew that he would do it if any man could and the sound of many in pursuit would only further exasperate the ponies ha he is nearing them now another moment and they will be down the sloping bank into the lake the girl gives a wild cry fane is straining every nerve bravo well donehe has saved her i rushed up and arrived to find fane supporting a halffainting young lady in whose soft face as it rested on his shoulder i recognized florence aspeden her eyes unclosed as i drew near and blushing she disengaged herself from his arms fane bent his head over her and murmured thank god i have saved you but perhaps i did not hear distinctly by this time all her friends had gathered round them and fane had consigned her to her cousins care and she was endeavoring to thank him which her looks and blushes and smiles did most eloquently mr aspeden was shaking fane by the hand and what further might have happened i know not if the colonel very wrathful at such an unseemly interruption to his cherished manoeuvres had not shouted out fall in gentlemenfall in captain fane fall in with your troop sir we did accordingly fall in and the review proceeded but my friend actually made some mistakes in his evolutions and kept his eyeglass immovably fixed on the point in the circle and behaved altogether in a distrait mannerfane whom i used to accuse of having too much sang froidwhom nothing could possibly disturbwhom i never saw agitated before in the whole course of my acquaintance what an inexplicable fellow he is the review over we joined the aspedens and many were the congratulations florence had heaped upon her but she looked distraite too until fane came up and leaning his hand on the carriage bent down and talked to her their conversation went on in a low tone and as i was busy laughing with mary i cannot report it save that from the bright blushes on the one hand and the soft whispered tones on the other fane was clearly at his old and favorite work of winning hearts you seem quite occupe this morning mr wilmot said mary in her winning tones i trust you have had no bad newsno order from the horse guards for the lancers to leave off moustaches no miss aspeden said sydney if such a calamity as that had occurred you would not see wilmot here he would never survive the loss of his moustachesthey are his first and only love and a first affection is never forgotten added that provoking mary in a most melancholy voice it would be a pity if it were as it seems such a fertile source of amusement to you and miss aspeden i said angrily to sydney too much of a boy then to take a joke captain fane has an invitation for you and mr sydney said mary i suppose by way of amende we are going on the river to a picnic at the old castleyou will come the tones were irresistible so i smoothed down my indignation and my poor moustache and replied that i would have that pleasure as did sydney bien goodbye then for we must hasten home said mary whipping her ponies and off bowled the carriage with its fair occupants you wont be here for this picnic old fellow i remarked to fane as we rode off the ground well i dont know i hardly think i shall go just yet you see i had six months leave when i was in germany before i came down here and i hardly like to ask for another so soon and it is so easy to find a reason for what one wishes i added smiling come and look at my new chestnut will you said fane not deigning to reply to my insinuation i am going to run her against stuckup of the guards bay colt that beautiful morning in june how well i remember it as we dropped down the sunlit river under the shade of the branching trees the gentle plash of the oars mingling with the high tones and ringing laughter of our merry party on our way to the castle picnic how beautiful this is i said to mary aspeden would that life could glide on calmly and peacefully as we do this morning how romantic you are becoming laughed mary what a pity that i feel much more in mood to fish than to sentimentalize ah i replied with the present companionship i could be content to float on forever hush i beg your pardon but do listen to that dear thrush interrupted mary not the least disturbed or even interested by my pretty speeches i was old enough to know i was not the least in love with mary aspeden but i was quite too much of a boy not to feel provoked i did not make more impression i was a desperate puppy at that time and she served me perfectly right however feeling very injured i turned my attention to fane who sat talking of course to florence and left mary to the attentions of her cantab cousin miss aspeden does not agree with you fred said fane she says life was not intended to glide on like a peaceful river she likes the waves and storms he added looking down at her with very visible admiration no not for myself replied florence with a sweet sad smile i did not mean that one storm will wreck a womans happiness but were i a man i should glory in battling with the tempesttossed waves of life if there be no combat there can be no fame and the fiercer the more terrible it is the more renown to be the victor in the struggle you are right answered fane with unusual earnestness that used to be my dream once and i think even now i have the stuff in me for it but then he continued sinking his voice i must have an end an aim and above all some one who will sorrow in my sorrow and glory in my glory who will be quite ready for luncheon i should think hope youve enjoyed your boating cried mr aspedens hearty voice from the shore where having come by land he now stood to welcome us surrounded by a crowd of anxious mammas wondering if the boating had achieved the desirable end of a proposal from captain a hoping mr b who had nothing but his pay had not been paying too much attention to adelina and that honoria had given sufficient encouragement to mr c who on the strength of l a year and a coronet in prospect was considered an eligible parti his being a consummate scamp and inveterate gambler is nothing and that d has too much consideration for his family to have any serious intentions to miss e whom he is assisting to land however whatever proposals have been accepted or rejected here we all were ready for luncheon which was laid out on the grass and fane will be obliged to finish his speech another time for little now is heard but bons mots laughter and champagne corks the captain is more brilliant than ever and i make mary laugh if i cannot make her sigh luncheon over what was to be done see the castle of course as we were in duty bound since it was what we came to do and the teteatete of the boats are resumed as ladies and gentlemen ascended the grassy slopes on which the fine old ruins stood i looked for mary aspeden feeling sure that i should conquer her in time though i did not want to in the least but she had gone off somewhere i dare say with tom cleaveland so i offered my arm to that same sentimental miss chesney who had bored me into a valse a deux temps the night of the theatricals and i have no doubt her mamma contemplated her as mrs wilmot of wilmot park with very great gratification and security becoming rather tired of the young ladys hackneyed style of conversation which consisted as usual of large notes of exclamation about the sweet nightingales the dear ruins the darling flowers c c i managed to exchange with another sub and strolled off by myself as i was leaning against an old wall in no very amiable frame of mind consigning all young ladies to no very delightful place and returning to my old conclusion that they were all tarlatan and coquetry soft musical voices on the other side of the wall fell almost unconsciously on my ear oh florence i am so unhappy are you darling i wish i could help you is it about cyril graham yes with a tremendous sigh i am afraid papa and i am sure mamma will never consent i know poor dear cyril is not rich but then he is so clever he will soon make himself known but if that tiresome fred wilmot should propose i know they will want me to accept him there is one thing i never never will i do snub him as much as ever i can but he is such a puppy i believe he thinks i am in love with himas if cyril were not worth twenty such as he for all he is the owner of wilmot park very pleasant this was what a fool i must have made of myself to mary aspeden and how nice it was to hear ones self called a puppy of course dear resumed florence as you love cyril it is impossible for you to love any one ever again but i do not think mr wilmot a puppy he is conceited to be sure but i do not believe he would be so much liked byby those who are his friends if he were not rather nice come dear cheer up i am sure uncle aspeden is too kind not to let you marry cyril when he knows how much you love one another i will talk to him mary dear and bring him round see if i do not butbutwill you think me very selfish if i tell youa long pausehe has asked mei meanhe wisheshe told mehe says he does love me who darling let me thinklord athummr grant no marydrummondthat is captain fanehe saidoh mary i am so happy at this juncture it occurred suddenly to me that i was playing the part of a listener but may not much be forgiven a man who has heard himself called a puppy so i moved away leaving the fair florence to her blushes and her happiness unshared by any but her friend between my astonishment at fane and my indignation at mary i was fairly bewildered fane actually had proposed he the honorable drummond fane who had always declaimed against matrimonywho had been proofhardened against half the best matches in the countrythat desperate flirt who we thought would never fall in love to have tumbled in headlong like this well there was some satisfaction i would chaff him delightfully about it and i was really glad for if florence had given her heart to fane she was not the sort of girl to forget nor he the sort of man to be forgotten in a hurry but in what an awfully foolish light i must have appeared to mary aspeden there was one thing she would never know i had overheard her i would get leave and go off somewherei would marry the first pretty girl i met withshe should not think i cared for her no i would go on flirting as if nothing had happened and then announce in a natural manner that i was going into the highlands and then she would be the one to feel small as she had made so very sure of my proposal and yet if i went away that was the thing to please her hang it i did not know what to do my vanity was most considerably touched though my heart was not but after cooling down a little i saw how foolishly i should look if i behaved otherwise than quietly and naturally and that after all that would be the best way to make mary reverse her judgment so when i met her again which was not until we were going to return i offered her my arm to the boat where fane and his belle fiancee were sitting looking most absurdly happy and the idea of my adamantine friend being actually caught seemed so ridiculous that it almost restored me to my good humor which sooth to say the appellation of puppy had somewhat disturbed and so the moon rose and shed her silver light over the young lady who had sentimentalized upon her and a romantic cornet produced a concertina and sent forth dulcet strains into the evening air and florence and her captain talked away in whispers and mary aspeden sat with tears in her eyes thinking i suppose of cyril and i mused on my puppyism and thus wrapped each in our own little sphere we floated down the river to woodlands and it being late with many a soft good night and many a gentle au revoir we parted and mr aspedens castle picnic was over i did not see fane the next day except at parade until i was dressing for mess when he stalked into my room and stretching himself on a sofa said after a pause well old boy ive been and gone and done it been and gone and done what i asked for by the laws of retaliation i was bound to tease him a little confound you what an idiot you are was the complimentary rejoinder why my dear fellow the truth is that like most of my unfortunate sex i have at last turned into that most tortuous path called love and surrendered myself to the machinations of beautiful woman the long and the short of it isi am engaged to be married good heavens fane i exclaimed what next you married who on earth is she i know of no heiress down here she is no heiress said the captain but she is what is much betterthe sweetest dearest most lovable of course i said but no heiress my dear fane you cannot mean what you say i should be sorry if i did not was the cool reply and you must be more of a fool fred than i took you for if you cannot see that florence aspeden is worth all the heiresses upon earth and is the embodiment of all that is lovely and winning in woman no doubt of it tout cela saute aux yeux i answered but reflect fane it would be utter madness in you to marry anything but an heiress love in a cottage is not your style you were not made for a small house one maidservant and dinner ah laughed fane you are bringing my former nonsense against me some would say i was committing worse folly now but believe me fred the folly even of the heart is better than the calculating wisdom of the world i do not hesitate to say that if florence had fortune i should prefer it for such a vaurien as i was made to spend money but as she has not i love her too dearly to think about it and my father i have no doubt will soon get me my majority and we shall get on stunningly so marry for love fred if you take my advice a rather different opinion to that which you inculcated so strenuously a month ago i observed smiling but let me congratulate you old fellow with all my heart pon my word i am very glad for i always felt afraid you would like morvilliers garcon resist all the attractions of a woman until the cent mille ecus and then without hesitation declare jepouse but you were too good to be spoiled as for my goodness theres not much of that replied fane i am afraid i am much better off than i deserve i wrote to the governor last night dear old boy he will do anything i ask him by the by mary will be married soon too i hope you are not epris in that quarter fredpray do not faint if you are my florence who can do anything she likes with anybody do you think any one could be angry with her coaxed old aspeden into consenting to marys marriage with a fellow she really is in love withgraham a barrister i think she would have had more difficulty with the ladymother if a letter had not most opportunely come from graham this morning announcing the agreeable fact that he had lots of tin left him unexpectedly i wish somebody would do the same by me and so this graham will fly down on the wings of loverepresented in these days by the express traintomorrow evening and how about the foreign service fane i could not help asking and do you intend going to london tomorrow i made those two resolutions under very different circumstances to the present my dear fellow laughed fane the first when i determined to cut away from florence altogether as the only chance of forgetting her sad the second when i thought poor mount was an accepted lover and i confess that i did not feel to have stoicism enough to witness his happiness but how absurd it seems that i should have fallen in love continued he i that defied the charms of all the venuses upon earththe last person any one would have taken for a marrying man i am considerably astonished myself but i suppose love is like the whoopingcough one must have it some time or other and with these words the gallant captain raised himself from the sofa lighted a cigar and strolling out of the room mounted his horse for woodlands where he was engaged of course to dinner that evening and now gentle reader what more is there to tell i fear as it is i have written too much about nothing and as thou hast i doubt not a fine imagination what need to tell how lord avanley and mr aspeden arranged matters not like the cross papas in books and dramas but amicably as gentlemen should how merrily the bells pealed for the double wedding how i as garcon dhonneur flirted with the bridesmaids to my hearts content how fane is my friend par excellence still and how his love is all the stronger for having come late he says how all the young ladies hated florence and all the mammas and chaperones blessed her for having carried off the fascinating younger son until his brother lord castleton dying at the baths fane succeeded of course to the title how she is if possible even more charming as lady castleton than as florence aspeden and how they were really hearthappy until the crimean campaign separated them and how she turns her beautiful eyes ever to the east and heeds not save to repulse the crowd of admirers who seek to render her forgetful of her soldierhusband true wife as she is may he live to come back with laurels hardly won still to hold her his dearest treasure may fane has come back all safe i hope dear reader you are as glad as i am he has distinguished himself stunningly and is now lieutenantcolonel of the dear old th you have gloried in the charge of ours at balaklava but as i have not whispered to you my name you cannot possibly divine that a rascally russian gave me a cut on the swordarm that very day in question which laid me hors de combat but got me my majority well may i as well as fane bless the remembrance of layton rise for if i had never made the acquaintance of mary aspedeni mean grahami might never have known her bellesoeur who is now shaking her head at me for writing about her and whom either through my interesting appearance when i returned home on the sicklist and my manifold crimean adventures or through the usual perversity of women who will fall always in love with scamps who do not deserve half their goodnessedith you shall not look over my shoulderi prevailed on to accept my noble self and lancer uniform with the puppyism shaken pretty well out of it and so here we are very happy of
