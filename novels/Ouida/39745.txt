the librarian of congress at washington a la memoire dingres peintrepoete follefarine book i chapter i not the wheat itself not even so much as the chaff only the dust from the corn the dust which no one needs or notices the mock farina which flies out from under the two revolving circles of the grindstones the impalpable cloud which goes forth to gleam golden in the sun a moment and then is scatteredon the wind into the water up in the sunlight down in the mud what matters who cares only the dust a mote in the air a speck in the light a black spot in the living daytime a colorless atom in the immensity of the atmosphere borne up one instant to gleam against the sky dropped down the next to lie in a fetid ditch only the dust the dust that flows out from between the grindstones grinding exceeding hard and small as the religion which calls itself love avers that its god does grind the world it is a nothing less than nothing the stones turn the dust is born it has a puff of life it dies who cares no one not the good god not any man not even the devil it is a thing even devildeserted ah it is very like you said the old miller watching the millstones follefarine heardshe had heard a hundred timesand held her peace follefarine the dust only the dust as good a name as any other for a nameless creature the dustsharpwinnowed and rejected of all as less worthy than even the shred husks and the shattered stalks follefarineshe watched the dust fly in and out all day long from between the grindstones she only wondered why if she and the dust were thus kindred and namesakes the wind flew away with the dust so mercifully and yet never would fly away with her the dust was carried away by the breeze and wandered wherever it listed the dust had a sweet short summerday life of its own ere it died if it were worthless it at least was free it could lie in the curl of a green leaf or on the white breast of a flower it could mingle with the golden dust in a lily and almost seem to be one with it it could fly with the thistledown and with the feathers of the dandelion on every roving wind that blew in a vague dreamy fashion the child wondered why the dust was so much better dealt with than she was follefarine follefollefollefarine the other children hooted after her echoing the name by which the grim humor of her bittertongued taskmaster had called her she had got used to it and answered to it as others to their birthnames it meant that she was a thing utterly useless absolutely worthless the very refuse of the winnowings of the flail of fate but she accepted that too so far as she understood it she only sometimes wondered in a dull fierce fashion why if she and the dust were sisters the dust had its wings while she had none all day long the dust flew in and out and about as it liked through the open doors and among the tossing boughs and through the fresh cool mists and down the golden shafts of the sunbeams and all day long she stayed in one place and toiled and was first beaten and then cursed or first cursed and then beatenwhich was all the change that her life knew for herself she saw no likeness betwixt her and the dust for that escaped from the scourge and flew forth but she abode under the flail always nevertheless follefarine was all the name she knew the great black wheel churned and circled in the brook water and lichens and ferns and mosses made lovely all the dark shadowy silent place the red mill roof gleamed in the sun under a million summer leaves the pigeons came and went all day in and out of their holes in the wall the sweet scents of ripening fruits in many orchards filled the air the great grindstones turned and turned and turned and the dust floated forth to dance with the gnat and to play with the sunbeam follefarine sat aloft on the huge black wet timbers above the wheel and watched with her thoughtful eyes and wondered again after her own fashion why her namesake had thus liberty to fly forth whilst she had none suddenly a shrill screaming voice broke the stillness savagely little devil cried the miller go fetch me those sacks and carry them within and pile them neatly do you hear like the piles of stone in the road follefarine swung down from the timbers in obedience to the command and went to the heap of sacks that lay outside the mill small sacks most of them all of last years flour there was an immense gladiolus growing near in the millgarden where they were a tall flower all scarlet and gold and straight as a palm with bees sucking into its bells and butterflies poising on its stem she stood a moment looking at its beauty she was scarce any higher than its topmost bud and was in her way beautiful something after its fashion she was a child of six or eight years with limbs moulded like sculpture and brown as the brook water great lustrous eyes half savage and half soft a mouth like a red pomegranate bud and straight dark browsthe brows of the friezes of egypt her only clothing was a short white linen kirtle knotted around her waist and falling to her knees and her skin was burned by exposure in the sun to a goldenbrown color though in texture it was soft as velvet and showed all the veins like glass standing there in the deep grass with the great scarlet flower against her and purple butterflies over her head an artist would have painted her and called her by a score of names and described for her some mystical or noble fate as anteros perhaps or as the doomed son of procne or as some child born to the forsaken in the savage forests of naxos or conceived by persephone in the eternal night of hell while still the earth lay black and barren and fruitless under the ban and curse of a bereaved maternity but here she had only one name follefarine and here she had only to labor drearily and stupidly like the cattle of the field without their strength and with barely so much even as their scanty fare and begrudged bed the sunbeams that fell on her might find out that she had a beauty which ripened and grew rich under their warmth like that of a red flower bud or a golden autumn fruit but nothing else ever did in none of the eyes that looked on her had she any sort of loveliness she was follefarine a little wicked beast that only merited at best a whip and a cruel word a broken crust and a malediction a thing born of the devil and out of which the devil needed to be scourged incessantly the sacks were all small they were the property of the peasant proprietors of the districta district of western normandy but though small they were heavy in proportion to her age and power she lifted one although with effort yet with the familiarity of an accustomed action poised it on her back clasped it tight with her round slender arms and carried it slowly through the open door of the mill that one put down upon the bricks she came for a seconda thirda fourtha fiftha sixth working doggedly patiently and willingly as a little donkey works the sacks were in all sixteen before the seventh she paused it was a hot day in midaugust she was panting and burning with the exertion the bloom in her cheeks had deepened to scarlet she stood a moment resting bathing her face in the sweet coolness of a white tall tuft of lilies the miller looked round where he worked among his beans and cabbages and saw little mule little beast he cried would you be lazyyouwho have no more right to live at all than an eft or a stoat or a toad and as he spoke he came toward her he had caught up a piece of rope with which he had been about to tie his tall beans to a stake and he struck the child with it the sharp cord bit the flesh cruelly curling round her bare chest and shoulders and leaving a livid mark she quivered a little but she said nothing she lifted her head and looked at him and dropped her hands to her sides her great eyes glowed fiercely her red curling lips shut tight her straight brows drew together little devil will you work now said the miller do you think you are to stand in the sun and smell at flowersyou poufff follefarine did not move pick up the sacks this moment little brute said the miller if you stand still a second before they are all housed you shall have as many stripes as there are sacks left untouched ohhe do you hear she heard but she did not move do you hear he pursued as many strokes as there are sacks little wretch nowi will give you three moments to choose one follefarine still stood mute and immovable her head erect her arms crossed on her chest a small slender bronzehued halfnude figure among the ruby hues of the gladioli and the pure snowlike whiteness of the lilies two she stood in the same attitude the sacks lying untouched at her feet a purplewinged butterfly lighting on her head three she was still mute still motionless he seized her by the shoulder with one hand and with the other lifted the rope it curled round her breast and back again and again and again she shuddered but she did not utter a single cry he struck her the ten times with the same number of strokes as there remained sacks uncarried he did not exert any great strength for had he used his uttermost he would have killed her and she was of value to him but he scourged her with a merciless exactitude in the execution of his threat and the rope was soon wet with drops of her bright young blood the noonday sun fell golden all around the deep sweet peace of the silent country reigned everywhere the pigeons fled to and fro in and out of their little arched homes the millstream flowed on singing a pleasant song now and then a ripe apricot dropped with a low sound on the turf close about was all the radiance of summer flowers of heavy rich roses of yellow lime tufts of sheaves of oldfashioned comely phlox and all the delicate shafts of the graceful lilies and in the warmth the child shuddered under the scourge against the light the black rope curled like a serpent darting to sting among the sunfed blossoms there fell a crimson stain but never a word had she uttered she endured to the tenth stroke in silence he flung the cord aside among the grass daughter of devilswhat strength the devil gives he muttered follefarine said nothing her face was livid her back bruised and lacerated her eyes still glanced with undaunted scorn and untamed passion still she said nothing but as his hand released her she darted as noiselessly as a lizard to the waters edge set her foot on the lowest range of the woodwork and in a second leaped aloft to the highest point and seated herself astride on that crossbar of black timber on which she had been throned when he had summoned her first above the foam of the churning wheels and in the deepest shadow of innumerable leaves then she lifted up a voice as pure as strong as fresh as the voice of a mavis in maytime and sang with reckless indifference a stave of song in a language unknown to any of the people of that place a loud fierce air with broken words of curious and most dulcet melody which rang loud and defiant yet melancholy even in their rebellion through the foliage and above the sound of the loud mill water it is a chant to the foul fiend the miller muttered to himself well why does he not come and take his own he would be welcome to it and he went and sprinkled holy water on his rope and said an ave or two over it to exorcise it every fiber of her childish body ached and throbbed the stripes on her shoulders burned like flame her little brain was dizzy her little breast was black with bruises but still she sang on clutching the timber with her hands to keep her from falling into the foam below and flashing her fierce proud eyes down through the shade of the leaves can one never cut the devil out of her muttered the miller going back to his work among the beans after awhile the song ceased the pain she suffered stifled her voice despite herself she felt giddy and sick but she sat there still in the shadow holding on by the jutting woodwork and watching the water foam and eddy below the hours went away the golden day died the grayness of evening stole the glow from the gladioli and shut up the buds of the roses the great lilies gleamed but the whiter in the dimness of twilight the vesper chimes were rung from the cathedral two leagues away over the fields the miller stopped the gear of the mill the grindstones and the waterwheels were set at rest the peace of the night came down the pigeons flew to roost in their niches but the sacks still lay unearned on the grass and a spider had found time to spin his fairy ropes about them the miller stood on his threshold and looked up at her where she sat aloft in the dusky shades of the leaves come down and carry these sacks little brute he said if notno supper for you tonight follefarine obeyed him and came down from the huge black pile slowly her bands crossed behind her back her head erect her eyes glancing like the eyes of a wild hawk she walked straight past the sacks across the dewladen turf through the tufts of the lilies and so silently into the house the entrance was a wide kitchen paved with blue and white tiles clean as a watercress filled with the pungent odor of dried herbs and furnished with brass pots and pans with walnut presses and with pinewood trestles and with strange little quaint pictures and images of saints on one of the trestles were set a jug of steaming milk some rolls of black bread and a big dish of stewed cabbages at the meal there was already seated a lean brown wrinkled careworn old servingwoman clad in the bluegray kirtle and the white headgear of normandy the miller stayed the child at the threshold little devilnot a bit nor drop tonight if you do not carry the sacks follefarine said nothing but moved on past the food on the board past the images of the saints past the high lancet window through which the moonlight had begun to stream and out at the opposite door there she climbed a steep winding stairway on to which that door had opened pushed aside a little wooden wicket entered a loft in the roof loosened the single garment that she wore shook it off from her and plunged into the fragrant mass of daisied hay and of dry orchard mosses which served her as a bed covered in these and curled like a dormouse in its nest she clasped her hands above her head and sought to forget in sleep her hunger and her wounds she was well used to both below there was a crucifix with a bleeding god upon it there was a little rudelysculptured representation of the nativity there was a wooden figure of st christopher a portrait of the madonna and many other symbols of the church but the child went to her bed without a prayer on her lips and with a curse on her head and bruises on her body sleep for once would not come to her she was too hurt and sore to be able to lie without pain the dried grasses so soft to her usually were like thorns beneath the skin that still swelled and smarted from the stripes of the rope she was feverish she tossed and turned in vain she suffered too much to be still she sat up and stared with her passionate wistful eyes at the leaves that were swaying against the square casement in the wall and the moonbeam that shone so cold and bright across her bed she listened all her senses awake to the noises of the house they were not many a cats mew a mouses scratch the clickclack of the old womans step the shrill monotony of the old mans voice these were all after awhile even these ceased the wooden shoes clattered up the wooden stairs the house became quite still there was only in the silence the endless flowing murmur of the water breaking against the motionless wheels of the mill neither man nor woman had come near to bring her anything to eat or drink she had heard them muttering their prayers before they went to rest but no hand unlatched her door she had no disappointment because she had had no hope she had rebellion because nature had implanted it in her but she went no further she did not know what it was to hope she was only a young wild animal well used to blows and drilled by them but not tamed as soon as the place was silent she got out of her nest of grass slipped on her linen skirt and opened her casementa small square hole in the wall and merely closed by a loose deal shutter with a hole cut in it scarcely bigger than her head a delicious sudden rush of summer air met her burning face a cool cluster of foliage hit her a soft blow across the eyes as the wind stirred it they were enough to allure her like any other young cub of the woods she had only two instinctsair and liberty she thrust herself out of the narrow window with the agility that only is born of frequent custom and got upon the shelving thatch of a shed that sloped a foot or so below slid down the roof and swung herself by the jutting bricks of the outhouse wall on to the grass the housedog a brindled mastiff that roamed loose all night about the mill growled and sprang at her then seeing who she was put up his gaunt head and licked her face and turned again to resume the rounds of his vigilant patrol ere he went she caught and kissed him closely and fervently without a word the mastiff was the only living thing that did not hate her she was grateful in a passionate dumb unconscious fashion then she took to her feet ran as swiftly as she could along the margin of the water and leaped like a squirrel into the wood on whose edge the millhouse stood once there she was content the silence the shadows the darkness where the trees stood thick the pale quivering luminance of the moon the mystical eerie sounds that fill a woodland by night all which would have had terror for tamer and happier creatures of her years had only for her a vague entranced delight nature had made her without one pulse of fear and she had remained too ignorant to have been ever taught it it was still warm with all the balmy breath of midsummer there were heavy dews everywhere here and there on the surface of the water there gleamed the white closed cups of the lotos through the air there passed now and then the soft gray dim body of a nightbird on the wing the wood whose trees were pines and limes and maples was full of a deep dreamy odor the mosses that clothed many of the branches hung filmlike in the wind in lovely coils and weblike fantasies around stretched the vast country dark and silent as in a trance the stillness only broken by some faint note of a sheeps bell some distant song of a muledriver passing homeward the child strayed onward through the trees insensibly soothed and made glad she knew not why by all the dimness and the fragrance round her she stood up to her knees in the shallow freshets that every now and then broke up through the grasses she felt the dews shaken off the leaves above fall deliciously upon her face and hair she filled her hands with the nightblooming marvelflower and drank in its sweetness as though it were milk and honey she crouched down and watched her own eyes look back at her from the dark gliding water of the river then she threw herself on her back upon the mossesso cool and moist that they seemed like balm upon the bruised hot skinand lay there looking upward at the swift mute passage of the flitting owls at the stately flight of the broadwinged moths at the movement of the swift brown bats at the soft trembling of the foliage in the breeze at the great clouds slowly sailing across the brightness of the moon all these things were vaguely sweet to herwith the sweetness of freedom of love of idleness of rest of all things which her life had never known so may the young largeeyed antelope feel the beauty of the forest in the hot lull of tropic nights when the speed of the pursuer has relaxed and the aromatic breath of the panther is no more against its flank she lay there long quite motionless tracing with a sort of voluptuous delight all movements in the air all changes in the clouds all shadows in the leaves all the immense multitude of ephemeral life which unheard in the day fills the earth with innumerable whispering voices after the sun has set now stirred in every herb and under every bough around her the silvery ghostlike wing of an owl touched her forehead once a little dormouse ran across her feet strange shapes floated across the cold white surface of the water quaint things hairy filmwinged swam between her and the stars but none of these things had terror for her they were things of the night with which she felt vaguely the instinct of kinship she was only a little wild beast they said the offspring of darkness and vileness and rage and disgrace and yet in a vague imperfect way the glories of the night its mysterious and solemn beauty its melancholy and lustrous charm quenched the fierceness in her dauntless eyes and filled them with dim wondering tears and stirred the halfdead soul in her to some dull pain some nameless ecstasy that were not merely physical and then in her way being stung by these and moved she knew not why to a strange sad sense of loneliness and shame and knowing no better she prayed she raised herself on her knees and crossed her hands upon her chest and prayed after the fashion that she had seen men and women and children pray at roadside shrines and crosses prayed aloud with a little beating breaking heart like the young child she was o devil if i be indeed thy daughter stay with me leave me not alone lend me thy strength and power and let me inherit of thy kingdom give me this o great lord and i will praise thee and love thee always she prayed in all earnestness in all simplicity in broken faltering language knowing no better knowing only that she was alone on the earth and friendless and very hungry and in sore pain while this mighty unknown king of the dominion of darkness whose child she ever heard she was had lost her or abandoned her and reigned afar in some great world oblivious of her misery the silence of the night alone gave back the echo of her own voice she waited breathless for some answer for some revelation some reply there only came the pure cold moon sailing straight from out a cloud and striking on the waters she rose sadly to her feet and went back along the shining course of the stream through the grasses and the mosses and under the boughs to her little nest under the eaves as she left the obscurity of the wood and passed into the fuller light her bare feet glistening and her shoulders wet with the showers of dew a large dark shape flying down the wind smote her with his wings upon the eyes lighted one moment on her head and then swept onward lost in shade at that moment likewise a radiant golden globe flashed to her sight dropped to her footsteps and shone an instant in the glisten from the skies it was but a great goshawk seeking for its prey it was but a great meteor fading and falling at its due appointed hour but to the heated savage dreamy fancy of the child it seemed an omen an answer a thing of prophecy a spirit of air nay why not him himself in legends which had been the only lore her ears had ever heard it had been often told her that he took such shapes as this if he should give me his kingdom she thought and her eyes flashed alight her heart swelled her cheeks burned the little dim untutored brain could not hold the thought long or close enough to grasp or sift or measure it but some rude rich glory impalpable unutterable seemed to come to her and bathe her in its heat and color she was his offspring so they all told her why not then also his heir she felt as felt the goatherd or the charcoalburner in those legends she had fed on who was suddenly called from poverty and toil from hunger and fatigue from a tireless hearth and a bed of leaves to inherit some fairy empire to ascend to some region of the gods like one of these hearing the summons to some great unknown imperial power smite all his poor pale barren life to splendor so follefarine standing by the waters side in the light of the moon desolate ignorant brutelike felt elected to some mighty heritage unseen of men if this were waiting for her in the future what matter now were stripes or wounds or woe she smiled a little dreamily like one who beholds fair visions in his sleep and stole back over the starlit grass and swung herself upward by the tendrils of ivy and crouched once more down in her nest of mosses and either the courage of the spirits of darkness or the influence of instincts dumb but nascent was with her for she fell asleep in her little loft in the roof as though she were a thing cherished of heaven and earth and dreamed happily all through the hours of the slowlyrising dawn her bruised body and her languid brain and her aching heart all stilled and soothed and her hunger and passion and pain forgotten with the nightblooming flowers still clasped in her hands and on her closed mouth a smile for she dreamed of her fathers kingdom a kingdom which no man denies to the creature that has beauty and youth and is poor and yet proud and is of the sex of its mother chapter ii in one of the most fertile and most fair districts of northern france there was a little norman town very very old and beautiful exceedingly by reason of its ancient streets its high peaked roofs its marvelous galleries and carvings its exquisite grays and browns its silence and its color and its rich still life its center was a great cathedral noble as york or chartres a cathedral whose spire shot to the clouds and whose innumerable towers and pinnacles were all pierced to the day so that the blue sky shone and the birds of the air flew all through them a slow brown river broad enough for marketboats and for cornbarges stole through the place to the sea lapping as it went the wooden piles of the houses and reflecting the quaint shapes of the carvings the hues of the signs and the draperies the dark spaces of the dormer windows the bright heads of some casementcluster of carnations the laughing face of a girl leaning out to smile on her lover all around it lay the deep grass unshaven the leagues on leagues of fruitful orchards the low blue hills tenderly interlacing one another the fields of colza where the white beaddress of the women workers flashed in the sun like a silvery pigeons wing to the west were the deepgreen woods and the wide plains golden with gorse of arthurs and of merlins lands and beyond to the northward was the great dim stretch of the ocean breaking on a yellow shore whither the river ran and whither led straight shady roads hidden with linden and with poplartrees and marked ever and anon by a wayside wooden christ or by a little murmuring well crowned with a crucifix a beautiful old shadowy ancient place picturesque everywhere often silent with a sweet sad silence that was chiefly broken by the sound of bells or the chanting of choristers a place of the middle ages still with lanterns swinging on cords from house to house as the only light with wondrous scrollworks and quaint signs at the doors of all its traders with monks cowls and golden croziers and whiterobed acolytes in its streets with the subtle smoke of incense coming out from the cathedral door to mingle with the odors of the fruits and flowers in the marketplace with great flatbottomed boats drifting down the river under the leaning eaves of its dwellings and with the galleries of its opposing houses touching so nearly that a girl leaning in one could stretch a provence rose or toss an easteregg across to her neighbor in the other doubtless there were often squalor poverty dust filth and uncomeliness within these old and beautiful homes doubtless often the dwellers therein were housed like cattle and slept like pigs and looked but once out to the woods and waters of the landscapes round for one hundred times that they looked at their hidden silver in an old delf jug or at their tawdry colored prints of st victorian or st scaevola but yet much of the beauty and the nobility of the old simple restful richhued life of the past still abode there and remained with them in the straight lithe form of their maidens untrammeled by modern garb and moving with the free majestic grace of forest does in the vast dim sculptured chambers where the grandam span by the wood fire and the little children played in the shadows and the lovers whispered in the embrasured window in the broad marketplace where the mules cropped the clover and the tawny awnings caught the sunlight and the white caps of the girls framed faces fitted for the pencils of missal painters and the wondrous flush of color from mellow fruits and flowers glanced amidst the shelter of deepest freshest green in the perpetual presence of their cathedral which through sun and storm through frost and summer through noon and midnight stood there amidst them and beheld the galled oxen tread their painful way and the scourged mules droop their humble heads and the helpless harmless flocks go forth to the slaughter and the old weary lives of the men and women pass through hunger and cold to the grave and the sun and the moon rise and set and the flowers and the children blossom and fade and the endless years come and go bringing peace bringing war bringing harvest bringing famine bringing life bringing death and beholding these still said to the multitude in its terrible irony lo your god is love this little town lay far from the great paris highway and all greatly frequented tracks it was but a short distance from the coast but near no harbor of greater extent than such as some small fishing village had made in the rocks for the trawlers few strangers ever came to it except some wandering painters or antiquaries it sent its apples and eggs its poultry and honey its colza and corn to the use of the great cities but it was rarely that any of its own people went thither now and then some one of the ovalfaced blueeyed lithelimbed maidens of its little homely households would sigh and flush and grow restless and murmur of paris and would steal out in the break of a warm gray morning whilst only the birds were still waking and would patter away in her wooden shoes over the broad white southern road with a stick over her shoulder and a bundle of all her worldly goods upon the stick and she would look back often often as she went and when all was lost in the blue haze of distance save the lofty spire that she still saw through her tears she would say in her heart with her lips parched and trembling i will come back again i will come back again but none such ever did come back they came back no more than did the white sweet sheaves of the lilies that the women gathered and sent to be bought and sold in the cityto gleam one faint summer night in a gilded balcony and to be flung out the next morning withered and dead one among the few who had thus gone whither the lilies went and of whom the people would still talk as their mules paced homewards through the lanes at twilight had been reine flamma the daughter of the miller of ypres ypres was a beechenwooded hamlet on the northern outskirt of the town a place of orchards and wooded tangle through which there ran a branch of the brimming river hastening to seek and join the sea and caught a moment on its impetuous way and forced to work by the grim millwheels that had churned the foambells there for centuries the millhouse was very ancient its timbers were carved all over into the semblance of shields and helmets and crosses and fleurdelis and its frontage was of quaint pargeted work black and white except where the old blazonries had been it had been handed down from sire to son of the same race through many generationsa race hard keen unlearned superstitious and caustictongueda race wedded to old ways credulous of legend chaste of life cruel of judgment harshly strong yet ignorantly weak a race holding dearer its heirloom of loveless joyless bigoted virtue even than those gold and silver pieces which had ever been its passion hidden away in earthen pipkins under old appleroots or in the crannies of wall timber or in secret nooks of oaken cupboards claudis flamma the last of this toilsome godfearing manbegrudging norman stock was true to the type and the traditions of his people he was too ignorant even to read but priests do not deem this a fault he was avaricious but many will honor a miser quicker than a spendthrift he was cruel but in the marketplace he always took heed to give his mare a full feed so that if she were pinched of her hay in her stall at home none were the wiser for she had no language but that of her wistful black eyes and this is a speech to which men stay but little to listen the shrewd old bittertongued sternliving man was feared and respected with the respect that fear begets and in truth he had a rigid virtue in his way and was proud of it with scorn for those who found it hard to walk less straightly and less circumspectly than himself he married late his wife died in childbirth his daughter grew into the perfection of womanhood under the cold hard narrow rule of his severity and his superstition he loved her indeed with as much love as it was possible for him ever to feel and was proud of her beyond all other things saved for her toiled for her muttered ever that it was for her when at confession he related how his measures of flour had been falsely weighted and how he had filched from the corn brought by the widow and the fatherless for her he had sinned from one to whom the good report of his neighbors and the respect of his own conscience were as the very breath of life it was the strongest proof of love that he could give but this love never gleamed one instant in his small sharp gray eyes nor escaped ever by a single utterance from his lips reprimand or homily or cynical rasping sarcasm was all that she ever heard from him she believed that he despised and almost hated her he held it well for women to be tutored in subjection and in trembling at twentytwo reine flamma was the most beautiful woman in calvados and the most wretched she was straight as a pine cold as snow graceful as a stem of wheat lovely and silent with a mute proud face in which the great blue eyes alone glowed with a strange repressed speechless passion and wishfulness her life was simple pure chaste blameless as the lives of the many women of her race who before her had lived and died in the shadow of that waterfed wood had always been her father rebuked and girded at her continually dreaming that he could paint whiter even the spotlessness of this lily refine even the purity of this virgin gold she never answered him anything nor in anything contradicted his will not one among all the youths and maidens of her birthplace had ever heard so much as a murmur of rebellion from her and the priests said that such a life as this would be fitter for the cloister than the marriagebed none of them ever read the warning that these darkblue slumbering eyes would have given to any who should have had the skill to construe them right there were none of such skill there and so she holding her peace the men and women noted her ever with a curious dumb reverence and said among themselves that the race of flamma would die well and nobly in her a saint said the good old gentle bishop of the district as he blessed her one summer evening in her fathers house and rode his mule slowly through the pleasant poplar lanes and breezeblown fields of colza back to his little quiet homestead where he tended his own cabbages and garnered his own honey reine flamma bowed her tall head meekly and took his benediction in silence the morning after the miller rising as his custom was at daybreak and reciting his paternosters thanked the mother of the world that she had given him thus strength and power to rear up his motherless daughter in purity and peace then he dressed himself in his gray patched blouse groped his way down the narrow stair and went in his daily habit to undraw the bolts and unloose the chains of his dwelling there was no need that morning for him the bolts were already back the housedoor stood wide open on the threshold a brown hen perched pluming herself there were the ticking of the clock the chirming of the birds the rushing of the water these were the only sounds upon the silence he called his daughters name there was no answer he mounted to her chamber it had no tenant he searched hither and thither in the house and the stable and the granary in the mill and the garden and the wood he shouted he ran he roused his neighbors he looked in every likely and unlikely place there was no reply there was only the howl of the watchdog who sat with his face to the south and mourned unceasingly and from that day neither he nor any man living there ever heard again of reine flamma some indeed did notice that at the same time there disappeared from the town one who had been there through all that spring and summer one who had lived strangely and been clad in an odd rich fashion and had been whispered as an eastern prince by reason of his scattered gold his unfamiliar tongue his blackbrowed stareyed deephued beauty like the beauty of the passionflower but none had ever seen this stranger and reine flamma in each others presence and the rumor was discredited as a foulness absurd and unseemly to be said of a woman whom their bishop had called a saint so it died out breathed only by a few mouths and it came to be accepted as a fact that she must have perished in the deep fastflowing river by some false step on the milltimber as she went at dawn to feed her doves or by some strange sad trance of sleepwalking from which she had been known more than once to suffer claudis flamma said little it was a wound that bled inwardly he toiled and chaffered and drove hard bargains and worked early and late with his hireling and took for the household service an old norman peasant woman more aged than himself and told no man that he suffered all that he ever said was she was a saint god took her and in his martyrdom he found a hard pride and a dull consolation it was no mere metaphoric form of words with him he believed in miracles and all manner of divine interposition and he believed likewise that she his angel being too pure for earth had been taken by gods own hand up to the bosom of mary and this honor which had befallen his firstbegotten shed a sanctity and splendor on his cheerless days and when the little children and the women saw him pass they cleared from his way as from a princes and crossed themselves as they changed words with one whose daughter was the bride of christ so six years passed away and the name of reine flamma was almost forgotten but embalmed in memories of religious sanctity as the dead heart of a saint is imbedded in amber and myrrh at the close of the sixth year there happened what many said was a thing devilconceived and wrought out by the devil to the shame of a pure name and to the hinderance of the people of god one winters night claudis flamma was seated in his kitchen having recently ridden home his mare from the market in the town the fire burned in ancient fashion on the hearth and it was so bitter without that even his parsimonious habits had relaxed and he had piled some wood liberally mingled with dry moss that cracked and glowed and shot flame up the wide black shaft of the chimney the days work was over the old womanservant sat spinning flax on the other side of the fire the great mastiff was stretched sleeping quietly on the brick floor the blue pottery the brass pans the oaken presses that had been the riches of his race for generations glimmered in the light the doors were barred the shutters closed around the house the winds howled and beneath its walls the fretting water hissed the miller overcome with the past cold and present warmth nodded in his wooden settle and slept and muttered dreamily in his sleep a sainta saintgod took her the old woman hearing looked across at him and shook her head and went on with her spinning with lips that moved inaudibly she had been wont to say out of her taskmasters hearing that no woman who was beautiful ever was a saint as well and some thought that this old creature marie pitchou who used to live in a miserable hut on the other side of the wood had known more than she had chosen to tell of the true fate of reine flamma suddenly a blow on the panels of the door sounded through the silence the miller awakened in a moment started to his feet and grasped his ash staff with one hand and with the other the oillamp burning on the trestle the watchdog arose but made no hostile sound a step crushed the dead leaves without and passed away faintly there was stillness again the mastiff went to the bolted door smelt beneath it and scratched at the panels on the silence there sounded a small timid feeble beating on the wood from without such a slight fluttering noise as a wounded bird might make in striving to rise it is nothing evil muttered flamma if it were evil the beast would not want to have the door opened it may be some one sick or stray all this time he was in a manner charitable often conquering the niggardly instincts of his character to try and save his soul by serving the wretched he was a miser and he loved to gain and loathed to give but since his daughter had been taken to the saints he had striven with all his might to do good enough to be taken likewise to that heavenly rest any crust bestowed on the starveling any bed of straw afforded to the tramp caused him a sharp pang but since his daughter had been taken he had tried to please god by this mortification of his own avarice and diminution of his own gains he could not vanquish the nature that was ingrained in him he would rob the widow of an ephah of wheat and leave his mare famished in her stall because it was his nature to find in all such saving a sweet savor but he would not turn away a beggar or refuse a crust to a wayfarer lest thus refusing he might turn away from him an angel unawares the mastiff scratched still at the panels the sound outside had ceased the miller setting the lamp down on the floor gripped more firmly the ashen stick undrew the bolts turned the stout key and opened the door slowly and with caution a loud gust of wind blew dead leaves against his face a blinding spray of snow scattered itself over his bent stretching form in the darkness without whitened from head to foot there stood a little child the dog went up to her and licked her face with kindly welcome claudis flamma drew her with a rough grasp across the threshold and went out into the air to find whose footsteps had been those which had trodden heavily away after the first knock the snow however was falling fast it was a cloudy moonless night he did not dare to go many yards from his own portals lest he should fall into some ambush set by robbers the mastiff too was quiet which indicated that there was no danger near so the old man returned closed the door carefully drew the bolts into their places and came towards the child whom the woman pitchou had drawn towards the fire she was a child of four or five years old huddled in coarse linen and in a little red garment of foxs skin and blanched from head to foot for the flakes were frozen on her and on the little hood that covered gypsylike her curls it was a strange little icecold ghostlike figure but out of this mass of icicles and whiteness there glowed great beaming frightened eyes and a mouth like a scarlet berry the radiance and the contrast of it were like the glow of holly fruit thrust out from a pile of drifted snow the miller shook her by the shoulder who brought you phratos answered the child with a stifled sob in her throat and who is that phratos answered the child again is that a man or a woman the child made no reply she seemed not to comprehend his meaning the miller shook her again and some drops of water fell from the ice that was dissolving in the warmth why are you come here he asked impatiently she shook her head as though to say none knew so little of herself as she you must have a name he pursued harshly and in perplexity what are you called who are you the child suddenly raised her great eyes that had been fastened on the leaping flames and flashed them upon his in a terror of bewildered ignorancethe piteous terror of a stray dog phratos she cried once more and the cry now was half a sigh half a shriek something in that regard pierced him and startled him he dropped his hand off her shoulder and breathed quickly the old woman gave a low cry and staring with all her might at the childs small dark fierce lovely face fell to counting her wooden beads and mumbling many prayers claudis flamma turned savagely on her as if stung by some unseen snake and willing to wreak his vengeance on the nearest thing that was at hand fool cease your prating he muttered with a brutal oath take the animal and search her bring me what you find then he sat down on the stool by the fire and braced his lips tightly and locked his bony hands upon his knees he knew what blow awaited him he was no coward and he had manhood enough in him to press any iron into his soul and tell none that it hurt him the old woman drew the child aside to a dusky corner of the chamber and began to despoil her of her coverings the creature did not resist the freezing cold and long fatigue had numbed and silenced her her eyelids were heavy with the sleep such cold produces and she had not strength because she had not consciousness enough to oppose whatsoever they might choose to do to her only now and then her eyes opened as they had opened on him with a sudden luster and fierceness like those in a netted animals impatient but untamed regard pitchou seized and searched her eagerly stripping her of her warm foxskin wrap her scarlet hood of wool her little rough hempen shirt which were all dripping with the water from the melted snow the skin of the child was brown with a golden bloom on it it had been tanned by hot suns but it was soft as silk in texture and transparent showing the course of each blue vein her limbs were not well nourished but they were of perfect shape and delicate bone and the feet were the long arched slender feet of the southern side of the pyrenees she allowed herself to be stripped and wrapped in a coarse piece of homespun linen she was still half frozen and in a state of stupor either from amazement or from fear she was quite passive and she never spoke her apathy deceived the old crone who took it for docility and who trusting to it proceeded to take advantage of it after the manner of her kind about the childs head there hung a little band of glittering coins they were not gold but the woman pitchou thought they were and seized them with gloating hands and ravenous eyes the child started from her torpor shook herself free and fought to guard themfiercely with tooth and nail as the young fox whose skin she had worn might have fought for its dear life the old woman on her side strove as resolutely long curls of the childs hair were clutched out in the struggle she did not wince or scream but she foughtfought with all the breath and the blood that were in her tiny body she was no match with all her ferocity and fury for the sinewy grip of the old peasant and the coins were torn off her forehead and hidden away in a hole in the wood out of her sight where the old peasant hoarded all her precious treasures of copper coins and other trifles that she managed to secrete from her masters allseeing eyes they were little oriental sequins engraved with arabic characters chained together after the eastern fashion to pitchou they looked a diadem of gold worthy of an empress the child watched them removed in perfect silence from the moment they had been wrenched away and the battle had been finally lost to her she had ceased to struggle as though disdainful of a fruitless contest but a great hate gathered in her eyes and smouldered there like a halfstifled fireit burned on and on for many a long year afterwards unquenched when pitchou brought her a cup of water and a roll of bread she would neither eat nor drink but turned her face to the wallmute those are just her fathers eyes the old woman muttered she had seen them burn in the gloom of the evening through the orchard trees as the stars rose and as reine flamma listened to the voice that wooed her to her destruction she let the child be and searched her soaked garments for any written word or any token that might be on them fastened roughly to the foxs skin there was a faded letter pitchou could not read she took it to her master claudis flamma grasped the paper and turned its superscription to the light of the lamp he likewise could not read yet at sight of the characters his tough frame trembled and his withered skin grew red with a sickly feverish quickening of the blood he knew them once in a time long dead he had been proud of those slender letters that had been so far more legible than any that the women of her class could pen and on beholding which the good bishop had smiled and passed a pleasant word concerning her being almost fitted to be his own clerk and scribe for a moment watching those written ciphers that had no tongue for him and yet seemed to tell their tale so that they scorched and withered up all the fair honor and pious peace of his old age a sudden faintness a sudden swooning sense seized him for the first time in all his life his limbs failed him he sank down on his seat again he gasped for breath he needed not to be told anything he knew all he knew that the creature whom he had believed so pure that god had deemed the earth unworthy of her youth was his throat rattled his lips were covered with foam his ears were filled with a rushing hollow sound like the roaring of his own millwaters in a time of storm all at once he started to his feet and glared at the empty space of the dim chamber and struck his hands wildly together in the air and cried aloud she was a saint i saida saint a saint in body and soul and i thought that god begrudged her and held her too pure for man and he laughed aloudthrice the child hearing and heavy with sleep and eagerly desiring warmth as a little frozen beast that coils itself in snow to slumber into death startled by that horrible mirth came forward the serge fell off her as she moved her little naked limbs glimmered like gold in the dusky light her hair was as a cloud behind her her little scarlet mouth was half open like the mouth of a child seeking its mothers kiss her great eyes dazzled by the flame flashed and burned and shone like stars they had seen the same face ere then in calvados she came straight to claudis flamma as though drawn by that awful and discordant laughter and by that leaping ruddy flame upon the hearth and she stretched out her arms and murmured a word and smiled a little dreamily seeking to sleep asking to be caressed desiring she knew not what he clinched his fist and struck her to the ground she fell without a sound the blood flowed from her mouth he looked at her where she lay and laughed once more she was a sainta saint and the devil begot in her that then he went out across the threshold and into the night with the letter still clinched in his hand the snow fell the storm raged the earth was covered with ice and water he took no heed but passed through it his head bare and his eyes blind the dog let him go forth alone and waited by the child chapter iii all night long he was absent the old servingwoman terrified in so far as her dull brutish nature could be roused to fear did what she knew what she dared she raised the little wounded naked creature and carried her to her own pallet bed restored her to consciousness by such rude means as she had knowledge of and stanched the flow of blood she did all this harshly as it was her custom to do all things and without tenderness or even pity for the sight of this stranger was unwelcome to her and she also had guessed the message of that unread letter the child had been stunned by the blow and she had lost some blood and was weakened and stupefied and dazed yet there seemed to her rough nurse no peril for her life and by degrees she fell into a feverish tossing slumber sobbing sometimes in her sleep and crying perpetually on the unknown name of phratos the old woman pitchou stood and looked at her she who had always known the true story of that disappearance which some had called death and some had deemed a divine interposition had seen before that transparent brown skin those hues in cheeks and lips like the carnation leaves that rich sunfed dusky beauty those straight dark brows she is his sure enough she muttered he was the first with reine flamma i wonder has he been the last and she went down the stairs chuckling as the low human brute will at any evil thought the mastiff stayed beside the child she went to the fire and threw more wood on and sat down again to her spinningwheel and span and dozed and span and dozed again she was not curious to her possessing that thread to the secret of the past which her master and her townfolk had never held it all seemed natural it was an old old story there had been thousands like it it was only strange because reine flamma had been held a saint the hours passed on the lamp paled and its flame at last died out in the loft above where the dog watched there was no sound the old woman slumbered undisturbed unless some falling ember of the wood aroused her she was not curious nor did she care how the child fared she had led that deadening life of perpetual labor and of perpetual want in which the human animal becomes either a machine or a devil she was a machine put to what use she might beto spin flax to card wool to wring a pigeons throat to bleed a calf to death to bake or stew to mumble a prayer or drown a kitten it was all one to her if she had a preference it might be for the office that hurt some living thing but she did not care all she heeded was whether she had pottage enough to eat at noonday and the leaden effigy of her mary safe around her throat at night the night went on and passed away one gleam of dawn shone through a round hole in the shutter she wakened with a start to find the sun arisen and the fire dead upon the hearth she shook herself and stamped her chill feet upon the bricks and tottered on her feeble way with frozen body to the housedoor she drew it slowly open and saw by the light of the sun that it had been for some time morning the earth was everywhere thick with snow a hoar frost sparkled over all the branches great sheets of ice were whirled down the rapid millstream in one of the leafless boughs a robin sang and beneath the bough a cat was crouched waiting with hungry eager eyes patient even in its famished impatience dull as her sympathy was and slow her mind she started as she saw her master there claudis flamma was at work the rough hard rude toil which he spared to himself no more than to those who were his hirelings he was carting wood going to and fro with huge limbs of trees that men in youth would have found it a severe task to move he was laboring breathlessly giving himself no pause and the sweat was on his brow although he trod ankle deep in snow and although his clothes were heavy with icicles he did not see or hear her she went up to him and called him by his name he started and raised his head and looked at her dull though she was she was in a manner frightened by the change upon his face it had been lean furrowed weatherbeaten always but it was livid now with bloodshot eyes and a bruised broken yet withal savage look that terrified her he did not speak but gazed at her like a man recalled from some drugged sleep back to the deeds and memories of the living world the old woman held her peace a few moments then spoke out in her old blunt dogged fashion is she to stay her mind was not awake enough for any curiosity she only cared to know if the child stayed only so much as would concern her soupkettle her kneaded dough her spun hemp her household labor he turned for a second with the gesture that a trapped fox may make held fast yet striving to essay a deathgrip then he checked himself and gave a mute sign of assent and heaved up a fresh log of wood and went on with his labors silently she knew of old his ways too well to venture to ask more she knew too that when he worked like this fasting and in silence there had been long and fierce warfare in his soul and some great evil done for which he sought to make atonement so she left him and passed in to the house and built up afresh her fire and swept her chamber out and fastened up her round black pot to boil and muttered all the while another mouth to feed another beast to tend and the thing was bitter to her because it gave trouble and took food now what the letter had been or who had deciphered it for him claudis flamma never told to any man and from the little strange creature no utterance could be ever got but the child who had come in the night and the snow tarried at ypres from that time thenceforward claudis flamma nourished sheltered clothed her but he did all these begrudgingly harshly scantily and he did all these with an acrid hate and scorn which did not cease but rather grew with time the blow which had been her earliest welcome was not the last that she received from him by many and whilst she was miserable exceedingly she showed it not as children do but rather like some chained and untamed animal in tearless stupor and in sudden sharp ferocity and this the more because she spoke but a very few words of the language of the people among whom she had been brought her own tongue was one full of round vowels and strange sounds a tongue unknown to them for many weeks he said not one word to her cast not one look at her he let her lead the same life that was led by the brutes that crawled in the timbers or by the pigs that couched and were kicked in the straw the woman pitchou gave her such poor scraps of garments or of victuals as she chose she could crouch in the corner of the hearth where the fire warmth reached she could sleep in the hay in the little loft under the roof so much she could do and no more after that first moment in which her vague appeal for pity and for rest had been answered by the blow that struck her senseless the child had never made a moan nor sought for any solace all the winter through she lay curled up on the tiles by the fence with her arms round the great body of the dog and his head upon her chest they were both starved beaten kicked and scourged with brutal words oftentimes they had the community of misfortune and they loved one another the blow on her head the coldness of the season the scanty food that was cast to her all united to keep her brain stupefied and her body almost motionless she was like a young bear that is motherless wounded frozen famished but which coiled in an almost continual slumber keeps its blood flowing and its limbs alive and like the bear with the spring she awakened when the townsfolk and the peasants came to the mill and first saw this creature there with her wondrous vivid hues and her bronzed halfnaked limbs they regarded her in amazement and asked the miller whence she came he set his teeth and answered ever the woman that bore her was reine flamma the avowal was a penance set to himself but to it he never added more and they feared his bitter temper and his caustic tongue too greatly to press it on him or even to ask him whether his daughter were with the living or the dead with the unfolding of the young leaves and the loosening of the frostbound waters and the unveiling of the violet and the primrose under the shadows of the wood all budding life revives and so did hers for she could escape from the dead cold bitter atmosphere of the silent loveless house where her bread was begrudged and the cudgel was her teacher out into the freshness and the living sunshine of the young blossoming world where the birds and the beasts and tender blue flowers and the curling green boughs were her comrades and where she could stretch her limbs in freedom and coil herself among the branches and steep her limbs in the coolness of waters and bathe her aching feet in the moisture of rainfilled grasses with the spring she arose the true forest animal she was wild fleet incapable of fear sure of foot in unison with all the things of the earth and the air and stirred by them to a strange dumb ignorant passionate gladness she had been scarce seen in the winter with the breaking of the year the people from more distant places who rode their mules down to the mill on their various errands stared at this child and wondered among themselves greatly and at length asked claudis flamma whence she came he answered ever setting hard his teeth the woman that bore her was one accursed whom men deemed a saintreine flamma and he never added more to tell the truth the horrible biting burning loathsome truth was a penance that he had set to himself and from which he never wavered they dared not ask him more for many were his debtors and all feared his scourging tongue but when they went away and gossiped among themselves by the wayside well or under the awnings of the marketstalls they said to one another that it was just as they had thought long ago the creature had been no better than her kind and they had never credited the fable that god had taken her though they had humored the miller because he was aged and in dotage whilst one old woman a withered and witchlike crone who had toiled in from the fishing village with a creel upon her back and the smell of the sea about her rags heard standing in the marketplace and laughed and mocked them these seers who were so wise after the years had gone and when the truth was clear you knew you knew you knew she echoed with a grin upon her face oh yes you were so wise who said seven years through that reine flamma was a saint and taken by the saints into their keeping and who hissed at me for a foulmouthed crone when i said that the devil had more to do with her than the good god and that the blackbrowed gypsy with jewels for eyes in his head like the toad was the only master to whom she gave herself ohhe you were so wise so she mocked them and they were ashamed and held their peace well knowing that indeed no creature among them had ever been esteemed so pure so chaste and so honored of heaven as had been the millers daughter many remembered the gypsy with the jeweled eyes and saw those brilliant fathomless midnight eyes reproduced in the small rich face of the child whom reine flamma as her own father said had borne in shame whilst they had been glorifying her apotheosis and it came to be said as time went on that this unknown stranger had been the fiend himself taking human shape for the destruction of one pure soul and the mocking of all true children of the church legend and tradition still held fast their minds in this remote ancient and priestridden place in their belief the devil was still a living power traversing the earth and air in search of souls and not seldom triumphing of metaphor or myth they were ignorant satan to them was a personality terrific and oftentimes irresistible assuming at will shapes grotesque or awful human or spiritual their forefathers had beheld him why not they so the henhucksters and poulterers the cidermakers and tanners the fisherfolk from the seaboard and the peasant proprietors from the country round came at length in all seriousness to regard the young child at ypres as a devilborn thing she was hellbegotten they would mutter when they saw her and they would cross themselves and avoid her if they could the time had gone by unhappily as they considered when men had been permitted to burn such creatures as this they knew it and were sorry for it the world they thought had been better when jews had blazed like torches and witches had crackled like firewood such treats were forbidden now they knew but many for all that thought within themselves that it was a pity it should be so and that it was mistaken mercy in the age they lived in which forbade the purifying of the earth by fire of such as she in the wintertime when they first saw her unusual floods swept the country and destroyed much of their property in the spring which followed there were mildew and sickness everywhere in the summer there was a long drought and by consequence there came a bad harvest and great suffering and scarcity there were not a few in the district who attributed all these woes to the advent of the child of darkness and who murmured openly in their huts and homesteads that no good would befall them so long as this offspring of hell were suffered in their midst since however the time was past when the broad marketplace could have been filled with a curious breathless eager crowd and the gray cathedral have grown red in the glare of flames fed by a young living body they held their hands from doing her harm and said these things only in their own inglenooks and contented themselves with forbidding their children to consort with her and with drawing their mules to the other side of the road when they met her they did not mean to be cruel they only acted in their own selfdefense and dealt with her as their fellowcountrymen dealt with a cagoteonly hence when with the reviving year the childs dulled brain awakened and all the animal activity in her sprang into vigorous action she found herself shunned marked and glanced at with averted looks of mingled dread and scorn a daughter of the devil she heard again and again muttered as they passed her she grew to take shelter in this repute as in a fortress and to be proud with a savage pride of her imputed origin it made her a little fierce mute fearless reckless alldaring and allenduring animal an animal in her ferocities her mute instincts her supreme patience her physical perfectness of body and of health perfect of shape and hue full of force to resist ignorant either of hope or fear desiring only one thing liberty with no knowledge but with unerring instinct she was at an age when happier creatures have scarce escaped from their mothers arms but she had not even thus early a memory of her mother and she had been shaken off to live or die to fight or famish as a young fox whose dam has been flung to the hounds is driven away to starve in the winter woods or save himself if he have strength by slaughter she was a tame animal only in one thing she took blows uncomplainingly and as though comprehending that they were her inevitable portion the child of the devil they said in a dumb halfunconscious fashion this fiveyearold creature wondered sometimes why the devil had not been good enough to give her a skin that would not feel and veins that would not bleed she had always been beaten ever since her birth she was beaten here she thought it a law of life as other children think it such to have their mothers kiss and their daily food and nightly prayer claudis flamma did after this manner his duty by her she was to him a thing accursed possessed loathsome imbued with evil from her origin but he did what he deemed his duty he clothed her if scantily he fed her if meagerly he lashed her with all the caustic gibes that came naturally to his tongue he set her hard tasks to keep her from idleness he beat her when she did not and not seldom when she did them he dashed holy water on her many times and used a stick to her without mercy after this light he did his duty that he should hate her was to fulfill a duty also in his eyes he had always been told that it was right to abhor the things of darkness and to him she was a thing of utter darkness a thing born of the black ruin of a stainless soul begotten by the pollution and corruption of an infernal tempter he never questioned her as to her pastthat short past like the span of an insects life which yet had sufficed to gift her with passions with instincts with desires even with memoriesin a word with charactera character he could neither change nor break a thing formed already for good or for evil abidingly he never spoke to her except in sharp irony or in curt command he set her hard tasks of bodily labor which she did not dispute but accomplished so far as her small strength lay with a mute dogged patience half ferocity half passiveness in those first winter days of her arrival he called her follefarine taking the most worthless the most useless the most abject the most despised thing he knew in all his daily life from which to name her and the name adhered to her and was the only one by which she was ever known follefarineas one may say the dust in time she grew to believe that it was really hers even as in time she began to forget that strange deep rich tongue in which she had babbled her first words and to know no other tongue than the normanfrench about her yet in her there existed imagination tenderness gratitude and a certain wild and true nobility though the old man flamma would never have looked for them never have believed in them she was devilborn she was of devil nature in his eyes upon his own millditch foul and fetid refuse would sometimes gather and receiving the seed of the lily would give birth to blossoms born stainless out of corruption but the allegory had no meaning for him had any one pointed it out to him he would have taken the speaker into his orchard and said will the crab bear a fruit not bitter will the nightshade give out sweetness and honey foolas the stem so the branch as the sap so the blossom and this fruit of sin and shame was poison in his sight chapter iv the little dim mind of the fiveyearold child was not a blank it was indeed filled to overflowing with pictures that her tongue could not have told of even had she spoken the language of the people amidst whom she had been cast a land altogether unlike that in which she had been set down that bitter night of snow and storm a land noble and wild and full of color broken into vast heights and narrow valleys clothed with green beech woods and with forests of oak and of walnut filled with the noise of torrents leaping from crag to crag and of brown mountainstreams rushing broad and angry through wooded ravines a land made beautiful by mossgrown watermills and lofty gateways of gray rock and still shadowy pools in which the bright fish leaped and mules bells that rang drowsily through leafy gorges and limestone crags that pierced the clouds spirelike and fantastic in a thousand shapes and high blue crests of snowtopped mountains whose pinnacles glowed to the divinest flush of rose and amber with the setting of the sun this land she remembered vaguely yet gloriously as the splendors of a dream of paradise rest on the brain of some young sleeper wakening in squalor cold and pain but the people of the place she had been brought to could not comprehend her few shy sullen words and her strange imperfect trills of song and she could not tell them that this land had been no realm enchanted of fairy or of fiend but only the forest region of the liebana thither one rich autumn day a tribe of gypsies had made their camp they were a score in all they held themselves one of the noblest branches of their wide family they were people with pure eastern blood in them and all the grace and the gravity of the oriental in their forms and postures they stole horses and sheep they harried cattle they stopped the mules in the passes and lightened their load of wineskins they entered the posada when they deigned to enter one at all with neither civil question nor show of purse but with a gleam of the teeth like a threatening dog and the flash of the knife half drawn out of the girdle they were low thieves and mean liars wild daredevils and loose livers loathers of labor and lovers of idle days and plundering nights yet they were beautiful with the noble calm scornful beauty of the east and they wore their rags with an air that was in itself an empire they could play too in heavenly fashion on their old threestringed viols and when their women danced on the sward by moonlight under the broken shadows of some moorish ruin clanging high their tambourines above their graceful heads and tossing the shining sequins that bound their heavy hair the muleteer or the herdsman seeing them from afar shook with fear and thought of the tales told him in his childhood by his grandam of the spirits of the dead moors that rose to revelry at midnight in the haunts of their old lost kingdom among them was a man yet more handsome than the rest taller and lither still wondrous at leaping and wrestling and all athletic things surest of any to win a woman to tame a horse to strike down a bull at a blow to silence an angry group at a wineshop with a single glance of his terrible eyes his name was taric he had left them often to wander by himself into many countries and at times when by talent or by terrorism he had netted gold enough to play the fool to his fancy he had gone to some strange city where credulity and luxury prevailed and there had lived like a prince as his own phrase ran and gamed and intrigued and feasted and roystered right royally whilst his gains lasted those spent he would always return awhile and lead the common roving thieving life of his friends and brethren till the fit of ambition or the run of luck were again on him then his people would afresh lose sight of him to light on him velvetclad and winebibbing in some painters den in some foreign town or welcome him ragged famished and footweary on their own sunburnt sierras and the mystery of his ways endeared him to them and they made him welcome whenever he returned and never quarreled with him for his faithlessness but if there were anything wilder or wickeder bolder or keener on hand than was usual his tribe would always saylet taric lead one day their camp was made in a gorge under the great shadows of the picos da europa a place that they loved much and settled in often finding the chestnut woods and the cliff caverns fair for shelter the heather abounding in grouse and the pools full of trout fair for feeding that day taric returned from a yearlong absence suddenly standing dark and mighty between them and the light as they lay around their soupkettle awaiting their evening meal there is a woman in labor a league back by the great corktree against the bridge he said to them go to her some of you and with a look to the women which singled out two for the errand he stretched himself in the warmth of the fire and helped himself to the soup and lay quiet vouchsafing them never a word but playing meaningly with the knife handle thrust into his shirt for he saw that some of the men were about to oppose his share of a common meal which he had not earned by a common right it was tarica name of some terror came to their fierce souls taric the strongest and fleetest and most well favored of them all taric who had slain the bull that all the matadors had failed to daunt taric who had torn up the young elm when they needed a bridge over a flood as easily as a child plucks up a reed taric who had stopped the fiercest contrabandista in all those parts and cut the mans throat with no more ado than a butcher slits a lambs so they were silent and let him take his portion of the fire and of the broth and of the thin red wine meanwhile the two gypsies quita and zara went on their quest and found things as he had said under the great corktree where the grass was long and damp and the wood grew thickly and an old rude bridge of unhewn blocks of rock spanned with one arch the river as it rushed downward from its limestone bed aloft they found a woman just dead and a child just born quita looked the woman all over hastily to see if by any chance any gold or jewels might be on her there were none there was only an ivory cross on her chest which quita drew off and hid quita covered her with a few boughs and left her zara wrapped the child in a bit of her woolen skirt and held it warm in her breast and hastened to the camp with it she is dead taric said quita meaning the woman she had left he nodded his handsome head this is yours taric said zara meaning the child she held he nodded again and drank another drop of wine and stretched himself what shall we do with her asked quita let her lie there he answered her what shall we do with it asked zara he laughed and drew his knife against his own brown throat in a significant gesture zara said no word to him but she went away with the child under some branches on which was hung a tattered piece of awning orange striped that marked her own especial restingplace out of the group about the fire one man rising advanced and looked taric full in the eyes has the woman died by foul means taric who never let any living soul molest or menace him answered him without offense and with a savage candor nothat i swear i used no foul play against her go look at her if you like i loved her well enough while she lived but what does that matter she is dead so best women are as many as the mulberries you loved her and you will let the wolves eat her body taric laughed there are no wolves in liebana go and bury her if you choose phratos i will the other answered him and he took his way to the corktree by the bridge the man who spoke was called phratos he was not like his tribe in anything except in a mutual love for a life that wandered always and was to no man responsible and needed no rooftree and wanted no settled habitation but preferred to dwell wild with the roe and the cony and to be hungry and unclad rather than to eat the good things of the earth in submission and in durance he had not their physical perfection an accident at his birth had made his spine misshapen and his gait halting his features would have been grotesque in their ugliness except for the sweet pathos of the eyes and the gay archness of the mouth among a race noted for its singular beauty of face and form phratos alone was deformed and unlovely and yet both deformity and unloveliness were in a way poetic and uncommon and in his rough sheepskin garments knotted to his waist with a leathern thong and with his thick tangled hair falling down on his shoulders they were rather the deformity of the brakehaunting faun the unloveliness of the moondancing satyr than those of a man and a vagrant with the likeness he had the temper of the old dead gods of the forests and rivers he loved music and could make it in all its innumerable sighs and songs give a voice to all creatures and things of the world of the waters and the woodlands and for many things he was sorrowful continually and for other things he forever laughed and was glad though he was misshapen and even as some said not altogether straight in his wits yet his kin honored him for he could draw music from the rude strings of his old viol that surpassed their own melodies as far as the shining of the sun on the summits of the europa surpassed the trembling of the little lamps under the painted roadside cavaries he was only a gypsy he only played as the fancy moved him by a bright fountain at a noonday halt under the ruined arches of a saracenic temple before the tawny gleam of a vast dim plain at sunrise in a cool shadowy court where the vines shut out all light beneath a balcony at night when the moonbeams gleamed on some fair unknown face thrust for a moment from the darkness through the white magnolia flowers yet he played in suchwise as makes women weep and holds children and dogs still to listen and moves grown men to shade their eyes with their hands and think of old dead times when they played and prayed at their mothers knees and his music had so spoken to himself that although true to his tribe and all their traditions loving the vagrant life in the open air and being incapable of pursuing any other he yet neither stole nor slew neither tricked nor lied but found his way vaguely to honesty and candor and having found them clove to them so that none could turn him living on such scant gains as were thrown to him for his music from balconies and posada windows and winehouse doors in the hamlets and towns through which he passed and making a handful of pulse and a slice of melon a couch of leaves and a draught of water suffice to him for his few and simple wants his people reproached him indeed with demeaning their race by taking payment in lieu of making thefts and they mocked him often and taunted him though in a manner they all loved himthe reckless and bloodstained taric most perhaps of all but he would never quarrel with them neither would he give over his strange ways which so incensed them and with time they saw that phratos was a gifted fool who like other mad simple creatures had best be left to go on his own way unmolested and without contradiction if too they had driven him from their midst they would have missed his music sorely that music which awoke them at break of day soaring up through their roof of chestnut leaves like a larks song piercing the skies phratos came now to the dead woman and drew off the boughs and looked at her she was quite dead she had died where she had first sunk down unable to reach her promised restingplace it was a damp green nook on the edge of the bright mountainriver at the entrance of that narrow gorge in which the encampment had been made the face which was white and young lay upward with the shadows of the flickering foliage on it and the eyes which quita had not closed were large and blue her hair which was long and brown was loose and had got wet among the grass and had little buds of flowers and stray golden leaves twisted in it phratos felt sorrow for her as he looked he could imagine her history taric whom many women had loved had besought many a one thus to share his fierce free life for a little space and then drift away out of it by chance or be driven away from it by his fickle passions or be taken away like this one by death in her bosom slipped in her clothes was a letter it was written in a tongue he did not know he held it awhile thinking then he folded it up and put it in his girdleit might be of use who could tell there was the child there that might live unless the camp broke up and zara left it under a walnuttree to die with the last butterflies of the fading summer which was in all likelihood all she would do nevertheless he kept the letter and when he had looked long enough at the dead creature he turned to the tools he had brought with him and set patiently to make her grave he could only work slowly for he was weak of body and his infirmity made all manual toil painful to him his task was hard even though the earth was so soft from recent heavy rains the sun set whilst he was still engaged on it and it was quite nightfall before he had fully accomplished it when the grave was ready he filled it carefully with the golden leaves that had fallen and the thick manycolored mosses that covered the ground like a carpet then he laid the body tenderly down within that forest shroud and with the moss like a windingsheet between it and the earth which had to fall on it he committed the dead woman to her restingplace it did not seem strange to him or awful to leave her there he was a gypsy and to him the grave under a foresttree and by a mountainstream seemed the most natural rest at last that any creature could desire or claim no rites seemed needful to him and no sense of any neglect cruel or unfitting jarred on him in thus leaving her in her loneliness with only the cry of the bittern or the bell of the wild roe as a requiem yet a certain sorrow for this unknown and lost life was on him bohemian though he was as he took up his mattock and turned away and went backward down the gorge and left her to lie there forever through rain and sunshine through wind and storm through the calm of the summer and the flush of the autumn and the wildness of the winter when the swollen stream should sweep above her tomb and the famished beasts of the hills would lift up their voices around it when he reached the camp he gave the letter to taric taric knowing the tongue it was written in and being able to understand the character looked at it and read it through by the light of the flaming wood when he had done so he tossed it behind in among the boughs in scorn the poor fools prayer to the brute that she hated he said with a scoff phratos lifted up the letter and kept it in a later time he found some one who could decipher it for him it was the letter of reine flamma to the miller at ypres telling him the brief story of her fatal passion and imploring from him mercy to her unborn child should it survive her and be ever taken to him remorse and absence had softened to her the harshness and the meanness of her fathers character she only remembered that he had loved her and had deemed her pure and faithful as the saints of god there was no word in the appeal by which it could have been inferred that claudis flamma had been other than a man much wronged and loving much patient of heart and without blame in his simple life phratos took the letter and cherished it he thought it might some day save her offspring this old mans vengeance could not he thought be so cruel to the child as might be the curse and the knife of taric she must have been beautiful said phratos to him after awhile that night and you care no more for her than that taric stretched his mighty limbs in the warmth of the flame and made his answer there will be as good grapes on the vines next year as any we gathered this what does it signifyshe was only a woman she loved me she thought me a god a devil a prince a chiefall manner of thingsthe people thought so too she was sick of her life she was sick of the priests and the beads and the mill and the market she was fair to look at and the fools called her a saint when a woman is young and has beauty it is dull to be worshipedin that way i met her in the wood one summer night the sun was setting i do not know why i cared for heri did she was like a tall white lily these women of ours are only great tawny sunflowers she was pure and straight of life she believed in heaven and hell she was innocent as the child unborn it was tempting to kill all that it is so easy to kill it when a woman loves you i taught her what passion and freedom and pleasure and torment all meant she came with meafter a struggle a hard one i kept her loyally while the gold lasted that i swear i took her to many cities i let her have jewels and music and silk dresses and fine linen i was good to her that i swear but after a bit she pined and grew dull again and wept in secret and at times i caught her praying to the white cross which she wore on her breast that made me mad i cursed her and beat her she never said anything she seemed only to love me more and that made me more mad then i got poor again and i had to sell her things one by one not that she minded that she would have sold her soul for me we wandered north and south and i made money sometimes by the dice or by breaking a horse or by fooling a woman or by snatching a jewel off one of their dolls in their churches and i wanted to get rid of her and i could not tell how i had not the heart to kill her outright but she never said a rough word you know and that makes a man mad maddalena or kara or rachelany of themwould have flown and struck a knife at me and hissed like a snake and there would have been blows and furious words and bloodshed and then we should have kissed and been lovers again fast and fierce but a woman who is quiet and only looks at you with great sad soft eyes when you strike herwhat is one to do we were horribly poor at last we slept in barns and haylofts we ate berries and drank the brookwater she grew weak and could hardly walk many a time i have been tempted to let her lie and die in the hedgeway or on the plains and i did notone is so foolish sometimes for sake of a woman she knew she was a burden and curse to mei may have said so perhaps i do not remember at last i heard of you in the liebana from a tribe we fell in with on the other side of the mountains and so we traveled here on foot i thought she would have got to the women before her hour arrived but she fell down there and could not stir and so the end came it is best as it is she was wretched and what could i do with a woman like that who would never hearken to another lover nor give up her dead god on his cross nor take so much as a broken crust if it were stolen nor even show her beauty to a sculptor to be carved in stonefor i tried to make her do that and she would not it is best as it is if she had lived we could have done nothing with her and yet i see her sometimes as i saw her that night so white and so calm in the little green wood as the sun set his voice ceased and he took up a horn full of vino clarete and drained it and was very still stretching his limbs to bask in the heat of the fire the wine had loosened his tongue and he had spoken from his hearttruthfully phratos his only hearer was silent he was thinking of the great blue sightless eyes that he had closed and of the loose brown hair on which he had flung the wet leaves and the earthclogged mosses the child lives he said at length taric who was sinking to sleep after the long fatigues of a heavy tramp through mountainpasses stirred sullenly with an oath let it go to hell he made answer and these were the only words of baptism that were spoken over the nameless daughter of taric the gypsy and of reine flamma that night phratos called out to him in the moonlight the woman zara who came from under her tent and stood under the glistening leaves strong and handsome with shining eyes and snowy teeth the child lives still he asked zara nodded her head you will try and keep it alive he pursued she shrugged her shoulders what is the use taric would rather it were dead what matter what taric wishes living or dead it will not hinder him a child more or less with us what is it only a draught of goats milk or a handful of meal so little it cannot be felt you have a child of your own zara you cared for it yes she answered with a sudden softening gleam of her bright savage eyes she had a brown strong yearold boy who kicked his naked limbs on the sward with joy at phratoss music then have pity on this motherless creature said phratos wooingly i buried that dead woman and her eyes though there was no sight in them still seemed to pray to mineand to pray for her child be merciful zara let the child have the warmth of your arms and the defense of your strength be merciful zara and your seed shall multiply and increase tenfold and shall be stately and strong and shall spread as the branches of the planetrees on which the storm spends its fury in vain and beneath which all things of the earth can find refuge for never was a womans pity fruitless nor the fair deeds of her days without recompense zara listened quietly as the dreamy poetic persuasive words stole on her ear like music like the rest of her people she half believed in him as a seer and prophet her teeth shone out in a soft sudden smile you are always a fool phratos she said but it shall be as you fancy and she went in out of the moonlit leaves and the clear cool autumn night into the little dark stifling tent where the newborn child had been laid away in a corner upon a roughandready bed of gathered dusky firneedles it is a little cub not worth the saving and its dam was not of our people she said to herself as she lifted the wailing and alien creature to her bosom it is for you my angel that i do it she murmured looking at the sleeping face of her own son outside the tent the sweet strains of phratoss music rose sighing and soft and mingling as sounds mingle in a dream with the murmurs of the forest leaves and the rushing of the mountainriver he gave her the only payment in his power zara hushing the strange child at her breast listened and was half touched half angered why should he play for this little stray thing when he never played once for you my glory she said to her son as she put the dead womans child roughly away and took him up in its stead to beat together in play his rosy hands and cover his mouth with kisses for even from these the worlds outcasts this new life of a few hours span was rejected as unworthy and despised nevertheless the music played on through the still forest night and nevertheless the child grew and throve the tribe of taric abode in the liebana or in the adjacent country along the banks of the deva during the space of four years and more scarcely losing in that time the sight either from near or far of the rosy peaks of the europa he did not abide with them he quarreled with them violently concerning some division of a capture of wineskins and went on his own way to distant provinces and cities to the gambling and roystering the womanfooling and the bullfighting that this soul lusted after always his daughter he left to dwell in the tent of zara and under the defense of phratos once or twice in sojourns of a night or two among his own people as the young creature grew in stature and strength taric had glanced at her and called her to him and felt the litheness of her limbs and the weight of her hair and laughed as he thrust her from him thinking in time to come shewho would know nothing of her mothers dead god on the cross and of her mothers idle weak scruplesmight bring him a fair provision in his years of age when his hand should have lost its weight against men and his form its goodliness in the sight of women once or twice he had given her a kick of his foot or blow with his leathern whip when she crawled in the grass too near his path or lay asleep in the sun as he chanced to pass by her otherwise he had naught to do with her absent or present otherwise he left her to chance and the devil who were as he said according to the christians the natural patrons and sponsors of all lovechildren chance and the devil however had not wholly their way in the liebana for besides them there was phratos phratos never abandoned her under the wolfskin and pineboughs of zaras tent there was misery very often zara had a fresh son born to her with each succeeding year and having a besotted love for her own offspring had little but indifference and blows for the stranger who shared their bed and food her children brown and curly naked and strong fought one another like panther cubs and rode in a cluster like red mountainash berries in the sheepskin round her waist and drank by turns out of the pitcher of broth and slept all together on dry ferns and mosses rolled in warm balls one in another like young bears but the child who had no affinity with them who was not even wholly of their tribe but had in her what they deemed the taint of gentile blood was not allowed to gnaw her bare bone or her ripe fig in peace if they wished for it was never carried with them in the sheepskin nest but left to totter after in the dust or mud as best she might was forced to wait for the leavings in the pitcher or go without if leavings there were none and was kicked away by the sturdy limbs of these young males when she tried to creep for warmths sake in among them on their fern bed but she minded all this little since in the liebana there was phratos phratos was always good to her the prayer which those piteous dead eyes had made he always answered he had always pity for the child many a time but for his remembrance she would have starved outright or died of cold in those wild winters when the tribe huddled together in the caverns of the limestone and the snowdrifts were driven up by the northern winds and blocked them there for many days many a time but for his aid she would have dropped on their march and been left to perish as she might on the long sunburnt roads in the arid midsummers when the gypsies plodded on their dusty way through the sinuous windings of hillside paths and along the rough stones of driedup watercourses in gorges and passages known alone to them and the wild deer when her throat was parched with the torment of long thirst it was he who raised her to drink from the rill in the rock high above to which the mothers lifted their eager children leaving her to gasp and gaze unpitied when she was driven away from the noonday meal by the hungry and clamorous youngsters who would admit no share of their partridge broth and stewed lentils it was he who bruised the maize between stones for her eating and gathered for her the wild fruit of the quince and the mulberry when the sons of zara had kicked and bruised and spurned her from the tent he would lead her away to some shadowy place where the leaves grew thickly and play to her such glad and buoyant tunes that the laughter seemed to bubble from the listening brooks and ripple among the swinging boughs and make the wild hare skip with joy and draw the timid lizard from his hole to frolic and when the way was long and the stony paths cruel to her little bare feet he would carry her aloft on his misshapen shoulders where his old viol always traveled and would beguile the steep way with a thousand quaint soft grotesque conceits of all the flowers and leaves and birds and animals talking rather to himself than her yet talking with a tender fancifulness half humor and half pathos that soothed her tired senses like a lullaby hence it came to pass that the sole creature whom she loved and who had pity for her was the uncouth crippled gay sad gentle dauntless creature whom his tribe had always held half wittol and half seer thus the life in the hills of the liebana went on till the child of taric had entered her sixth year she had both beauty and grace she had the old moresco loveliness in its higher type she was fleet as the roe strong as the young izard wild as the woodpartridge on the wing she had grace of limb from the postures and dances with which she taught herself to keep time to the fantastic music of the viol she was shy and sullen fierce and savage to all save himself for the hand of every other was against her but to him she was docile as the dove to the hand that feeds it he had given her a string of bright sequins to hang on her hair and when the peasants of the mountains and valleys saw her by the edge of some green woodland pool whirling by moonlight to the sound of his melodies they took her to be some unearthly spirit and told wonderful things over their garlic of the elf crowned with stars they had seen dancing on a round lotosleaf in the hush of the night in the liebana she was beaten often hungry almost always cursed fiercely driven away by the mothers mocked and flouted by the children and this taught her silence and ferocity yet in the liebana she was happy for one creature loved her and she was freefree to lie in the long grass to bathe in the still pools to watch the wild things of the woods to wander ankledeep in forest blossoms to sleep under the rocking of pines to run against the sweet force of the wind to climb the trees and swing cradled in leaves and to look far away at the snow on the mountains and to dream and to love and to be content in dreaming and loving their mystical glory that awoke with the sun one day in the red autumn taric came he had been wholly absent more than two years he was superb to the sight still with matchless splendor of face and form but his carriage was more reckless and disordered than ever and in his gemlike and nightblack eyes there was a look of cunning and of subtle ferocity new to them his life had gone hardly with him and to the indolence the passions the rapacity the slothful sensuality of the gypsywho had retained all the vices of his race whilst losing the virtues of simplicity in living and of endurance under hardshipthe gall of a sharp poverty had become unendurable and to live without dice and women and wine and boastful brawling seemed to him to be worse than any death the day he returned they were still camped in the liebana in one of its narrow gorges overhung with a thick growth of trees and coursed through by a headlong hillstream that spread itself into darkling breadths and leafy pools in which the fish were astir under great snowy lilies and a tangled web of waterplants he strode into the midst of them as they sat round their campfire lit beneath a shelf of rock as his wont was and was welcomed and fed and plied with such as they had with that mixture of sullen respect and incurable attachment which his tribe preserved through all their quarrels for this the finest and the fiercest the most fickle and the most faithless of them all he gorged himself and drank and said little when the meal was done the young of the tribe scattered themselves in the red evening light under the great walnuts some at feud some at play which is mine he asked surveying the children they showed her to him the sequins were round her head she swung on a bough of ash the pool beneath mirrored her she was singing as children sing without words yet musically and gladly catching at the fireflies that danced above her in the leaves can she dance he asked lazily of them in her own fashionas a flower in the wind phratos answered him with a smile and willing to woo for her the good graces of her father he slung his viol off his shoulders and tuned it and beckoned the child she came knowing nothing who taric was he was only to her a fierceeyed man like the rest who would beat her most likely if she stood between him and the sun or overturned by mischance his horn of liquor phratos played and all the gypsy children as their wont was danced but she danced all alone and with a grace and a fire that surpassed theirs she was only a baby still she had only her quick ear to guide her and her only teacher was such inborn instinct as makes the birds sing and the young kids gambol yet she danced with a wondrous subtlety and intensity of ardor beyond her years her small brown limbs glancing like bronze in the fireglow the sequins flashing in her flying hair and her form flung high in air like a bird on the wing or a leaf on the wind never still never ceasing to dart and to leap and to whirl and to sway yet always with a sweet dreamy indolence even in her fiery unrest taric watched her under his bent brow until the music ceased and she dropped on the grass spent and panting like a swallow after a long ocean flight she will do he muttered what is it you mean with the child some women asked taric laughed the little vermin is good for a gold piece or two he answered phratos said nothing but he heard after awhile the camp was still the gypsies slept two or three of their men went out to try and harry cattle by the light of the moon if they should be in luck two others went forth to set snares for the wood partridges and rabbits the rest slumbered soundly the dogs curled to a watching sleep of vigilant guard in their midst taric alone sat by the dying fire when all was very quiet and the stars were clear in midnight skies the woman zara stole out of her tent to him you signed to me she said to him in a low voice you want the child killed taric showed his white teeth like a wolf not i what should i gain what is it you want then with her i mean to take her that is all see herea month ago on the other side of the mountains i met a fantoccini player it was at a wineshop hard by luzarches he had a womanchild with him who danced to his music and whom the people praised for her beauty and who anticked like a dancingdog and who made a great deal of silver we got friends he and i at the weeks end the brat died some sickness of the throat they said her master tore his hair and raved the little wretch was worth handfuls of coin to him for such another he would give twelve gold pieces he shall have her she will dance for him and me there is plenty to be made in that way the women are fools over a handsome child they open their larders and their purses i shall take her away before sunrise he says he teaches them in seven days by starving and giving the stick she will dance while she is a child later onthere are the theaters she will be strong and handsome and in the great cities now a womans comeliness is as a mine of gold ore i shall take her away by sunrise to sell her the hard fierce heart of zara rebelled against him she had no tenderness save for her own offspring and she had maltreated the stray child many a time yet the proud liberty and the savage chastity of her race were roused against him by his words taric laughed again surely why not i will make a dancingdog of her for the peasants pastime and in time she will make dancingdogs of the nobles and the princes for her own sport it is a brave lifenone better the gypsy woman stood astonished and irresolute if he had flung his child in the river or thrown her off a rock he would have less offended the instincts and prejudices of her clan what will phratos say she asked at length phratos a rotten fig for phratos what can he sayor do the little beast is mine i can wring its neck if i choose and if it refuse to pipe when we play for it i will the woman sought in vain to dissuade him he was inflexible she left him at last telling herself that it was no business of hers he had a right to do what he chose with his own so went and lay down among her brownfaced boys and was indifferent and slept taric likewise slept upon a pile of moss under the ledge of the rock lulled by the heat of the fire which ere lying down he had fed with fresh boughs of resinous wood when all was quite still and his deep quiet breathing told that his slumber was one not easily broken a man softly rose from the ground and threw off a mass of dead leaves that had covered him and stood erect a dark strange misshapen figure in the moonlight it was phratos he had heard and understood all that taric meant for the present and the future of the child and he knew that when taric vowed to do a thing for his own gain it were easier to uproot the chain of the europa than to turn him aside from his purpose it was my doing said phratos to himself bitterly as he stood there and his heart was sick and sore in him as with selfreproach for a crime he thought awhile standing still in the hush of the midnight then he went softly with a footfall that did not waken a dog and lifted up the skins of zaras tent as they hung over the firpoles the moonbeams slanting through the foliage strayed in and showed him the woman sleeping among her rosy robust children like a mastiff with her litter of tawny pups and away from them on the bare ground closer to the entrance the slumbering form of the young daughter of taric she woke as he touched her opening bright bewildered eyes hush it is i phratos he murmured over her and the stifled cry died on her lips he lifted her up in his arms and left the tent with her and dropped the curtain of sheepskin and went out into the clear crisp autumn night her eyes had closed again and her head had sunk on his shoulder heavy with sleep she had not tried to keep awake one moment after knowing that it was phratos who had come for her she loved him and in his hold feared nothing taric lay on the ledge of the rock deaf with the torpor of a halfdrunken slumber dreaming gloomily his hand playing in his dreams with the knife that was thrust in his waistband phratos stepped gently past him and through the outstretched forms of the dogs and men and across the diedout embers of the fire over which the emptied soupkettle still swung as the nightbreeze blew to and fro its chain no one heard him he went out from their circle and down the path of the gorge in silence carrying the child she was folded in a piece of sheepskin and in her hair there were still the sequins they glittered in the white light as he went as the wind blew it touched the chords of the viol on his shoulder and struck a faint musical sighing sound from them is it morning the child murmured half asleep no dear it is night he answered her and she was content and slept againthe strings of the viol sending a soft whisper in her drowsy ear each time that the breeze arose and swept across them when the morning came it found him far on his road leaving behind him the liebana there followed a bright month of autumn weather the child was happy as she had never been they moved on continually through the plains and the fields the hills and the woods the hamlets and the cities but she and the viol were never weary they rode aloft whilst he toiled on yet neither was he weary for the viol murmured in the wind and the child laughed in the sunshine chapter v it was late in the year the earth and sky were a blaze of russet and purple and scarlet and gold the air was keen and swift and strong like wine a summer fragrance blended with a winter frost the grape harvest had been gathered in and had been plentiful and the people were liberal and of good humor sometimes before a wineshop or beneath a balcony or in a broad marketsquare at evening phratos played and the silver and copper coins were dropped fast to him when he had enough by him to get a crust for himself and milk and fruit for her he did not pause to play but moved on resolutely all the day resting at night only he bought her a little garment of red foxes furs her head and her feet were bare she bathed in clear running waters and slept in a nest of hay she saw vast towers and wondrous spires and strange piles of wood and stone and rivers spanned by arches and great forests half leafless and plains red in stormy sunset light and towns that lay hid in soft gold mists of vapor and saw all these as in a dream herself borne high in air wrapped warm in fur and lulled by the sweet familiar fraternity of the old viol she asked no questions she was content like a mole or a dormouse she was not beaten or mocked she was never hungry nor cold no one cursed her and she was with phratos it takes time to go on foot across a great country and phratos was nearly always on foot now and then he gave a coin or two or a tune or two for a lift on some strawladen wagon or some mulecart full of pottery or of vegetables that was crawling on its slow way through the plains of the marshy lands or the poplarlined leagues of the public highways but as a rule he plodded on by himself shunning the people of his own race and shunned in return by the ordinary populace of the places through which he traveled for they knew him to be a spanish gypsy by his skin and his garb and his language and by the starryeyed arabfaced child who ran by his side in her red fur and her flashing sequins there is a curse written against all honest folk on every one of those shaking coins the peasants muttered as she passed them she did not comprehend their sayings for she knew none but her gypsy tongue and that only very imperfectly but she knew by their glance that they meant that she was something evil and she gripped tighter phratoss handhalf terrified half triumphant the weather grew colder and the ground harder the golden and scarlet glories of the south and of the west their red leafage and purple flowers gorgeous sunsets and leaping waters gave place to the level pastures pale skies leafless woods and dim gray tints of the northerly lands the frosts became sharp and mists that came from unseen seas enveloped them there were marvelous old towns cathedral spires that arose ethereal as vapor still dusky cities aged with many centuries that seemed to sleep eternally in the watery halo of the fog green cultivated hills from whose smooth brows the earthtouching clouds seemed never to lift themselves straight sluggish streams that flowed with leisurely laziness through broad flat meadowlands white with snow and obscure with vapor these were for what they exchanged the pomp of dying foliage the glory of crimson fruits the fierce rush of the mistral the odors of the nowelborn violets the fantastic shapes of the aloes and olives raising their dark spears and their silvery network against the amber fires of a winter dawn in the rich southwest the child was chilled oppressed vaguely awestruck and disquieted but she said nothing phratos was there and the viol she missed the red forests and the leaping torrents and the prickly fruits and the smell of the violets and the vineyards and the wild shapes of the cactus and the old myrtles that were hoary and contorted with age but she did not complain nor ask any questions she had supreme faith in phratos one night at the close of a black day in midwinter the sharpest and hardest in cold that they had ever encountered they passed through a little town whose roadways were mostly canals and whose spires and roofs and pinnacles and turrets and towers were all beautiful with the poetry and the majesty of a longperished age the day had been bitter there was snow everywhere great blocks of ice choked up the water the belfry chimes rang shrilly through the rarefied air the few folks that were astir were wrapped in wool or sheepskin through the casements there glowed the ruddy flush of burning logs and the muffled watchmen passing to and fro in antique custom on their rounds called out under the closed houses that it was eight of the night in a heavy snowstorm phratos paused in the town at an old hostelry to give the child a hot drink of milk and a roll of rye bread there he asked the way to the wood and the mill of ypres they told it him sullenly and suspiciously since for a wild gypsy of spain the shrewd thrifty plain people of the north had no liking he thanked them and went on his way out of the barriers of the little town along a road by the river towards the country art thou cold dear he asked her with more tenderness than common in his voice the child shivered under her little furskin which would not keep out the searching of the hurricane and the driving of the snowflakes but she drew her breath quickly and answered him no they came to a little wood leafless and black in the gloomy night a dead crow swung in their faces on a swaying peartree the roar of the millstream loudly filled what otherwise would have been an intense silence he made his way in by a little wicket through an orchard and through a garden and so to the front of the millhouse the shutters were not closed through the driving of the snow he could see within it looked to hima houseless wanderer from his youth upstrangely warm and safe and still an old man sat on one side of the wide hearth an old woman who span on the other the spinningwheel turned the thread flew the logs smoked and flamed the red glow played on the blue and white tiles of the chimneyplace and danced on the pewter and brass on the shelves from the rafters there hung smoked meats and dried herbs and strings of onions there was a crucifix and below it a little nativity in wax and carved wood he could not tell that the goodly stores were only gathered there to be sold later at famine prices to a starving peasantry he could not tell that the wooden god was only worshiped in a blind bigoted brutal selfishness that desired to save its own soul and to leave all other souls in eternal damnation he could not tell he only saw old age and warmth and comfort and what the people who hooted him as a heathen called the religion of love they will surely be good to her he thought old people and prosperous and alone by their fireside it seemed that they must be so anyway there was no other means to save her from taric his heart was sore within him for he had grown to love the child and to the vagrant instincts of his race the life of the house and of the hearth seemed like the life of the cage for the bird yet phratos who was not altogether as his own people were but had thought much and often in his own wild way knew that such a life was the best for a womanchildand above all for a womanchild who had such a sire as taric to keep her with himself was impossible he had always dwelt with his tribe having no life apart from theirs and even if he had left them wherever he had wandered there would taric have followed and found him and claimed the child by his right of blood there was no other way to secure her from present misery and future shame save only this to place her with her mothers people she stood beside him still and silent gazing through the snowflakes at the warmth of the millkitchen within he stooped over her and pushed between her fur garment and her skin the letter he had found on the breast of the dead woman in the liebana thou wilt go in there to the old man yonder and sleep by that pleasant fire tonight he murmured to her and thou wilt be good and gentle and even as thou art to me always and tomorrow at noontide i will come and see how it fares with thee her small hands tightened upon his i will not go without thee she muttered in the broken tongue of the gypsy children there were food and milk fire and shelter safety from the night and the storm there she saw but these were naught to her without phratos she struggled against her fate as the young bird struggles against being thrust into the cagenot knowing what captivity means and yet afraid of it and rebelling by instinct he took her up in his arms and pressed her close to him and for the first time kissed her for phratos though tender to her had no womans foolishness but had taught her to be hardy and strong and to look for neither caresses nor compassionknowing well that to the lovechild of taric in her future years the first could only mean shame and the last could only mean alms which would be shame likewise go dear he said softly to her and then he struck with his staff on the wooden door and lifting its latch unclosed it and thrust the child forward ere she could resist into the darkness of the low entranceplace then he turned and went swiftly himself through the orchard and wood into the gloom and the storm of the night he knew that to show himself to a northern householder were to do her evil and hurt for between the wanderer of the spanish forests and the peasant of the norman pastures there could be only defiance mistrust and disdain i will see how it is with her tomorrow he said to himself as he faced again the wind and the sleet if it be well with herlet it be well if not she must come forth with me and we must seek some lair where her wolfsire shall not prowl and discover her but it will be hard to find for the vengeance of taric is swift of foot and has a farstretching hand and eyes that are sleepless and his heart was heavy in him as he went he had done what seemed to him just and due to the child and her mother he had been true to the vow he had made answering the mute prayer of the sightless dead eyes he had saved the flesh of the child from the whip of the trainer and the future of the child from the shame of the brothel he had done thus much in saving her from her father and he had done it in the only way that was possible to him yet his heart was heavy as he went and it seemed to him even as though he had thrust some mountainbird with pinions that would cleave the clouds and eyes that would seek the sun and a song that would rise with the dawn and a courage that would breast the thunder down into the darkness of a trap to be shorn and crippled and silenced for evermore i will see her tomorrow he told himself restless with a vague remorse as though the good he had done had been evil but when the morrow dawned there had happened that to phratos which forbade him to see whether it were well with her that day or any day in all the many years that came for phratos that night being blinded and shrouded in the storm of snow lost such slender knowledge as he had of that northern country and wandered far afield not knowing where he was in the wide white desert on which no single starray shone the violence of the storm grew with the hours the land was a sheet of snow the plains were dim and trackless as a desert sheep were frozen in their folds and cattle drowned amidst the ice in the darkness all lights were out and the warning peals of the bells were drowned in the tempest of the winds the land was strange to him and he lost all knowledge where he was above beneath around were the dense white rolling clouds of snow now and then through the tumult of the hurricane there was blown a strange harsh burst of jangled chimes that wailed a moment loudly on the silence and then died again at many doors he knocked the doors of little lonely places standing in the great colorless waste but each door being opened cautiously was with haste shut in his face again it is a gypsy the people muttered and were afraid and they drew their bars closer and huddled together in their beds and thanked their saints that they were safe beneath a roof he wrapped his sheepskin closer round him and set his face against the blast a hundred times he strove to set his steps backwards to the town and a hundred times he failed and moved only round and round vainly never escaping the maze of the endless white fields now the night was long and he was weakly in the midst of the fields there was a cross and at the head of the cross hung a lantern the wind tossed the light to and fro it flickered on the head of a woman she lay in the snow and her hand grasped his foot as he passed her i am dead she said to him dead of hunger but the lad livessave him and as she spoke her lips closed together her throat rattled and she died the boy slept at her feet and babbled in his sleep delirious phratos stooped down and raised him he was a child of eight years and worn with famine and fever and his gaunt eyes stared hideously up at the driving snow phratos folded him in his arms and went on with him the snow had nearly covered the body of his mother all around were the fields there was no light except from the lantern on the cross a few sheep huddled near without a shepherd the stillness was intense the bells had ceased to ring or he had wandered far from the sound of them the lad was senseless he muttered drearily foolish words of fever his limbs hung in a dead weight his teeth chattered phratos bearing him struggled on the snow was deep and drifted heavily every now and then he stumbled and plunged to his knees in a rift of earth or in a shallow pool of ice at last his strength feeble at all times failed him his arms could bear their burden no longer he let the young boy slip from his hold upon the ground and stood breathless and broken with the snowflakes beating on him the woman trusted me he thought she was a stranger she was a beggar she was dead she had no bond upon him neither could she ever bear witness against him yet he was loyal to her he unwound the sheepskin that he wore and stripped himself of it and folded it about the sick child and with a slow laborious effort drew the little body away under the frail shelter of a knot of furze and wrapped it closely round and left it there it was all that he could do then with no defense between him and the driving cold he strove once more to find his road it was quite dark quite still the snow fell ceaselessly the white wide land was patchless as the sea he stumbled on as a mule may which being blind and bruised yet holds its way from the sheer instinct of its sad dumb patience his veins were frozen his beard was ice the wind cut his flesh like a scourge a sickly dreamy sleepiness stole on him he knew well what it meant he tried to rouse himself he was young and his life had its sweetness and there were faces he would fain have seen again and voices whose laughter he would fain have heard he drew the viol round and touched its strings but his frozen fingers had lost their cunning and the soul of the music was chilled and dumb it only sighed in answer he kissed it softly as he would have kissed a womans lips and put it in his bosom it had all his youth in it then he stumbled onward yet again feebly being a cripple and cold to the bone and pierced with a million thorns of pain there was no light anywhere the endless wilderness of the white plowed lands stretched all around him where the little hamlets clustered the storm hid them no light could penetrate the denseness of that changeless gloom and the only sound that rose upon the ghastly silence was the moaning of some perishing flock locked in a flood of ice and deserted by its shepherd but what he saw and what he heard were not these going barefoot and blindfold to his death the things of his own land were with him the golden glories of sunsets of paradise the scarlet blaze of a wilderness of flowers the sound of the fountains at midnight the glancing of the swift feet in the dances the sweetness of songs sad as death sung in the desolate courts of old palaces the deep dreamy hush of white moons shining through lines of palms straight on a silvery sea these arose and drifted before him and he ceased to suffer or to know and sleep conquered him he dropped down on the white earth noiselessly and powerlessly as a leaf sinks the snow fell and covered him when the morning broke a peasant going to his labor in the fields while the stormy winter sun rose red over the whitened world found both his body and the childs the boy was warm and living still beneath the shelter of the sheepskin phratos was dead the people succored the child and nursed and fed him so that his life was saved but to phratos they only gave such burial as the corby gives the stricken deer it is only a gypsy let him lie they said and they left him there and the snow kept him his viol they robbed him of and cast it as a plaything to their children but the children could make no melody from its dumb strings for the viol was faithful and its music was dead too and his own land and his own people knew him never again and never again at evening was the voice of his viol heard in the stillness and never again did the young men and maidens dance to his bidding and the tears and the laughter rise and fall at his will and the beasts and the birds frisk and sing at his coming and the children in his footsteps cry lo it is summer since phratos is here book ii chapter i the hottest sun of a hot summer shone on a straight white dusty road an old man was breaking stones by the wayside he was very old very bent very lean worn by nigh a hundred years if he had been worn by one but he struck yet with a will and the flints flew in a thousand pieces under his hammer as though the youth and the force of nineteen years instead of ninety were at work on them when the noon bell rang from a little odd straight steeple with a slanting roof that peered out of the trees to the westward he laid his hammer aside took off his brassplated cap wiped his forehead of its heat and dust sat down on his pile of stones took out a hard black crust and munched with teeth that were still strong and wiry the noontide was very quiet the heat was intense for there had been no rainfall for several weeks there was one lark singing high up in the air with its little breast lifted to the sun but all the other birds were mute and invisible doubtless hidden safely in some delicious shadow swinging drowsily on tufts of linden bloom or underneath the roofing of broad chestnut leaves the road on either side was lined by the straight forms of endless poplars standing side by side in sentinel the fields were all ablaze around on every side with the gold of ripening corn or mustard and the scarlet flame of innumerable poppies here and there they were broken by some little house white or black or painted in bright colors which lifted up among its leaves a little tower like a sugarloaf or a black gable and a pointed arch beneath it now and then they were divided by rows of trees standing breathless in the heat or breadths of apple orchards some with fruits ruby red some with fruits as yet green as their foliage through it all the river ran silver in the light with shallow fords where the deepflanked bullocks drank and ever and anon an ancient picturesque bridge of wood timebronzed and mossimbedded the old man did not look round once he had been on these roads a score of years the place had to him the monotony and colorlessness which all long familiar scenes wear to the eyes that are weary of them he was ninetyfive he had to labor for his living he ate black bread he had no living kith or kin no friend save in the mighty legion of the dead he sat in the scorch of the sun he hated the earth and the sky the air and the landscape why not they had no loveliness for him he only knew that the flies stung him and that the red ants could crawl through the holes in his shoes and bite him sharply with their little piercing teeth he sat in such scanty shade as the tall lean poplar gave munching his hard crusts he had a fine keen profile and a long white beard that were cut as sharply as an intaglio against the golden sunlight in which the gnats were dancing his eyes were fastened on the dust as he ate blue piercing eyes which had still something of the fire of their youth and his lips under the white hair moved a little now and then half audibly his thoughts were with the long dead years of an unforgotten timea time that will be remembered as long as the earth shall circle round the sun with the present he had nothing to do he worked to satisfy the lingering cravings of a body that age seemed to have lost all power to kill he worked because he was too much of a man still to beg and because suicide looked to his fancy like a weakness but life for all that was over with him life in the years of his boyhood had been a thing so splendid so terrible so drunken so divine so tragic so intense that the world seemed now to him to have grown pale and gray and pulseless with no sap in its vines no hue in its suns no blood in its humanity for his memory held the days of thermidor the weeks of the white terror the winter dawn when the drums rolled out a kings threnody the summer nights when all the throats of paris cried marengo he had lived in the wondrous awe of that abundant time when every hour was an agony or a victory when every woman was a martyr or a bacchanal when the same scythe that had severed the flowering grasses served also to cleave the fair breasts of the mother the tender throat of the child when the ground was purple with the blue blood of men as with the juices of outtrodden grapes and when the waters were white with the bodies of virgins as with the moonfed lilies of summer and now he sat here by the wayside in the dust and the sun only feeling the sting of the fly and the bite of the ant and the world seemed dead to him because so long ago though his body still lived on his soul had cursed god and died through the golden motes of the dancing air and of the quivering sunbeams whilst high above the lark sang on there came along the road a girl she was barefooted and barethroated lithe of movement and straight and supple as one who passed her life on the open lands and was abroad in all changes of the weather she walked with the free and fearless measure of the countrywomen of rome or the desertborn women of nubia she had barely completed her sixteenth year but her bosom and limbs were full and firm and moulded with almost all the luxuriant splendor of maturity her head was not covered after the fashion of the country but had a scarlet kerchief wound about on it she bore a flat basket filled high with fruits and herbs and flowers a mass of color and of blossom through which her dark level brows and her great eyes blueblack as a tempestuous night looked out set straight against the sun she came on treading down the dust with her long and slender feet that were such feet as a sculptor would give to his cleopatra or his phryne her face was grave shadowed even fierce and her mouth though scarlet as a berry and full and curled had its lips pressed close on one another like the lips of one who has long kept silence and may keep ituntil death as she saw the old man her eyes changed and lightened with a smile which for the moment banished all the gloom and savage patience from her eyes and made them mellow and lustrous as a southern sun she paused before him and spoke showing her beautiful white teeth small and even like rows of cowry shells you are well marcellin the old man started and looked up with a certain gladness on his own keen visage which had lost all expression save such as an intense and absorbed retrospection will lend fool he made answer harshly yet not unkindly when will you know that so long as an old man lives so long it cannot be well with him need one be a man or old to answer so she spoke in the accent and the language of the province but with a voice rich and pure and cold not the voice of the north or of any peasantry she put her basket down from off her head and leaned against the trunk of the poplar beside him crossing her arms upon her bare chest to the young everything is possible to the old nothing he said curtly her eyes gleamed with a thirsty longing she made him no reply he broke off half his dry bread and tendered it to her she shook her head and motioned it away yet she was as sharphungered as any hawk that has hunted all through the night and the woods and has killed nothing the growing life the superb strength the lofty stature of her made her need constant nourishment as young trees need it and she was fed as scantily as a blind beggars dog and less willingly than a galleyslave the kindly air had fed her richly strongly continually that was all possible she said slowly after awhile what is possible i do not understand the old man marcellin smiled grimly you see that lark it soars there and sings there it is possible that a fowler may hide in the grasses it is possible that it may be shot as it sings it is possible that it may have the honor to die in agony to grace a rich mans table you see she mused a moment her brain was rapid in intuitive perception but barren of all culture it took her many moments to follow the filmy track of a metaphorical utterance but by degrees she saw his meaning and the shadow settled over her face again the possible then is onlythe worse she said slowly the old man smiled still grimly nay our friends the priests say there is a possible which will giveone daythe fowler who kills the lark the wings of the lark and the larks power to sing laus deo in heaven i do not saythey do the priests all the scorn of which her curved lips were capable curled on them and a deep hate gathered in her eyesa hate that was unfathomable and mute then there is no possible for me she said bitterly if so be that priests hold the gifts of it marcellin looked up at her from under his bushy white eyebrows a glance fleet and keen as the gleam of blue steel yes there is he said curtly you are a womanchild and have beauty the devil will give you one always the devil she muttered there was impatience in her echo of the words and yet there was an awe also as of one who uses a name that is mighty and full of majesty although familiar always the devil repeated marcellin for the world is always of men his meaning this time lay too deep for her and passed her she stood leaning against the poplar with her head bent and her form motionless and golden in the sunlight like a statue of bronze if men be devils they are my brethren she said suddenly why do they then so hate me the old man stroked his beard because fraternity is hate cain said so but god would not believe him she mused over the saying silent still the lark dropped down from heaven suddenly falling through the air mute it had been struck by a sparrowhawk which flashed back against the azure of the skies and the white haze of the atmosphere and which flew down in the track of the lark and seized it ere it gained the shelter of the grass and bore it away within his talons marcellin pointed to it with his pipestem you see there are many forms of the possible when it means death she added the old man took his pipe back and smoked of course death is the keynote of creation again she did not comprehend a puzzled pain clouded the luster of her eyes but the lark praised godwhy should it be so dealt with marcellin smiled grimly abel was praising god but that did not turn aside the steel she was silent yet again he had told her that old story of the sons born of eve and the one whom hearing it she had understood and pitied had been cain at that moment through the roadway that wound across the meadows and through the corn lands and the trees there came in sight a gleam of scarlet that was not from the poppies a flash of silver that was not from the river a column of smoke that was not from the weeds that burned on the hillside there came a moving cloud with a melodious murmur softly rising from it a cloud that moved between the high flowering hedges the tall amber wheat the slender poplars and the fruitful orchards a cloud that grew larger and clearer as it drew more near to them and left the green watermeadows and the winding fieldpaths for the great highroad it was a procession of the church it drew closer and closer by slow imperceptible degrees until it approached them the old man sat upright not taking his cap from his head nor his pipe from his mouth the young girl ceased to lean for rest against the tree and stood with her arms crossed on her breast the church passed them the gilt crucifix held aloft the scarlet and the white of the floating robes catching the sunlight the silver chains and the silver censers gleaming the fresh young voices of the singing children cleaving the air like a rush of wind the dark shorn faces of the priests bowed over open books the tender sound of little bells ringing across the low deep monotony of prayer the church passed them the dust of the parched road rose up in a choking mass the heavy mist of the incense hung darkly on the sunlit air the tramp of the many feet startled the birds from their rest and pierced through the noonday silence it passed them and left them behind it but the fresh leaves were choked and whitened the birds were fluttered and affrightened the old man coughed the girl strove to brush the dust motes from her smarting eyelids that is the church said the stonebreaker with a smile dustterrora choked voiceand blinded eyes now she understood and her beautiful curled lips laughed mutely the old man rammed some more tobacco into the bowl of his pipe that is the church he said to burn incense and pray for rain and to fell the forests that were the rainmakers the procession passed away out of sight going along the highway and winding by the course of the river calling to the bright blue heavens for rain whilst the little bells rang and the incense curled and the priests prayed themselves hoarse and the peasants toiled footsore and the eager steps of the choral children trod the tiny gnat dead in the grasses and the bright butterfly dead in the dust the priests had cast a severer look from out their downdropped eyelids the children had huddled together with their voices faltering a little and the boy choristers had shot out their lips in gestures of defiance and opprobrium as they had passed these twain beneath the wayside trees for the two were both outcasts didst thou see the man that killed the king whispered to another one fair and curlyheaded baby who was holding in the sun her little white silverfringed banner and catching the rise and fall of the sonorous chant as well as she could with her little lisping tones didst thou see the daughter of the devil muttered to another a handsome goldenbrown boy who had left his herd untended in the meadow to don his scarlet robes and to swing about the censer of his village chapel and they all sang louder and tossed more incense on high and marched more closely together under the rays of the gleaming crucifix as they went feeling that they had been beneath the shadow of the powers of darkness and that they were purer and holier and more exalted because they had thus passed by in scorn what was accursed with psalms on their lips with the cross as their symbol so they went their way through the peaceful country with a glory of sunbeams about themthrough the corn past the orchards by the river into the heart of the old brown quiet town and about the foot of the great cathedral where they kneeled down in the dust and prayed then rose and sang the angelus then the tall darkvisaged priest who had led them all thither under the standard of the golden crucifix lifted his voice alone and implored god and exhorted man implored for rain and all the blessings of harvest exhorted to patience and the imitation of god the people were moved and saddened and listened smiting their breasts and after awhile rising from their knees many of them in tears dispersed and went their ways muttering to one anotherwe have had no such harvests as those of old since the man that slew a saint came to dwell here and answering to one anotherwe had never such droughts as these in the sweet cool weather of old before the offspring of hell was among us for the priests had not said to them lo your mercy is parched as the earth and your hearts as the heavens are brazen chapter ii in the days of his youngest youth in the old drunken days that were dead this stonebreaker marcellin had known such life as it is given to few men to knowa life of the soul and the senses a life of storm and delight a life mad with blood and with wine a life of divinest dreams a life when women kissed them and bid them slay a life when mothers blessed them and bade them die a life strong awful splendid unutterable a life seized at its fullest and fiercest and fairest out of an air that was death off an earth that was hell when his cheeks had had a boys bloom and his curls a boys gold he had seen a nation in delirium he had been one of the elect of a people he had uttered the words that burn and wrought the acts that live he had been of the thousand of marsala and he had been of the avengers of thermidor he had raised his flutelike voice from the tribune and he had cast in his vote for the death of a king passions had been his playthings and he had toyed with life as a child with a match he had beheld the despised enthroned in power and desolation left within kings palaces he too had been fierce and glad and cruel and gay and drunken and proud as the whole land was he had seen the white beauty of princely women bare in the hands of the mob and the throats that princes had caressed kissed by the broad steel knife he had had his youth in a wondrous time when all men had been gods or devils and all women martyrs or furies and nowhe broke stones to get daily bread and those who passed him by cursed him saying this man slew a king for he had outlived his time and the life that had been golden and red at its dawn was now gray and pale as the ashes of a fire grown cold for in all the list of the worlds weary errors there is no mistake so deadly as age years before in such hot summer weather as this against which the church had prayed the old man going homewards to his cabin amidst the fields had met a little child coming straight towards him in the full crimson glow of the setting sun and with the flame of the poppies all around her he hardly knew why he looked at her but when he had once looked his eyes rested there she had the hues of his youth about her in that bloodred light among the bloodred flowers she made him think of womens forms that he had seen in all their grace and their voluptuous loveliness clothed in the red garment of death and standing on the dusky red of the scaffold as the burning mornings of the summers of slaughter had risen over the land the child was all alone before him in that intense glow as of fire above her there was a tawny sky flushed here and there with purple around her stretched the solitary level of the fields burnt yellow as gold by the long months of heat there were stripes on her shoulders blue and black from the marks of a thong he looked at her and stopped her why he hardly knew except that a look about her beaten but yet unsubdued attracted him he had seen the same look in the years of his youth on the faces of the nobles he hated have you been hurt he asked her in his harsh strong voice she put her heavy load of fagots down and stared at him hurt she echoed the word stupidly no one ever thought she could be hurt what was done to her was punishment and justice yes those stripesthey must be painful she gave a gesture of assent with her head but she did not answer who beat you he pursued a cloud of passion swept over her bent face flamma you were wicked they said so and what do you do when you are beaten i shut my mouth for what for fear they should know it hurt meand be glad marcellin leaned on his elm stick and fastened on her his keen passionless eyes with a look that for him who was shamed and was shunned by all his kind was almost sympathy come to my hut he said to her i know a herb that will take the fret and the ache out of your bruises the child followed him passively half stupidly he was the first creature that had ever bidden her go with him and this rough pity of his was sweet to her with an amazing incredible balm in it that only those can know who see raised against them every mans hand and hear on their ears the mockery of all the voices of their world under reviling and contempt and constant rejection she had become savage as a trapped hawk wild as an escaped panther but to him she was obedient and passive because he had spoken to her without a taunt and without a curse which until now had been the sole two forms of human speech she had heard his little hut was in the midst of those spreading cornfields set where two pathways crossed each other and stretched down the gentle slope of the cultured lands to join the great highwaya hut of stones and plaited rushes with a roof of thatch where the old republican hardy of frame and born of a toiling race dwelt in solitude and broke his scanty bitter bread without lament if without content he took some leaves of a simple herb that he knew soaked them with water and bound them on her shoulders not ungainly though his hand was so rough with labor and as men said had been so often red with carnage then he gave her a draught of goats milk sweet and fresh from a wooden bowl shared with her the dry black crusts that formed his only evening meal bestowed on her a gift of a rare old scarlet scarf of woven wools and eastern broideries one of the few relics of his buried life lifted the fagots on her back so that she could carry them with greater ease and set her on her homeward way come to me again he said briefly as she went across the threshold the child bent her head in silence and kissed his hand quickly and timidly like a grateful dog that is amazed to have a caress and not a blow after a forty years vow i have broken it i have pitied a human thing the old man muttered as he stood in his doorway looking after her shadow as it passed small and dark across the scarlet light of the poppies they call him vile and they say that he slew men thought the child who had long known his face though he never had noted hers and it seemed to her that all mercy lay in her fathers kingdomwhich they called the kingdom of evil the cool moist herbs soaked on her bruises and the draught of milk had slaked the thirst of her throat is evil good she asked in her heart as she went through the tall red poppies and from that evening thenceforward follefarine and marcellin cleaved to one another being outcasts from all others chapter iii as the religious gathering broke up and split in divers streams to wander divers ways the little town returned to its accustomed stillnessa stillness that seemed to have in it the calm of a thousand sleeping years and the legends and the dreams of half a score of old dead centuries on marketdays and saintdays days of high feast or of perpetual chaffering the town was full of color movement noise and population the country people crowded in filling it with the jingling of mulebells the fisher people came bringing in with them the crisp salt smell of the sea and the blue of the sea on their garments its own tanners and ivory carvers and fruiterers and lacemakers turned out by the hundred in all the quaint variety of costumes that their forefathers had bequeathed to them and to which they were still wise enough to adhere but at other times when the fishers were in their hamlets and the peasantry on their lands and in their orchards and the townsfolk at their labors in the old rich renaissance mansions which they had turned into tanneries and granaries and woolsheds and workshops the place was profoundly still scarcely a child at play in the streets scarcely a dog asleep in the sun when the crowds had gone the priests laid aside their vestments and donned the black serge of their daily habit and went to their daily avocations in their humble dwellings the crosses and the censers were put back upon their altars and hung up upon their pillars the boy choristers and the little children put their white linen and their scarlet robes back in cupboards and presses with heads of lavender and sprigs of rosemary to keep the moth and the devil away and went to their fields to their homes to their herds to their paper kites to their daisy chains to the poor rabbits they pent in a hutch to the poor flies they killed in the sun the streets became quite still the marketplace quite empty the drowsy silence of a burning cloudless afternoon was over all the quiet places about the cathedral walls where of old the bishops and the canons dwelt gray shady courts dim open cloisters houses covered with oaken carvings and shadowed with the spreading branches of chestnuts and of limetrees that were as aged as themselves under the shelter of one of the lindens after the populace had gone there was seated on a broad stone bench the girl who had stood by the wayside erect and unbending as the procession had moved before her she had flung herself down in dreamy restfulness she had delivered her burden of vegetables and fruit at a shop near by whose awning stretched out into the street like a toadstool yellow with the sun the heat was intense she had been on foot all day she sat to rest a moment and put her burning hands under a little rill of water that spouted into a basin in a niche in the wallan ancient well with a stone image sculptured above and a wreath of vineleaves in stone running around in the lavish ornamentation of an age when men loved loveliness for its own sake and begrudged neither time nor labor in its service she leaned over the fountain kept cool by the roofing of the thick green leaves there was a metal cup attached to the basin by a chain she filled it at the running thread of water and stooped her lips to it again and again thirstily the day was sultry the ways were long and white with powdered limestone her throat was still parched with the dust raised by the many feet of the multitude and although she had borne in the great basket which now stood empty at her side cherries peaches mulberries melons full of juice and lusciousness this daughter of the devil had not taken even one to freshen her dry mouth follefarine stooped to the water and played with it and drank it and steeped her lips and her arms in it lying there on the stone bench with her bare feet curled one in another and her slender round limbs full of the voluptuous repose of a resting panther the coolness the murmur the clearness the peace the soft flowing movement of water possess an ineffable charm for natures that are passiontossed feverish and full of storm there was a dreamy peace about the place too which had charms likewise for her in the dusky arch of the long cloisters in the lichengrown walls in the broad pamments of the paven court in the clusters of delicate carvings beneath and below in the sculptured frieze where little nests that the birds had made in the spring still rested in the dense brooding thickness of the boughs that brought the sweetness and the shadows of the woods into the heart of the peopled town she stayed there loath to move loath to return where a jeer a bruise a lifted stick a muttered curse were all her greeting and her guerdon as she lay thus one of the doors in the old houses in the cloisters opened the head of an old woman was thrust out crowned with the high fanshaped comb and the towering white linen cap that are the female note of that especial town the woman was the mother of the sacristan and she looking out shrieked shrilly to her son georges georges come hither the devils daughter is drinking the blest water the sacristan was hoeing among his cabbages in the little garden behind his house surrounded with clipt yew and damp from the deep shade of the cathedral that overshadowed it he ran out at his mothers call hoe in hand himself an old man though stout and strong the well in the wall was his especial charge and pride immeasurable sanctity attached to it according to tradition the water had spouted from the stone itself at the touch of a branch of blossoming pear held in the hand of st jerome who had returned to earth in the middle of the fourteenth century and dwelt for awhile near the cathedral working at the honorable trade of a cordwainer and accomplishing mighty miracles throughout the district it was said that some of his miraculous power still remained in the fountain and that even yet those who drank on st jeromes day in full faith and with believing hearts were oftentimes cleansed of sin and purified of bodily disease wherefore on that day throngs of peasantry flocked in from all sides and crowded round it and drank to the benefit of the sacristan in charge if not to that of their souls and bodies summoned by his mother he flew to the rescue of the sanctified spring get you gone he shouted get you gone you child of hell how durst you touch the blessed basin do you think that god struck water from the stone for such as you follefarine lifted her head and looked him in the face with her audacious eyes and laughed then tossed her head again and plunged it into the bright living water till her lips and her cheeks and all the rippling hair about her temples sparkled with its silvery drops the sacristan infuriated at once by the impiety and the defiance shrieked aloud insolent animal daughter of satan i will teach you to taint the gift of god with lips of the devil and he seized her roughly with one hand upon her shoulder and with the other raised the hoe and brandished the wooden staff of it above her head in threat to strike her whilst his old mother still thrusting her lofty headgear and her wrinkled face from out the door screamed to him to show he was a man and have no mercy as his grasp touched her and the staff cast its shadow across her follefarine sprang up defiance and fury breathing from all her beautiful fierce face she seized the staff in her right hand wrenched it with a swift movement from its hold and catching his head under her left arm rained blows on him from his own weapon with a sudden gust of breathless rage which blinded him and lent to her slender muscular limbs the strength and the force of man then as rapidly as she had seized and struck him she flung him from her with such violence that he fell prostrate on the pavement of the court caught up the metal pail which stood by ready filled dashed the water over him where he lay and turning from him without a word walked across the courtyard slowly and with a haughty grace in all the carriage of her bare limbs and the folds of her ragged garments bearing the empty osier basket on her head deaf as the stones around her to the screams of the sacristan and his mother in these secluded cloisters and in the high noontide when all were sleeping or eating in the cool shelter of their darkened houses the old womans voice remained unheard the saints heard no doubt but they were too lazy to stir from their niches in that sultry noontide and except the baying of a chained dog aroused there was no answer to the outcry and follefarine passed out into the marketplace unarrested and not meeting another living creature as she turned into one of the squares leading to the open country she saw in the distance one of the guardians of the peace of the town moving quickly towards the cloisters with his glittering lace shining in the sun and his long scabbard clattering upon the stones she laughed a little as she saw they will not come after me she said to herself they are too afraid of the devil she judged rightly they did not come she crossed all the wide scorching square whose white stones blazed in the glare of the sun there was nothing in sight except a stray cat prowling in a corner and three sparrows quarreling over a foulsmelling heap of refuse the quaint old houses round seemed all asleep with the shutters closed like eyelids over their little dim aged orbs of windows the gilded vanes on their twisted chimneys and carved parapets pointed motionless to the warm south there was not a sound except the cawing of some rooks that built their nests high aloft in the fretted pinnacles of the cathedral undisturbed she crossed the square and took her way down the crooked streets that led her homeward to the outlying country it was an old twisted dusky place with the water flowing through its center as its only roadway and in it there were the oldest houses of the town all of timber black with age and carved with the wonderful florid fancies and grotesque conceits of the years when a house was to its master a thing beloved and beautiful a bulwark an altar a heritage an heirloom to be dwelt in all the days of a long life and bequeathed in all honor and honesty to a noble offspring the street was very silent the ripple of the water was the chief sound that filled it its tenants were very poor and in many of its antique mansions the beggars shared shelter with the rats and the owls in one of these dwellings however there were still some warmth and color the orange and scarlet flowers of a nasturtium curled up its twisted pilasters the big fair clusters of hydrangea filled up its narrow casements a breadth of manycolored saxafrage with leaves of green and rose and blossoms of purple and white hung over the balcony rail which five centuries earlier had been draped with cloth of gold and a little yellow songbird made music in the empty niche from which the sculptured flowerdeluce had been so long torn down from that window a woman looked down leaning with folded arms above the rosetipped saxafrage and beneath the greenleaved vine she was a fair woman white as the lilies she had silver pins in her amber hair and a mouth that laughed sweetly she called to follefarine you brown thing why do you stare at me follefarine started and withdrew the fixed gaze of her lustrous eyes because you are beautiful she answered curtly all beautiful things had a fascination for her this woman above was very fair to see and the girl looked at her as she looked at the purple butterflies in the sun at the stars shining down through the leaves at the vast dim gorgeous figures in the cathedral windows at the happy children running to their mothers with their hands full of primroses as she saw them in the woods at springtime at the laughing groups round the woodfires in the new year time when she passed a lattice pane that the snowdrift had not blocked at all the things that were so often in her sight and yet with which her life had no part or likeness she stood there on the rough flints in the darkness cast from the jutting beams of the house and the other happier creature leaned above in the light white and rosehued and with the silver bells of the pins shaking in her yellow tresses you are old flammas granddaughter cried the other from her leafy nest above you work for him all day long at the mill yes and your feet are bare and your clothes are rags and you go to and fro like a packhorse and the people hate you you must be a fool your father was the devil they say why do you not make him give you good things he will not hear the child muttered wearily had she not besought him endlessly with breathless prayer will he not wait a yearwait a year what then asked follefarine with a quick startled breath in a year you will be a woman and he always hears women they say he hears you the fair woman above laughed perhaps in his fashion but he pays me ill as yet and she plucked one of the silver pins from her hair and stabbed the rosy foam of the saxafrage through and through with it for she was but a gardeners wife and was restless and full of discontent get you gone she added quickly or i will throw a stone at you you witch you have the evil eye they say and you may strike me blind if you stare so follefarine went on her way over the sharp stones with a heavy heart that picture in the casement had made that passage bright to her many a time and when at last the picture had moved and spoken it had only mocked her and reviled her as the rest did the street was dark for her like all the others now the gardeners wife leaning there with the green and gold of the vineleaves brushing her hair looked after her down the crooked way that young wretch will be more beautiful than i she thought and the thought was bitter to her as such a one is to a fair woman follefarine went slowly and sadly through the street with her head dropped and the large osier basket trailing behind her over the stones she was well used to be pelted with words hard as hailstones and usually heeded them little or gave them back with sullen defiance but from this woman they had wounded her from that bright bower of golden leaves and scarlet flowers she had faintly fancied some stray beam of light might wander even to her she was soon outside the gates of the town and beyond the old walls where the bramble and the lichen grew over the huge stones of ramparts and fortifications useless and decayed from age the country roads and lanes the silver streams and the wooden bridges the lanes through which the market mules picked their careful way the fields in which the whitecapped peasant women and the brindled oxen were at work stretched all before her in a radiant air sweet with the scent of ripening fruits from many orchards here and there a wayside calvary rose dark against the sun here and there a chapel bell sounded from under some little peaked red roof the cattle dozed beside meadow ditches that were choked with wild flowers the dogs lay down beside their sheep and slept at the first cottage which she passed the housewife sat out under a spreading chestnuttree weaving lace upon her knee follefarine looked wistfully at the woman who was young and pretty and who darted her swift skilled hand in and out and around the bobbins keeping time meanwhile with a mirthful burden that she sang the woman looked up and frowned as the girl passed by her a little way farther on there was a winehouse by the roadside built of wood vinewreathed and half hidden in the tall flowering briers of its garden out of the lattice there was leaning a maiden with the silver cross on her bosom shining in the sun and her meek blue eyes smiling down from under the tower of her high white cap she was reaching a carnation to a student who stood below with long fair locks and ruddy cheeks and a beard yellow with the amber down of twenty years and who kissed her white wrist as he caught the red flower follefarine glanced at the pretty picture with a dull wonder and a nameless pain what could it mean to be happy like that half a league onward she passed another cottage shadowed by a sycamoretree and with the swallows whirling around its tall twisted stone chimneys and a beurre pear covering with branch and bloom its old gray walls an aged woman sat sipping coffee in the sun and a young one was sweeping the blue and white tiles with a broom singing gayly as she swept art thou well placed my mother she asked pausing to look tenderly at the withered brown face on which the shadows of the sycamore leaves were playing the old mother smiled steeping her bread in the coffeebowl surely child i can feel the sun and hear you sing she was happy though she was blind follefarine stood a moment and looked at them across a hedge of honeysuckle how odd it must feel to have any one to care to hear your voice like that she thought and she went on her way through the poppies and the corn half softened half enraged was she lower than they because she could find no one to care for her or take gladness in her life or was she greater than they because all human delights were to her as the dead letters of an unknown tongue down a pathway fronting her that ran midway between the yellowing seas of wheat and a belt of lilac clover over which a swarm of bees was murmuring there came a countrywoman crushing the herbage under her heavy shoes ragged picturesque sunbrowned swinging deep brass pails as she went to the herds on the hillside she carried a child twisted into the folds of her dress a boy half asleep with his curly head against her breast as she passed the woman drew her kerchief over her bosom and over the brown rosy face of the child she shall not look at thee my darling she muttered her look withered remys little limb and she covered the child jealously and turned aside so that she should tread a separate pathway through the clover and did not brush the garments of the one she was compelled to pass follefarine heard and laughed aloud she knew of what the woman was thinking in the summer of the previous year as she had passed the tanyard on the western bank of the river the tanners little son rushing out in haste had curled his mouth in insult at her and clapping his hands hissed in a childs love of cruelty the mocking words which he had heard his elders use of her in answer she had only turned her head and looked down at him with calm eyes of scorn but the child running out fast and startled by that regard had stepped upon a shred of leather and had fallen heavily breaking his left leg at the knee the limb unskillfully dealt with and enfeebled by a tendency to disease had never been restored but hung limp crooked useless withered from below the knee through all the country side the little cripple remy creeping out into the sun upon his crutches was pointed out in a passionate pity as the object of her sorcery the victim of her vengeance when she had heard what they said she had laughed as she laughed now drawing together her straight brows and showing her glistening teeth all the momentary softness died in her as the peasant covered the boys face and turned aside into the clover she laughed aloud and swept on through the halfripe corn with that swift harmonious majestic movement which was inborn in her as it is inborn in the deer or the antelope singing again as she went those strange wild airs like the sigh of the wind which were all the language that lingered in her memory from the land that had seen her birth to such aversion as this she was too well used for it to be a matter of even notice to her she knew that she was marked and shunned by the community amidst which her lot was cast and she accepted proscription without wonder and without resistance follefarine the dust what lower thing did earth hold in this oldworld district amidst the pastures and cornlands of normandy superstition had taken a hold which the passage of centuries and the advent of revolution had done very little to lessen few of the people could read and fewer still could write they knew nothing but what their priests and their politicians told them to believe they went to their beds with the poultry and rose as the cock crew they went to mass as their ducks to the osier and weed ponds and to the conscription as their lambs to the slaughter they understood that there was a world beyond them but they remembered it only as the best market for their fruit their fowls their lace their skins their brains were as dim as were their oillit streets at night though their lives were content and mirthful and the most part pious they went out into the summer meadows chanting aves in seasons of drought to pray for rain on their parching orchards in the same credulity with which they groped through the winter fog bearing torches and chanting dirges to gain a blessing at seedtime on their bleak black fallows the beauty and the faith of the old mediaeval life were with them still and with its beauty and its faith were its bigotry and its cruelty likewise they led simple and contented lives for the most part honest and among themselves cheerful and kindly preserving much grace of color of costume of idiosyncrasy because apart from the hueless communism and characterless monotony of modern cities but they believed in sorcery and in devilry they were brutal to their beasts and could be as brutal to their foes they were steeped in legend and tradition from their cradles and all the darkest superstitions of dead ages still found home and treasury in their hearts and at their hearths therefore believing her a creature of evil they were inexorable against her and thought that in being so they did their duty they had always been a religious people in this birth country of the flamma race the strong poetic veneration of their forefathers which had symbolized itself in the carving of every lintel corbel or buttress in their streets and in the fashion of every spire on which a weathervane could gleam against their suns was still in their blood the poetry had departed but the bigotry remained their ancestors had burned wizards and witches by the score in the open square of the cathedral place and their grandsires and grandams had in brave dumb ignorant peasant fashion held fast to the lily and the cross and gone by hundreds to the salutation of the axe and the baptism of the sword in the red days of revolution they were the same people still industrious frugal peaceful loyal wedded to old ways and to old relics content on little and serene of heart yet withal where they feared or where they hated brutal with the brutality begotten of abject ignorance and they had been so to this outcast whom they all called follefarine when she had first come amidst them a little desolate foreign child mute with the dumbness of an unknown tongue and cast adrift among strange people unfamiliar ways and chill blank glances she had shyly tried in a childs vague instincts of appeal and trust to make friends with the other children that she saw and to share a little in the mothers smiles and the babies pastimes that were all around her in the glad green world of summer but she had been denied and rejected with hard words and harder blows at her coming the smiles had changed to frowns and the pastime into terror she was proud she was shy she was savage she felt rather than understood that she was suspected and reviled she ceased to seek her own kind and only went for companionship and sympathy to the creatures of the fields and the woods to the things of the earth and the sky and the water thou art the devils daughter half in sport hissed the youths in the marketplace against her as the little child went among them carrying a load for her grandsire heavier than her arms knew how to bear thou wert plaguespotted from thy birth said the old man himself as she strained her small limbs to and fro the floors of his storehouses carrying wood or flour or tiles or rushes or whatever there chanced to need such convoy get thee away we are not to touch thee hissed the sixyearold infants at play by the river when she waded in amidst them to reach with her lither arm the faroff waterflowers they were too timorous to pluck and tender it to the one who had desired it the devil begot thee and my cow fell ill yesternight after thou hadst laid hands on her muttered the old women lifting a stick as she went near to their cattle in the meadows to brush off with a broad dockleaf the flies that were teasing the poor meek patient beasts so cursed when she did her duty and driven away when she tried to do good her young soul had hardened itself and grown fierce mute callous isolated there were only the fourfooted things so wise so silent so tender of heart so bruised of body so innocent and so agonized that had compassion for her and saved her from utter desolation in the mild sad gaze of the cow in the lustrous suffering eyes of the horse in the noble frank faith of the dog in the softbounding glee of the lamb in the unwearied toil of the ass in the tender industry of the bird she had sympathy and she had example she loved them and they loved her she saw that they were sinless diligent faithful devoted loyal servers of base masters loving greatly and for their love goaded beaten overtasked slaughtered she took the lesson to heart and hated men and women with a bitter hatred so she had grown up for ten years caring for no human thing except in a manner for the old man marcellin who was like her proscribed the priests had striven to turn her soul what they had termed heavenward but their weapons had been wrath and intimidation she would have none of them no efforts that they or her grandsire made had availed she would be starved thrashed cursed maltreated as they would she could not understand their meaning or would not submit herself to their religion as years went on they had found the contest hopeless so had abandoned her to the devil who had made her and the daughter of one whom the whole province had called saint had never passed within churchdoors or known the touch of holy water save when they had cast it on her as an exorcism and when she met a priest in the open roads or on the bypaths of the fields she always sang in loud defiance her wildest melodies where had she learnt these they had been sung to her by phratos and taught by him who had he been her old life was obscure to her memory and yet glorious even in its dimness she did not know who those people had been with whom she had wandered nor in what land they had dwelt but that wondrous free life remained on her remembrance as a thing never to be forgotten or to be known again a life odorous with bursting fruits and budding flowers full of strangest and of sweetest music spent forever under green leaves and suns that had no setting forever beside fathomless waters and winding forests forever rhymed to melody and soothed to the measure of deep winds and drifting clouds for she had forgotten all except its liberty and its loveliness and the old gypsy life of the liebana remained with her only as some stray fragment of an existence passed in another world from which she was now an exile and revived in her only in the fierce passion of her nature in her bitter vague rebellion in her longing to be free in her anguish of vain desires for richer hues and bluer skies and wilder winds than those amidst which she toiled at times she remembered likewise the songs and the melodies of phratos remembered them when the moon rays swept across the white breadth of waterlilies or the breath of spring stole through the awakening woods and when she remembered them she weptwept bitterly where none could look on her she never thought of phratos as a man as of one who had lived in a human form and was now dead in an earthly grave her memory of him was of some nameless creature half divine whose footsteps brought laughter and music with eyes bright as a birds yet sad as a dogs and a voice forever singing clad in goats hair and gigantic and gay a creature that had spoken tenderly to her that had bidden her laugh and rejoice that had carried her when she was weary that had taught her to sleep under the dewy leaves and to greet the things of the night as soft sisters and to fear nothing in the whole living world in the earth or the air or the sky and to tell the truth though a falsehood were to spare the bare feet flintstones and naked shoulders the stick and an empty body hunger and thirst a creature that seemed to her in her memories even as the faun seemed to the fancies of the children of the piraeus a creature half man and half animal glad and grotesque full of mirth and of music belonging to the forest to the brook to the stars to the leaves wandering like the wind and like the wind homeless this was all her memory but she cherished it in the face of the priests she bent her straight black brows and curled her scornful scarlet lips but for the sake of phratos she held one religion though she hated men she told them never a lie and asked them never an alms she went now along the white level roads the empty basket balanced on her head her form moving with the free harmonious grace of desert women and she sang as she went the old sweet songs of the broken viol she was friendless and desolate she was ill fed she was heavily tasked she toiled without thanks she was ignorant of even so much knowledge as the peasants about her had she was without a past or a future and her present had in it but daily toil and bitter words hunger and thirst and chastisement yet for all that she sangsang because the vitality in her made her dauntless of all evil because the abundant life opening in her made her glad in despite of fate because the youth and the strength and the soul that were in her could not utterly be brutalized could not wholly cease from feeling the gladness of the sun the coursing of the breeze the liberty of nature the sweet quick sense of living before long she reached the spot where the old man marcellin was breaking stones his pile was raised much higher he sat astride on a log of timber and hammered the flints on and on on and on without looking up the dust was still thick on the leaves and the herbage where the tramp of the people had raised it and the prayers and the chants had failed as yet to bring one slightest cloud one faintest rain mist across the hot unbroken azure of the skies marcellin was her only friend the proscribed always adhere to one another when they are few they can only brood and suffer harmlessly when they are many they rise as with one foot and strike as with one hand therefore it is always perilous to make the lists of any proscription overlong the child who was also an outcast went to him and paused in a curious lifeless bitter way they cared for one another this girl who had grown to believe herself born of hell and this man who had grown to believe that he had served hell with the bastard follefarine and with the regicide marcellin the people had no association and for them no pity therefore they had found each other by the kinship of proscription and in a way there was love between them you are glad since you sing said the old man to her as she passed him again on her homeward way and paused again beside him the birds in cage sing she answered him but think you they are glad are they not she sat down a moment beside him on the bank which was soft with moss and odorous with wild flowers curling up the stems of the poplars and straying over into the corn beyond are they look yesterday i passed a cottage it is on the great south road far away from here the house was empty the people no doubt were gone to labor in the fields there was a wicker cage hanging to the wall and in the cage there was a blackbird the sun beat on his head his square of sod was a dry clod of bare earth the heat had dried every drop of water in his pan and yet the bird was singing singing how in torment beating his breast against the bars till the blood started crying to the skies to have mercy on him and to let rain fall his song was shrill it had a scream in it still he sang do you say the merle was glad what did you do asked the old man still breaking the stones with a monotonous rise and fall of his hammer i took the cage down and opened the door and he he shot up in the air first then dropped down amidst the grasses where a little brook which the drought had not dried was still running and he bathed and drank and bathed again seeming mad with the joy of the water when i lost him from sight he was swaying on a bough among the leaves over the river but then he was silent and what do you mean by that her eyes clouded she was mute she vaguely knew the meaning it bore to herself but it was beyond her to express it all things of nature had voices and parables for her because her fancy was vivid and her mind was dreamy but that mind was still too dark and too profoundly ignorant for her to be able to shape her thoughts into metaphor or deduction the bird had spoken to her by his silence as by his song but what he had uttered she could not well utter again save indeed that song was not gladness and neither was silence pain marcellin although he had asked her had asked needlessly for he also knew and what think you the people said when they went back and found the cage empty he pursued still echoing his words and hers by the ringing sound of the falling hammer a smile curled her lips that was no thought of mine she said carelessly they had done wickedly to cage him to set him free i would have pulled down their thatch or stove in their door had need been good said the old man briefly with a gleam of light over his harsh lean face he looked up at her as he worked the shivered flints flying right and left it was a pity to make you a woman he muttered as his keen gaze swept over her a woman she echoed the words dully and half wonderingly she could not understand it in connection with herself a woman that was a woman who sat in the sun under the figtree working her lace on a frame that was a woman who leaned out of her lattice tossing a red carnation to her lover that was a woman who swept the open porch of her house singing as she cleared the dust away that was a woman who strode on her blithe way through the clover carrying her child at her breast she seemed to have no likeness to them no kindred with them she a beast of burden a creature soulless and homeless an animal made to fetch and carry to be cursed and beaten to know neither love nor hope neither past nor future but only a certain dull patience and furious hate a certain dim pleasure in labor and indifference to pain it was a pity to make you a woman said the old man once more you might be a man worth something but a womana thing that has no medium no haven between hell and heaven no option save to sit by the hearth to watch the pot boil and suckle the children or to go out into the streets and the taverns to mock at men and to murder them which will you do in the future what she scarcely knew the meaning of the word she saw the female creatures round her were of all shades of age from the young girls with their peachlike cheeks to the old crones brown and withered as last years nuts she knew that if she lived on she would be old likewise but of a future she had no conception no ideal she had been left too ignorant to have visions of any other world hereafter than this one which the low lying green hills and the arc of the pale blue sky shut in upon her she had one desire indeeda desire vague but yet fiercethe desire for liberty but it was such desire as the bird which she had freed had known the desire of instinct the desire of existence only her mind was powerless to conceive a future because a future is a hope and of hope she knew nothing the old man glanced at her and saw that she had not comprehended he smiled with a certain bitter pity i spoke idly he said to himself slaves cannot have a future but yet yet he saw that the creature who was so ignorant of her own powers of her own splendors of her own possibilities had even now a beauty as great as that of a lustrous easterneyed passionflower and he knew that to a woman who has such beauty as this the world holds out in its hand the tender of at least one futureone election one kingdom one destiny women are loved she said suddenly will any one love me marcellin smiled bitterly many will love you doubtlessas the wasp loves the peach that he kisses with his sting and leaves rotten to drop from the stem she was silent again revolving his meaning it lay beyond her both in the peril which it embodied from others and the beauty in herself which it implied she could reach no conception of herself save as what she now was a bodyservant of toil a beast of burden like a young mule but all shun me as even the wasp shuns the bitter oak apple she said slowly and dreamily who should love me even as the wasp loves the peach marcellin smiled his grim and shadowy smile he made answer wait she sat mute once more revolving this strange brief word in her thoughtsstrange to her with a promise as vague as splendid and as incomprehensible as the prophecy of empire to a slave the future she said at last that means something that one has not and that is to comeis it so something that one never has and that never comes muttered the old man wearily cracking the flints in two something that one possesses in ones sleep and that is farther off each time that one awakes and yet a thing that one sees alwayssees even when one lies adying they sayfor men are fools follefarine listened musing with her hands clasped on the handle of her empty basket and her chin resting upon them and her eyes watching a maimed butterfly drag its wings of emerald and diamond through the hot pale sickly dust i dream she said suddenly as she stooped and lifted the wounded insect gently on to the edge of a leaf but i dream wide awake marcellin smiled never say so they will think you mad that is only what foolish things called poets do what is a poet a foolish thing i tell youmad enough to believe that men will care to strain their eyes as he strains his to see the face of a god who never looks and never listens ah she was so accustomed to be told that all she did was unlike to others and was either wicked or was senseless that she saw nothing except the simple statement of a fact in the rebuke which he had given her she sat quiet gazing down into the thick white dust of the road bestirred by the many feet of mules and men that had trodden through it since the dawn i dream beautiful things she pursued slowly in the moonlight most often i seem to remember when i dreamso much so much rememberwhat should you remember you were but a baby when they brought you hither so they say but i might live before in my fathers kingdomin the devils kingdom why not why not indeed perhaps we all lived there once and that is why we all through all our lives hanker to get back to it i ask him so often to take me back but he does not seem ever to hear chut he will hear in his own good time the devil never passes by a woman a woman she repeated the word seemed to have no likeness and no fitness with herself a womanshea creature made to be beaten and sworn at and shunned and loaded like a mule and driven like a bullock look you said the old man resting his hammer for a moment and wiping the sweat from his brow i have lived in this vile place forty years i remember the woman that they say bore youreine flamma she was a beautiful woman and pure as snow and noble and innocent she wearied god incessantly i have seen her stretched for hours at the foot of that cross she was wretched and she entreated her god to take away her monotonous misery and to give her some life new and fair but god never answered he left her to herself it was the devil that heardand replied then is the devil juster than their god marcellin leaned his hammer on his knees and his voice rose clear and strong as it had done of yore from the tribune he looks so at the least it is his wisdom and that is why his following is so large nay i say when god is deaf the devil listens that is his wisdom see you so often the poor little weak human soul striving to find the right way cries feebly for help and none answer the poor little weak soul is blind and astray in the busy streets of the world it lifts its voice but its voice is so young and so feeble like the pipe of a newlyborn bird in the dawn that it is drowned in the shouts and the manifold sounds of those hard crowded cruel streets where every one is for himself and no man has ears for his neighbor it is hungered it is athirst it is sorrowful it is blinded it is perplexed it is afraid it cries often but god and man leave it to itself then the devil who harkens always and who though all the trumpets blowing their brazen music in the streets bray in his honor yet is too wise to lose even the slightest sound of any in distresssince of such are the largest sheaves of his harvestcomes to the little soul and teaches it with tenderness and guides it towards the paths of gladness and fills its lips with the bread of sweet passions and its nostrils with the savor of fair vanities and blows in its ear the empty breath of mens lungs till that sickly wind seems divinest music then is the little soul dazzled and captured and made the devils for evermore half through its innocence half through its weakness but chiefly of all because god and man would not hear its cries whilst yet it was sinless and only astray he ceased and the strokes of his hammer rang again on the sharp flint stones she had listened with her lips parted breathlessly and her nightlike eyes dilated in the far distant time when he had been amidst the world of men he had known how to utter the words that burned and charm to stillness a raging multitude he had not altogether lost this power at such rare times as he still cared to break his silence and to unfold the unforgotten memories of a life long dead he would speak thus to her but to no other follefarine listened mute and breathless her great eyes uplifted to the sun where it was sinking westward through a pomp of golden and of purple cloud he was the only creature who ever spoke to her as though she likewise were human and she followed his words with dumb unquestioning faith as a dog its masters footsteps the soul what is the soul she muttered at length he caught in his hand the beautiful diamondwinged butterfly which now freed of the dust and drinking in the sunlight was poised on a foxglove in the hedge near him and held it against the light what is it that moves this creatures wings and glances in its eyes and gives it delight in the summers warmth in the orchids honey and in the

so much power why not have given it a little more so that it could escape you always you ask what men have asked ten times ten thousand yearssince the world beganwithout an answer because the law of all creation is cruelty i suppose because the dust of death is always the breath of life the great man dead changes to a million worms and lives again in the juices of the grass above his grave it matters little the worms destroy the grasses nourish few great men do more than the first or do as much as the last but get you homeward he continued breaking off his parable it is two hours past noon and if you be late on the way you pay for it with your body begone she nodded her head and went he seldom used gentle words to her and yet she knew in a vague way that he cared for her moreover she rejoiced in that bitter caustic contempt in which he the oldest man amidst them held all men his words were the only thing that had aroused her dulled brain to its natural faculties in a manner from him she had caught something of knowledgesomething too of intellect he alone prevented her from sinking to that absolute unquestioning despair which surely ends in idiocy or in selfmurder she pursued her way in silence across the fields and along the straight white road and across a wooden bridge that spanned the river to her home there was a gentler luster in her eyes and her mouth had the faint light of a half smile upon it she did not know what hope meant it never seemed possible to her that her fate could be other than it was since so long the messengers and emissaries of her fathers empire had been silent and leadenfooted to her call yet in a manner she was comforted for had not two mouths that day bidden her wait she entered at length the little wood of ypres and heard that rush and music of the deep mill water which was the sole thing she had learned to love in all the place beyond it were the apple orchards and fruit gardens which rendered claudis flamma back full recompense for all the toil they cost himrecompense so large indeed that many disbelieved in that poverty which he was wont to aver weighed so hardly and so lightly on him both were now rich in all their maturer abundance since the stream which rushed through them had saved them from the evil effects of the long drought so severely felt in all other districts the cherrytrees were scarlet with their latest fruit the great pumpkins glowed among their leaves in tawny orange heaps little russetbreasted bullfinches beat their wings vainly at the fine network that enshrouded the paler gold of the wall apricots a gray cat was stealing among the delicate yellows of the pearshaped marrows where a round green wrinkled melon lay aripening in the sun a gorgeous dragonfly was hovering and a mothermavis in her simple coif of brown and white and gray was singing with all the gladness of her sunny summer joys beyond a hedge of prickly thorn the narrower flowergarden stretched spanned by low stone walls made venerable by the silvery beards of lichens and the earth was full of color from the crimson and the golden gladioli from the carminehued carnations from the deepblue lupins and the gloire de dijon roses from the green slender stems and the pure white cups of the virginal lilies and from the gorgeous beetles with their purple tunics and their shields of bronze like grecian hoplites drawn in battle array while everywhere above this sweet glad garden world the butterflies purple and jeweled the redstarts in their ruby dress the dainty azurewinged and blue warblers the goldengirdled wasp with his pinions light as mist and the velvetcoated bee with his pleasant harvest song flew ever in the sunlight murmuring poising praising rejoicing the place was beautiful in its own simple quiet way lying in a hollow where the river tumbled down in two or three short breaks and leaps which broke its habitual smooth and sluggish form and brought it in a sheet of dark water and with a million foambells against the walls of the millhouse and under the ponderous wheels the wooden house itself also was picturesque in the old fashion when men builded their dwellings slowly and for love common with all its countless carvings black by age its jutting beams shapen into grotesque human likeness and tragic masks its parquetted work run over by the green cups of stoneworts and its high roof with deep shelving eaves bright with diapered tiles of blue and white and rose and alive all day with curling swallows with pluming pigeons with cooing doves it was beautiful and the heart of reine flammas young daughter doubtless would have clung to it with all a childs instinct of love and loyalty to its home had it not been to her only a prisonhouse wherein three bitter jailers forever ruled her with a rod of ironbigotry and penury and cruelty she flung herself down a moment in the garden on the long grass under a mulberrytree ere she went in to give her account of the fruit sold and the moneys brought by her she had been on foot since four oclock in the dawn of that sultry day her only meal had been a bowl of cold milk and a hunch of dry bread crushed in her strong small teeth she had toiled hard at such bodily labor as was set to her to domestic work to the work of the distaff and spindle of the stove and the needle they had never been able to break her they had found that she would be beaten black and blue ere she would be bound to it but against open air exertion she had never rebelled and she had in her all the strength and the swiftness of the nomadic race of the liebana and had not their indolence and their dishonesty she was very hungry she was again thirsty yet she did not break off a fruit from any bough about her she did not steep her hot lips in any one of the cool juicy apricots which studded the stones of the wall beyond her no one had ever taught her honesty except indeed in that dim dead time when phratos had closed her small hands in his whenever they had stretched out to some forbidden thing and had said take the goods the gods give thee but steal not from men and yet honest she was by reason of the fierce proud savage independence in her and her dim memories of that sole friend loved and lost she wanted many a thing many a timenay nearly every hour that she lived she wanted those sheer necessaries which make life endurable but she had taught herself to do without them rather than owe them by prayer or by plunder to that human race which she hated and to which she always doubted her own kinship buried in the grass she now abandoned herself to the bodily delights of rest of shade of coolness of sweet odors the scent of the fruits and flowers was heavy on the air the fall of the water made a familiar tempestuous music on her ear and her fancy poetic still though deadened by a life of ignorance and toil was stirred by the tender tones of the numberless birds that sang about her the earth and the air are good she thought as she lay there watching the dark leaves sway in the foam and the wind and the brightbosomed birds float from blossom to blossom for there was latent in her all untaught that old pantheistic instinct of the divine age when the world was young to behold a sentient consciousness in every leaf unfolded to the light to see a soul in every created thing the day shines on to feel the presence of an eternal life in every breeze that moves in every grass that grows in every flame that lifts itself to heaven in every bell that vibrates on the air in every moth that soars to reach the stars pantheism is the religion of the poet and nature had made her a poet though man as yet had but made of her an outcast a slave and a beast of burden the earth and the air are good she thought watching the sunrays pierce the purple heart of a passionflower the shadows move across the deep brown water the radiant butterfly alight upon a lily the scarletthroated birds dart in and out through the yellow feathery blossoms of the limes all birds were her friends phratos had taught her in her infancy many notes of their various songs and many ways and means of luring them to come and rest upon her shoulder and peck the berries in her hand she had lived so much in the open fields and among the woods that she had made her chief companions of them she could emulate so deftly all their voices from the call of the wood dove to the chant of the blackbird and from the trill of the nightingale to the twitter of the titmouse that she could summon them all to her at will and have dozens of them fluttering around her head and swaying their pretty bodies on her wrist it was one of her ways that seemed to the peasantry so weird and magical and they would come home from their fields on a spring daybreak and tell their wives in horror how they had seen the devils daughter in the red flush of the sunrise ankledeep in violets and covered with birds from head to foot hearing their whispers and giving them her messages to carry in return one meekeyed woman had dared once to say that st francis had done as much and it had been accredited to him as a fair action and virtuous knowledge but she was frowned down and chattered down by her louder neighbors who told her that she might look for some sharp judgment of heaven for daring to couple together the blessed name of the holy saint and the accursed name of this foul spirit but all they could say could not break the charmed communion between follefarine and her feathered comrades she loved them and they her in the hard winter she had always saved some of her scanty meal for them and in the springtime and the summer they always rewarded her with floods of songs and soft caresses from their nestling wings there were no rare birds no birds of moor and mountain in that cultivated and populous district but to her all the little homebred things of pasture and orchard were full of poetry and of characters the robins with that pretty air of boldness with which they veil their real shyness and timidity the strong and saucy sparrows powerful by the strength of all mediocrities and majorities all the dainty families of finches in their gay apparelings the plain brown bird that fills the night with music the gorgeous oriole ruffling in gold the gilded princeling of them all the little blue warblers the violets of the air the kingfishers that have hovered so long over the forgetmenots upon the rivers that they have caught the colors of the flowers on their wings the bright blackcaps green as the leaves with their yellow waistcoats and velvet hoods the innocent freebooters of the woodland liberties all these were her friends and lovers various as any human crowds of court or city she loved them they and the fourfooted beasts were the sole things that did not flee from her and the woeful and mad slaughter of them by the peasants was to her a grief passionate in its despair she did not reason on what she felt but to her a bird slain was a trust betrayed an innocence defiled a creature of heaven struck to earth suddenly on the silence of the garden there was a little shrill sound of pain the birds flew high in air screaming and startled the leaves of a bough of ivy shook as with a struggle she rose and looked a line of twine was trembling against the foliage in its noosed end the throat of the mavis had been caught it hung trembling and clutching at the air convulsively with its little drawn up feet it had flown into the trap as it had ended its joyous song and soared up to join its brethren there were a score of such traps set in the millers garden she unloosed the cord from about its tiny neck set it free and laid it down upon the ivy the succor came too late the little gentle body was already without breath the feet had ceased to beat the air the small soft head had drooped feebly on one side the lifeless eyes had started from their sockets the throat was without song for evermore the earth would be good but for men she thought as she stood with the little dead bird in her hand its mate which was poised on a rose bough flew straight to it and curled round and round about the small slain body and piteously bewailed its fate and mourned refusing to be comforted agitating the air with trembling wings and giving out vain cries of grief vain for the little joyous life was gone the life that asked only of god and man a home in the green leaves a drop of dew from the cup of a rose a bough to swing on in the sunlight a summer day to celebrate in song all the winter through it had borne cold and hunger and pain without lament it had saved the soil from destroying larvae and purified the trees from all foul germs it had built its little home unaided and had fed its nestlings without alms it had given its sweet song lavishly to the winds to the blossoms to the empty air to the deaf ears of men and now it lay dead in its innocence trapped and slain because a human greed begrudged it a berry worth the thousandth part of a copper coin out from the porch of the millhouse claudis flamma came with a knife in his hand and a basket to cut lilies for one of the choristers of the cathedral since the morrow would be the religious feast of the visitation of mary he saw the dead thrush in her hand and chuckled as he went by to himself the tenth bird trapped since sunrise he said thinking how shrewd and how sure in their make were these traps of twine that he set in the grass and the leaves she said nothing but a darkness of disgust swept over her face as he came in sight in the distance she knelt down and scraped a hole in the earth and laid moss in it and put the mavis softly on its green and fragrant bier and covered it with handfuls of fallen rose leaves and with a sprig or two of thyme around her head the widowed thrush flew ceaselessly uttering sad crieswho now should wander with him through the sunlightwho now should rove with him above the blossoming fieldswho now should sit with him beneath the boughs hearing the sweet rain fall between the leaveswho now should wake with him whilst yet the world was dark to feel the dawn break ere the east were red and sing a welcome to the unborn day chapter iv meanwhile claudis flamma cut the lilies for the cathedral altars muttering many holy prayers as he gathered the flowers of mary when the white lily sheaves had been borne away kept fresh in wet moss by the young chorister who had been sent for them the miller turned to her where is the money she standing beside the buried bird undid the leathern thong about her waist opened the pouch and counted out the coins one by one on the flat stone of a watertank among the lilies and the ivy there were a few silver pieces of slight value and some dozens of copper ones the fruit had been left at various stalls and houses in small portions for it was the custom to supply it fresh each day he caught them up with avidity bit and tested each counted them again and again and yet again after the third enumeration he turned sharply on her there are two pieces too little what have you done with them there are two sous short she answered him curtly twelve of the figs for the tanner florian were rotten rottenthey were but overripe it is the same thing you dare to answer meanimal i say they had only tasted a little too much of the sun it only made them the sweeter they were rotten they were not you dare to speak if they had been rotten they lay under the others he could not have seen i saw you saw who are youa beggara beasta foul offspring of sin you dared to show them to him i will warrant i showed him that they were not good and gave him back the two sous i took seven sous for what were good i took nothing for the rotten ones wretch you dare to tell me that a smile careless and sarcastic curled her mouth her eyes looked at him with all their boldest fiercest luster i never stealnot even from you good flamma you have stolen now he shrieked his thin and feeble voice rising in fury at his lost coins and his discovered treachery it is a lie that the figs were rotten it is a lie that you took but seven sous you stole the two sous to buy you bread and honey in the streets or to get a drink at the wineshops i know you i know you it is a devils device to please your gluttonous appetite the figs rottennot so rotten as is your soul would they be though they were black as night and though they stunk as river mud go back to denis florian and bring me the two sous or i will thrash you as a thief she laughed a hard scornful reckless laughter you can thrash me you cannot make me a thief you will not go back to florian i will not ask him to pay for what was bad you will not confess that you stole the money i should lie if i did then strip she set her teeth in silence and without a moments hesitation unloosened the woolen sash knotted round her waist and pushed down the coarse linen shirt from about her throat the white folds fell from off the perfect curves of her brown arms and left bare her shining shoulders beautiful as any sculptured psyches she was not conscious of degradation in her punishment she had been bidden to bow her head and endure the lash from the earliest years she could remember according to the only creed she knew silence and fortitude and strength were the greatest of all the virtues she stood now in the crosslights among the lilies as she had stood when a little child erect unquailing and ready to suffer insensible of humiliation because unconscious of sin and because so tutored by severity and exposure that she had as yet none of the shy shame and the fugitive shrinking of her sex she had only the boldness to bear the courage to be silent which she had had when she had stood among the same tall lilies in the same summer radiance in the years of her helpless infancy she uncovered herself to the lash as a brave hound crouches to it not from inborn cowardice but simply from the habit of obedience and of endurance he had ever used her as the greeks the helots he always beat her when she was in fault to teach her to be faultless and when without offense beat her to remind her that she was the offspring of humiliation and a slave he took as he had taken in an earlier time a thick rope which lay coiled upon the turf ready for the binding of some straying boughs and struck her with it slowly his arm had lost somewhat of its strength and his power was unequal to his will still rage for the loss of his copper pieces and the sense that she had discovered the fraudulent intention of his small knavery lent force to his feebleness as the scourge whistled through the air and descended on her shoulders it left bruised swollen marks to stamp its passage and curling adderlike bit and drew blood yet to the end she stood mute and motionless as she had stood in her childhood not a nerve quivered not a limb flinched the color rushed over her bent face and her bare bosom but she never made a movement she never gave a sound when his arm dropped from sheer exhaustion she still said not one word she drew tight once more the sash about her waist and fastened afresh the linen of her bodice the bruised and wounded flesh smarted and ached and throbbed but she was used to such pain and bore it as their wounds were borne by the women of the spartan games thy two sous have borne thee bitterness he muttered with a smile thou wilt scarce find fruit rotten again in haste there are bread and beans within go get a meal i want the mule to take flour to barbizene she did not go within to eat the bruises and the burning of her skin made her feel sick and weak she went away and cast herself at full length in the shade of the long grasses of the orchard resting her chin upon her hands cooling her aching breast against the soft damp moss thinking thinking thinking of what she hardly knew except indeed that she wished that she were dead like the bird she had covered with the rose leaves he did not leave her long to even so much peace as this his shrill voice soon called her from her rest he bade her get ready the mule and go she obeyed the mule was saddled with his wooden pack as many sacks as he could carry were piled upon the framework she put her hand upon his bridle and set out to walk to barbizene which was two leagues away work is the only thing to drive the devil that begat her out of her muttered the miller as he watched the old mule pace down the narrow treeshadowed road that led across the fields and he believed that he did rightly in this treatment of her it gratified the sharp hard cruelty of temper in him indeed but he did not think that in such selfindulgence he ever erred he was a bitter cunning miserly old man whose solitary tenderness of feeling and honesty of pride had been rooted out forever when he had learned the dishonor of the woman whom he had deemed a saint in the ten years of time which had passed since first the little brown largeeyed child had been sent to seek asylum with him he had grown harder and keener and more severe with each day that rose her presence was abhorrent to him though he kept her partly from a savage sense of duty partly from the persuasion that she had the power in her to make the strongest and the cheapest slave he had ever owned for the rest he sincerely and devoutly believed that the devil in some witchery of human guise had polluted his daughters body and soul and that it was by the foul fiend and by no earthly lover that she had conceived and borne the creature that now abode with him perhaps also as was but natural he sometimes felt more furious against this offspring of hell because ever and again some gleam of fantastic inborn honor some strange savage instinct of honesty would awake in her and oppose him and make him ashamed of those small and secret sins of chicanery wherein his soul delighted and for which he compounded with his gods he had left her mind a blank because he thought the body labored hardest when the brain was still asleep which is true she could not read she could not write she knew absolutely nothing yet there was a soul awake in her yet there were innumerable thoughts and dreams brooding in her fathomless eyes yet there was a desire in her fierce and unslacked for some other life than this life of the packhorse and of the day laborer which alone she knew he had done his best to degrade and to brutalize her and in much he had succeeded but he had not succeeded wholly there was a liberty in her that escaped his thraldom there was a soul in her that resisted the deadening influence of her existence she had none of the shame of her sex she had none of the timorous instincts of womanhood she had a fierce stubborn courage and she was insensible of the daily outrages of her life she would strip bare to his word obediently feeling only that it would be feeble and worthless to dread the pain of the lash she would bathe in the woodland pool remembering no more that she might be watched by human eyes than does the young tigress that has never beheld the face of man in all this she was brutalized and degraded by her tyrants bondage in other things she was far higher than he and escaped him stupefied as her mind might be by the exhaustion of severe physical labor it had still irony and it had still imagination and under the hottest heats of temptation there were two things which by sheer instinct she resisted and resisted so that neither of them had ever been forced on herthey were falsehood and fear it is the infamous strength of the devil said claudis flamma when he found that he could not force her to deviate from the truth the world says the same of those who will not feed it with lies chapter v that long dry summer was followed by an autumn of drought and scarcity the prayers of the priests and peoples failed to bring down rain the wooden christs gazed all day long on parching lands and panting cattle even the broad deep rivers shrank and left their banks to bake and stink in the long drought the orchards sickened for lack of moisture and the peasants went about with feverish faces aguestricken limbs and trembling hearts the corn yielded ill in the hard scorched ground and when the winter came it was a time of dire scarcity and distress claudis flamma and a few others like him alone prospered the millhouse at ypres served many purposes it was a granary a market a bakers shop an usurers den all in one it looked a simple and innocent place in the summertime it was peaceful and lovely green and dark and still with the blue sky above it and the songs of birds all around with its old black timbers its manycolored orchards its leafy gardens its gray walls washed by the hurrying stream but in the winter it was very dreary utterly lonely the water roared and the leafless trees groaned in the wind and the great leaden clouds of rain or fog enveloped it duskily to the starving wet and woebegone peasants who would go to it with aching bones and aching hearts it seemed desolate and terrible they dreaded with a great dread the sharp voice of its masterthe hardest and the shrewdest and the closestfisted norman of them all for they were most of them his debtors and so were in a bitter subjugation to him and had to pay those debts as best they might with their labor or their suffering with the best of all their wool or oil or fruit often with the last bit of silver that had been an heirloom for five centuries or with the last bit of money buried away in an old pitcher under their appletree to be the nestegg of their little pet daughters dowry and yet claudis flamma was respected among them for he could outwit them and was believed to be very wealthy and was a man who stood well with the good saints and with holy churcha wise man in a word with whom these northern folks had the kinship of mutual industry and avarice for the most part the population around ypres was thrifty and thriving in a cautious patient certain way of welldoing and by this portion of it the silent old miser was much honored as a man laborious and penurious who chose to live on a leek and a rye loaf but who must have it was well known put by large gains in the thatch of his roof or under the bricks of his kitchen by the smaller section of itpoor unthrifty loosehanded foolswho belied the province of their birth so far as to be quick to spend and slow to save and who so fell into want and famine and had to borrow of others their childrens bread the old miller was hated with a hate deeper and stronger because forced to be mute and to submit to cringe and to be trod upon in the miserable servitude of the hopeless debtor in the hard winter which followed on that sickly autumn these and their like fell further in the mire of poverty than ever and had to come and beg of flamma loans of the commonest necessaries of their bare living they knew that they would have to pay a hundredfold in horrible extortion when the spring and summer should bring them work and give them fruit on their trees and crops on their little fields but they could do no better it had been for many years the custom to go to flamma in such need and being never quit of his hold his debtors never could try for aid elsewhere the weather towards the season of noel became frightfully severe the mill stream never stopped but all around it was frozen and the swamped pastures were sheets of ice the birds died by thousands in the open country and several of the sheep perished in snowstorms on the higher lands there was dire want in many of the hovels and homesteads and the bare harvests of a district usually so opulent in all riches of the soil brought trouble and dearth in their train sickness prevailed because the old people and the children in their hunger ate berries and roots unfit for human food the waters swelled the ice melted many homes were flooded and some even swept away old pitchou and claudis flamma alone were content the mill wheel never stopped work and famine prices could be asked in this extremity follefarine worked all that winter day after day month after month with scarcely a word being spoken to her or scarcely an hour being left her that she could claim as her own she looked against the snow as strangely as a scarlet rose blossoming in frost there could have done but the people that came to and fro even the young men among them were too used to that dark vivid silent face of hers and those lithe brown limbs that had the supple play and the golden glow of the east in them to notice them as any loveliness and if they did note them on some rare time thought of them only as the marks of a vagrant and accursed race she was so unlike to themselves that the northern peasantry never dreamed of seeing beauty in her they turned their heads away when she went by striding after her mule or bearing her pitcher from the well with the free and vigorous grace of a mountain or desertborn creature the sheepskin girt about her loins the red kerchief knotted to her head the loose lithe movements of her beautiful limbs the fire and dreams in her musing eyesall these were so unlike themselves that they saw nothing in them except what was awful or unlovely half the winter went by without a kind word to her from any one except such as in that time of suffering and scarcity marcellin spoke to her so had every winter gone since she had come therea time so long ago that the memory of phratos had become so dim to her that she often doubted if he also were not a mere shadow of a dream like all the rest half the winter she fared hardly and ate sparingly and did the work of the mule and the bullocksindifferent and knowing no better and only staring at the stars when they throbbed in the black skies on a frosty night and wondering if she would ever go to them or if they would ever come to herthose splendid and familiar unknown things that looked on all the misery of the earth and shone on tranquilly and did not seem to care time came close on to the new year and the distress and the cold were together at their height the weather was terrible and the poor suffered immeasurably a score of times aday she heard them ask bread at the mill and a score of times saw them given a stone she saw them come in the raw fog pinched and shivering and sick with ague and she saw her grandsire deny them with a grating sarcasm or two or take from them fifty times its value for some niggard grant of food why should i think of it why should i care she said to herself and yet she did both and could not help it there was among the sufferers one old and poor who lived not far from the mill by name manon dax she was a little old hardy brown woman shriveled and bent yet strong with bright eyes like a robins and a tough frame eighty years old she had been southern born and the wife of a stonecutter he had been dead fifty years and she had seen all her sons and daughters and their offspring die too and had now left on her hand to rear four young greatgrandchildren almost infants who were always crying to her for food as newborn birds cry in their nests she washed a little when she could get any linen to wash and she span and she picked up the acorns and the nuts and she tilled a small plot of ground that belonged to her hut and she grew cabbages and potatoes and herbs on it and so kept a roof over her head and fed her four nestlings and trotted to and fro in her wooden shoes all day long and worked in hail and rain in drought and tempest and never complained but said that god was good to her she was anxious about the children knowing she could not live longthat was all but then she felt sure that the mother of god would take care of them and so was cheerful and did what the day brought her to do and was content now on manon dax as on thousands of others the unusual severity of the winter fell like a knife she was only one among thousands nobody noticed her still it was hard all the springs near her dwelling were frozen for many weeks there was no well nearer than half a league and half a league out and half a league back every day over ground sharp and slippery with ice with two heavy pails to carry is not a little when one is over eighty and has only a wisp of woolen serge between the wind and ones withered limbs the acorns and horsechestnuts had all been disputed with her fiercely by boys rough and swift who foresaw a hard time coming in which their pigs would be ill fed the roots in her little gardenplot were all black and killed by the cold the nettles had been all gathered and stewed and eaten the snow drove in through a big hole in her roof the woods were ransacked for every bramble and broken bough by rievers younger and more agile than herself she had nothing to eat nothing to burn the children lay in their little beds of hay and cried all day long for food and she had none to give them if it were only myself she thought stopping her ears not to hear them if it had been only herself it would have been so easy to creep away into the corner among the dry grass and to lie still till the cold froze the pains of hunger and made them quiet and to feel numb and tired and yet glad that it was all over and to murmur that god was good and so to let death comecontent but it was not only herself the poor are seldom so fortunatethey themselves would say so unhappyas to be alone in their homes there were the four small lives left to her by the poor dead foolish things she had lovedsmall lives that had been rosy even on so much hunger and blithe even amidst so much cold that had been mirthful even at the flooding of the snowdrift and happy even over a meal of mouldy crusts or of hips and haws from the hedges had beenuntil now when even so much as this could not be got and when their beds of hay were soaked through with snowwater nowwhen they were quite silent except when they sobbed out a cry for bread i am eightytwo years old and i have never since i was born asked man or woman for help or owed man or woman a copper coin she thought sitting by her black hearth across which the howling wind drove and stopping her ears to shut out the childrens cries she had often known severe winters scanty food bitter livingshe had scores of times in her long years been as famished as this and as cold and her house had been as desolate yet she had borne it all and never asked for an alms being strong and ignorant and being also in fear of the world and holding a debt a great shame but now she knew that she must do it or let those children perish being herself old and past work and having seen all her sons die out in their strength before her the struggle was long and hard with her she would have to die soon she knew and she had striven all her lifetime so to live that she might die saying i have asked nothing of any man this perhaps she thought sadly had been only a pride after all a feeling foolish and wicked that the good god sought now to chasten any way she knew that she must yield it up and go and ask for something or else those four small things who were like a cluster of red berries on a leafless tree must suffer and must perish it is bitter but i must do it she thought sure it is strange that the good god cares to take any of us to himself through so sharp a way as hunger it seems if i saw his face now i should say not heaven for me monseigneur only bread and a little wood and she rose up on her bent stiff limbs and went to the pile of hay on which the children were lying pale and thin but trying to smile all of them because they saw the tears on her cheeks be still my treasures she said to them striving to speak cheerily and laying her hands on the curls of the eldest born i go away for a little while to try and get you food be good bernardou and take care of them till i come back bernardou promised being four years old himself and she crept out of the little black door of the hut on to the white road and into the rushing winds i will go to flamma she said to herself it was three in the afternoon nearly dark at this season of midwinter the business of the day was done the people had come and gone favored or denied according to such sureties as they could offer the great wheel worked on in the seething water the master of the mill sat against the casement to catch the falling light adding up the sums in his ledgercrooked little signs such as he had taught himself to understand though he could form neither numerals nor letters with his pen all around him in the storehouses there were corn wood wool stores of every sort of food all around him in the room he lived in there were hung the salt meats the sweet herbs and the dried fruits that he had saved from the profusion of other and healthier years it pleased him to know that he held all that and also withheld it it moved him with a certain saturnine glee to see the hungry wistful eyes of the peasants stare longingly at all those riches whilst their white lips faltered out an entreatywhich he denied it was what he liked to sit there and count his gains after his fashion and look at his stores and listen to the howling wind and driving hail and chuckle to think how lean and cold and sick they were outsidethose fools who mocked him because his saint had been a gypsys leman to be prayed to for bread and give the stone of a bitter denial to be implored with tears of supplication and answer with a grim jest to see a woman come with children dying for food and to point out to her the big brass pans full of milk and say to her all that makes butter for paris and then see her go away wailing and moaning that her child would die and tottering feebly through the snowall this was sweet to him before his daughter had gone from him he had been though a hard man yet honest and had been though severe not cruel but since he had been aware of the shame of the creature whom he had believed in as an angel every fiber in him had been embittered and salted sharp with the poignancy of an acrid hate towards all living things to hurt and to wound and to see what he thus struck bleed and suffer was the only pleasure life had left for him he had all his manhood walked justly according to his light and trusted in the god to whom he prayed and his god and his child had denied and betrayed him and his heart had turned to gall the old woman toiled slowly through the roads which lay between her hut and the watermill they were roads which passed through meadows and along cornfields beside streamlets and among little belts of woodland lanes and paths green and pleasant in the summer but now a slough of frozen mud and whistled through by northeast winds she held on her way steadily stumbling often and often slipping and going slowly for she was very feeble from long lack of food and the intensity of the cold drove through and through her frame still she held on bravely in the teeth of the rough winds and of the coming darkness though the weather was so wild that the poplartrees were bent to the earth and the little light in the calvary lamp by the river blew to and fro and at last died out still she held on a little dark tottering figure with a prayer on her lips and a hope in her heart the snow was falling the clouds were driving the waters were roaring in the twilight she was only a little black speck in the vast gray waste of the earth and the sky and the furious air tossed her at times to and fro like a withered leaf but she would not let it beat her she groped her way with infinite difficulty grasping a bough for strength or waiting under a tree for breath a moment and thus at last reached the millhouse such light as there was left showed her the kitchen within the stores of wood the strings of food it looked to her as it had looked to phratos a place of comfort and of plenty a strong safe shelter from the inclement night she lifted the latch and crept in and went straight to claudis flamma who was still busy beneath the window with those rude signs which represented to him his earthly wealth she stood before him white from the falling snow with her brown face working with a strong emotion her eyes clear and honest and full of an intense anxiety of appeal flamma she said simply to him we have been neighbors fifty years and morethou and i and many have borrowed of thee to their hurt and shame but i never i am eightytwo and i never in my days asked anything of man or woman or child but i come tonight to ask bread of youbread for the four little children at home i have heard them cry three days and have had nothing to give them save a berry or two off the trees i cannot bear it any more so i have come to you he shut his ledger and looked at her they had been neighbors as she had said half a century and more and had often knelt down before the same altar side by side what dost want he asked simply food she made answer food and fuel they are so coldthe little ones what canst pay for them he asked nothingnothing now there is not a thing in the house except the last hay the children sleep on but if thou wilt let me have a littlejust a littlewhile the weather is so hard i will find means to pay when the weather breaks there is my garden and i can wash and spin i will pay faithfully thou knowest i never owed a brass coin to any man but i am so old and the children so young claudis flamma got up and walked to the other side of the kitchen her eyes followed him with wistful hungry longing where he went there stood pans of new milk baskets of eggs rolls of bread piles of fagots her feeble heart beat thickly with eager hope her dim eyes glowed with pleasure and with thankfulness he came back and brought to her a few sharp rods plucked from a thorntree give these to thy childrens children he said with a dark smile for theseand for no morewill they recompense thee when they shall grow to maturity she looked at him startled and disquieted yet thinking that he meant but a stern jest good flamma you mock me she murmured trembling the babies are little and good ah give me food quickly for gods sake a jest is well in season but to an empty body and a bitter heart it is like a stripe he smiled and answered her in his harsh grating voice i give thee the only thing given without payment in this worldadvice take it or leave it she reeled a little as if he had struck her a blow with his fist and her face changed terribly whilst her eyes stared without light or sense in them you jest flamma you only jest she muttered the little children starve i tell you you will give me bread for them just a little bread i will pay as soon as the weather breaks i can give nothing i am poor very poor he answered her with the habitual lie of the miser and he opened his ledger again and went on counting up the dots and crosses by which he kept his books his servant pitchou sat spinning by the hearth she did not cease her work nor intercede by a word the poor can be better to the poor than any princes but the poor can also be more cruel to the poor than any slavedrivers the old womans head dropped on her breast she turned feebly and felt her way as though she were blind out of the house and into the air it was already dark with the darkness of the descending night the snow was falling fast her hope was gone all was coldcold as death she shivered and gasped and strove to totter on the children were alone the winds blew and drove the snowflakes in a white cloud against her face the bending trees creaked and groaned as though in pain the roar of the millwater filled the air there was now no light the day was gone and the moon was hidden beneath her feet the frozen earth cracked and slipped and gave way she fell down being so old and so weakly she could not rise again but lay still with one limb broken under her and the winds and the snowstorm beating together upon her the children the children she moaned feebly and then was still she was so cold and the snow fell so fast she could not lift herself nor see what was around her she thought that she was in her bed at home and felt as though she would soon sleep through the dense gloom around her there came a swiftlymoving shape that flew as silently and as quickly as a nightbird and paused as though on wings beside her a voice that was at once timid and fierce tender and savage spoke to her through the clouds of driven snowspray hush it is i ifollefarine i have brought you my food it is not muchthey never give me much still it will help a little i heard what you saidi was in the loft flamma must not know he might make you pay but it is all mine truly mine take it foodfor the children the blessed word aroused her from her lethargy she raised herself a little on one arm and tried to see whence the voice came that spoke to her but the effort exhausted her she fell again to the ground with a groanher limb was broken follefarine stood above her her dark eyes gleaming like a hawks through the gloom and full of a curious startled pity you cannot get up you are old she said abruptly seelet me carry you home the children yes the children can have it it is not much but it will serve she spoke hastily and roughly she was ashamed of her own compassion what was it to her whether any of these people lived or died they had always mocked and hated her if i did right i should let them rot and spit on their corpses she thought with the ferocity of vengeance that ran in her oriental blood yet she had come out in the storm and had brought away her food for strangers though she had been at work all day long and was chilled to the bone and was devoured with ravenous hunger why did she do it she did not know she scorned herself but she was sorry for this woman so poor and so brave with her eightytwo years and so bitterly denied in her extremity manon dax dimly caught the muttered words and feebly strove to answer them whilst the winds roared and the snow beat upon her fallen body i cannot rise she murmured my leg is broken i think but it is no matter go you to the little ones whoever you are you are good and have pity go to them go it is no matter for me i have lived my lifeanyway it will soon be over i am not in painindeed follefarine stood in silence a minute then she stooped and lifted the old creature in her strong young arms and with that heavy burden set out on her way in the teeth of the storm she had long known the woman and the grandchildren by sight and name once or twice when she had passed by them the grandam tender of heart but narrow of brain and believing all the tales of her neighbors had drawn the little ones closer to her under the wing of her serge cloak lest the evil eye that had bewitched the tanners youngest born should fall on them and harm them in like manner nevertheless the evil eyes gleamed on her with a wistful sorrow as follefarine bore her with easy strength and a sure step through the frozen woodland ways as she would have borne the load of wood or the sacks of corn that she was so well used to carry to and fro like a packhorse manon dax did not stir nor struggle she did not even strive to speak again she was vaguely sensible of a slow buoyant painless movement of a close soft pressure that sheltered her from the force of the winds of a subtle warmth that stole through her emaciated aching frame and made her drowsy and forgetful and content to be still she could do no more her day for struggle and for work was done once she moved a little her bearer paused and stopped and listened did you speak she whispered manon dax gave a soft troubled sigh god is good she muttered like one speaking in a dream follefarine held on her way fiercely blown blinded by the snow pierced by the blasts of the hurricane but sure of foot on the ice as a reindeer and sure of eye in the dark as a nighthawk are you in pain she asked once of the burden she carried there was no answer old manon seemed to sleep the distance of the road was nothing to her fleet and firm of step and inured to all hardships of the weather yet short as it was it cost her an hour to travel it heavily weighted as she was soaked with snowwater blown back continually by the opposing winds and forced to stagger and to pause by the fury of the storm at last she reached the hut the wind had driven open the door the wailing cries of the children echoed sorrowfully on the stillness answered by the bleating of sheep cold and hungry in their distant folds the snow had drifted in unchecked all was quite dark she felt her way within and being used by long custom to see in the gloom as the nighthaunting beasts and birds can see she found the bed of hay and laid her burden gently down on it the children ceased their wailing and the two eldest ones crept up close to their grandmother and pressed their cheeks to hers and whispered to her eagerly with their little famished lips where is the food where is the food but there was still no answer the clouds drifted a little from the moon that had been so long obscured it shone for a moment through the vapor of the heavy sky the whitened ground threw back the rays increased tenfold the pale gleam reached the old still face of manon dax there was a feeble smile upon itthe smile with which her last words had been spoken in the darkness god is good she was quite dead chapter vi all that night follefarine tarried with the children the youngest had been suffocated whilst they had been alone by the snow which had fallen through the roof and from which its elders had been too small and weakly to be able to drag it out unaided she laid it stiff already in the cold of the night beside the body of its old grandam who had perished in endeavoring to save it they lay together the yearold child and the aged woman the broken bud and the leafless bough they had died of hunger as the birds die on the moors and plains it is a common fate she stayed beside the children who were frightened and bewildered and quite mute she divided such food as she had brought between them not taking any herself she took off the sheepskin which she wore in winter tied round her loins as her outdoor garment and made a little nest of it for the three and covered them with it she could not close the door from the height of the drifted snow and the wind poured in all night long though in an hour the snow ceased to fall now and then the clouds parting a little let a ray of the moon stray in and then she could see the quiet faces of the old dead woman and the child they die of famineand they die saying their god is good she thought and she pondered on it deeply and with the bitter and melancholy irony which life had already taught her while the hours of the night dragged slowly on the winds howled above the trembling hovel and the children sobbed themselves to sleep at last lulled by the warmth of the skin into which they crept together like young birds in a nest she sat there patiently frozen and ravenous yet not drawing a corner of the sheepskin to her own use nor regretting a crumb of the bread she had surrendered she hated the human race whose hand was always against her she had no single good deed to thank them for nor any single gentle word yet she was sorry for that old creature who had been so bitterly dealt with all her years through and who had died saying god is good she was sorry for those little helpless unconscious starving animals who had lost the only life that could labor for them she forgavebecause she forgotthat in other winters this door had been shut against her as against an accursed thing and these babes had mocked her in their first imperfect speech the dawn broke the sharp gray winters day came the storm had lulled but the whole earth was frostbound and white with snow and the air was piercing and the sky dark and overcast she had to leave them she was bound to her daily labor at the mill she knew that if when the sun rose she should be found absent she and they too would surely suffer what to do for them she could not tell she had no friend save marcellin who himself was as poor as these she never spoke to any living thing except a sheepdog or a calf bleating for its mother or a toilworn bullock staggering over the plowed clods between her and all those around her there were perpetual enmity and mistrust and scarcely so much of a common bond as lies in a common humanity for in her title to a common humanity with them they disbelieved while she in her scorn rejected claim to it at daybreak there passed by the open door in the mist a peasant going to his cattle in the fields beyond pushing through the snow a rude handcart full of turnips and other winter food she rose and called to him he stared and stood still she went to the doorway and signed to him old manon dax is dead will you tell the people the children are here alone and they starve manon dax dead he echoed stupidly he was her nearest neighbor he had helped her fetch her washingwater sometimes from the well half a league away when his wife had been down with fever and ague the old woman had nursed her carefully and well through many a tedious month yes i found her on the road in the snow last night she had broken her leg and she was dead before i got here go and send some one the little children are all alone and one of them is dead too it was so dark still that he had not seen at first who it was that addressed him but slowly as he stared and stared and drew nearer to her he recognized the scarlet girdle the brown limbs the straight brow the fathomless eyes and he feared her with a great fear rising there suddenly before him out of that still white world of dawn and shadow he dropped the handles of his cart and fled a turn in the road and the darkness of the morning soon hid him from sight she thought that he had gone to summon his people and she went back and sat again by the sleeping children and watched the sad still faces of the dead the peasant flew home as swiftly as his heavy shoes and the broken ice of the roads would allow his cabin was at some distance at a place where amidst the fields a few huts a stone crucifix some barns and stacks and a single wineshop made up a little village celebrated in the district for its widespreading orchards and their excellence of fruits even so early the little hamlet was awake the shutters were opened the people were astir men were brushing the snow from their thresholds women were going out to their fieldwork behind the narrow lattices the sleepyeyes and curly heads of children peered while their fingers played with the fanciful incrustations of the frost the keeper of the tavern was unbarring his house door a girl broke the ice in a pool for her ducks to get at the water a few famished robins flew to and fro songless his own wife was on her doorstep to her he darted manon dax is dead he shouted what of that said his wife shouldering her broom a great many had died that winter and they were so poor and sharpset with famine themselves that they had neither bread nor pity to spare this of that said the man doggedly and full of the excitement of his own terrors the young devil of ypres has killed her that i am sure she is there in the hut in the dark with her eyes glaring like coals and for what should she be there if not for evil tell me that is it possible his wife cried incredulous yet willing to believe while the girl left her ducks and the wineshopkeeper his door and the women their cabins and came and stood round the bearer of such strange news it was very welcome news in a raw frostbitten dawn when a day was beginning that would otherwise have had nothing more wonderful in it than tidings of how a litter of black pigs throve and how a brown horse had fared with the swelling in the throat they were very dull there from years end to years end once a month maybe a letter would come in from some soldierson or brother or a peddler coming to buy eggs would bring likewise some stray rumor from the outer worldbeyond this there was no change they heard nothing and saw nothing seldom moving a league away from that gray stone crucifix round which their little homes were clustered this man had nothing truly to tell he had fled horrified to be challenged in the twilight and the snow by a creature of such evil omen as follefarine but when he had got an audience he was too true an orator and not such a fool as to lose it for such a little beggarly matter as truth and his tongue clacked quickly of all which his fears and fancies had conceived until he had talked himself and his listeners into the full belief that manon dax being belated had encountered the evil glance of the daughter of all evil and had been slain thereby in most cruel sorcery now in the whole neighborhood there was nothing too foul to be accredited of the begotten of the fienda fiend whom all the grown men and women remembered so well in his earthly form when he had come to ruin poor reine flammas body and soul with his eyes like jewels and his strength passing the strength of all men the people listened gaping and wonderstruck and forgetting the bitterness of the cold being warmed with those unfailing human cordials of foul suspicion and of gratified hatred some went off to their daily labor being unable to spare time for more gossip but divers women who had nothing to occupy them remained about flandrin a shriveled dame who owned the greatest number of broodhens in the village who had only one son a priest and who was much respected and deferred to by her neighbors spoke first when flandrin had ended his tale for the seventh time it being a little matter to him that his two hungry cows would be lowing all the while vainly for their morning meal flandrin you have said well beyond a doubt the good soul has been struck dead by sorcery but you have forgot one thing the children are there and that devil of ypres is with them wegood christians and trueshould not let such things be go and drive her out and bring the young ones hither flandrin stood silent it was very well to say that the devil should be driven out but it was not so well to be the driver that is as it should be assented the other women go flandrin and wewe will take the little souls in for this day and then give them to the public charity better cannot be done go but mind that thou dost strike that beast follefarine sharply cried his wife if thou showest her the cross she will have to grovel and flee said another not she grumbled the old dame whose son was a priest one day my blessed son who is nearly a saint heaven knows menaced her with his cross and she stood straight and fearless and looked at it and said by that sign you do all manner of vileness in this world and say you are to be blest in another i know and so laughed and went on what are you to do with a witch like thateh go flandrin shrieked the women in chorus go every minute you waste the little angels are nearer to hell come yourselves with me then said flandrin sullenly i will not go after those infants it is not a mans work in his own mind he was musing on a story his priests had often told him of swine into which exorcised devils had entered and dispatched swiftly down a slope to a miserable end and he thought of his own pigs black fat and happy worth so much to him in the market better he mused that manon daxs grandchildren should be the devils prey than those his choicest swine the women jeered him menaced him flouted him besought him but vainlyhe would not move alone he had become possessed with the terrors that his own fancy had created and he would not stir a step for all their imprecations let us go ourselves then screamed his wife at length flourishing above her head the broom with which she had swept the snow men are forever cowards it shall never be said of me that i left those babes to the fiend while i gave my own children their porridge by the fire there was a sentiment in this that stirred all her companions to emulation they rushed into their homes snatched a shovel a staff a broom a pegstick each whatever came uppermost and dragging flandrin in the midst went down the sloping frozen road between its fringe of poplars they were not very sure in their own minds why they went nor for what they went but they had a vague idea of doing what was wise and pious and they had a great hate in their hearts against her they sped as fast as the slippery road would let them and their tongues flew still faster than their feet the cold of the daybreak made them sharp and keen on their prey they screamed themselves hoarse their voices rising shrilly above the whistling of the winds and the creaking of the trees and they inflamed each other with ferocious belief in the sorcery they were to punish they were in their way virtuous they were content on very little they toiled hard from their birth to their grave they were most of them chaste wives and devoted mothers they bore privation steadily and they slaved in fair weather and foul without a complaint but they were narrow of soul greedy of temper bigoted and uncharitable and where they thought themselves or their offspring menaced implacable they were of the stuff that would be burned for a creed and burn others for another creed it is the creed of the vast majority of every nation the priests and lawgivers of every nation have always told their people that it is a creed holy and honorablehow can the people know that it is at once idiotic and hellish follefarine sat within on the damp hay under the broken roof and watched the open door the children were still asleep the eldest one in his sleep had turned and caught her hand and held it she did not care for them they had screamed and run behind the woodstack or their grandams skirts a hundred times when they had seen her on the road or in the orchard but she was sorry for them almost as sorry as she was for the little naked woodpigeons when their nests were scattered on the ground in a tempest or for the little starveling rabbits when they screamed in their holes for the soft white mother that was lying tortured and twisted in the jaws of a steel trap she was sorry for themhalf roughly half tenderlywith some shame at her own weakness and yet too sincerely sorry to be able to persuade herself to leave them to their fate there all alone with their dead for in the savage heart of tarics daughter there was an innermost corner wherein her mothers nature slept she sat there quite still watching the open porch and listening for footsteps the snow was driven in circling clouds by the winds the dense fog of the dawn lifted itself off the surrounding fields the branches of the trees were beautiful with hanging icicles from the meadow hard by there wailed unceasingly the mournful moaning of flandrins cattle deserted of their master and hungry in their wooden sheds she heard a distant convent clock strike six no one came yet she had resolved not to leave the children all alone though flamma should come and find her there and thrash her for her absence from his tasks so she sat still and waited after a little she heard the crisp cracking of many feet on the frozen snow and icefilled ruts of the narrow road she heard a confused clatter of angry voices breaking harshly on the stillness of the winter morning the light was stronger now and through the doorway she saw the little passionate crowd of angry faces as the women pressed onward down the hill with flandrin in their midst she rose and looked out at them quietly for a minute they pausedirresolute silent perplexed at the sight of her they were half daunted they felt the vagueness of the crime they came to bring against her the wife of flandrin recovered speech first and dared them to the onslaught what she screamed nine good christians fearful of one daughter of hell fie for shame look my leaden peter is round my neck is he not stronger than she any day in a moment more thus girded at and guarded at the same time they were through the door and on the mud floor of the hearth close to her casting hasty glances at the poor dead body on the hearth whose fires they had left to die out all through that bitter winter they came about her in a fierce gesticulating breathless troop flourishing their sticks in her eyes and casting at her a thousand charges in one breath flandrin stood a little aloof sheepishly on the threshold wishing he had never said a word of the death of manon dax to his good wife and neighbors you met that poor saint and killed her in the snow with your witcheries one cried you have stifled that poor babe where it lay cried another a good woman like that shrieked a third who was well and blithe and praising god only a day ago for i saw her myself come down the hill for our well water it is as you did with the dear little remy who will be lame all his life through you hissed a fourth you are not fit to live you spit venom like a toad are you alive my angels said a fifth waking the three children noisily and rousing their piercing cries are you alive after that witch has gazed on you it is a miracle the saints be praised follefarine stood mute and erect for the moment not comprehending why they thus with one accord fell upon her she pointed to the bodies on the hearth with one of those grave and dignified gestures which were her birthright she was cold and hungry she said curtly her mellow accent softening and enriching the provincial tongue which she had learned from those amidst whom she dwelt she had fallen and was dying i brought her here the young child was killed by the snow i stayed with the rest because they were frightened and alone there is no more to tell what of it thou hadst better come away what canst thou prove whispered flandrin to his wife he was afraid of the storm he had invoked and would fain have stilled it but that was beyond his power the women had not come forth half a league in the howling winds of a midwinter daybreak only to go back with a mere charity done and with no vengeance taken they hissed they screamed they hurled their rage at her they accused her of a thousand crimes they filled the hut with clamor as of a thousand tongues they foamed they spat they struck at her with their sticks and she stood quiet looking at them and the old dead face of manon dax lay upward in the dim light the eldest boy struggled in the grasp of the peasant woman who had seized him and stretched his arms instead to the one who had fed him and whose hand he had held all through his restless slumber in that long and dreary night the woman covered his eyes with a scream ahh she moaned see how the innocent child is bewitched it is horrible look on thatoh infernal thing cried flandrins wife lifting up her treasured figure of peter you dare not face that blessed image seesee all of youhow she winces and turns white follefarine had shrunk a little as the child had called her its gesture of affection was the first that she had ever seen towards her in any human thing she laughed aloud as the image of peter was thrust in her face she saw it was some emblem and idol of their faith devoutly cherished she stretched her hand out wrenched it away trampled on it and tossed it through the doorway into the snow where it sank and disappeared then she folded her arms and waited for them there was a shriek at the blasphemy of the impious act then they rushed on her they came inflamed with all the fury which abject fear and bigoted hatred can beget in minds of the lowest and most brutal type they were strong rude ignorant fanatical peasants and they abhorred her and they believed no child of theirs to be safe in its bed while she walked alive abroad beside such women when in wrath and riot the tiger and the hyena are as the lamb and the dove they set on her with furious force they flung her they trod on her they beat her they kicked her with their woodshod feet with all the malignant fury of the female animal that fights for its offsprings and its own security strong though she was and swift and full of courage she had no power against the numbers who had thrown themselves on her and borne her backward by dint of their united effort and held her down to work their worst on her she could not free herself to return their blows nor lift herself to wrestle with them she could only deny them the sweetness of wringing from her a single cry and that she did she was mute while the rough hands flew at her the sticks struck at her the heavy feet were driven against her body and the fierce fingers clutched at her hair and twisted and tore itshe was quite mute throughout prick her in the breast and see if the devil be still in her i have heard say there is no better way to test a witch cried flandrins wife writhing in rage for the outrage to the petrus her foes needed no second bidding they had her already prostrate in their midst and a dozen eager violent hands seized a closer grip upon her pulled her clothes from her chest and holding her down on the mud floor searched with ravenous eyes for the signet marks of hell the smooth soft skin baffled them its rich and tender hues were without spot or blemish what matterwhat matter hissed rose flandrin when our fathers hunted witches in the old time did they stop for that draw blood and you will see she clutched a jagged rusty nail from out the wall and leaned over her prey it is the only babe that will ever cling to thee she cried with a laugh as the nail drew blood above the heart still follefarine made no sound and asked no mercy she was powerless defenseless flung on her back amidst her tormentors fastened down by treading feet and clinching hands she could resist in nothing she could not stir a limb still she kept silence and her proud eyes looked unquailing into the hateful faces bent to hers the muscles and nerves of her body quivered with a mighty pang her chest heaved with the torture of indignity her heart fluttered like a wounded birdnot at the physical pain but at the shame of these womens gaze the loathsome contact of their hands the iron pierced deeper but they could not make her speak except for her eyes which glowed with a dusky fire as they glanced to and fro seeking escape she might have been a statue of olivewood flung down by ruffians to make a bonfire if one were to drive the nail to the head she would not feel cried the women in furious despair and were minded almost to put her to that uttermost test suddenly from the doorway flandrin raised an alarm there is our notary close at hand on the road on his mule hist come out quickly you know how strict he is and how he forbids us ever to try and take the law into our own keeping quickas you love your livesquick the furies left their prey and scattered and fled the notary was a name of awe to them for he was a severe man but just they seized the children went out with them into the road closed the hut door behind them and moved down the hill the two younger wailing sadly and the eldest trying to get from them and go back the women looked mournful and held their heads down and comforted the little ones flandrin himself went to his cattle in the meadow is anything amiss the old whitehaired notary asked stopping his gray mule at sight of the little cavalcade the women weeping told him that manon dax was dead and the youngest infant likewiseof cold in the night as they supposed they dared to say no more for he had many times rebuked them for their lack of charity and their bigoted cruelties and superstitions and they were quaking with fear lest he should by any chance enter the cottage and see their work flandrin going to his cow saw her first and he came to us and told us they added crossing themselves fervently and hushing little bernardou who wanted to get from them and return and we have taken the poor little things to carry them home we are going to give them food and warm them awhile by the stove and then we shall come back and do all that is needful for the beloved dead who are within that is well that is good and neighborly of you said the notary who liked them having married them all and registered all their childrens births and who was a good old man though stern he promised them to see for his part that all needed by the law and by the church should be done for their old lost neighbor and then he urged his mule into a trot for he had been summoned to a rich mans sickbed in that early winter morning and was in haste lest the priest should be beforehand with him there how tender the poor are to the poor those people have not bread enough for themselves and yet they burden their homes with three strange mouths their hearts must be true at the core if their tongues sometimes be foul he mused as he rode the mule down through the fog the women went on carrying and dragging the children with them in a sullen impatience to think we should have had to leave that fiend of ypres they muttered in their teeth well there is one thing she will not get over the hurt for days her bones will be stiff for many a week that will teach her to leave honest folk alone and they traversed the road slowly muttering to one another hold thy noise thou little pig cried flandrins wife pushing bernardou on before her hold thy noise i tell you or i will put you in the black box in a hole in the ground along with thy greatgrandmother but bernardou wept aloud refusing to be comforted or terrified into silence he was old enough to know that never more would the old kindly withered brown face bend over him as he woke in the morning nor the old kindly quavering voice croon him country ballads and cradle songs at twilight by the bright wood fire little by little the women carrying the children crept down the slippery slope half ice and half mud in the thaw and entered their own village and therein were much praised for their charity and courage for when they praise as when they abuse villages are loud of voice and blind of eye almost as much as are the cities their tongues and those of their neighbors clacked all day long noisily and bravely of their good and their great deeds they had all the sanctity of martyrdom and all the glory of victory in one true they have left all their house and fieldwork half done but the holy peter will finish it in his own good time and avenge himself for his outrage mused the wife of flandrin sorrowing over her lost petrus in the snowdrift and boxing the ears of little bernardou to make him cease from his weeping where he was huddled in her chimney corner when they went back with their priest at noon to the hut of old manon dax to make her ready for her burial they trembled inwardly lest they should find their victim there and lest she should lift up her voice in accusation against them their hearts misgave them sorely their priest a cobblers son almost as ignorant as themselves save that he could gabble a few morsels of bad latin would be they knew on their side but they were sensible that they had let their fury hurry them into acts that could easily be applauded by their neighbors but not so easily justified to the law for the law is overgood said rose flandrin and takes the part of all sorts of vile creatures it will protect a rogue a brigand a bullock a dog a witch a devilanythingexcept now and then an honest woman but their fears were groundless she was gone the hut when they entered it had no tenants except the lifeless famished bodies of the old grandam and the yearold infant when follefarine had heard the hut door close and the steps of her tormentors die away down the hill she had tried vainly several times to raise herself from the floor and had failed she had been so suddenly attacked and flung down and trampled on that her brain had been deadened and her senses had gone for the first sharp moment of the persecution as she lifted herself slowly and staggered to her feet and saw the blood trickle where the nail had pierced her breast she understood what had happened to her her face grew savage and dark her eyes fierce and lustful like the eyes of some wild beast rising wounded in his lair it was not for the hurt she cared it was the shame of defeat and outrage that stung her like a whip of asps she stood awhile looking at the face of the woman she had aided i tried to help you she thought i was a fool i might have known how they pay any good done to them she was not surprised her mind had been too deadened by a long course of ill usage to feel any wonder at the treatment she had been repaid with she hated them with the mute unyielding hatred of her race but she hated herself more because she had yielded to the softness of sorrow and pity for any human thing and more still because she had not been armed and on her guard and had suffered them to prevail and to escape without her vengeance i will never come out without a knife in my girdle again she thoughtthis was the lesson that her charity had brought her as its teaching she went out hardening her heart as she crept through the doorway into the snow and the wind so that she should not leave one farewell word or token of gentleness with the dead that lay there so tranquil on the ashes of the hearth she lied even in her last breath thought follefarine she said that her god was good she could hardly keep on her own homeward way all her limbs were stiff and full of pain the wound in her chest was scarcely more than skin deep yet it smarted sorely and bled still her brain was dull and her ears filled with strange noises from the force with which she had been flung backward on her head she had given her sheepskin to the children as before her phratos had done and the peasants had carried the youngest of them away in it the sharpness of the intense cold froze the blood in her as she crawled through a gap in the poplar hedge and under the whitened brambles and grasses beyond to get backward to the mill by the path that ran through the woods and pastures the sun had risen but was obscured by fog through which it shed a dull red ray here and there above the woods in the east it was a bitter morning and the wind though it had abated was still rough and drove the snow in clouds of powder hither and thither over the fields she could only move very slowly the thorns tearing her the snow blinding her the icicles lacerating her bare feet as she moved she wondered dimly why she lived it seemed to her that the devil when he had made her must have made her out of sport and cruelty and then tossed her into the world to be a scapegoat and a football for any creature that might need one that she might end her own life never occurred to her her intelligence was not awake enough to see that she need not bear its burden one hour more so long as there was one pool in the woods deep enough to drown her under its green weeds and lily leaves any cool summer night or that she had but to lie down then and there where she was on the snow beneath the icedropping trees and let the sleep that weighed on her eyelids come dreamless and painless and there would be an end of all for her as for the frozen rabbits and the birds that strewed the upland meadows starved and stiff she did not knowand had she known wretched though existence was to her death would not have allured her she saw that the dead might be slapped on their cheek and could not lift their arm to strike againa change that would not give her vengeance could have had no sweetness and no succor for her the change she wanted was to live and not to die by tedious and painful efforts she dragged herself home by the way of the lanes and pastures hungry lame bleeding cold and miserable her eyes burning like flame her hands and her head hot with fever she made her way into the millyard and tried to commence her first mornings work the drawing of water from the well for the beasts and for the house and the sweeping down of the old wide court round which the sheds and storehouses ran she never dreamed of asking either for food or pity either for sympathy or remission of her labors she set to work at once but for the only time since phratos had brought her thither the strength and vigor of her frame had been beaten she was sick and weak her hand sank off the handle of the windlass and she dropped stupidly on the stone edge of the well and sat there leaning her head on her hands the mastiff came and licked her face tenderly the pigeons left the meal flung to them on the snow and flew merrily about her head in pretty fluttering caresses the lean cat came and rubbed its cheek softly against her purring all the while the woman pitchou saw her and she called out of the window to her master flamma there is thy gadabout who has not been abed all night the old man heard and came out of his mill to the well in the courtyard where hast been he asked sharply of her pitchou says thou hast not lain in thy bed all night long is it so follefarine lifted her head slowly with a dazed stupid pain in her eyes yes it is true she answered doggedly and where hast been then he asked through his clinched teeth enraged that his servant had been quicker of eye and of ear than himself a little of her old dauntless defiance gleamed in her face through its stupor and languor as she replied to him with effort in brief phrases i went after old manon dax to give her my supper she died in the road and i carried her home the youngest child was dead too i stayed there because the children were alone i called to flandrin and told him he came with his wife and other women and they said i had killed old dax they set on me and beat me and pricked me for a witch it is no matter but it made me late in her glance upward even in the curtness of her words there was an unconscious glimmer of appeala vague fancy that for once she might perhaps meet with approval and sympathy instead of punishment and contempt she had never heard a kind word from him nor one of any compassion and yet a dim unuttered hope was in her heart that for once he might condemn her persecutors and pardon her but the hope was a vain one like all which she had cherished since first the door of the millhouse had opened to admit her flamma only set his teeth tighter in his own soul he had been almost ashamed of his denial to his old neighbor and had almost feared that it would lose him the good will of that good heaven which had sent him so mercifully such a sharp year of famine to enrich him therefore it infuriated him to think that this offspring of a foul sin should have had pity and charity where he had lacked them he looked at her and saw with grim glee that she was black and blue with bruises and that the linen which she held together across her bosom had been stained with blood flandrin and his wife are honest people and pious he said in answer to her when they find a wench out of her bed at night they deal rightly with her and do not hearken to any lies that she may tell them of feigned almsgiving to cover her vices from their sight i thank them that they did so much of my work for me they might well prick thee for a witch but they will never cut so deep into thy breast as to be able to dig the mark of the devil out of it now up and work or it will be the worse for thee she obeyed him there during the dark winters day the pain which she endured with her hunger and the cold of the weather made her fall thrice like a dead thing on the snow of the court and the floors of the sheds but she lay insensible till the youth in her brought back consciousness without aid in those moments of faintness no one noticed her save the dog who came and crept to her to give her warmth and strove to wake her with the kisses of his rough tongue she did her work as best she might neither flamma nor his servant once spoke to her my women dealt somewhat roughly with thy wench at break of day good flamma said the man flandrin meeting him in the lane that afternoon and fearful of offending the shrewd old man who had so many of his neighbors in his grip i hope thou wilt not take it amiss the girl maddened my damespitting on her peter and throwing the blessed image away in a ditch the woman did well said flamma coldly driving his gray mare onward through the fog and flandrin could not tell whether he were content or were displeased claudis flamma himself hardly knew which he was he held her as the very spawn of hell and yet it was loathsome to him that his neighbors should also know and say that a devil had been the only fruit of that fair offspring of his own whom he and they had so long held as a saint the next day and the next and the next again after that she was too ill to stir they beat her and called her names but it was of no use they could not get work out of her she was past it and beyond all rousing of their sticks or of their words they were obliged to let her be she lay for nearly four days in the hay in her loft devoured with fever and with every bone and muscle in pain she had a pitcher of water by her and drank continually thirstily like a sick dog with rest and no medicine but the cold spring water she recovered she had been delirious in a few of the hours and had dreamed of nothing but of the old life in the liebana and of the old sweet music of phratos she remained there untended shivering and feverstricken until the strength of her youth returned to her she rose on the fifth day recovered weaker but otherwise little the worse with the soft sad songs of her old friend the viol ringing always through her brain the fifth day from the death of manon dax was the day of the new year there was no work being done at the mill the wheel stood still locked fast for the deep stream was close bound in ice frost had returned and the country was white with snow two feet deep and bleak and bare and rioted over by furious cross winds flamma and pitchou were in the kitchen when she entered it they looked up but neither spoke to her in being illfor the first time since they had had to do with hershe had committed for the millionth time a crime there was no welcome for her in that cheerless place where scarcely a spark of fire was allowed to brighten the hearth where the hens straying in from without sat with ruffled feathers chilled and moping and where the old black forest clock in the corner had stopped from the intense cold and grimly pointed midnight at high noon there was no welcome for her she went out into the air thinking the woods even at midwinter could not be so lonesome as was that cheerless house the sun was shining through a rift in the stormy clouds and the white roofs and the icecrusted waters and the frosted trees were glittering in its light there were many dead birds about the paths claudis flamma had thought their famine time a good one in which to tempt them with poisoned grain she wondered where the dog was who never had failed to greet hera yard farther on she saw him he was stretched stiff and lifeless beside the old barrel that had served him as a kennel his master had begrudged him the little straw needful to keep him from the hurricanes of those bitter nights and he had perished quietly without a moan like a sentinel slain at his postfrozen to death in his old age after a life of faithfulness repaid with blows she stood by him awhile with dry eyes but with an aching heart he had loved her and she had loved him many a time she had risked a stroke of the lash to save it from his body many a time she had sobbed herself to sleep in her earlier years with her arms curled round him as round her only friend and only comrade in bondage and in misery she stooped down and kissed him softly on his broad grizzled forehead lifted his corpse into a place of shelter and covered it tenderly so that he should not be left to the crows and the kites until she should be able to make his grave in those orchards which he had loved so well to wander in and in which he and she had spent all their brief hours of summer liberty and leisure she shuddered as she looked her last on him and filled in the snow above his tomb under the old twisted peartree beneath which he and she had so often sat together in the long grasses consoling one another for scant fare and cruel blows by the exquisite mute sympathy which can exist betwixt the canine and the human animal when the two are alone and love and trust each other only out of all the world whilst the dog had lived she had had two friends now that he slept forever in the old gray orchard she had but one left she went to seek this one her heart ached for a kind glancefor a word that should be neither of hatred nor of scorn it was seldom that she allowed herself to know such a weakness she had dauntless blood in her she came of a people that despised pity who knew how to live hard and to die hard without murmur or appeal yet as she had clung to the old mastiff who was savage to all save herself so she still clung to the old man marcellin who to all save herself was a terror and a name of foul omen he was good to her in his own fierce rugged way they had the kinship of the proscribed and they loved one another in a strange silent savage manner as a yearling wolf cub and an aged grizzled bear might love each other in the depths of a forest where the foot of the hunter and the fangs of the hound were alike against the young and the old she had not seen him for six days she felt ill and weak and cold and alone she thought she would go to him in his hut and sit a little by his lonely hearth and hear him tell strange stories of the marvelous time when he was young and the world was drunk with a mad sweet dream which was never to come true upon earth her heart was in wild revolt and a futile hate gnawed ever in it she had become used to the indignities of the populace and the insults of all the people who went to and fro her grandsires place but each one pierced deeper and deeper than the last and left a longer scar and killed more and more of the gentler and better instincts that had survived in her through all the brutalizing debasement of her life she could not avenge the outrage of rose flandrin and her sisterhood and being unable to avenge it she shut her mouth and said nothing of it as her habit was nevertheless it festered and rankled in her and now and then the thought crossed herwhy not take a flint and a bit of tow and burn them all in their beds as they slept in that little hollow at the foot of the hill she thought of it oftenwould she ever do it she did not know it had a taint of cowardice in it yet a man that very winter had fired a farmstead for far less an injury and had burned to death all who had lain therein that night why should she not kill and burn these also they had never essayed to teach her to do better and when she had tried to do good to one of them the others had set on her as a witch in the afternoon of this first day of the year she had to pass through their hamlet to seek marcellin the sun was low and red the dusky light glowered over the white meadows and through the leafless twilight of the woods here and there a solitary tree of holly reared itself scarlet and tall from the snowdrifts here and there a sheaf of arrowy reeds pierced the sheets of ice that covered all the streams and pools the little village lay with its dark round roofs cosy and warm with all the winter round she strode through it erect and flashing her scornful eyes right and left but her right hand was inside her shirt and it gripped fast the handle of a knife for such was the lesson which the reward for her charity had taught hera lesson not lightly to be forgotten nor swiftly to be unlearned again in its simple mode the little place like its greater neighbors kept high festival for a fresh year begun its crucifix rose bare and white out of a crown of fir boughs and many wreaths of ruddy berries on its cabin windows the light of wood cracking and blazing within glowed brightly through them she saw many of their interiors as she went by in the shadow without in one the children knelt in a circle round the fire roasting chestnuts in the embers with gay shouts of laughter in another they romped with their big sheepdog decking him with garlands of ivy and laurel in one little brown room a betrothal party made merry in another that was bright with dutch tiles and hung round with dried herbs and fruits an old matron had her arm round the curly head of a sailor lad home for a short glad hour in the house of flandrin a huge souppot smoked with savory odor and the eyes of his wife were soft with a tender mirth as she watched her youngestborn playing with a punchinello all bells and bright colors and saw the elder ones cluster round a gilded jesus of sugar in the wineshop the keeper of it having married a wife that day kept open house to his friends and he and they were dancing to the music of a horn and a fiddle under rafters bedecked with branches of fir with manyhued ribbons and with little oil lamps that blew to and fro in the noise of the romp and all round lay the dark still woods and in the midst rose the crucifix and above on the height of the hill the little old hut of manon dax stood dark and empty she looked at it all going through it with her hand on her knife one spark she thought playing with the grim temptation that possessed herone spark on the dry thatch and what a bonfire they would have for their feasting the thought was sweet to her injustice had made her ravenous and savage when she had tried to do well and to save life these people had accused her of taking it by evil sorcery she felt a longing to show them what evil indeed she could do and to see them burn and to hear them scream vainly and then to say to them with a laugh as the flames licked up their homes and their lives another time take care how you awake a witch why did she not do it she did not know she had brought out a flint and tinder in the pouch that hung at her side it would be as easy as to pluck a sere leaf she knew that she stood still and played with her fancy and it was horrible and sweet to herso sweet because so horrible how soon their mirth would be stilled as she stood thinking there and seeing in fancy the red glare that would light up that peaceful place and hearing the roar of the lurid flames that would drown the music and the laughter and the childrens shouts out of the twilight there rose to her a small dark thing with a halo of light round its head the thing was little bernardou and the halo was the shine of his curling hair in the lingering light he caught her skirts in his hands and clung to her and sobbed i know youyou were good that night the people all say you are wicked but you gave us your food and held my hand take me back to granmereoh take me back she was startled and bewildered this child had never mocked her but he had screamed and run from her in terror and had been told a score of stories that she was a devil who could kill his body and soul she is dead bernardou she answered him and her voice was troubled and sounded strangely to her as she spoke for the first time to a child without being derided or screamed at in fear dead what is that sobbed the boy she was stiff and cold i know and they put her in a hole but she would waken i know she would if she only heard us we never cried in the night but she heard in her sleep and got up and came to us oh do tell herdo do tell her she was silent she did not know how to answer him and the strangeness of any human appeal made to her bewildered her and held her mute why are you out in the cold bernardou she asked him suddenly glancing backward through the lattice of the flandrins house through which she could see the infants laughing and shaking the puppet with the gilded bells they beat me they say i am naughty because i want granmere he said with a sob they beat me often and oh if she knew she would wake and come do tell herdo bernardou will be so good and never vex her if only she will come back his piteous voice was drowned in tears his little life had been hard scant fare cold winds and naked limbs had been his portion yet the life had been bright and gleeful to him clinging to his grandams skirts as she washed at the tub or hoed in the cabbageground catching her smile when he brought her the first daisy of the year running always to her open arms in any hurt sinking to sleep always with the singing of her old ballads on his ear it had been a little life dear glad kindly precious to him and he wept for it refusing to be comforted by sight of a gilded puppet in anothers hand or a sugared jesus in anothers mouth as they expected him to be it is the sort of comfort that is always offered to the homeless and they are always thought ungrateful if they will not be consoled by it i wish i could take you bernardou she murmured with a momentary softness that was exquisitely tender in its contrast to her haughty and fierce temper i wish i could for one wild instant the thought came to her to break from her bonds and take this creature who was as lonely as herself and to wander away and away into that unknown land which stretched around her and of which she knew no more than one of the dark leaves knew that grew in the snowfilled ditch but the thought passed unuttered she knew neither where to go nor what to do her few early years in the liebana were too dreamlike and too vaguely remembered to be any guide to her and the world seemed only to her in her fancies as a vast plain dreary and dismal in which every hand would be against her and every living thing be hostile to her besides the long habitude of slavery was on her and it is a yoke that eats into the flesh too deeply to be wrenched off without an effort as she stood thinking with the childs eager hands clasping her skirts a shrill voice called from the woodstack and dungheap outside flandrins house bernardou bernardou thou little plague come within what dost do out there in the dark mischief i will warrant the speaker strode out and snatched and bore and clutched him away she was the sister of rose flandrin who lived with them and kept the place and the children in order thou little beast she muttered in fury dost dare talk to the witch that killed thy grandmother thou shalt hie to bed and sup on a fine whipping thank god thou goest to the hospital tomorrow thou wouldst bring a dire curse on the house in reward for our alms to thee she dragged him in and slammedto the door and his cries echoed above the busy shouts and laughter of the flandrin family gathered about the tinseled punch and the sugared jesus and the souppot that stewed them a fat farmyard goose for their supper follefarine listened awhile with her hand clinched on her knife then she toiled onward through the village and left it and its carols and carouses behind her in the red glow of the sinking sun she thought no more of setting their huts in a blaze the childs words had touched and softened her she remembered the long patient bitter life of the woman who had died of cold and hunger in her eightysecond year and yet who had thus died saying to the last god is good what is their god she mused they care for him and he seems to care nothing for them whether they be old or young yet her heart was softened and she would not fire the house in which little bernardou was sheltered his was the first gratitude that she had ever met with and it was sweet to her as the rare blossom of the edelweiss to the traveler upon the highest alpine summitsa flower full of promise born amidst a waste the way was long to where marcellin dwelt but she walked on through the fields that were in summer all one scarlet group of poppies the day was over the evening drew nigh the sound of innumerable bells in the town echoed faintly from the distance over the snow all was still on the night of the new year the people had a care that the cattle in the byres the sheep in the folds the dogs in the kennels the swine in the styes the old carthorses in the sheds should have a full meal and a clean bed and be able to rejoice in all the country round there were only two that were forgottenthe dead in their graves and the daughter of taric the gypsy follefarine was cold hungry and exhausted for the fever had left her enfeebled and from the coarse food of the millhouse her weakness had turned but she walked on steadily at the hut where marcellin dwelt she knew that she would be sure of one welcome one smile one voice that would greet her kindly one face that would look on her without a frown it would not matter she thought how the winds should howl and the hail drive or how the people should be merry in their homes and forgetful of her and of him he and she would sit together over the little fire and give back hate for hate and scorn for scorn and commune with each other and want no other cheer or comrade it had been always so since he had first met her at sunset among the poppies then a little child eight years old every newyearsnight she had spent with him in his hovel and in their own mute way they had loved one another and drawn closer together and been almost glad though often pitcher and platter had been empty and sometimes even the hearth had been cold she stepped bravely against the wind and over the crisp firm snow her spirits rising as she drew near the only place that had ever opened its door gladly to her coming her heart growing lighter as she approached the only creature to whom she had ever spoken her thoughts without derision or told her woes without condemnation his hut stood by itself in the midst of the wide pastures and by the side of a stream a little light was wont to twinkle at that hour through the crevices of its wooden shutter this evening all was dark the outline of the hovel rose like a rugged mound against the white wastes round it the only sound was the faroff chiming of the bells that vibrated strangely on the rarefied sharp air she crossed the last meadow where the sheep were folded for the night and went to the door and pushed against it to open itit was locked she struck it with her hand open marcellinopen quickly it is only i there was no answer she smote the wood more loudly and called to him again a heavy step echoed on the mud floor within a match was struck a dull light glimmered a voice she did not know muttered drowsily who is there it is i marcellin she answered it is not night i am come to be an hour with you is anything amiss the door opened slowly an old woman whose face was strange to her peered out into the dusk she had been asleep on the settle by the fire and stared stupidly at the flame of her own lamp is it the old man marcellin you want she asked marcellin yeswhere is he he died four days ago get you gone i will have no tramps about my place died follefarine stood erect and without a quiver in her face and in her limbs but her teeth shut together like a steel clasp and all the rich and golden hues of her skin changed to a sickly ashen pallor yes why not grumbled the old woman to be sure men said that god would never let him die because he killed st louis but i myself never thought that i knew the devil would not wait more than a hundred years for himyou can never cheat the devil and he always seems stronger than the saintssomehow you are that thing of ypres are you not get you gone who are you why are you here she gasped her right hand was clinched on the doorpost and her right foot was set on the threshold so that the door could not be closed i am an honest woman and a pious and it befouls me to dwell where he dwelt the old peasant hissed in loud indignation i stood out a whole day but when one is poor and the place is offered quit of rent what can one doand it is roomy and airy for the fowls and the priest has flung holy water about it and purified it and i have a horseshoe nailed up and a st john in the corner but be off with you and take your foot from my door follefarine stood motionless when did he die and how she asked in her teeth he was found dead on the road on his heap of stones the fourth night from this answered the old woman loving to hear her own tongue yet dreading the one to whom she spoke perhaps he had been hungered i do not know or more likely the devil would not wait any longeranyways he was dead the hammer in his hand max lieben the man that travels with the wooden clocks found him he lay there all night nobody would touch him they say they saw the mark of the devils claws on him at last they got a dungcart and that took him away before the sun rose he died just under the great calvaryit was like his blasphemy they have put him in the common ditch i think it shame to let the man that slew a saint be in the same grave with all the poor honest folk who feared god and were christians though they might be beggars and outcasts get you gone you be as vile as he if you want him go ask your father the foul fiend for himthey are surely together now and she drove the door to and closed it and barred it firmly within not but what the devil can get through the chinks she muttered as she turned the wick of her lamp up higher follefarine went back over the snow blind sick feeling her way through the twilight as though it were the darkness of night he died alonehe died alone she muttered a thousand times as she crept shivering through the gloom and she knew that now her own fate was yet more desolate she knew that now she lived alone without one friend on earth the death on the open highway the numbness and stillness and deafness to all the maledictions of men the shameful bier made at night on the dungcart amidst loathing glances and muttered curses the nameless grave in the common ditch with the beggar the thief the harlot and the murdererthese which were so awful to all others seemed to her as sweet as to sink to sleep on soft unshorn grass whilst roseleaves were shaken in the wind and fell as gently as kisses upon the slumberer for even those at least were rest and she in her youth and in her strength and in the blossom of her beauty gorgeous as a passionflower in the sun envied bitterly the old man who had died at his work on the public road hated by his kind weighted with the burden of nigh a hundred years for his death was not more utterly lonely and desolate than was her life and to all taunts and to all curses the ears of the dead are deaf book iii chapter i night had come a dark night of earliest spring the wild day had sobbed itself to sleep after a restless life with fitful breaths of storm and many sighs of shuddering breezes the sun had sunk leaving long tracks of bloodred light across onehalf the heavens there was a sharp crisp coldness as of lingering frost in the gloom and the dullness heavy clouds as yet unbroken hung over the cathedral and the clustering roofs around it in dark and starless splendor over the great still plains which stretched eastward and southward black with the furrows of the scarcebudded corn the wind blew hard blowing the river and the many streamlets spreading from it into foam driving the wintry leaves which still strewed the earth thickly hither and thither in legions breaking boughs that had weathered through the winter hurricanes and scattering the tender blossoms of the snowdrops and the earliest crocuses in all the little mossgrown gardenways the smell of wet grass of the woodborn violets of trees whose new life was waking in their veins of damp earths turned freshly upwards by the plow were all blown together by the riotous breezes now and then a light gleamed through the gloom where a little peasant boy lighted home with a torch some old priest on his mule or a boat went down the waters with a lamp hung at its prow for it grew dark early and people used to the river read a threat of a flood on its face a dim glow from the west which was still tinged with the fire of the sunset fell through a great square window set in a stone building and striking across the sicklier rays of an oil lamp reached the opposing wall within it was a wall of gray stone dead and lusterless like the wall of a prisonhouse over whose surface a spider as colorless as itself dragged slowly its crooked hairy limbs loaded with the moisture of the place an old tower of which the countryfolk told strange tales where it stood among the rushes on the left bank of the stream a man watched the spider as it went it crept on its heavy way across the faint crimson reflection from the glow of the sunken sun it was fat well nourished lazy content its home of dusky silver hung on high where its pleasure lay in weaving clinging hoarding breeding it lived in the dark it had neither pity nor regret it troubled itself neither for the death it dealt to nourish itself nor for the light without into which it never wandered it spun and throve and multiplied it was an emblem of the man who is wise in his generation of the man whom cato the elder deemed divine of the majority and the mediocrity who rule over the earth and enjoy its fruits this man knew that it was wise that those who were like to it were wise also wise with the only wisdom which is honored of other men he had been unwisealways and therefore he stood watching the sun die with hunger in his soul with famine in his body for many months he had been half famished as were the wolves in his own northern mountains in the winter solstice for seven days he had only been able to crush a crust of hard black bread between his teeth for twenty hours he had not done even so much as this the trencher in his trestle was empty and he had not wherewithal to refill it he might have found some to fill it for him no doubt he lived amidst the poor and the poor to the poor are good though they are bad and bitter to the rich but he did not open either his lips or his hand he consumed his heart in silence and his vitals preyed in anguish on themselves without his yielding to their torments he was a madman and cato who measured the godliness of men by what they gained would have held him accursedthe madness that starves and is silent for an idea is an insanity scouted by the world and the gods for it is an insanity unfruitful except to the future and for the future who caressave the madmen themselves he watched the spider as it went it could not speak to him as its fellow once spoke in the old scottish story to hear as that captive heard the hearer must have hope and a kingdomif only in dreams this man had no hope he had a kingdom indeed but it was not of earth and in an hour of sheer cruel bodily pain earth alone has dominion and power and worth the spider crawled across the gray wall across the glow from the vanished sun across a coil of a dead passionvine that strayed over the floor across the classic shape of a great cartoon drawn in chalks upon the dull rugged surface of stone nothing arrested it nothing retarded it as nothing hastened it it moved slowly on fat lusterless indolent hueless reached at length its den and there squatted aloft loving the darkness its young swarming around its netted prey held in its forceps its nets cast about through the open casement there came in on the rising wind of the storm in the light of the last lingering sunbeam a beautiful nightmoth begotten by some cruel hothouse heat in the bosom of some frail exiled tropic flower it swam in on trembling pinions and lit on the golden head of a gathered crocus that lay dying on the stonesa moth that should have been born to no world save that of the summer world of a midsummer nights dream a shape of ariel and oberon slender silver purple roseate lustrouseyed and gossamerwinged a creature of woodland waters and blossoming forests of the yellow chalices of kingcups and the white breasts of river lilies of moonbeams that strayed through a summer world of shadows and dewdrops that glistened in the deepfolded hearts of roses a creature to brush the dreaming eyes of a poet to nestle on the bosom of a young girl sleeping to float earthwards on a falling star to slumber on a lotusleaf a creature that amidst the still soft hush of woods and waters tells to those who listen of the world when the world was young the moth flew on and poised on the fading crocusleaves which spread out their pale gold on the level of the floor it was weary and its delicate wings drooped it was stormtossed windbeaten drenched with mist and frozen with the cold it belonged to the moon to the dew to the lilies to the forgetmenots and the night and it found that the hard grip of winter had seized it whilst yet it had thought that the stars and the summer were with it it lived before its timeand it was like the human soul which being born in the darkness of the world dares to dream of light and wandering in vain search of a sun that will never rise falls and perishes in wretchedness it was beautiful exceedingly with the brilliant tropical beauty of a life that is shortlived it rested a moment on the stem of the pale flower then with its radiant eyes fastened on the point of light which the lamp thrust upward it flew on high spreading out its transparent wings and floating to the flame kissed it quivered once and died there fell among the dust and cinder of the lamp a little heap of shrunken firescorched blackened ashes the wind whirled them upward from their rest and drove them forth into the night to mingle with the stormscourged grasses the pale dead violets the withered snowflowers with all things frosttouched and forgotten the spider sat aloft sucking the juices from the fettered flies teaching its spawn to prey and feed content in squalor and in plenitude in sensual sloth and in the increase of its spawn and of its hoard he watched them both the success of the spider the death of the moth trite as a fable ever repeated as the tides of the sea the two symbols of humanity of the life which fattens on greed and gain and the life which perishes of divine desire then he turned and looked at the cartoons upon the wall shapes grand and dim the children of his genius a genius denied by men his head sank on his chest his hand tore the shirt away from his breast which the pangs of a bodily hunger that he scorned devoured indeed but which throbbed with a pain more bitter than that of even this lingering and ignoble death he had genius in him and he had to die like a wolf on the armorican wolds yonder westward when the snows of winter hid all offal from its fangs it was horrible he had to die for want of the crust that beggars gnawed in the kennels of the city he had to die of the lowest and commonest need of allthe sheer animal need of food javais quelque chose la was perhaps the most terrible of all those deathcries of despair which the guillotine of thermidor wrung from the lips of the condemned for it was the despair of the bodily life for the life of the mind which died with it when the man clings to life for lifes sake because it is fair and sweet and good to the sight and the senses there may be weakness in his shudder at its threatening loss but when a man is loth to leave life although it be hard and joyless and barren of all delights because life gives him power to accomplish things greater than he which yet without him must perish there is the strength in him as there is the agony of prometheus with him it must die also that deep dim greatness within him which moves him despite himself that nameless unspeakable force which compels him to create and to achieve that vision by which he beholds worlds beyond him not seen by his fellows weary of life indeed he may be of life material and full of subtlety of passion of pleasure of pain of the kisses that burn of the laughs that ring hollow of the honey that so soon turns to gall of the sickly fatigues and the tired cloyed hunger that are the portion of men upon earth weary of these he may be but still if the gods have breathed on him and made him mad with the madness that men have called genius there will be that in him greater than himself which he knowsand cannot know without some fierce wrench and pangwill be numbed and made impotent and drift away lost for evermore into that eternal night which is all that men behold of death it was so with this man now life was barren for him of all delight full of privation of famine of obscurity of fruitless travail and of vain desire and yet because he believed that he had it in him to be great or rather because with a purer and more impersonal knowledge he believed that it was within his power to do that which when done the world would not willingly let die it was loathsome to him to perish thus of the sheer lack of food as any toothless snake would perish in its swamp he stood opposite to the great white cartoons on which his soul had spent itself creations which looked vague and ghostly in the shadows of the chamber but in which he saw or at the least believed he saw the titledeeds of his own heirship to the worlds kingdom of fame for himself he cared nothing but for them he smiled a little bitterly as he looked they will light some bakehouse fire to pay those that may throw my body in a ditch he thought and yet the old passion had so much dominance still that he instinctively went nearer to his latest and bestloved creations and took the white chalks up and worked once more by the dull sullen rays of the lamp behind him they would be torn down on the morrow and thrust for fuel into some housewifes kitchenstove what matter he loved them they were his sole garniture and treasure in them his soul had gathered all its dreams and all its pure delights so long as his sight lasted he sought to feed it on them so long as his hand had power he strove to touch to caress to enrich them even in such an hour as this the old sweet trance of art was upon him he was devoured by the deadly fangs of long fast streaks of living fire seemed to scorch his entrails his throat and lungs were parched and choked and ever and again his left hand clinched on the bones of his naked chest as though he could wrench away the throes that gnawed it he knew that worse than this would follow he knew that tenfold more torment would await him that limbs as strong and muscles as hard and manhood as vigorous as his would only yield to such death as this slowly doggedly inch by inch day by day he knew and he knew that he could not trust himself to go through that uttermost torture without once lifting his voice to summon the shame of release from it shame since release would need be charity he knew full well he had seen all forms of death he had studied its throes and portrayed its horrors he knew that before dawnit might be before midnightthis agony would grow so great that it would conquer him and that to save himself from the cowardice of appeal the shame of besought alms he would have to use his last powers to drive home a knife hard and sure through his breastbone yet he stood there almost forgetting this scarcely conscious of any other thing than of the passion that ruled him some soft curve in a girls bare bosom some round smooth arm of a sleeping woman some fringe of leaves against a moonlit sky some broadwinged bird sailing through shadows of the air some fullorbed lion rising to leap on the nude soft indolentlyfolded limbs of a dreaming virgin palmshadowed in the eastall these he gazed on and touched and looked again and changed by some mere inward curve or deepened line of his chalk stylus all these usurped him appealed to him were well beloved and infinitely sad seemed ever in their whiteness and their loneliness to cry to himwhither dost thou go wilt thou leave us alone and as he stood and thus caressed them with his eyes and touch and wrestled with the inward torment which grew greater and greater as the night approached the sudden sickly feebleness of long hunger came upon him the gravelike coldness of his fireless chamber slackened and numbed the flowing of his veins his brain grew dull and all its memory ceased confused and blotted he staggered once wondering dimly and idly as men wonder in delirium if this indeed were death then he fell backwards senseless on his hearth the last glow of day died off the wall the wind rose louder driving in through the open casement a herd of withered leaves an owl flew by uttering weary cries against the storm on high the spider sat sucking the vitals of its prey safe in its filth and darkness looking down ever on the lifeless body on the hearth and saying in its heartthou fool chapter ii as the night fell follefarine alone steered herself down the water through the heart of the town where the buildings were oldest and where on either side there loomed through the dusk carved on the black timbers strange masks of satyr and of faun of dragon and of griffin of fiend and of martyr she sat in the clumsy empty marketboat guiding the tillerrope with her foot the sea flowing in stormily upon the coast sent the tide of the river inland with a swift impetuous current to which its sluggish depths were seldom stirred the oars rested unused in the bottom of the boat she glided down the stream without exertion of her own quietly easily dreamily she had come from a long days work lading and unlading timber and grain for her taskmaster and his fellowfarmers at the river wharf at the back of the town where the little seatrawlers and traders with their fresh salt smell and their brown sails crisp from fierce seawinds gathered for traffic with the cornbarges and the eggboats of the land her days labor was done and she was repaid for it by the free effortless backward passage home through the shadows of the waterstreets where in the overhanging buildings ever and anon some lantern swinging on a cord from side to side or some open casement arched above a gallery showed the dark sad wistful face of some old creature kneeling in prayer before a crucifix or the gold earrings of some laughing girl leaning down with the first frail violets of the year fragrant in her boddice the cold night had brought the glow of woodfires in many of the dwellings of that poor and picturesque quarter and showed many a homely interior through the panes of the oriel and lancet windows over which brooded sculptured figures seraphwinged or carven forms helmeted and leaning on their swords in one of them there was a group of young men and maidens gathered round the wood at nutburning the lovers seeking each others kiss as the kernels broke the shells in another some rosy curly children played at soldiers with the cuirass and saber which their grandsire had worn in the army of the empire in another before a quaint oval oldfashioned glass a young girl all alone made trial of her weddingwreath upon her fair forehead and smiled back on her own image with a little joyous laugh that ended in a sob in another a young bearded workman carved ivory beside his hearth whilst his old mother sat knitting in a high oak chair in another a sister of charity with a fair madonnas face bent above a little pot of homebred snowdrops with her tears dropping on the white heads of the flowers whilst the sick man whom she had charge of slept and left her a brief space for her own memories her own pangs her own sickness which was only of the heartonlyand therefore hopeless all these follefarine saw going onward in the boat on the gloom of the water below she did not envy them she rather with her hatred of them scorned them she had been freeborn though now she was a slave the pleasures of the home and hearth she envied no more than she envied the imprisoned bird its seed and water its mate and song within the close cage bars yet they had a sort of fascination for her she wondered how they felt these people who smiled and span and ate and drank and sorrowed and enjoyed and were in health and disease at feast and at funeral always together always bound in one bond of a common humanity these people whose god on the cross never answered them who were poor she knew who toiled early and late who were heavily taxed who fared hardly and scantily yet who for the main part contrived to be mirthful and content and to find some sunshine in their darkened hours and to cling to one another and in a way be glad just above her was the corner window of a very ancient house crusted with blazonries and carvings it had been a prince bishops palace it was now the shared shelter of half a score of laceweavers and of ivoryworkers each family in their chamber like a bee in its cell as the boat floated under one of the casements she saw that it stood open there was a china cup filled with houseborn primroses on the broad sill there was an antique illuminated book of hours lying open beside the flowers there was a strong firelight shining from within there was an old woman asleep and smiling in her dreams beside the hearth by the open book was a girl leaning out into the chill damp night and looking down the street as though in search for some expected and thricewelcome guest she was fair to look at with dark hair twisted under her towering white cap and a peachlike cheek and throat and her arms folded against her blue kerchief crossed upon her chest into the chamber unseen by her a young man came and stole across the shadows and came unheard behind her and bent his head to hers and kissed her ere she knew that he was there she started with a little happy cry and pushed him away with pretty provocation he drew her into his arms and into the chamber and shut to the lattice and left only a dusky reflection from within shining through the panes made dark by age and dust follefarine had watched them as the window closed her head dropped she was stirred with a vague passionate contemptuous wonder what was this love that was about her everywhere and yet with which she had no share she only thought of it with haughtiest scorn and yet there had come a great darkness on the river a fierce roughness in the wind the shutters were now closed in many of the houses of the waterstreet and their long black shadows fell across the depth that severed them and met and blended in the twilight the close of this day was stormy the wind blew the river swiftly and the heavy raw mists were setting in from the sea as the night descended she did not heed these she liked the wild weather best she loved the rush of a chill wind among her hair and the moisture of blown spray upon her face she loved the manifold fantasies of the clouds and the melodies of the blast coming over the sands and the rushes she loved the swirl and rage of the angry water and the solitude that closed in round her with the darkness the boat passed onward through the now silent town only in one other place a light glowed through the unshuttered lattices that were ruddy with light and emblematic with the paintings of the renaissance it was the window of the gardeners wife at that season there could bloom neither saxifrage nor nasturtium but some greenleaved winter shrub with rosyladen berries had replaced them and made a shining frame all round the painted panes the fair woman was within her delicate head rose out of the brown shadows round with a lamp burning above it and a little oval mirror before into the mirror she was gazing with a smile whilst with both hands about her throat she clasped some strings of polished shells brought to her from the sea how white and how warm and how glad she is thought follefarine looking upward and she rowed in the gloom through the sluggish water with envy at her heart she was growing harder wilder worse with every day more and more like some dumb fierce forest beast that flees from every step and hates the sound of every voice since the night that they had pricked her for a witch the people had been more cruel to her than ever they cast bitter names at her as she went by they hissed and hooted her as she took her mule through their villages or passed them on the road with her back bent under some load of fagots or of winter wood once or twice they stoned her and chance alone had saved her from injury for it was an article of faith in all the hamlets round that she had killed old manon dax the flandrins said so and they were good pious people who would not lie every dusky evening when the peasantry through the doors of their cabins saw the gleam of her red girdle and the flash of her hawks eyes where she plodded on through the mist on her tyrants errands they crossed themselves and told each other for the hundredth time the tale of her iniquities over their pan of smoking chestnuts it had hardened her tenfold it had made her brood on sullen dreams of a desperate vengeance marcellin too was gone his body had been eaten by the quicklime in the common ditch and there was not even a voice so stern as his to bid her a goodmorrow he had been a harsh man of dark repute and bitter tongue but in his way he had loved her in his way with the eloquence that had remained to him and by the strange stories that he had told her of that wondrous time wherein his youth had passed when men had been as gods and giants and women horrible as medea or sublime as iphigenia he had done something to awaken her mind to arouse her hopes to lift her up from the torpor of toil the lusts of hatred the ruinous apathy of despair but he was dead and she was alone and abandoned utterly to herself she mourned for him with a passionate pain that was all the more despairing because no sound of it could ever pass her lips to any creature to and fro continually she went by the road on which he had died alone by the heap of broken stones by the wooden crucifix by the high hedge and the cornlands beyond every time she went the blood beat in her brain the tears swelled in her throat she hated with a hatred that consumed her and was ready to ripen into any deadly deed the people who had shunned him in his life and in his death derided and insulted him and given him such burial as they gave the rotten carcass of some noxious beast her heart was ripe for any evil that should have promised her vengeance a dull cold sense of utter desolation and isolation was always on her the injustice of the people began to turn her blood to gall her courage into cruelty there began to come upon her the look of those who brood upon a crime it was in truth but the despairing desire to live that stirred within her to know to feel to roam to enjoy to suffer still if need be but to suffer something else than the endless toil of the fieldox and towhorsesomething else than the unavenged blow that pays the ass and the dog for their services the desire to be free grew upon her with all the force and fury inherited from her fathers tameless and everwandering race if a crime could have made her free she would have seized it she was in the prison of a narrow and hated fate and from it she looked out on the desert of an endless hate which stretched around her without one blossom of love one well spring of charity rising in its deathlike waste the dreamy imaginations the fantastic pictures that had been so strong in her in her early years were still there though distorted by ignorance and inflamed by despair though in her first poignant grief for him she had envied marcellin his hardwon rest his grave in the public ditch of the town it was not in her to desire to die she was too young too strong too restless too impatient and her blood of the desert and the forest was too hot what she wanted was to live live as the great moorbird did that she had seen float one day over these pale pure blue skies with its mighty wings outstretched in the calm gray weather which came none knew whence and which went none knew whither which poised silent and stirless against the clouds then called with a sweet wild lovenote to its mate and waited for him as he sailed in from the misty shadows where the sea lay and then with him rose yet higher and higher in the air and passed westward cleaving the fields of light and so vanisheda queen of the wind a daughter of the sun a creature of freedom of victory of tireless movement and of boundless space a thing of heaven and of liberty the evening became night a night rough and cold almost as winter there was no boat but hers upon the river which ran high and strong she left the lights of the town behind her and came into the darkness of the country now and then the moon shone a moment through the stormwrack here and there a torch glimmered borne by some wayfarer over a bridge there was no other light the bells of the cathedral chiming a miserere sounded full of woe behind her in the still sad air there stood but one building between her and her home a square strong tower built upon the edge of the stream of which the peasants told many tales of horror it was of ancient date and spacious and very strong its upper chambers were used as a granary by the farmpeople who owned it the vaulted hall was left unused by them partly because the river had been known to rise high enough to flood the floor partly because legend had bequeathed to it a ghastly repute of spirits of murdered men who haunted it no man or woman in all the country round dared venture to it after nightfall it was all that the stoutest would do to fetch and carry grain there at broad day and the peasant who being belated rowed his marketboat past it when the moon was high moved his oar with one trembling hand and with the other crossed himself unceasingly to follefarine it bore no such terror the unconscious pantheism breathed into her with her earliest thoughts with the teachings of phratos made her see a nameless mystical and always wondrous beauty in every blade of grass that fed on the dew and with the light rejoiced in every bare brown stone that flashed to gold in bright brook waters under a tuft of weed in every hillside stream that leaping and laughing sparkled in the sun in every wind that wailing went over the sickness of the weary world for such a temper no shape of the day or the night no miracle of life or of death can have terror it can dread nothing because every created thing has in it a divine origin and an eternal mystery as she and the boat passed out into the loneliness of the country with fitful moon gleams to light its passage the weather and the stream grew wilder yet there were on both sides strips of the silvery inland sands beds of tall reeds and the straight stems of poplars ghostlike in the gloom the tide rushed faster the winds blew more strongly from the north the boat rocked and now and then was washed with water till its edges were submerged she stood up in it and gave her strength to its guidance it was all that she could do to keep its course straight and steer it so that it should not grate upon the sand nor be blown into the tangles of the river reeds for herself she had no care she could swim like any cygnet and for her own sport had spent hours in water at all seasons but she knew that to claudis flamma the boat was an honored treasure since to replace it would have cost him many a hardearned and wellloved piece of money as she stood thus upright in the little tossing vessel against the darkness and the winds she passed the solitary building it had been placed so low down against the shore that its front walls strong of hewn stone and deep bedded in the soil were half submerged in the dense growth of the reeds and of the willowy osiers which grew up and brushed the great arched windows of its haunted hall the lower half of one of the seven windows had been blown wide open a broad square casement braced with iron bars looking out upon the river and lighted by a sickly glimmer of the moon her boat was swayed close against the wall in a sudden lurch caused by a fiercer gust of wind and higher wave of the strong tide the rushes entangled it it grounded on the sand there was no chance she knew of setting it afloat again without her leaving it to gain a footing on the land and use her force to push it off into the current she leaped out without a moments thought among the rushes with her kirtle girt up close above her knees she sank to her ankles in the sand and stood to her waist in the water but she was almost as light and sure of foot as a moorgull when it lights upon the treacherous mosses of a bog and standing on the soaked and shelving bank she thrust herself with all her might against her boat dislodged it and pushed it out once more afloat she was about to wade to it and spring into it before the stream had time to move it farther out when an owl flew from the open window behind her unconsciously she turned her head to look whence the bird had come she saw the wide dark square of the opened casement the gleam of a lamp within the cavernlike vastness of the vaulted hall instinctively she paused and drew closer and forgot the boat the stone sills of the seven windows were level with the topmost sprays of the tall reeds and the willowy underwood they were therefore level with herself she saw straight in saw so far as the pale uncertain fusion of moon and lamp rays showed them the height and width of this legend haunted place vaulted and pillared with timber and with stone dim and lonely as a cathedral crypt and with the nightbirds flying to and fro in it as in a ruin seeking their nests in its rafters and in the capitals of its columns no fear but a great awe fell upon her she let the boat drift on its way unheeded and stood there at gasp like a forest doe she had passed this grain tower with every day and night that she had gone down the river upon the errands of her taskmaster but she had never looked within it once holding the peasants stories and terrors in the cold scorn of her intrepid courage now when she looked she for the first time believedbelieved that the dead lived and gathered there white shadowy countless shapes loomed through the gloom all motionless all noiseless all beautiful with the serene yet terrible loveliness of death in their midst burned a lamp as the light burns night and day in the tombs of the kings of the east her color paled her breath came and went her body trembled like a leaf yet she was not afraid a divine ecstasy of surprise and faith smote the dull misery of her life she saw at last another world than the world of toil in which she had labored without sight and without hope as the blinded ox labored in the brickfield treading his endless circles in the endless dark and only told that it was day by blows she had no fear of themthese whom she deemed the dwellers of the lands beyond the sun could not be more cruel to her than had been the sons of men she yearned to them longed for them wondered with rapture and with awe if these were the messengers of her fathers kingdom if these would have mercy on her and take her with them to their immortal homeswhether of heaven or of hell what mattered it it was enough to her that it would not be of earth she raised herself upon the ledge above the rushes poised herself lightly as a bird and with deft soundless feet dropped safely on the floor within and stood in the midst of that enchanted worldstood motionless gazing upwards with rapt eyes and daring barely to draw breath with any audible sigh lest she should rouse them and be driven from their presence the flame of the lamp and the moonlight reflected back from the foam of the risen waters shed a strange pallid shadowy light on all the forms around her they are the dead surely she thought as she stood among them and she stayed there with her arms folded on her breast to still its beating lest any sound should anger them and betray her a thing lower than the dusta mortal amidst this great immortal host the mists and the shadows between her eyes and them parted them as with a sea of dim and subtle vapor through which they looked white and impalpable as a summer cloud when it seems to lean and touch the edge of the world in a gray quiet dawn they were but the creations of an artists classic dreams but to her they seemed to thrill to move to sigh to gaze on her to her they seemed to live with that life of the air of the winds of the stars of silence and solitude and all the nameless liberties of death of which she dreamed when shunned and cursed and hungered she looked up to the skies at night from a sleepless bed they were indeed the dead the dead of that fair time when all the earth was young and men communed with their deities and loved them and were not afraid when their gods were with them in their daily lives when in every breeze that curled the sea in every cloud that darkened in the west in every watercourse that leaped and sparkled in the sacred cedar groves in every beesucked blossom of wild thyme that grew purple by the marble temple steps the breath and the glance of the gods were felt the footfall and the voice of the gods were heard they were indeed the dead the dead whodying earliest whilst yet the earth was young enough to sorrow for its heroic lives to embalm them to remember them and to count them worthy of lamentperished in their bodies but lived forever immortal in the traditions of the world from every space of the somber chamber some one of these gazed on her through the mist here the silver dove of argos winged her way through the ironjaws of the dark seagates here the white io wandered in exile and unresting forever scourged on by the sting in her flesh as a man by the genius in him here the glad god whom all the woodlands love played in the moonlight on his reeds to the young stags that couched at his feet in golden beds of daffodils and asphodel here in a darkened land the great demeter moved bereaved and childless bidding the vine be barren and the figtrees fruitless and the seed of the sown furrows strengthless to multiply and fill the sickles with ripe increase here the women of thebes danced upon cithaeron in the mad moonless nights under the cedars with loose hair on the wind and bosoms that heaved and brake through their girdles of fawnskin here at his labor in pherae the sungod toiled as a slave the highest wrought as the lowest while wise hermes stood by and made mirth of the kingship that had bartered the rod of dominion for the mere music which empty air could make in a hollow reed here too the brother gods stood hypnos and oneiros and thanatos their bowed heads crowned with the poppy and moonwort the flowering fern and the amaranth and pressed to their lips a white rose in the old sweet symbol of silence fashioned in the same likeness with the same winged feet which yet fall so softly that no human ears hear their coming the gods that most of all have pity on menthe gods of the night and of the grave these she saw not plainly but through the wavering shadows and the halo of the vapors which floated dense and silvery as smoke in from the misty river their lips were dumb and for her they had no name nor story and yet they spoke to her with familiar voices she knew them she knew that they were gods and yet to the world were dead and in the eyes of the forestgod who piped upon his reeds she saw the eyes of phratos look on her with their tender laughter and their unforgotten love just so had he looked so long agoso longin the deep woods at moonrise when he had played to the bounding fawns to the leaping waters to the listening trees to the sleeping flowers they had called him an outcastand loshe found him a god she sank on her knees and buried her face in her hands and weptwept with grief for the living lost foreverwept with joy that the dead forever lived tears had rarely sprung to her proud rebellious eyes she deemed them human thingsthings of weakness and of shame she had thrust them back and bit her lips till the blood came in a thousand hours of pain rather than men should see them and exult the passion had its way for once and spent itself and passed she rose trembling and pale with her eyes wet and dimmed in luster like stars that shine through rain and looked around her fearfully she thought that the gods might rise in wrath against her even as mortals did for daring to be weary of her life as she rose she saw for the first time before the cold hearth the body of a man it was stretched straightly out on the stone floor the chest was bare upon the breast the right hand was clinched close and hard the limbs were in profound repose the head was lit by the white glimmer from the moon the face was calm and colorless and full of sadness in the dim strange light it looked white as marble colossal as a statue in that passionless restthat dread repose instinctively she drew nearer to him breathless and allured she bent forward and looked closer on his face he was a god like all the rest she thought but deadnot as they were dead with eyes that rejoiced in the light of cloudless suns and with lips that smiled with a serene benignity and an eternal lovebut dead as mortals die without hope without release with the breath frozen on their tired lips and bound on their hearts eternally the burden of their sin and woe she leaned down close by his side and looked on himsorrowful because he alone of all the gods was stricken there and he alone had the shadow of mortality upon him looking thus she saw that his hands were clinched upon his chest as though their latest effort had been to tear the bones asunder and wrench out a heart that ached beneath them she saw that this was not a divine but a human formdead indeed as the rest were but dead by a mans death of assassination or disease or suicide or what men love to call the act of heaven whereby they mean the selfsown fruit of their own faults and follies had the gods slain himbeing a mortalfor his entrance there marcellin in legends had told her of such things he was human with a human beauty which yet white and cold and golden full of serenity and sadness was like the sungods yonder and very strange to her whose eyes had only rested on the sunburnt pinched and rugged faces of the populace around her that beauty allured her she forgot that he had against her the crime of that humanity which she hated he was to her like some noble forest beast some splendid bird of prey struck down by a bolt from some murderous bow strengthless and senseless yet majestic even in its fall the gods slew him because he dared to be too like themselves she thought else he could not be so beautifulheonly a man and dead the dreamy intoxication of fancy had deadened her to all sense of time or fact the exaltation of nerve and brain made all fantastic fantasies seem possible to her as truth herself she was strong and desolate no more since the eyes of the immortals had smiled on her and bade her welcome there and she felt an infinite pity on him inasmuch as with all his likeness to them he yet having incurred their wrath lay helpless there as any broken reed she bent above him her dark rich face with a soft compassion on it she stroked the pale heavy gold of his hair with fingers brown and lithe but infinitely gentle she fanned the cold pain of his forehead with the breath of her roselike mouth she touched him and stroked him and gazed on him as she would have caressed and looked on the velvet hide of the stag the dappled plumage of the hawk the white leaf of the lily a subtle vague pleasure stole on her a sharp sweet sorrow moved herfor he was beautiful and he was dead if they would give him back his life she thought and she looked for the glad forestgod playing on his reed amidst the amber asphodels he who had the smile and the glance of phratos but she could see pans face no more the wind rose the moon was hidden all was dark save the flicker of the flame of the lamp the storm had broken and the rain fell she saw nothing now but the bowed head of thanatos holding the rose of silence to his lips on her ear there seemed to steal a voice from the darkness saying one life alone can ransom another live immortal with us or for that dead manperish she bowed her head where she knelt in the darkness the force of an irresistible fate seemed upon her that sacrifice which is at once the delirium and divinity of her sex had entered into her she was so lowly a thing a creature so loveless and cursed the gods if they took her in pity would soon scorn her as men had scorned whilst he who lay deadthough so still and so white and so mute and so powerlesshe looked a king among men though the gods for his daring had killed him let him live she murmured its for mei am nothingnothing let me die as the dust dieswhat matter the wind blew the flame of the lamp into darkness the moon still shone through the storm on to the face of thanatos he alone heard hethe only friend who fails no living thing he alone remained and waited for her he whom alone of all the godsfor this mans sakeshe chose chapter iii when the trance of her delirious imaginations passed they left her tranquil but with the cold of death seeming to pass already from the form she looked on into hers she was still crouching by his body on the hearth and knew what she had chosen and did not repent he was dead stillor so she thoughtshe watched him with dim dreaming eyes watched him as women do who love she drew the fair glistening hair through her hands she touched the closed and blue veined eyelids tenderly she laid her ear against his heart to hearken for the first returning pulses of the life she had brought back to him it was no more to her the dead body of a man unknown unheeded a stranger and because a mortal of necessity to her a foe it was a nameless wondrous mystic force and splendor to which she had given back the pulse of existence the light of day which was no more the gods nor any mans no more the prey of death nor the delight of love but hershersshared only with the greatness she had bought for him even as she looked on him she felt the first faint flutter in his heart she heard the first faint breath upon his lips his eyes unclosed and looked straight at hers without reason or luster in them clouded with a heavy and delirious pain to dieof hungerlike a rat in a trap he muttered in his throat and strove to rise he fell back senseless striking his head upon the stones she started her hands ceased to wander through his hair and touch his cold lips as she would touch the cup of a flower she rose slowly to her feet she had heard and the words so homely and so familiar in the lives of all the poor pierced the wild faiths and visions of her heated brain as a ray of the clear daybreak pierces through the purple smoke from altar fires of sacrifice the words were so terrible and yet so trite they cleft the mists of her dreams as tempered steel cleaves folds of gossamer to dieof hunger she muttered the phrase after himshaken from her stupor by its gaunt and common truth it roused her to the consciousness of all his actual needs her heart rebelled even against the newlyfound immortal masters since being in wrath they could not strike him swiftly with their vengeance but had killed him thus with these lingering and most bitter pangs and had gathered there as to a festival to see him die as she stooped above him she could discern the faint earthy cavernous odor which comes from the languid lungs and empty chest of one who has long fasted almost unto death she had known that famine odor many a time ere then in the hut of manon dax and by the hedgerows and in the ditches that made the sickbeds of many another as old as wretched and as nobly stubborn against alms in times of drought or in inclement winters the people in all that countryside suffered continually from the hunger torment she had often passed by men and women and children crouching in black and wretched cabins or lying feverstricken on the cold stony fields glad to gnaw a shred of sheepskin or suck a thorny bramble of the fields to quiet the gnawing of their entrails she stood still beside him and thought all light had died the night was black with storm the shadowy shapes were gone there were the roar of the rushing river and the tumult of the winds and rains upon the silence all she saw was this golden head this colorless face this lean and nerveless hand that rested on the feebly beating heartthese she saw as she would have seen the white outlines of a statue in the dark he moved a little with a hollow sigh breadbreadbread he muttered to die for bread at the words all the quick resource and selfreliance which the hard life she led had sharpened and strengthened in her awoke amidst all the dreams and passions and meditations of her mystical faiths and her poetic ignorance the boldness and the independence of her nature roused themselves she had prayed for him to the gods and to the gods given herself for himthat was wellif they kept their faith but if they forsook it the blood rushed back to her heart with its old proud current alone she swore to herself to save him to save him in the gods despite in the street that day she had found the half of a roll of black bread it had lain in the mud none claiming it a sulky lad passed it in scorn a beggar with gold in his wallet kicked it aside with his crutch she took it and put it by for her supper so often some stripe or some jibe replaced a begrudged meal for her at flammas board that was all she had a crust dry as a bone which could do nothing towards saving him which could be of no more use to pass those clinched teeth and warm those frozen veins than so much of the wet sand gathered up from the rivershore neither could there be any wood which if brought in and lit would burn all the timber was green and full of sap and all for a score square leagues around was at that hour drenched with water she knew that the warmth of fire to dry the deadly dampness in the air the warmth of wine to quicken the chillness and the torpor of the reviving life were what were wanted beyond all other things she had seen famine in all its stages and she knew the needs and dangers of that fell disease there was not a creature in all the world who would have given her so much as a loaf or a fagot even if the thought of human aid had ever dawned on her as it was she never even dreamed of it every human handto the rosy fist of the smallest and fairest childwas always clinched against her she would have sooner asked for honey from a knot of snakes or sought a bed of roses in a swarm of wasps as have begged mercy or aid at any human hearth she knew nothing either of any social laws that might have made such need as this a public care on public alms she was used to see men women and children perishing of want she had heard people curse the land that bore and would not nourish them she was habituated to work hard for every bit or drop that passed her lips she lived amidst multitudes who did the same she knew nothing of any public succor to which appeal could in such straits be made if bread were not forthcoming a man or a woman had to die for lack of it as manon dax and marcellin had done that seemed to her a rule of fate against which there was no good in either resistance or appeal what could she do she pondered whatever she would do she knew that she had to do quickly yet she stood irresolute to do anything she had to stoop herself again down to that sort of theft to which no suffering or privation of her own had ever tempted her in a vague fierce fashion unholpen and untaught she hated all sin all quoted it as her only birthright all told her that she was imbued with it body and soul all saw it in her slightest acts in her most harmless words and she abhorred this the one gift which men cast to her as her only heirloom with a strong scornful loathing which stood her in the stead of virtue with an instinctive cynicism which moved her continually yet to which she could have given no name she had loved to see the children and the maidensthose who held her accursed and were themselves held so innocent and juststeal the ripe cherries from the stalk pluck the forbidden flowers that nodded over the convent walls pierce through the boundary fence to reach anothers pear speak a lie softly to the old grayheaded priest and lend their ripe lips to a soldiers rough salute while she the daughter of hell pointed at despised shunned as a leper hunted as a witch kept her hands soilless and her lips untouched it was a pride to her to say in her teeth i am stronger than they when she saw the stolen peach in their hand and heard the lying word on their tongue it had a savage sweetness for her the will with which she denied herself the luxurious fruit that unseen she could have reached a thousand times from the walls when her throat was parched and her body empty with which she uttered the truth and the truth alone though it brought the blows of the cudgel down on her shoulders with which she struck aside in disdain the insolent eyes and mocking mouths of the youths who would fain have taught her that if beggared of all other things she was at least rich in form and hue she hated sin for sin seemed to her only a human word for utter feebleness she had never sinned for herself as far as she knew yet to serve this man on whose face she had never looked before that night she was ready to stoop to the thing which she abhorred she had been so proud of her freedom from all those frailties of passion and greed and selfpity with which the souls of the maidens around her were hauntedso proud with the fierce chaste tameless arrogance of the women of her race that was bred in their blood and taught them as their first duty by the oriental and jealous laws of their vengeful and indolent masters she had been so proudand this cleanliness of hand and heart this immunity from her enemies weakness this independence which she had worn as a buckler of proof against all blows and had girded about her as a zone of purity more precious than gold this the sole treasure she had she was about to surrender for the sake of a stranger it was a greater gift and one harder to give than the life which she had offered for his to the gods she kneeled on one knee on the stone floor beside him her heart torn with a mute and violent struggle her bent face dark and rigid her straight haughty brows knit together in sadness and conflict in the darkness he moved a little he was unconscious yet ever in that burning stupor one remembrance one regret remained with him that the mind of a man can be killed for the want of the food thrown to swine he muttered drearily in the one gleam of reason that abode in the delirium of his brain the words were broken disjointed almost inarticulate but they stung her to action as the spur stings a horse she started erect and crossed the chamber leapt through the open portion of the casement and lighted again without kneedeep in water she lost her footing and fell entangled in the rushes but she rose and climbed in the darkness to where the roots of an oak stump stretched into the stream and gaining the shore ran as well as the storm and the obscurity allowed her along the bank straight towards ypres it was a wild and bitter night the rushing of the foaming river went by her all the way the path was flooded and she was up to her ankles in water at every step and often forced to wade through channels a foot deep she went on straight towards her home unconscious of cold of fatigue of her wet clinging clothes of the water that splashed unseen in the black night up against her face as her steps sank into some shaking strip of marsh some brook which in the rising of the river ran hissing and swelling to twice its common height all she was sensible of was of one inspiration one purpose one memory that seemed to give her the wings of the wind and yet to clog her feet with the weight of leadthe memory of that white sad senseless face lying beneath the watch of the cruel gods she reached ypres feeling and scenting her way by instinct as a dog does all through the tumult of the air and against the force of the driving rains she met no living creature the weather was too bad for even a beggar to be afoot in it and even the stray and homeless beasts had sought some shelter from a ruined shed or crumbling wall as softly as a leaf may fall she unloosed the latch of the orchard stole through the trees and took her way in an impenetrable gloom with the swift sure flight of one to whom the place had long been as familiar by night as day the uproar of wind and rain would have muffled the loudest tread the shutters of the millhouse were all closed it was quite still flamma and his serving people were all gone to their beds that they might save by sleep the cost of wood and candle she passed round to the side of the house climbed up the tough network of a tree of ivy and without much labor loosened the fastenings of her own loft window and entering there passed through the loft into the body of the house opening the doors of the passages noiselessly she stole down the staircase making no more sound than a hare makes stealing over mosses to its form the everwakeful lightlysleeping ears of a miser were near at hand but even they were not aroused and she passed down unheard she went hardily fearlessly once her mind was set upon the errand she did not reason with herself as more timorous creatures might have done that being half starved as recompense for strong and continual labor she was but about to take a just due withheld a fair wage long overdue she only resolved to take what another needed by a violence which she had never employed to serve her own needs and having resolved went to execute her resolution with the unhesitating dauntlessness that was bred in her blood and bone knowing all the turns and steps of the obscure passages she quickly found her way to the storechambers where such food and fuel as were wanted in the house were stored the latter was burnt and the former eaten sparingly and grudgingly but the store of both was at this season of the year fairly abundant it had more than once happened that the mill had been cut off from all communication with the outer world by floods that reached its upper casements and claudis flamma was provided against any such accidents the more abundantly as he had more than once found it a lucrative matter in such seasons of inundation to lower provisions from his roof to boats floating below when the cotters around were in dire need and ready to sell their very souls for a bag of rice or string of onions follefarine opened the shutter of the storeroom and let in the faint gray glimmer from the clearing skies a bat which had been resting from the storm against the rafters fluttered violently against the lattice a sparrow driven down the chimney in the hurricane flew up from one of the shelves with a twittering outcry she paused to open the lattice for them both and set them free to fly forth into the still sleeping world then she took an old rush basket that hung upon a nail and filled it with the best of such homely food as was to be found thereloaves and meats and rice and oil and a flask of the richest winewine of the south of the hue of the violet sold under secrecy at a high charge and profit that done she tied together as large a bundle of brushwood and of fagots as she could push through the window which was broad and square and thrust it out by slow degrees put her basket through likewise and lowered it carefully to the ground then followed them herself with the agility born of long practice and dropped on the grass beneath she waited but to close and refasten the shutter from without then threw the mass of fagots on her shoulders and carrying in her arms the osier basket took her backward way through the orchards to the river she had not taken either bit or drop for her own use she was well used to carry burdens as heavy as the mules bare and to walk under them unassisted for many leagues to the hamlets and markets roundabout but even her strength of bronze had become fatigued she felt frozen to the bone her clothes were saturated with water and her limbs were chill and stiff yet she trudged on unblenching and unpausing over the soaked earth and through the swollen water and the reeds keeping always by the side of the stream that was so angry in the darkness by the side of the gray flooded sands and the rushes that were blowing with a sound like the sea she met no living creature except a fox who rushed between her feet holding in its mouth a screaming chicken once she stumbled and struck her head and breast with a dull blow against a pile of wood which in the furious weather was unseen by her it stunned her for the instant but she rallied and looked up with eyes as used to pierce the deepest gloom as any goshawks she discerned the outline of the calvary towering high and weirdlike above the edge of the river where the priests and people had placed it so that the boatmen could abase themselves and do it honor as they passed the banks the lantern on the cross shone far across the stream but shed no rays upon the path she followed at its foot she had stumbled and been bruised upon her errand of mercy the reflection of its light streamed across to the opposing shore and gave help to a boatload of smugglers landing stolen tobacco in a little creek she recovered herself and trudged on once more along the lonely road how like their god is to them she thought the wooden crucifix was the type of her persecutors of those who flouted and mocked her who flung and pierced her as a witch who cursed her because she was not of their people the cross was the hatred of the world incarnated to her it was in christs name that marcellins corpse had been cast on the dung and in the ditch it was in christs name that the women had avenged on her the pity which she had shown to manon dax it was in christs name that flamma scourged her because she would not pass rotten figs for sweet for the name of christ is used to cover every crime by the peasant who cheats his neighbor of a copper coin as by the sovereign who massacres a nation for a throne she left the black cross reared there against the rushes and plodded on through sand and rain and flood bearing her loadin christs name they would have seized her as a thief the storm abated a little and every now and then a gleam of moonlight was shed upon the flooded meadows she gained the base of the tower and by means of the length of rope let by degrees the firewood and the basket through the open portion of the window on to the floor below then again followed them herself her heart thrilled as she entered her first glance to the desolate hearth showed her that the hours of her absence had brought no change there the gods had not kept faith with her they had not raised him from the dead they have left it all to me she thought with a strange sweet yearning in her heart over this life that she had bought with her own she first flung the fagots and brushwood on the hearth and set them on fire to burn fanned by the breath of the wind then she poured out a little of the wine and kneeled down by him and forced it drop by drop through his colorless lips raising his head upon her as she kneeled the wine was pure and old it suffused his attenuated frame as with a rush of new blood under her hand his heart beat with firmer and quicker movement she broke bread in the wine and put the soaked morsels to his mouth as softly as she would have fed some little shivering bird made nestless by the hurricane he was not conscious yet but he swallowed what she held to him without knowing what he did a slight warmth gradually spread over his limbs a strong shudder shook him his eyes looked dully at her through a film of exhaustion and of sleep javais quelque chose la he muttered incoherently his voice rattling in his hollow chest as he raised himself a little on one arm javais quelque chose la and with a sigh he fell back once morehis head tossing in uneasiness from side to side amidst the heat and mists of his aching brain one thought remained with himthat he had created things greater than himself and that he died like a dog powerless to save them the saddest dying words that the air ever bare on its breaththe one bitter vain regret of every genius that the common herds of men stamp out as they slay their mad cattle or their drunken mobsstayed on the blurred remembrance of his brain which in its stupor and its helplessness still knew that once it had been strong to createthat once it had been clear to recordthat once it had dreamed the dreams which save men from the life of the swinethat once it had told to the world the truth divested of liesand that none had seen none had listened none had believed there is no more terrible woe upon earth than the woe of the stricken brain which remembers the days of its strength the living light of its reason the sunrise of its proud intelligence and knows that all these have passed away like a tale that is told like a year that is spent like an arrow that is shot to the stars and flies aloft and falls in a swamp like a fruit that is too well loved of the sun and so oversoon ripe is dropped from the tree and forgot on the grasses dead to all joys of the dawn and the noon and the summer but alive to the sting of the wasp to the fret of the aphis to the burn of the drought to the theft of the parasite she only dimly understood and yet she was smitten with awe and reverence at that endless grief which had no taint of cowardice upon it but was pure as the patriots despair impersonal as the prophets agony for the first time the mind in her consciously awoke for the first time she heard a human mind find voice even in its stupor and its wretchedness to cry aloud in reproach to its unknown creator i am yours shall i perish with the body why have bade me desire the light and seek it if forever you must thrust me into the darkness of negation shall i be nothing like the muscle that rots like the bones that crumble like the flesh that turns to ashes and blow in a film on the winds shall i die so ithe mind of a man the breath of a god time went by the chimes from the cathedral tolled dully through the darkness over the expanse of the flood the light from the burning wood shone redly and fitfully the sigh and moan of the tossed rushes and of the waterbirds awakened and afraid came from the outer world on the winds that blew through the desolation of the haunted chamber gray owls flew in the high roof taking refuge from the night rats hurried noiseless and eager over the stones of the floor seeking stray grains that fell through the rafters from the granaries above she noticed none of these she never looked up nor around all she heard was the throb of the delirious words on the silence all she saw was the human face in the clouded light through the smoke from the hearth the glow of the fire shone on the bowed head of thanatos the laughing eyes of pan hermes fair cold derisive face and the splendor of the lykegenes toiling in the ropes that bound him to the millstones to grind bread for the mortal appetites and the ineloquent lips of men but at the gods she barely looked her eyes were bent upon the human form before her she crouched beside him half kneeling and half sitting her clothes were drenched the fire scorched the draughts of the air froze her she had neither eaten nor drunk since the noon of the day but she had no other remembrance than of this life which had the beauty of the sunking and the misery of the beggar he lay long restless unconscious muttering strange sad words at times of sense at times of folly but always whether lucid or delirious words of a passionate rebellion against his fate a despairing lament for the soul in him that would be with the body quenched after awhile the feverish mutterings of his voice were lower and less frequent his eyes seemed to become sensible of the glare of the fire and to contract and close in a more conscious pain after a yet longer time he ceased to stir so restlessly ceased to sigh and shudder and he grew quite still his breath came tranquilly his head fell back he sank to a deep sleep the personal fears the womanly terrors which would have assailed creatures at once less savage and less innocent never moved her for an instant that there was any strangeness in her position any peril in this solitude she never dreamed her heart bold with the blood of taric could know no physical fear and her mind at once ignorant and visionary her temper at once fierce and unselfish kept from her all thought of those suspicions which would fall on her and chastise an act like hers suspicions such as would have made a woman less pure and less dauntless tremble at that lonely house that night of storm that unknown fate which she had taken into her own hands unwitting and unheeding whether good or evil might be the issue thereof to her he was beautiful he suffered she had saved him from death and he was hers and this was all that she remembered she dealt with him as she would have done with some forest beast or bird that she should have found frozen in the woods of winter his head had fallen on her and she crouched unwearied in the posture that gave him easiest rest with a touch so soft that it could not awaken him she stroked the lusterless gold of his hair and from time to time felt for the inaudible beating of his heart innumerable dreams shapeless delicious swept through her brain like the echoes of some music faint yet unutterably sweet that half arouses and half soothes some sleeper in a gray drowsy summer dawn for the first time since the melodies of phratos had died forever from off her ear she was happy she did not ask whereforeneither of herself or of the gods did she question whence came this wonderflower of her nameless joy she only sat quiet and let the hours drift by and watched him as he slept and was content so the hours passed whilst yet it seemed night still the silence trembled with the pipe of waking birds the darkness quivered with the pale first rays of dawn over the flood and the fields the first light broke from the unseen world behind the mist faint bells rang in the coming day he moved in his sleep and his eyes unclosed and looked at her face as it hung above him like some drooped rose that was heavy with the too great sweetness of a summer shower it was but the gaze of a moment and his lids dropped again weighted with the intense weariness of a slumber that held all his senses close in its leaden chains but the glance brief though it was had been consciousunder it a sudden flush passed over her a sudden thrill stirred in her as the life stirs in the young trees at the near coming of the spring for the first time since her birth she became wholly human a sharp terror made her tremble like a leaf she put his head softly from her on the ground and rose quivering to her feet it was not the gods she feared it was herself she had never once known that she had beauty more than the flower knows it blowing on the wind she had passed through the crowds of fair and market not knowing why the youths looked after her with cruel eyes all aglow she had walked through them indifferent and unconscious thinking that they wanted to hunt her down as an unclean beast and dared not because her teeth were strong she had taken a vague pleasure in the supple grace of her own form as she had seen it mirrored in some woodland pool where she had bathed amidst the waterlilies but it had been only such an instinctive and unstudied pleasure as the swan takes in seeing her silver breast shine back to her on the glassy current adown which she sails nowas she rose and stood as the dawn broke beside him on the hearth and heard the birds first waking notes that told her the sun was even then touching the edge of the veiled world to light a hot shame smote her and the womanhood in her woke she looked down on herself and saw that her soaked skirts were knotted above her knees as she had bound them when she had leaped from the boats side that her limbs were wet and glistening with river water and the moisture from the grasses and the sand and shingle of the shore and that the linen of her vest threadbare with age left her arms bare and showed through its rents the gleam of her warm brown skin and the curves of her shining shoulders a sudden horror came upon her lest he should awake again and see her as she waswet miserable halfclothed windtossed like the rushes outcast and ashamed she did not know that she had beauty in her she did not know that even as she was she had an exquisitely savage grace as stormbirds have in theirs against the thundercloud and the lightning blaze of their waterworld in tempest she felt a sudden shrinking from all chance of his clearer and more conscious gaze a sudden shy dread and longing to hide herself under the earth or take refuge in the depth of the waters rather than meet those eyes to which she had given back the light of life cast on her in abhorrence and in scornand that he could have any other look for her she had no thought she had been an outcast among an alien people too long to dream that any human love could ever fall on her she had been too long cursed by every tongue to dream that any human voice could ever arise in honor or in welcome to a thing so despised and criminal as she for the gift which she had given this man too would curse herthat she had known when she had offered it she drew her rude garments closer and stole away with velvet footfall through the twilight of the dawn her head hung down and her face was flushed as with some great guilt with the rising of the day all her new joy was banished with the waking of the world all her dreams shrank back into secrecy and shame the mere timid song of the linnet in the leafless bushes seemed sharp on her ear calling on her to rise and go forth to her work as the creature of toil of exile of namelessness and of despair that men had made her at the casement she turned and cast one long but lingering glance upon him where he slept then once more she launched herself into the dusky and watery mists of the cold dawn she had made no more sound in her passing than a bird makes in her flight the sleeper never stirred but dreamed on motionless in the darkness and the silence and the drowsy warmth he dreamed indeed of a womans form half bare golden of hue like a fruit of the south blue veined and flushed to changing rose heats like an opals fire with limbs strong and yet slender gleaming wet with water and brown arched feet all shining with silvery sands with mystical eyes black as night and amorouslidded and a mouth like the halfclosed bud of a flower which sighing seemed to breathe upon him all the fragrance of dim cedarwoods shrouded in summer rains of honeyweighted heather blown by moorland winds of almond blossoms tossed like snow against a purple sea of all things airborn sunfed fair and free but he saw these only as in a dream and as a dream when he awakened they had passed though still dark from heavy clouds the dawn grew into morning as she went noiselessly away over the gray sands the wet shorepaths the sighing rushes the rivermeadows were all flooded and on the opposite banks the road was impassable but on her side she could still find footing for the ground there had a steeper rise and the swollen tide had not reached in any public roadway too high for her to wade or draw herself by the halfmerged bushes through it on the homeward tracks to ypres the low sun was hidden in a veil of water the old convent bells of all the countryside sang through the mists the day was still young but the life of the soil and the stream was waking as the birds were boats went down the current bearing a sad freightage of sheep drowned in the night and of ruined peasants whose little wealth of stack and henhouse had been swept down by the unlookedfor tide from the distant banks the voices of women came muffled through the fog weeping and wailing for some lost lamb choked by the water in its fold or some pretty breadth of garden just fragrant with snowdrops and with violets that had been laid desolate and washed away through the clouds of vapor that curled in a dense opaque smoke from the wet earth there loomed the dusky shapes of oxen their belled horns sending forth a pleasant music from the gloom on the air there was a sweet damp odor from soaked grasses and upturned sods from the breath of the herds lowing hock deep in water from the green knots of broken primrose roots sailing by on the brown rough river a dying bush of gray lavender swept by on the stream it had the fresh moulds of its lost gardenhome still about it and in its stems a robin had built her little nest the nest streamed in tatters and ruin on the wind the robin flew above the wreck fluttering and uttering shrill notes of woe follefarine saw nothing she held on her way blindly mutely mechanically by sheer force of long habit her mind was in a trance she was insensible of pain or cold of hunger or fever of time or place yet she went straight home as the horse being blinded will do to the place where its patience and fealty have never been recompensed with any other thing than blows as she had groped her way through the gloom of the night and found it though the light of the roadside christ had been turned from her so in the same blind manner she had groped her way to her own conceptions of honesty and duty she hated the bitter and cruel old man with a passion fierce and enduring that nothing could have changed yet all the same she served him faithfully this was an untamed animal indeed that he had yoked to his plowshare but she did her work loyally and doggedly and whenever she had shaken her neck free of the yoke she returned and thrust her head through it again whether he scourged her back to it or not it was partially from the force of habit which is strong upon all creatures it was partially from a vague instinct in her to work out her right to the begrudged shelter which she received and not to be beholden for it for one single hour to any charity the mill was at work in the twilight when she reached it claudis flamma screamed at her from the open door of the loft where he was weighing corn for the grinding you have been away all night long he cried to her she was silent standing below in the wet garden he cast a foul word at her new upon his lips she was silent all the same her arms crossed on her breast her head bent where is the boatthat is worth more than your body and soul you have none she raised her head and looked upward i have lost the boat she thought that very likely he would kill her for it once when she had lost an osier basket not a hundredth part the cost of this vessel he had beaten her till every bone in her frame had seemed broken for many a week but she looked up quietly there among the dripping bushes and the cheerless grassy ways that she never told a lie he above in the loft knew by long proof but this was in his sight only on a piece with the strength born in her from the devil the devil had in all ages told so many truths to the confusion of the saints god drifted where i do not knowon the face of the floodwith the tide you had left it loose i got out to push it off the sand it had grounded i forgot it it went adrift what foul thing were you at meanwhile she was silent if you do not say i will cut your heart out with a hundred stripes you can i can you shall know truly that i can go get the boatfind it above or below wateror to the town prison you go as a thief the word smote her with a sudden pang for the first time her courage failed her she turned and went in silence at his bidding in the wet daybreak through the swollen pools and the soaked thickets she searched for the lost vessel knowing well that it would be scarcely less than a miracle which could restore it to her and that the god upon the cross worked no miracles for hera child of sin for several hours she searched hungry drenched with water ready to drop with exhaustion as she was used to see the overdriven cattle sink upon the road she passed many peasants women on their mules men in their barges children searching for such flotsam and jetsam as might have been flung upon the land from the little flooded gardens and the few riverside cabins that had been invaded in the night she asked tidings of the missing treasure from none of these what she could not do for herself it never occurred to her that others could do for her it was an ignorance that was strength at length to her amaze she found it saved for her by the branches of a young tree which being blown down had fallen into the stream and had caught the boat hard and fast as in a net at peril to her life she dislodged it with infinite labor from the entanglement of the boughs and at scarce less peril rowed on her homeward way upon the swollen force of the turbid river full against the tide which again was flowing inland from the sea that beat the bar away to the northward in the full sunrise it was far on in the forenoon as she drew near the orchards of ypres brown in their leaflessness and with gray lichens blowing from their boughs like hoary beards of trembling paupers shaking in the icy breaths of charity she saw that claudis flamma was at work amidst his trees pruning and delving in the red and chilly day she went up the winding stairs planks green and slippery with wet river weeds which led straight through the apple orchards to the mill i have found the boat she said standing before him her voice was faint and very tired her whole body drooped with fatigue her head for once was bowed he turned with his billhook in his hand there was a leap of gladness at his heart the misers gladness over recovered treasure but he showed such weakness neither in his eye nor words it is well for you that you have he said with bitter meaning i will spare you half the stripesstrip without a word of remonstrance standing before him in the gray shadow of the lichens and the red mists of the morning she pushed the rough garments from her breast and shoulders and vanquishing her weakness drew herself erect to receive the familiar chastisement i am guiltythis time she said to herself as the lash fellshe was thinking of her theft chapter iv a score of years before in a valley of the far north a group of eager and silent listeners stood gathered about one man who spoke aloud with fervent and rapturous oratory it was in the green norwegian spring when the silence of the winter world had given way to a million sounds of waking life from budding leaves and nesting birds and melting torrents and warm winds fanning the tender primrose into being and wooing the red alpine rose to blossom the little valley was peopled by a hardy race of herdsmen and of fishers men who kept their goatflocks on the steep sides of the mountains or went down to the deep waters in search of a scanty subsistence but they were a people simple noble grave even in a manner heroic and poetic a people nurtured on the old grand songs of a mighty past and holding a pure faith in the traditions of a great seasovereignty they listened breathless to the man who addressed them raised on a tribune of rough rock and facing the ocean where it stretched at the northward end of the vale a man peasantborn himself but gifted with a native eloquence halfpoet halfpreacher fanatic and enthusiast one who held it as his errand to go to and fro the land raising his voice against the powers of the world and of wealth and who spoke against these with a fervor and force which to the unlearned and impressionable multitudes that heard him seemed the voice of a genius heavensent when a boy he had been a shepherd and dreaming in the loneliness of the mountains and by the side of the deep hilllakes far away from any sound or steps of human life a madness innocent and in its way beautiful had come upon him he believed himself born to carry the message of grace to the nations and to raise his voice up against those passions whose fury had never assailed him and against those riches whose sweetness he had never tasted so he had wandered from city to city from village to village mocked in some places revered in others protesting always against the dominion of wealth and speaking with a strange pathos and poetry which thrilled the hearts of his listeners and had almost in it at times the menace and the mystery of a prophets upbraiding he lived very poorly he was gentle as a child he was a cripple and very feeble he drank at the wayside rills with the dogs he lay down on the open fields with the cattle yet he had a power in him that had its sway over the people and held the scoffers and the jesters quiet under the spell of his tender and flutelike tones raised above the little throng upon the bare red rock with the vast green fields and dim pinewoods stretching round him as far as his eye could reach he preached now to the groups of fishers and herdsmen and foresters and hunters protesting to this simple people against the force of wealth and the lust of possession as though he preached to princes and to conquerors he told them of what he had seen in the great cities through which he had wandered of the corruption and the vileness and the wantonness of the greed in which the days and the years of mens lives were spent of the amassing of riches for which alone the nations cared so that all loveliness all simplicity all high endeavor all innocent pastime were abjured and derided among them and his voice was sweet and full as the swell of music as he spoke to them telling them one of the many fables and legends of which he had gathered a full harvest in the many lands that had felt his footsteps this was the parable he told them that day whilst the rude toilers of the forests and the ocean stood quiet as little children hearkening with upturned faces and bated breath as the sun went down behind the purple pines there lived once in the east a great king he dwelt far away among the fragrant fields of roses and in the light of suns that never set he was young he was beloved he was fair of face and form and the people as they hewed stone or brought water said among themselves verily this man is as a god he goes where he lists and he lies still or rises up as he pleases and all fruits off all lands are culled for him and his nights are nights of gladness and his days when they dawn are all his to sleep through or spend as he wills but the people were wrong for this king was weary of his life his buckler was sown with gems but his heart beneath it was sore for he had been long bitterly harassed by foes who descended upon him as wolves from the hills in their hunger and plagued with heavy wars and with bad rice harvests and with many troubles to his nation that kept it very poor and forbade him to finish the building of new marble palaces and the making of fresh gardens of delight in which his heart was set so he being weary of a barren land and of an empty treasury with all his might prayed to the gods that all he touched might turn to gold even as he had heard had happened to some magician long before in other ages and the gods gave him the thing he craved and his treasury overflowed no king had ever been so rich as this king now became in the short space of a single summerday but it was bought with a price when he stretched out his hand to gather the rose that blossomed in his path a golden flower scentless and stiff was all he grasped when he called to him the carrierdove that sped with a scroll of lovewords across the mountains the bird sank on his breast a carven piece of metal when he was athirst and shouted to his cupbearer for drink the red wine ran a stream of molten gold when he would fain have eaten the pulse and the pomegranate grew alike to gold between his teeth and at eventide when he sought the silent chambers of his harem saying here at least shall i find rest and bent his steps to the couch whereon his bestbeloved slave was sleeping a statue of gold was all he drew into his eager arms and cold shut lips of sculptured gold were all that met his own that night the great king slew himself unable any more to bear this agony since all around him was desolation even though all around him was wealth now the world is too like that king and in its greed of gold it will barter its life away look youthis thing is certain i say that the world will perish even as that king perished slain as he was slain by the curse of its own fulfilled desire the future of the world is written for god has granted their prayer to men he has made them rich and their riches shall kill them when all green places shall have been destroyed in the builders lust of gainwhen all the lands are but mountains of brick and piles of wood and ironwhen there is no moisture anywhere and no rain ever fallswhen the sky is a vault of smoke and all the rivers rank with poisonwhen forest and stream and moor and meadow and all the old green wayside beauty are things vanished and forgottenwhen every gentle timid thing of brake and bush of air and water has been killed because it robbed them of a berry or a fruitwhen the earth is one vast city whose young children behold neither the green of the field nor the blue of the sky and hear no song but the hiss of the steam and know no music but the roar of the furnacewhen the old sweet silence of the countryside and the old sweet sounds of waking birds and the old sweet fall of summer showers and the grace of a hedgerow bough and the glow of the purple heather and the note of the cuckoo and cricket and the freedom of waste and of woodland are all things dead and remembered of no manthen the world like the eastern king will perish miserably of famine and of drought with gold in its stiffened hands and gold in its withered lips and gold everywheregold that the people can neither eat nor drink gold that cares nothing for them but mocks them horriblygold for which their fathers sold peace and health holiness and libertygold that is one vast grave his voice sank and the silence that followed was only filled with the sound of the winds in the pinewoods and the sound of the sea on the shore the people were very still and afraid for it seemed to them that he had spoken as prophets speak and that his words were the words of truth suddenly on the awestricken silence an answering voice rang clear scornful bold and with the eager and fearless defiance of youth if i had been that king i would not have cared for woman or bird or rose i would have lived long enough to enrich my nation and mass my armies and die a conqueror what would the rest have mattered you are mad o preacher to rail against gold you flout a god that you know not and that never has smiled upon you the speaker stood outside the crowd with a dead seabird in his hand he was in his early boyhood he had long locks of bright hair that curled loosely on his shoulders and eyes of northern blue that flashed like steel in their scorn the people indignant and terrified at the cold rough words which blasphemed their prophet turned with one accord to draw off the rash doubter from that sacred audienceplace but the preacher stayed their hands with a gesture and looked sadly at the boy is it thee arslan dost thou praise goldi thought thou hadst greater gods the boy hung his head and his face flushed gold must be power always he muttered and without power what is life and he went on his way out from the people with the dead bird which he had slain with a stone that he might study the exquisite mysteries of its silvery hues the preacher followed him dreamily with his glance yet he will not give his life for gold he murmured for there is that in him greater than gold which will not let him sell it if he would chapter v and the words of the preacher had come true so true that the boy arslan grown to manhood had dreamed of fame and following the genius in him and having failed to force the world to faith in him had dropped down dying on a cold hearth for sheer lack of bread under the eyes of the gods it had long been day when he awoke the wood smouldered still warming the stone chamber the owls that nested in the ceiling of the hall were beating their wings impatiently against the closed casements blind with the light and unable to return to their haunts and homes the food and the wine stood beside him on the floor the fire had scared the rats from theft he raised himself slowly and by sheer instinct ate and drank with the avidity of long fast then he stared around him blankly blinded like the owls it seemed to him that he had been dead and had risen from the grave it will be to suffer it all over again in a little space he muttered dully his first sensation was disappointment anger weariness he did not reason he only felt his mind was a blank little by little a disjointed remembrance came to him he remembered that he had been famished in the coldness of the night endured much torment of the body had fallen headlong and lost his consciousness this was all he could recall he looked stupidly for awhile at the burning logs at the pile of brambles at the flask of wine and the simple stores of food he looked at the gray closed window through which a silvery daylight came there was not a sound in the house there was only the cracking of the wood and the sharp sealike smell of the smoking pine boughs to render the place different from what it had been when he last had seen it he could recall nothing except that he had starved for many days had suffered and must have slept suddenly his face burned with a flush of shame as sense returned to him he knew that he must have swooned from weakness produced by cold and hunger that some one must have seen and succored his necessity and that the food which he had half unconsciously devoured must have been the food of alms his limbs writhed and his teeth clinched as the thought stole on him to have gone through all the aching pangs of winter in silence asking aid of none only to come to this at last to have been ready to die in all the vigor of virility in all the strength of genius only to be saved by charity at the end to have endured mute and patient the travail of all the barren years only at their close to be called back to life by aid that was degradation he bit his lips till the blood started as he thought of it some eyes must have looked on him in his wretchedness some face must have bent over him in his misery some other human form must have been near his in this hour of his feebleness and need or this thing could never have been he would have died alone and unremembered of man like a snake in its swamp or a fox in its earth and such a death would have been to him tenfold preferable to a life restored to him by such a means as this death before accomplishment is a failure yet withal may be great but life paved by alms is a failure and a failure forever inglorious so the shame of this ransom from death far outweighed with him the benefit why could they not let me be he cried in his soul against those unknown lives which had weighed his own with the fetters of obligation rather death than a debt i was content to die the bitterness was passed i should have known no more why could they not let me be and his heart was hard against them they had stolen his only birthrightfreedom had he craved life so much as to desire to live by shame he would soon have gone out into the dusky night and have snatched food enough for his wants from some rich husbandmans granaries or have stabbed some miser at prayers for a bag of goldrather crime than the debt of a beggar so he reasoned stung and made savage by the scourge of enforced humiliation hating himself because in obedience to mere animal craving he had taken and eaten not asking whether what he took was his own he had closed his mouth living and had been ready to die mute glad only that none had pitied him his heart hardened itself utterly against this unknown hand which had snatched him from deaths dreamless ease and ungrudged rest to awaken him to a humiliation that would be as ashes in his teeth so long as his life should last he arose slowly and staggered to the casement he fancied he was delirious and had distempered visions of the food so long desired he knew that he had been starving longhow long long enough for his brain to be weak and visited with phantoms instinctively he touched the long round rolls of bread the shape of the wine cask the wicker of the basket they were the palpable things of common life they seemed to tell him that he had not dreamed then it was charity his lips moved with a curse that was his only thanksgiving the windows were unshuttered through them he looked straight out upon the rising daya day rainless and pale and full of cool softness after the deluge of the rains the faint sunlight of a spring that was still chilled by winter was shed over the flooded fields and swollen streams snowwhite mists floated before the languid passage of the wind and the moist land gave back as in a mirror the leafless trees the wooden bridges the belfries and the steeples and the strange sad bleeding christs on all sides near the meadows were sheets of water the woods seemed to drift upon a lake a swans nest was washed past on broken rushes the great silvery birds beating their heavy wings upon the air and pursuing their ruined home with cries beyond everything was veiled in the twilight of the damp gray vapor a world half seen half shrouded lovely exceedingly filled with all divine possibilities and all hidden powers a world such as youth beholds with longing eyes in its visions of the future a beautiful world he said to himself and he smiled wearily as he said it beautiful certainly in that delicious shadow in that vague light in that cloudlike mist wherein the earth met heaven beautiful certainly all those mystical shapes rising from the sea of moisture which hid the earth and all the things that toiled on it it was beautiful this calm dim morning world in which there was no sound except the distant ringing of unseen bells this veil of vapor whence sprang these fairy and fantastic shapes that cleft the watery air this colorless transparent exhalation breathing up from the land to the sky in which all homely things took grace and mystery and every common and familiar form became transfigured it was beautiful but this landscape had been seen too long and closely by him for it to have power left to cheat his senses under that pure and mystical veil of the refracted rain things vile and things full of anguish had their beingthe cattle in the slaughterhouses the drunkard in the hovels disease and debauch and famine the ditch that was the common grave of all the poor the hospital where pincers and knives tore the living nerves in the inquisition of science the fields where the women toiled bent cramped and hideous the dumb driven beasts patient and tortured forever blameless yet forever accursedall these were there beneath that lovely veil through which there came so dreamily the slender shafts of spires and the chimes of halfheard bells he stood and watched it long so long that the clouds descended and the vapors shifted away and the pale sunrays shone clearly over a disenchanted world where roof joined roof and casement answered casement and the figures on the crosses became but rude and illcarved daubs and the cocks crew to one another and the herdsmen swore at their flocks and the oxen flinched at the goad and the women went forth to their fieldwork and all the charm was gone then he turned away the cold fresh breath of the morning had breathed upon him and driven out the dull delicious fancies that had possessed his brain the simple truth was plain before him that he had been seen by some stranger in his necessity and succored he was thankless like the suicide to whom unwelcome aid denies the refuge of the grave calling him back to suffer and binding on his shoulders the discarded burden of lifes infinite weariness and woes he was thankless for he had grown tired of this fruitless labor this abortive combat he had grown tired of seeking credence and being derided for his pains while other men prostituted their powers to base use and public gain receiving as their wages honor and applause he had grown tired of toiling to give beauty and divinity to a world which knew them not when it beheld them he had grown tired though he was yet young and had strength and had passion and had manhood tiredutterly because he was destitute of all things save his genius and in that none were found to believe i have tried all things and there is nothing of any worth it does not need to have worn the imperial purples and to be lying dying in old age to know thus much in all truth and all bitterness why did they give me back my life he said in his heart as he turned aside from the risen sun he had striven to do justly with this strange fleeting unasked gift of existence which comes already warped into our hands and is broken by death ere we can set it straight he had not spent it in riot or madness in lewd love or in gambling greed he had been governed by great desires though these had been fruitless and had spent his strength to a great end though this had been never reached as he turned from looking out upon the swollen stream that rushed beneath his windows his eyes fell upon the opposite wall where the white shapes of his cartoons were caught by the awakening sun the spider had drawn his dusty trail across them the rat had squatted at their feet the darkness of night had enshrouded and defaced them yet with the morning they arose stainless noble undefiled among them there was one colossal form on which the sun poured with its full radiance this was the form of a captive grinding at a millstone the majestic symmetrical supple form of a man who was also a god in his naked limbs there was a supreme power in his glance there was a divine command his head was lifted as though no yoke could ever lie on that proud neck his foot seemed to spurn the earth as though no mortal tie had ever bound him to the sod that human steps bestrode yet at the cornmill he labored grinding wheat like the patient blinded oxen that toiled beside him for it was the great apollo in pherae the hand which awoke the music of the spheres had been bloodstained with murder the beauty which had the light and luster of the sun had been darkened with passion and with crime the will which no other on earth or in heaven could withstand had been bent under the chastisement of zeus he whose glance had made the black and barren slopes of delos to laugh with fruitfulness and gladnesshe whose prophetic sight beheld all things past present and to come the fate of all unborn races the doom of all unspent ageshe the farstriking king labored here beneath the curse of crime greatest of all the gods and yet a slave in all the hills and vales of greece his io paean sounded still upon his holy mountains there still arose the smoke of fires of sacrifice with dance and song the delian maidens still hailed the divinity of letos son the waves of the pure ionian air still rang forever with the name of delphinios at pytho and at clarus in lycia and in phokis his oracles still breathed forth upon their fiat terror or hope into the lives of men and still in all the virgin forests of the world the wild beasts honored him wheresoever they wandered and the lion and the boar came at his bidding from the deserts to bend their free necks and their wills of fire meekly to bear his yoke in thessaly yet he labored here at the cornmill of admetus and watching him at his bondage there stood the slender slight wingfooted hermes with a slow mocking smile upon his knavish lips and a jeering scorn in his keen eyes even as though he cried o brother who would be greater than i for what hast thou bartered to me the golden rod of thy wealth and thy dominion over the flocks and the herds for seven chords strung on a shellfor a melody not even thine own for a lyre outshone by my syrinx hast thou sold all thine empire to me will human ears give heed to thy song now thy scepter has passed to my hands immortal music only is left thee and the vision foreseeing the future o god o hero o fool what shall these profit thee now thus to the artist by whom they had been begotten the dim white shapes of the deities spoke thus he saw them thus he heard whilst the pale and watery sunlight lit up the form of the toiler in pherae for even as it was with the divinity of delos so is it likewise with the genius of a man which being born of a god yet is bound as a slave to the grindstone since even as hermes mocked the lord of the unerring bow so is genius mocked of the world when it has bartered the herds and the grain and the rod that metes wealth for the seven chords that no ear dully mortal can hear and as he looked upon this symbol of his life the captivity and the calamity the strength and the slavery of his existence overcame him and for the first hour since he had been born of a woman arslan buried his face in his hands and wept he could bend great thoughts to take the shapes that he chose as the chained god in pherae bound the strong kings of the desert and forest to carry his yoke yet like the god he likewise stood fettered to the mill to grind for bread book iv chapter i a valley long and narrow shut out from the rest of the living world by the ramparts of stone that rose on either side to touch the clouds dense forests of pines purple as night where the erlking rode and the bearking reigned at one end mountains mist and gloom at the other end the ocean brief days with the sun shed on a world of snow in which the sounds of the winds and the moans of the wolves alone were heard in the solitude long nights of marvelous magnificence with the stars of the arctic zone glowing with an unbearable luster above a sea of phosphorescent fire those were arslans earliest memoriesthose had made him what he was in that pineclothed norwegian valley opening to the sea there were a few homesteads gathered together round a little wooden church with torrents falling above them and a profound loneliness around severed by more than a days journey from any other of the habitations of men there a simple idyllic life rolled slowly on through the late and lovely springtimes when the waters loosened and the seed sprouted and the white blossoms broke above the black ground through the short and glorious summers when the childrens eyes saw the elves kiss the roses and the fairies float on the sunbeam and the maidens braided their fair hair with blue cornflowers to dance on the eve of st john through the long and silent winters when an almost continual night brooded over all things and the thunder of the ocean alone answered the war of the windtorn forests and the bloodred blaze of the northern light gleamed over a white still mountain world and within doors by the warm wood fire the youths sang scandinavian ballads and the old people told strange sagas and the mothers rocking their newborn sons to sleep prayed god to have mercy on all human lives drowning at sea and frozen in the snow in this alpine valley a green nest hidden amidst stupendous walls of stone bottomless precipices and summits that touched the clouds there was a cottage even smaller and humbler than most and closest of all to the church it was the house of the pastor the old man had been born there and had lived there all the years of his lifesave a few that he had passed in a town as a studentand he had wedded a neighbor who like himself had known no other home than this one village he was gentle patient simple and full of tenderness he worked like his people all the week through in the open weather among his fruittrees his little breadth of pasturage his herbgarden and his few sheep on the sabbathday he preached to the people the creed that he himself believed in with all the fond unquestioning implicit faith of the young children who lifted to him their wondering eyes he was good he was old in his simple needs and his undoubting hopes he was happy all the living things of his little world loved him and he loved them so fate lit on him to torture him as it is its pleasure to torture the innocent it sent him a daughter who was fair to sight and had a voice like music a form lithe and white hair of gold and with eyes like her own blue skies on a summer night she had never seen any other spot save her own valley but she had the old norse blood in her veins and she was restless the sea tempted her with an intense power she desired passionately without knowing what she desired the simple pastoral work the peaceful household labors the girls garland of alpine flowers the youths singing in the brief rose twilight the saga told the thousandth time around the lamp in the deep midwinter silence these things would not suffice for her the old scandinavian bersaeck madness was in her veins the mountains were to her as the walls of a tomb and one day the sea tempted her too utterly beyond her strength as a lover after a thousand vain entreaties one day tempts a woman and one day finds her weak the sea vanquished her and she wentwhither they hardly knew to these old people the world that lay behind their mountain fortress was a blank it might be a paradise it might be a prison they could not tell they suffered their great agony meekly they never cursed her they did not even curse their god because they had given life to a womanchild after awhile they heard of her she wrote them tender and glowing words she was well she was proud she was glad she had found those who told her that she had a voice which was a gift of gold and that she might sing in triumph to the nations such tidings came to her parents from time to time brief words first teeming with hope then delirious with triumph yet ever ending with a short sad sigh of conscience a prayer for pardonpardon for what the letters never said perhaps only for the sin of desertion the slow salt tears of age fell on these glowing pages in which the heart of a young vainglorious mad tender creature had stamped itself but the old people never spoke of them to others she is happy it does not matter for us this was all they said yet this gentle patience was a martyrdom too sharp to last within that year the mother died and the old man was left alone the long winter came locking the valley within its fortress of ice severing it from all the rest of the breathing human world and the letters ceased he would not let them say that she had forgotten he chose to think that it was the wall of snow which was built up between them rather than any division raised by her ingratitude and oblivion the sweet sudden spring came all the white and golden flowers breaking up from the hard crust of the soil and all the loosened waters rushing with a shout of liberty to join the sea the summer followed with the red mountain roses blossoming by the brooks and the green mountain grasses blowing in the wind with the music of the herdbells ringing down the passes and the sound of the fife and of the reedpipe calling the maidens to the dance in the midst of the summer one night when all the stars were shining above the quiet valley and all the children slept under the roofs with the swallows and not a soul was stirring save where here and there a lover watched a light glare in some lattice underneath the eaves a halfdead woman dragged herself feebly under the limetree shadows of the pastors house and struck with a faint cry upon the door and fell at her fathers feet broken and senseless before the full day dawned she had given birth to a male child and was dead forgiveness had killed her she might have borne reproach injury malediction but against that infinite love which would bear with her even in her wretchedness and would receive her even in her abasement she had no strength she died as her sons eyes opened to the morning light he inherited no name and they called him after his grandsire arslan when his dead daughter lay stretched before him in the sunlight with her white large limbs folded to rest and her noble fair face calm as a mask of marble the old pastor knew littlenothingof what her life through these two brief years had been her lips had scarcely breathed a word before she had fallen senseless on his threshold that she had had triumph he knew that she had fallen into dire necessities he saw whether she had surrendered art for the sake of love or whether she had lost the public favor by some public caprice whether she had been eminent or obscure in her career whether it had abandoned her or she had abandoned it he could not tell and he knew too little of the world to be able to learn that she had traveled back on her weary way homeward to her native mountains that her son might not perish amidst strangers thus much he knew but no more nor was more ever known by any living soul in life there are so many histories which are like broken boughs that strew the ground snapped short at either end so that none know the crown of them nor the root the child whom she had left grew in goodliness and strength and stature until the people said that he was like the childking whom their hero frithiof raised up upon his buckler above the multitude and who was not afraid but boldly gripped the brazen shield and smiled fearlessly at the noonday sun the child had his mothers scandinavian beauty the beauty of a marble statue white as the snow of great height and largely moulded and his free life amidst the icefields and the pinewoods and on the wide wild northern seas developed these bodily to their uttermost perfection the people admired and wondered at him love him they did not the lad was cold dauntless silent he repelled their sympathies and disdained their pastimes he chose rather to be by himself than with them he was never cruel but he was never tender and when he did speak he spoke with a sort of eloquent scorn and caustic imagery that seemed to them extraordinary in one so young but his grandfather loved him with a sincere love though it was tinged with so sharp a bitterness and reared him tenderly and wisely and braced him with a scholars lore and by a mountaineers exposure so that both brain and body had their due he was a simple childlike broken old man but in this youth of promise that unfolded itself beside his age seemed to strike fresh root and he had wisdom and skill enough to guide it justly the desire of his soul was that his grandson should succeed him in the spiritual charge of that tranquil and beloved valley and thus escape the dire perils of that world in which his mothers life had been caught and consumed like a moths in flame but arslans eyes looked ever across the ocean with that look in them which had been in his mothers and when the old norseman spoke of this holy and peaceful future he was silent moreover hewho had never beheld but the rude paintings on panels of pine that decorated the little red church under the firs and lindenshe had the gift of art in him he had few and rough means only with which to make his crude and unguided essays but the delirium of it was on him and the peasants of his village gazed awestricken and adoring before the things which he drew on every piece of pinewood on every smooth breadth of seaworn granite on every bare surface of limewashed wall that he could find at liberty for his usage when they asked him what in his manhood he would do he said little i will never leave the old man he made answer and he kept his word up to his twentieth year he never quitted the valley he studied deeply after his own manner but nearly all his hours were passed in the open air alone in the pure cold air of the highest mountain summits amidst the thunder of the furious torrents in the black recesses of lonely forests where none save the wolf and the bear wandered with him or away on the vast expanse of the sea where the storm drove the great arctic waves like scourged sheep and the huge breakers seized the shore as a panther its prey on such a world as this and on the marvelous nights of the north his mind fed itself and his youth gained its powers the faint feeble life of the old man held him to this lonely valley that seemed filled with the coldness the mystery the unutterable terror and the majesty of the arctic pole to which it looked but unknown to him circumstance thus held him likewise where alone the genius in him could take its full shape and full stature unknown to him in these years it took the depth the strength the patience the melancholy the virility of the north took these never to be lost again in the twentieth winter of his life an avalanche engulfed the pastors house and the little church by which it stood covering both beneath a mountain of earth and snow and rock and riven trees some of the timbers withstood the shock and the roof remained standing uncrushed above their heads the avalanche fell some little time after midnight there were only present in the dwelling himself the old man and a serving woman the woman was killed on her bed by the fall of a beam upon her he and the pastor still lived lived in perpetual darkness without food or fuel or any ray of light the wooden clock stood erect uninjured they could hear the hours go by in slow succession the old man was peaceful and even cheerful praising god often and praying that help might come to his beloved one but his strength could not hold out against the icy cold the long hunger the dreadful blank around as of perpetual night he died ere the first day had wholly gone by at evensong saying still that he was content and still praising god who had rewarded his innocence with shame and recompensed his service with agony for two more days and nights arslan remained in his living tomb enshrouded in eternal gloom alone with the dead stretching out his hands ever and again to meet that icy touch rather than be without companionship on the morning of the third day the people of the village who had labored ceaselessly reached him and he was saved as soon as the spring broke he left the valley and passed over the mountains seeking a new world his old familiar home had become hateful to him he had no tie to it save two low graves still snowcovered underneath a knot of tall stonepines the old norse passion of wandering was in his veins as it had been in his mothers before him he fiercely and mutely descried freedom passion knowledge art fame as she had desired them and he went turning his face from that lowly green nest lying like a larks between the hills he did not go as youth mostly goes blind with a divine dream of triumph he went consciously to a bitter combat as the seakings of old whose blood ran in his veins and whose strength was in his limbs had gone to war setting their prow hard against the sharp salt waves and in the teeth of an adverse wind he was not without money the pastor indeed had died almost penniless he had been always poor and had given the little he possessed to those still poorer but the richest landowner in the village the largest possessor of flocks and herds dying childless had bequeathed his farm and cattle to arslan having loved the lads dead mother silently and vainly the value of these realized by sale gave to arslan when he became his own master what in that valley at least was wealth and he went without care for the future on this score into the world of men his mind full of dreams and the beautiful myths of dead ages his temper compounded of poetry and of coldness of enthusiasm and of skepticism his one passion a supreme ambition pure as snow in its instinct but half savage in its intensity from that spring when he had passed away from his birthplace as the winter snows were melting on the mountainsides and the mountain flowers were putting forth their earliest buds under the pineboughs until the time that he now stood solitary starving and hopeless before the mocking eyes of his hermes twelve years had run their course and all through them he had never once again beheld his native land like the scandinavian regner he chose rather to perish in the folds and by the fangs of the snakes that devoured him than return to his country with the confession of defeat and despite the powers that were in him his life had been a failure an utter failureas yet in his early youth he had voyaged often with men who went to the extreme north in search of skins and such poor trade as they could drive with esquimaux or koraks he had borne their dangers and their poverty their miseries and their famine for sake of seeing what they sawthe pathless oceans of the ice realm the trailing pines alone in a white snowworld the red moon fantastic and horrible in a sky of steel the horned clouds of reindeer rushing through the endless night the arch of the aurora spanning the heavens with their fire he had passed many seasons of his boyhood in the silence the solitude the eternal desolation of the mute mystery of the arctic world which for no man has either sympathy or story and in a way he had loved it and was often weary for it in a way its spirit remained with him always and its inexorable coldness its pitiless indifference to mens wants and weakness its loneliness and its purity and its scorn were in all the works of his hand blended in a strange union with the cruelty and the voluptuousness and the gorgeousness of color that gave to everything he touched the gleed and the temper of the case thus what he did pleased none being for one half the world too chill and being for the other half too sensual the world had never believed in him and he found himself in the height and the maturity of his powers condemned to an absolute obscurity not one man in a million knew his name during these years he had devoted himself to the study of art with an undeviating subservience to all its tyrannies he had studied humanity in all its phases he had studied form with all the rigid care that it requires he had studied color in almost every land that lies beneath the sun he had studied the passions in all their deformities as well as in all their beauties he had spared neither himself nor others in pursuit of knowledge he had tried most vices he had seen all miseries he had spared himself no spectacle however loathsome he had turned back from no license however undesired that could give him insight into or empire over human raptures and affliction neither did he spare himself any labor however costly however exhausting to enrich his brain with that varied learning that multifarious scene which he held needful to every artist who dared to desire greatness the hireling beauty of the wanton the splendor of the sun and sea the charnel lore of anatomy the secrets of dead tongues and buried nations the horrors of the lazar wards and pesthouses the glories of golden deserts and purple vineyards the flush of love on a young girls cheek the rottenness of corruption on a dead mans limbs the hellish tint of a brothel the divine calm of an eastern night all things alike he studied without abhorrence as without delight indifferent to all save for one endknowledge and art so entirely and undividedly did this possess him that it seemed to have left him without other passions even as the surgeon dissects the fair lifeless body of some womans corpse regardless of loveliness or sex only intent on the secret of disease the mystery of formation which he seeks therein so did he study the physical beauty of women and their mortal corruption without other memories than those of art he would see the veil fall from off the limbs of a creature lovely as a goddess and would think only to himselfhow shall i render this so that on my canvas it shall live once more one night in the hot close streets of damascus a man was stabbeda young maronitewho lay dying in the roadway without sign or sound whilst his assassins fled the silver syrian moon shining full on his white and scarlet robe his calm upturned face his lean hand knotted on the dagger he had been spared no time to use a famished street dog smelling at his blood arslan passing through the city saw and paused beside him stood still and motionless looking down on the outstretched figure then drew his tablets out and sketched the serene rigid face the flowing bloodsoaked robes the hungry animal mouthing at the wound another painter his familiar friend following on his steps joined him a little later and started from his side in horror my god what do you do there he cried do you not seethe man is dying arslan looked upi had not thought of that he answered it was thus always with him he was not cruel for the sake of cruelty to animals he was humane to women gentle to men serene but his art was before all things with him and with humanity he had little sympathy and if he had passions they had wakened no more than as the drowsy tiger wakes in the hot hush of noon half indifferent half lustful to strike fiercely what comes before her and then having slain couches herself and sleeps again but for this absolute surrender of his life his art had as yet recompensed him nothing men did not believe in him what he wrought saddened and terrified them they turned aside to those who fed them on simpler and on sweeter food his works were great but they were such as the public mind deems impious they unveiled human corruption too nakedly and they shadowed forth visions too exalted and satires too unsparing for them to be acceptable to the multitude they were compounded of an idealism clear and cold as crystal and of a reality cruel and voluptuous as love they were penetrated with an acrid satire and an intense despair the world which only cares for a honeyed falsehood and a gilded gloss in every art would have none of them so for these twelve long years his labor had been waste his efforts been fruitless those years had been costly to him in pursetravel study gold flung to fallen women sums spent on faithless friends utter indifference to whosoever robbed him so long as he was left in peace to pursue lofty aims and high endeavors all these did their common work on wealth which was scanty in the press of the world though it had appeared inexhaustible on the shores of the north sea his labors also were costly and they brought him no return the indifference to fortune of a man of genius is to a man of the world the stupor of idiocy from such a stupor he was shaken one day to find himself face to face with beggary his works were seen by few and these few were antagonistic to them all ways to fame were closed to him either by the envy of other painters or by the apathies and the antipathies of the nations themselves in all lands he was repulsed he roused the jealousy of his compeers and the terror of the multitudes they hurled against him the old wornout cry that the office of art was to give pleasure not pain and when his money was gone so that he could no longer at his own cost expose his works to the public gaze they and he were alike obliterated from the public marts they had always denied him fame and they now thrust him quickly into oblivion and abandoned him to it without remorse and even with contentment he could indeed with the facile power of eye and touch that he possessed have easily purchased a temporary ease an evanescent repute if he had given the world from his pencil those themes for which it cared and descended to the common spheres of common art but he refused utterly to do this the best and greatest thing in him was his honesty to the genius wherewith he was gifted he refused to prostitute it he refused to do other than to tell the truth as he saw it this man blasphemes this man is immoral his enemies had always hooted against him it is what the world always says of those who utter unwelcome truths in its unwilling ears so the words of the old scald by his own northern seashores came to pass and at length for the sake of art it came to this that he perished for want of bread for seven days he had been without food except the winter berries which he broke off the trees without and such handfuls of wheat as fell through the disjointed timbers of the ceiling for whose possession he disputed with the rats the sheer absolute poverty which leaves the man whom it has seized without so much as even a crust wherewith to break his fast is commoner than the world in general ever dreams for he was now so poor that for many months he had been unable to buy fresh canvas on which to work and had been driven to chalk the outlines of the innumerable fancies that pursued him upon the bare smooth gray stone walls of the old granary in which he dwelt he let his life go silently away without complaint and without effort because effort had been so long unavailing that he had discarded it in a contemptuous despair he accepted his fate seeing nothing strange in it and nothing pitiable since many men better than he had borne the like he could not have altered it without beggary or theft and he thought either of these worse than itself there were hecatombs of grain bursting their sacks in the lofts above but when once on each eighth day the maltster owning them sent his men to fetch some from the store arslan let the boat be moored against the wall be filled with barley and be pushed away again down the current without saying once to the rowers wait i starve and yet though like a miser amidst his gold his body starved amidst the noble shapes and the great thoughts that his brain conceived and his hand called into substance he never once dreamed of abandoning for any other the career to which he had dedicated himself from the earliest days that his boyish eyes had watched the vast arc of the arctic lights glow above the winter seas art was to him as mother brethren mistress offspring religionall that other men hold dear he had none of these he desired none of them and his genius sufficed to him in their stead it was an intense and reckless egotism made alike cruel and sublime by its intensity and purity like the egotism of a mother in her child to it as the mother to her child he would have sacrificed every living creature but to it also like her he would have sacrificed his very existence as unhesitatingly but it was an egotism which though merciless in its tyranny was as pure as snow in its impersonality it was untainted by any grain of avarice of vanity of selfish desire it was independent of all sympathy it was simply and intensely the passion for immortalitythat sublime selfishness that superb madness of all great minds art had taken him for its own as demeter in the days of her desolation took the child demophoon to nurture him as her own on the food of gods and to plunge him through the flames of a fire that would give him immortal life as the pusillanimous and sordid fears of the mortal mother lost to the child for evermore the possession of olympian joys and of perpetual youth so did the craven and earthly cares of bodily needs hold the artist back from the radiance of the life of the soul and drag him from the purifying fires yet he had not been utterly discouraged he strove against the metaniera of circumstance he did his best to struggle free from the mortal bonds that bound him and as the child demophoon mourned for the great goddess that had nurtured him refusing to be comforted so did he turn from the base consolations of the senses and the appetites and beheld ever before his sight the ineffable majesty of that mater dolorosa who once had anointed him as her own even now as the strength returned to his limbs and the warmth to his veins the old passion the old worship returned to him the momentary weakness which had assailed him passed away he shook himself with a bitter impatient scorn for the feebleness into which he had been betrayed and glanced around him still with a dull wonder as to the strange chances which the night past had brought he was incredulous still he thought that his fancy heated by long fasting might have cheated him that he must have dreamed and that the food and fuel which he saw must surely have been his own yet reflection told him that this could not be he remembered that for several weeks his last coin had been spent that he had been glad to gather the birds winter berries to crush beneath his teeth and gather the dropped corn from the floor to quiet the calm of hunger that for many a day there had been no fire on the hearth and that only a frame which the long sunless northern winters had braced in early youth had enabled him to resist and endure the cold therefore it must be charity charity as the hateful truth came home to him he met the eyes of the white slender winged hermes eyes that from out that colorless and smiling face seemed to mock him with a cruel contempt his was the old old storythe rod of wealth bartered for the empty shell that gave forth music hermes seemed to know it and to jeer him hermes the mischiefmonger and the trickster of men the inventive god who spent his days in chicanery of his brethren and his nights in the mockery of mortals the messenger of heaven who gave pandora to mankind hermes the eternal type of unscrupulous success seemed to have voice and cry to himoh fool fool fool who listens for the music of the spheres and disdains the only melody that men have ears to hearthe melody of gold arslan turned from the great cartoon of the gods in pherae and went out into the daylight and stripped and plunged into the cold and turbulent stream its chillness and the combat of its current braced his nerves and cleared his brain when he was clad he left the graintower with the white forms of its gods upon its walls and walked slowly down the bank of the river since life had been forced back upon him he knew that it was incumbent upon his manhood to support it by the toil of his hands if men would not accept the labor of his brain before he had been too absorbed in his pursuit too devoted to it body and soul to seek to sustain existence by the sheer manual exertion which was the only thing that he had left untried for selfmaintenance in a manner too he was too proud not too proud to labor but too proud to easily endure to lay bare his needs to the knowledge of others but now human charity must have saved him a charity which he hated as the foulest insult of his life and he had no chance save to accept it like a beggar bereft of all shame or to seek such work as would give him his daily bread so he went feebly for he was still weak from the length of his famine the country was well known to him but the people not at all he had come by hazard on the old ruin where he dwelt and had stayed there full a year these serene blue skies these pale mists these cornclad slopes these fields of plenteous abundance these quiet homesteads these fruitharvests of this norman plain were in soothing contrast to all that his life had known these old quaint cities these little villages that seemed always hushed with the sound of bells these quiet streams on which the calm sunlight slept so peacefully these green and golden lands of plenty that stretched away to the dim gray distant seaall these had had a certain charm for him he had abided with them partly because amidst them it seemed possible to live on a handful of wheat and a draught of water unnoticed and unpitied partly because having come hither on foot through many lands and by long hardship he had paused here weary and incapable of further effort whilst the little gold he had had on him had lasted he had painted innumerable transcripts of its ancient buildings and of its summer and autumnal landscapes and of latethrough the bitter winterof late it had seemed to him that it was as well to die here as elsewhere when a man knows that his dead limbs will be huddled into the common ditch of the poor the nameless and the unclaimed and that his dead brain will only serve for soil to feed some little rank wayside poisonous weed it will seldom seem of much moment in what earth the ditch be dug by what feet the sward be trod he went now on his way seeking work he did not care what he asked for any that might serve to use such strength as hunger had left in him and to give him his daily bread but this is a great thing to demand in this world and so he found it they repulsed him everywhere they had their own people in plenty they had their sturdy tough weatherbeaten women who labored all day in rain or snow or storm for a pittance and they had these in larger numbers than their fieldwork needed they looked at him askance this man with the eyes of arctic blue and the grave gestures of a king who only asked to labor as the lowest among them he was a stranger to them he did not speak their tongue with their accent he looked with that white beauty and that lofty stature as though he could crush them in the hollow of his hand they would have none of him he brings misfortune they said among themselves and they would have none of him he had an evil name with them they said at eventide by their woodfires that strange things had been seen since he had come to the granary by the river once he had painted a study of the wondrous child zagreus gazing in the fatal mirror from the pretty face of a stonecutters little fair son the child was laughing happy healthful at noon crowned with carnations and riverlilies and by sunset he was deaddead like the flowers that were still among his curls once a girl had hired herself as model to him for an egyptian wanton half a singer and half a gypsyhandsome lithe fantastic voluptuous the very night she left the granary she was drowned in crossing a wooden bridge of the river which gave way under the heavy tramp of a fantoccini player who accompanied her once he had sketched for the corner of an oriental study a rareplumaged bird of the south which was the idol of a watercarrier of the district and the wonder of all the children round and from that date the bird had sickened and drooped and lost its colors and pined until it died the boys death had been from a sudden seizure of one of the many ills of infancy the dancinggirls had come from a common accident due to the rottenness of old worn watersoaked timber the mockingbirds had arisen from the cruelty of captivity and the chills of northern winds all had been the result of simple accident and of natural circumstance but they had sufficed to fill with horror the minds of a peasantry always bigoted and strongly prejudiced against every stranger and it became to them a matter of implicit credence that whatsoever living thing should be painted by the artist arslan would assuredly never survive to see the rising of the morrows sun in consequence for leagues around they shunned him not man nor woman nor child would sit to him as models and now when he sought the wage of a daily labor among them he was everywhere repulsed he had long repulsed human sympathy and in its turn it repulsed him at last he turned and retraced his steps baffled and wearied his early habits had made him familiar with all manner of agricultural toil he would have done the task of the sower the herdsman the hewer of wood or the charcoalburner but they would none of them believe this of one with his glance and his aspect and solicitation was new to his lips and bitter there as gall he took his way back along the line of the river the beauty of the dawn had gone the day was only now chilly heavy with a rank moisture from the steaming soil broken boughs and uprooted bushes were floating on the turgid water and over all the land there hung a sullen fog the pressure of the air the humidity the colorless stillness that reigned throughout weighed on lungs which for a score of years had only breathed the pure strong rarefied air of the north he longed with a sudden passion to be once more amidst his native mountains under the clear steellike skies and beside the rush of the vast wild seas were it only to die as he looked on them it were better to die there than here he longed as men in deserts thirst for drink for one breath of the strong salt air of the north one sight of the bright keen seaborn sun as it leapt at dawn from the waters the crisp cold nights the heavens which shone as steel the forests filled with the cry of the wolves the mountains which the ocean ceaselessly assailed the mighty waves which marched erect like armies the bitter arctic wind which like a saber cleft the darkness all these came back to him beloved and beautiful in all their cruelty desired by him with a sick longing for their freshness for their fierceness for their freedom as he dragged his tired limbs through the grasses and looked out upon the sullen stream that flowed beside him an oar struck the water a flat black boat drifted beneath the bank a wild swan disturbed rose with a hiss from the sedges the boat was laden with grain there was only one rower in it who steered by a string wound round her foot she did not lift her face as she went by him but her bent brow and her bosom grew red and she cut the water with a swifter sharper stroke her features were turned from him by that movement of her head but he saw the eastern outline of the cheek and chin the embrowned velvet of the skin the halfbare beauty of the heaving chest and supple spine bent back in the action of the oars the long slender arched shape of the naked foot round which the cord was twined their contour and their color struck him with a sudden surprise he had seen such oftentimes eastwards on the banks of golden rivers treading with such feet as these the sands that were the dust of countless nations bearing on such shoulders as these earthen watervases that might have served the feasts of pharaohs showing such limbs as these against the curled palm branches and the deep blue sky upon the deserts edge but herea face of asia among the cornlands of northern france it seemed to him strange he looked after her with wonder the boat went on down the stream without any pause the sculls cleaving the heavy tide with regular and resolute monotony the amber piles of the grain and the brown form of the bending figure soon hidden in the clouds of rivermist he watched her only seeing a beggargirl rowing a skiff full of corn down a sluggish stream there was nothing to tell him that he was looking upon the savior of his body from the thralls of death if there had beenin his mood thenhe would have cursed her the boat glided into the fog which closed behind it a flock of waterbirds swam out from the rushes and darted at some floating kernels of wheat that had fallen over the vessels side they fought and hissed and flapped and pecked among themselves over the chance plunder a large rat stole amidst them unnoticed by them in their exultation and seized their leader and bore him struggling and beating the air with bloodstained wings away to a hole in the bank a mongrel dog prowling on the shore hearing the wild ducks cries splashed into the sedges and swam out and gripped the rat by the neck in bold sharp fangs and bore both rat and bird bleeding and dying to the land the owner of the mongrel a peasant making ready the soil for colza in the lowlying fields snatched the duck from the dog to bear it home for his own eating and kicked his poor beast in the ribs for having ventured to stray without leave and to do him service without permission the dulcet harmony of the worlds benignant law thought arslan as he turned aside to enter the stone archway of his own desolate dwelling to live one must slaughterwhat life can i take at that moment the setting sun pierced the heavy veil of the vapor and glowed through the fog the boat now distant glided for a moment into the ruddy haze and was visible the water around it like a lake of flame the white steam above it like the smoke of a sacrifice fire then the sun sank the mists gathered closely once more all light faded and the day was dead he felt stifled and sick at heart as he returned along the reedy shore towards his dreary home he wondered dully why his life would not end since the world would have none of him neither the work of his brain nor the work of his hands it seemed that he had no place in it he was half resolved to lie down in the water there among the reeds and let it flow over his face and breast and kiss him softly and coldly into the sleep of death he had desired this many times what held him back from its indulgence was not the child within us that fears death of which plato speaks he had no such misgiving in him and he believed death to be a simple rupture and end of all things such as any man had right to seek and summon for himself it was rather that the passion of his art was too strong in him that the power to create was too intense in him so that he could not willingly consign the forces and the fantasies of his brain to that assimilation to which he would without thought or pause have flung his body as he entered the haunted hall which served him as his paintingroom he saw a fresh fire of logs upon the hearth whose leaping flames lighted the place with cheerful color and he saw on the stone bench fresh food sufficient to last several days and a brass flagon filled with wine a curious emotion took possession of him as he looked it was less surprise at the fact for his senses told him that it was the work of some charity which chose to hide itself than it was wonder as to who in this strange land where none would even let him earn his daily bread knew enough or cared enough to supply his necessities thus and with this there arose the same intolerant bitterness of the degradation of alms the same ungrateful hatred of the succor that seemed to class him among beggars which had moved him when he had awakened with the dawn he felt neither tenderness nor gratitude he was only conscious of humiliation there were in him a certain coldness strength and indifference to sympathy which whilst they made his greatness as an artist made his callousness as a man it might have been sweet to others to find themselves thus remembered and pitied by another at an hour when their forces were spent their fate friendless and their hopes all dead but it was not so to him he only felt like the desert animal which wounded repulses every healing hand and only seeks to die alone there was only one vulnerable one tender nerve in him and this was the instinct of his genius he had been nurtured in hardihood and had drawn in endurance with every breath of his native air he would have borne physical ills without one visible pang and would have been indifferent to all mortal suffering but for the powers in him for the art he adored he had a childs weakness a womans softness he could not bear to die without leaving behind his life some work the world would cherish call it folly call it madness it is both the ivory zeus that was to give its sculptor immortality lives but in tradition the bronze athene that was to guard the piraeus in eternal liberty has long been leveled with the dust yet with every age the artist still gives life for fame still cries let my body perish but make my work immortal it was this in him now which stirred his heart with a new and gentler emotion emotion which while half disgust was also half gladness this food was almsgiven since he had not earned it and yetby means of this sheer bodily subsistenceit would be possible for him to keep alive those dreams that strength by which he still believed it in him to compel his fame from men he stood before the phoebus in pherae thinking it stung him with a bitter torment it humiliated him with a hateful burdenthis debt which came he knew not whence and which he never might be able to repay and yet his heart was strangely moved it seemed to him that the fate which thus wantonly and with such curious persistence placed life back into his hands must needs be one that would bear no common fruit he opposed himself no more to it he bent his head and broke bread and ate and drank of the red winehe did not thank god or man as he broke his fast he only looked in the mocking eyes of hermes and said in his heart since i must live i will triumph and hermes smiled hermes the wise who had bought and sold the generations of men so long ago in the golden age and who knew so well how they would barter away their greatness and their gladness their bodies and their souls for one sweet strain of his hollow reed pipe for one sweet glance of his soulless pandoras eyes hermeshermes the liar hermes the wiseknew how mens oaths were kept chapter ii at the close of that day claudis flamma discovered that he had been robbedrobbed more than once he swore and raved and tore his hair for loss of a little bread and meat and oil and a flagon of red wine he did not suspect his granddaughter accusing her perpetually of sins of which she was innocent he did not once associate her in thought with the one offense which she had committed he thought that the window of his storehouse had been forced from the exterior he made no doubt that his spoiler was some vagabond from one of the river barges through such tramps his henhouse and his applelofts had often previously been invaded she heard his lamentations and imprecations in unbroken silence he did not question her and without a lie she was able to keep her secret in her own sight she had done a foul thinga thing that her own hunger had never induced her to do she did not seek to reconcile herself to her action by any reflection that she had only taken what she had really earned a thousand times over by her service her mind was not sufficiently instructed and was of too truthful a mould to be capable of the deft plea of a sophistry she could dare the thing and do it and hold her peace about it though she should be scourged to speak but she could not tamper with it to excuse it to herself for this she had neither the cunning nor the cowardice why had she done itdone for a stranger what no pressure of need had made her do for her own wants she did not ask herself she followed her instinct he allured her with his calm and kingly beauty which was like nothing else her eyes had ever seen and she was drawn by an irresistible attraction to this life which she had bought at the price of her own from the gods yet stronger even than this sudden human passion which had entered into her was the dread lest he whom she had ransomed from his death should he know his debt to her under such a dread she never opened her lips to any one on this thing which she had done silence was natural to her she spoke so rarely that many in the province believed her to be dumb no sympathy had ever been shown to her to woo her to disclose either the passions that burned latent in her veins or the tenderness that trembled stifled in her heart thrice again did she take food and fuel to the watertower undetected both by the man whom she robbed and the man whom she succored thrice again did she find her way to the desolate chamber in its owners absence and refill the empty platters and warm afresh the cold blank hearth thrice again did claudis flamma note the diminution of his stores and burnish afresh his old rusty fowlingpiece and watch half the night on his dark staircase and prepare with his own hands a jar of poisoned honey and a bag of poisoned wheat which he placed with a cruel chuckle of grim glee to tempt the eyes of his spoilers but the spoiler being of his own household saw this trap set and was aware of it in a week or two the need for these acts which she hated ceased she learned that the stranger for whom she thus risked her body and soul had found a boatmans work upon the water which although a toil rough and rude and but poorly paid still sufficed to give him bread though she herself was so pressed with hunger many a time that as she went through the meadows and hedgerows she was glad to crush in her teeth the tender shoots of the briers and the acrid berry of the brambles she never again unbidden touched so much as a mouldy crust thrown out to be eaten by the poultry flamma counting his possessions greedily night and morning blessed the saints for the renewed safety of his dwelling and cast forth the poisoned wheat as a thankoffering to the male birds who were forever flying to and fro their nested mates in the leafless boughs above the earliest violets and whose little throats were strangled even in their glad flood of nuptial song and whose soft bright eyes grew dull in death ere even they had looked upon the springtide sun for it was thus ever that follefarine saw men praise god she took their death to her own door sorrowing and full of remorse had i never stolen the food these birds might never have perished she thought as she saw the rosy throats of the robins and bullfinches turned upward in death on the turf she blamed herself bitterly with an aching heart the fatality which makes human crime recoil on the innocent creatures of the animal world oppressed her with its heavy and hideous injustice their god was good they said yet for her sin and her grandsires greed the harmless songbirds died by the score in torment how shall a god be good who is not just she thought in this mute young lonely soul of hers nature had sown a strong passion for justice a strong instinct towards what was righteous as the germ of a plant born in darkness underground will by sheer instinct uncurl its colorless tendrils and thrust them through crevices and dust and the close structure of mortared stones until they reach the light and grow green and strong in it so did her nature strive of its own accord through the gloom enveloping it towards those moral laws which in all ages and all lands remain the same no matter what deity be worshiped or what creed be called the truth her nascent mind was darkened oppressed bewildered perplexed even like the plant which forcing itself upward from its cellar opens its leaves not in pure air and under a blue sky but in the reek and smoke and fetid odors of a city yet like the plant she vaguely felt that light was somewhere and as vaguely sought it with most days she took her grandsires boat to and fro the town fetching or carrying there was no mode of transit so cheap to him as this whose only cost was her fatigue with each passage up and down the river she passed by the dwelling of arslan sometimes she saw him once or twice in the twilight he spoke to her she only bent her head to hide her face from him and rowed more quickly on her homeward way in silence at other times in his absence and when she was safe from any detection she entered the dismal solitudes wherein he labored and gazed in rapt and awed amazement at the shapes that were shadowed forth upon the walls the service by which he gained his daily bread was on the waters and took him often leagues awaysimple hardy toil among fishers and canalcarriers and bargemen but it left him some few days and all his nights free for art and never in all the years of his leisure had his fancy conceived and his hand created more exquisite dreams and more splendid fantasies than now in this bitter and cheerless time when he labored amidst the poorest for the bare bread of life des belles choses peuvent se faire dans une cave and in truth the gloom of the cellar gives birth to an art more sublime than the light of the palace can ever beget suffering shortens the years of the artist and kills him oftentimes ere his prime be reached but in suffering alone are all great works conceived the senses the passions the luxuries the lusts of the flesh the deliriums of the desires the colors the melodies the fragrance the indolencesall that make the mere living of life delightful all go to enrich and to deepen the human genius which steeps itself in them but it is in exile from these that alone it can rise to its greatest the grass of the holy river gathers perfume from the marvelous suns and the moonless nights and the gorgeous bloom of the east from the aromatic breath of the leopard and the perfume of the fallen pomegranate from the sacred oil that floats in the lamps and the caress of the girlbathers feet and the myrrhdropping unguents that glide from the maidens bare limbs in the moonlightthe grass holds and feeds on them all but not till the grass has been torn from the roots and been crushed and been bruised and destroyed can the full odors exhale of all it has tasted and treasured even thus the imagination of man may be great but it can never be at its greatest until one serpent with merciless fangs has bitten it through and through and impregnated it with passion and with poisonthat one deathless serpent which is memory arslan had never been more ceaselessly pursued by innumerable fantasies and never had given to these a more terrible force a more perfect utterance than now when the despair which possessed him was absolutewhen it seemed to him that he had striven in his last strife with fate and been thrown never to rise againwhen he kept his body alive by such soulless ceaseless labor as that of the oxen in the fieldswhen he saw every hour drift by barren sullen painfulwhen only some dull yet stanch instinct of virility held him back from taking his own life in the bleak horror of these fruitless dayswhen it seemed to him that his oath before hermes to make men call him famous was idle as the sigh of a desert wind through the hollow ears of a skull bleaching white on the sand yet he had never done greater thingsnever in the long years through which he had pursued and studied art with the poor wage that he earned by labor he bought by degrees the tools and pigments lacking to him and lived on the scantiest and simplest food that he might have wherewith to render into shape and color the imaginations of his brain and it was on these that the passionate wondering halfblinded eyes of follefarine looked with awe and adoration in those lonely hours when she stole in his absence into his chamber and touching nothing scarcely daring to breathe aloud crouched on the bare pavement mute and motionless and afraid with a fear that was the sweetest happiness her brief youth had ever known though her own kind had neglected and proscribed her with one accord there had been enough in the little world surrounding her to feed the imaginative senses latent in herenough of the old mediaeval fancy of the old ecclesiastical beauty of the old monastic spirit to give her a consciousness though a dumb one of the existence of art untaught though she was and harnessed to the dreary millwheel round of a hard physical toil she yet had felt dimly the charm of the place in which she dwelt where the fretted pinnacles rose in hundreds against the skywhere the common dwellings of the poor were paneled and parquetted and carved in a thousand fashionswhere the graceful and the grotesque and the terrible were mingled in an inextricable and yet exquisite confusionwhere the gray squat jug that went to the well and the jutting beam to which the clothes line was fastened and the creaking sign that swung above the smallest wineshop and the wooden gallery on which the poorest troll hung out her manycolored rags had all some trace of a dead art some fashioning by a dead handwhere all these were it was not possible for any creature dowered by nature with any poetic instinct to remain utterly unmoved and unawakened in their midst of the science and the execution of art she was still absolutely ignorant the powers by which it was created still seemed a magic incomprehensible and not human but its meaning she felt with that intensity which is the truest homage of all homage to its influence day after day therefore she returned and gazed on the three gods of forgetfulness and on all the innumerable forms and fables which bore them company the virgin field of her unfilled mind receiving the seeds of thought and of fancy that were scattered so largely in this solitude lying waste bearing no harvest of these visits arslan himself knew nothing towards him her bold wild temper was softened to the shyness of a doe she dreaded lest he should ever learn what she had done and she stole in and out of the old granary unseen by all with the swiftness and the stealthiness which she shared in common with other untamed animals which like her shunned all man and womankind and this secretin itself so innocent yet for which she would at times blush in her loneliness with a cruel heat that burnt all over her face and framechanged her life transfigured it from its objectless passionless brutish dullness and monotony into dreams and into desires for the first time she had in her joy and fear for the first time she became human all the week through he wrought perforce by night the great windows stood wide open to the bright cold moon of early spring he worked only with black and white using color only at sunrise or on the rare days of his leisure often at nightfall she left her loft as secretly as a fox its lair and stole down the river and screened herself among the grasses and watched him where he labored in the mingling light of the moon and of the oillamp burning behind him she saw these things grow from beneath his hand these mighty shapes created by him and he seemed to her like a god with the power to beget worlds at his will and all human life in its full stature out from a little dust the contrast of this royal strength of this supreme power which he wielded with the helpless exhaustion of the body in which she had found him dying smote her with a sorrow and a sweetness that were like nothing she had ever owned that a man could summon hosts at his command like this yet perish for a crustthat fusion of omnipotence and powerlessness which is the saddest and the strangest of all the sad strange things of genius awoke an absorbing emotion in her she watched him thus for hours in the long nights of a slowfooted spring in whose mists and chills and heavy dews her inured frame took no more harm than did the green corn shooting through the furrows she was a witness to his solitude she saw the fancies of his brain take form she saw the sweep of his arm call up on the blank of the wall or on the pale spaces of the canvas these images which for her had alike such majesty and such mystery she saw the faces beam the eyes smile the dancingwomen rise the foliage uncurl the gods come forth from the temples the nereids glide through the moonlit waters at his command and beneath his touch she saw him also in those moments when conceiving no eyes to be upon him the man whom mankind denied loosened rein to the bitterness in him and standing weary and heartsick before these creations for which his generation had no sight and no homage let the agony of constant failure of continual defeat overcome him and cursed aloud the madness which possessed him and drove him on forever in this ungrateful service and would not let him do as other men didtell the world lies and take its payment out in gold until now she had hated all things grieved for none unless indeed it were for a galled ox toiling wounded and tortured on the field or a trapped bird shrieking in the still midnight woods but now watching him hearing him a passionate sorrow for a human sorrow possessed her and to her eyes he was so beautiful in that utter unlikeness to herself and to all men whom she had seen she gazed at him never weary of that cold fair golden beauty like the beauty of his sungod of those serene deeplidded eyes which looked so often past her at the dark night skies of those lithe and massive limbs like the limbs of the gladiator that yonder on the wall strained a lion to his breast in the deadly embrace of combat she gazed at him until she loved him with the intense passion of a young and ignorant life into whose gloom no love had ever entered with this love the instinct of her womanhood arose amid the ignorance and savagery of her nature and she crouched perpetually under the screen of the long grass to hide her vigil and whenever his eyes looked from his easel outward to the night she drew back breathless and trembling she knew not why into the deepest shadow meantime with that rude justice which was in her she set herself atonement for her faultthe fault through which those tender little brightthroated birds were stretched dead among the first violets of the year she labored harder and longer than ever for her taskmaster and denied herself the larger half of even those scanty portions which were set aside for her of the daily fare living on almost nothing as those learn to do who are reared under the roof of the french poor to his revilings she was silent and under his blows patient by night she toiled secretly until she had restored the value of that which she had taken why did she do it she could not have told she was proud of the evil origin they gave her she had a cynical gladness in her infamous repute she scorned women and hated men yet all the same she kept her hands pure of thefts and her lips pure of lies so the weeks ran on till the hardness of winter gave way to the breath of the spring and in all the wood and orchard around the watermill the boughs were green with buds and the ground was pale with primrosesa spring all the sweeter and more fertile because of the severity of the past winter it became midapril and it was marketday for ypres and for all the other villages and homesteads lying round that wondrous cathedralspire that shot into the air farreaching and ethereal like some vast fountain whose column of water had been arrested and changed to ice the old quiet town was busy with a rich sunshine shed upon it in which the first yellow butterflies of the year had begun to dance it was high noon and the highest tide of the market flowergirls fruitgirls eggsellers poultryhucksters crowds of women old and young had jolted in on their docile asses throned on their sheepskin saddles and now chattering and chaffering drove fast their trade on the steps of the cathedral boys with birdsnests knifegrinders making their little wheels fly cobblers hammering with boards across their knees traveling peddlers with knapsacks full of toys and mirrors and holy images and strings of beads sat all together in competition but in amity here and there a priest passed with his black robe and broad hat like a dusky mushroom among a bed of varihued gillyflowers here and there a soldier all color and glitter showed like a gaudy red tulip in bloom amidst tufts of thyme the old wrinkled leathern awnings of the marketstalls glowed like copper in the brightness of the noon the red tiles of the houses edging the great square were gilded with yellow houseleeks the little children ran hither and thither with big bunches of primroses or sheaves of blue woodhyacinths singing the red and blue serges of the young girls bodices were like the gay hues of the anemones in their baskets and the brown faces of the old dames under the white roofing of their headgear were like the russet faces of the homekept apples they had garnered through all the winter everywhere in the shade of the flapping leather and the darkness of the wooden porches there were the tender blossoms of the field and forest of the hedge and garden the azure of the hyacinths the pale saffron of the primroses the cool hues of the meadow daffodils the ruby eyes of the cultured jonquils gleamed among wet ferns gray herbs and freshly budded leafage plovers eggs nestled in mosslined baskets sheaves of velvetcoated wallflowers poured fragrance on the air great plumes of lilac nodded on the wind and amber feathers of laburnum waved above the homelier masses of mint and marjoram and sage and saxafrage it was high noon but the women still found leisuretime to hear the music of their own tongues loud and continuous as the clacking of mill paddles in one corner an excited little group was gathered round the stall of a favorite flowerseller who wore a bright crimson gown and a string of large silver beads about her neck and a wide linen cap that shaded her pretty rosy face as a great snowy mushroom may grow between the sun and a little ruddy wild strawberry her brown eyes were now brimming over with tears where she stood surrounded by all the treasures of spring she held clasped in her arms a great pot with a young almondtree growing in it and she was weeping as though her heart would break because a tile had fallen from a roof above and crushed low all its pink splendor of blossom i saw her look at it she muttered look at it as she passed with her wicked eyes and a black cat on the roof mewed to her and that moment the tile fell oh my almondtree oh my little darling the only one i saved out of three through the frosts the very one that was to have gone this very night to paris thou art not alone edmee groaned an old woman tottering from her eggstall with a heap of ruffled bloodstained brown plumage held up in her hand look as she went by my poor brown henthe best sitter i have good for eggs with every sunrise from lent to noeljust cackled and shook her tail at her and at that very instant a huge yellow dog rushed in and killed the blessed birdkilled her in her basket a great yellow beast that no one had ever seen before and that vanished again into the earth like lightning not worse than she did to my precious remy said a tanners wife who drew after her clinging to her skirts a little lame misshapen querulous child she hath the evil eye said sternly an old man who had served in the days of his boyhood in the army of italy as he sat washing fresh lettuces in a large brass bowl by his grandsons herbstall you remember how we met her in the fields last feastnight of the three kings asked a youth looking up from plucking the feathers out from a living struggling moaning goose coming singing through the fog like nothing earthly and a moment later a torch caught little jocelins curls and burnt him till he was so hideous that his mother could scarce have known him you remember surely we remember they cried in a hearty chorus round the broken almondtree was there not the good old dax this very winter killed by her if ever any creature were killed by foul means though the law would never listen to the flandrins when they said so and little bernardou added one who had not hitherto spoken little bernardou died a month after his grandam in hospital she had cast her eye on him and the poor little lad never rallied a jettatrice ever brings misfortune muttered the old soldier of napoleon washing his last lettuce and lighting a fresh pipe or does worse muttered the mother of the crippled child she is not for nothing the devils daughter mark you nay indeed said an old woman knitting from a ball of wool with which a kitten played among the strewn cabbageleaves and the crushed sweetsmelling thyme nay was it not only this very winter that my sons little youngest boy threw a stone at her just for luck as she went by in her boat through the town and it struck her and drew blood from her shoulder and that selfsame night a piece of the oaken carvings in the ceiling gave way and dropped upon the little angel as he slept and broke his arm above the elbowshe is a witch there is no question but she is a witch if i were sure so i would think it well to kill her murmured the youth as he stifled the struggling bird between his knees my sister met her going through the standing corn last harvesttime and the child she brought forth a week after was born blind and is blind now said a hardvisaged woman washing turnips in a basin of water i was blackandblue for a month when she threw me down and took from me that hawk i had trapped and went and fastened my wrist in the iron instead hissed a boy of twelve in a shrill piping treble as he slit the tongue of a quivering starling they say she dances naked by moonlight in the water with imps cried a bright little lad who was at play with the kitten she is a witch there is no doubt about that said again the old woman who sat knitting on the stone bench in the sun and her mother such a saint sighed another old dame who was grouping green herbs together for salads and all the while the girl edmee clasped her almondtree and sobbed over it if she were only here swore edmees lover under his breath at that moment the accused came towards them erect in the full light she had passed through the market with a load of herbs and flowers for one of the chief hostelries in the square and was returning with the flat broad basket balanced empty on her head something of their mutterings and curses reached her but she neither hastened nor slackened her pace she came on towards them with her free firm step and her lustrous eyes flashing hard against the sun she gave no sign that she had heard except that the blood darkened a little in her cheeks and her mouth curled with a haughtier scorn but the sight of her answering in that instant to their hate the sight of her with the sunshine on her scarlet sash and her slender limbs added impulse to their rage they had talked themselves into a passionate belief in her as a thing hellborn and unclean that brought all manner of evil fates among them they knew that holy water had never baptized her that neither cross nor chrism had ever exorcised her that a churchs door had never opened to her they had heard their children hoot her many a time unrebuked they had always hated her with the cruelty begotten by a timid cowardice or a selfish dread they were now ripe to let their hate take shape in speech and act the lover of edmee loosened his hand from the silver beads about her throat and caught up instead a stone let us see if her flesh feels he cried and cast it it fell short of her being ill aimed she did not slacken her speed nor turn out of her course she still came towards them erect and with an even tread who lamed my remy screamed the cripples mother who broke my grandsons arm cackled the old woman that sat knitting who withered my peachtree the old gardener hooted who freed the devilbird and put me on the trap yelled the boy with the starling who flung the tile on the almond shouted the flowergirls lover who made my sister bring forth a little beast blind as a mole shrieked the woman washing in the brazen bowl who is a witchwho dances nakedwho bathes with devils at the full moon cried the youth who had plucked the goose bare alive and he stooped for a pebble and aimed better than his comrade and flung it at her as she came it is a shame to see the child of reine flamma so dealt with murmured the old creature that was grouping her salads but her voice found no echo the old soldier even rebuked her a jettatrice should be killed for the good of the people he mumbled meanwhile she came nearer and nearer the last stone had struck her upon the arm but it had drawn no blood she walked on with firm slow steps into their midst unfaltering the courage did not touch them they thought it only the hardihood of a thing that was devilbegotten she is always mute like that she cannot feel strike strike strike cried the cripples mother and the little cripple himself clapped his small hands and screamed his shrill laughter the youths obedient and nothing loth rained stones on her as fast as their hands could fling them still she neither paused nor quailed but came on straightly steadily with her face set against the light their impatience and their eagerness made their aim uncertain the stones fell fast about her on every side but one alone struck hera jagged flint that fell where the white linen skirt opened on her chest it cut the skin and the blood started the children shrieked and danced with delight the youths rushed at her inflamed at once with her beauty and their own savage hate stone her to death stone her to death they shouted she only laughed and held her head erect and stood motionless where they arrested her without the blood once paling in her face or her eyes once losing their luminous calm scorn the little cripple clapped his hands climbing on his mothers back to see the sight and his mother screamed again and again above his laughter strike strike strike one of the lads seized her in his arms to force her on her knees while the others stoned her the touch of him roused all the fire slumbering in her blood she twisted herself round in his hold with a movement so rapid that it served to free her struck him full on the eyes with her clinched hand in a blow that sent him stunned and staggering back then swiftly as lightning flash drew her knife from her girdle and striking out with it right and left dashed through the people who scattered from her path as sheep from the spring of a hound slowly and with her face turned full upon them she backed her way across the marketplace the knife turned blade outward was pressed against her chest none of them dared to follow her they thought her invulnerable and possessed she moved calmly with a firm tread backwardbackwardbackward holding her foes at bay the scarlet sash on her loins flashing bright in the sun her level brows bent together as a tiger bends his ere he leaps they watched her huddling together frightened and silent even the rabid cries of the cripples mother had ceased on the edge of the great square she paused a moment the knife still held at her chest her mouth curled in contemptuous laughter strike now she cried to them and she dropped her weapon and stood still but there was not one among them who dared lift his hand there was not so much as a word that answered her she laughed aloud and waited for their attack while the bell in the tower above them tolled loudly the strokes of noon no one among them stirred even the shrill pipe of the lame boys rejoicing had sunk and was still at that moment through the golden haze of sunbeams and dust that hung above the crowd she saw the red gleam of the soldiers of the state and their heavy tramp echoed on the silence as they hastened to the scene of tumult she had no faith in any justice which these would deal her had they not once dragged her before the tribunal of their law because she had forced asunder the iron jaws of that trap in the oak wood to give freedom to the bleeding hawk that was struggling in it whilst its callow birds screamed in hunger in their nest in the branches above she had no faith in them nor in any justice of men and she turned and went down a twisting lane shaded from the sun and ran swiftly as a doe through all its turns and down the steps leading to the waterside there her boat was moored she entered it and pulled herself slowly down the river which now at noontide was almost deserted whilst the shutters of the houses that edged it on either side were all closed to keep out the sun a boatman stretched half asleep upon the sacks in his barge a horse dozing in his harness on the towingpath a homeless child who had no one to call him in to shelter from the heat and who sat and dappled his little burning feet in the flowing water these and their like were all there were here to look on her she rowed herself feebly with one oar gradually out of the ways of the town her left arm was strained and for the moment useless her shoulders throbbed with bruises and the wound from the stone still bled she stanched the blood by degrees and folded the linen over it and went on she was so used to pain and so strong that this seemed to her to be but little she had passed through similar scenes before though the people had rarely broken into such open violence towards her except on that winters day in the hut of manon dax the heat was great though the season was but midapril the sky was cloudless the air without a breeze the pink blossoms of peachtrees bloomed between the old brown walls of the wooden houses in the galleries between the heads of saints and the faces of fauns there were tufts of homebred lilies of the valley and thick flowering bushes of golden genista the smell of mignonette was sweet upon the languid breeze and here and there from out the darkness of some open casement some stoveforced crimson or purple azalea shrub glowed for the peoples merchandise was flowers and all the silent waterstreets were made lovely and fragrant by their fair abundance the tide of the river was flowing in the stream was swelling over all the black piles and the broad smooth strips of sand that were visible at low water it floated her boat inward with it without trouble past the last houses of the town past the budding orchards and gray stone walls of the outskirts past the meadows and the cornfields and the poplars of the open country a certain faintness had stolen on her with the gliding of the vessel and the dizzy movement of the water pain and the loss of blood filled her limbs with an unfamiliar weakness she felt giddy and half blind and almost powerless to guide her course when she had reached the old granary where it stood among the waterdocks and rushes she checked the boat almost unconsciously and let it drift in amidst the reeds and lie there and pulled herself feebly up through the shallow pools then she went across the stone sill of the casement into the chamber where she had learned to live a life that was utterly apart from the actual existence to which chance had doomed her it was the height of noon at such an hour the creator of these things that she loved was always absent at the toil which brought him his bread she knew that he never returned until the evening never painted except at earliest dawn the place was her own in the freedom of solitude all these shapes and shadows in which imagination and tradition had taken visible shape were free to her she had grown to love them with a great passion to seek them as consolers and as friends she crept into the room and its coolness its calm its dimmed refreshing light seemed like balm after the noise of the busy marketplace and the glare of the cloudless sunshine a sick sense of fatigue and of feebleness had assailed her more strongly she dropped down in the gloom of the place on the broad cold flags of the floor in the deepest shadow where the light from without did not reach and beneath the cartoon of the gods of oblivion of all the forms with which he had peopled its loneliness these had the most profound influence on her in their fair passionless majestic beauty in which it seemed to her that the man who had begotten them had repeated his own likeness for they were all alike yet unlike of the same form and feature yet different even in their strong resemblance like elder and younger brethren who hold a close companionship for hypnos was still but a boy with his blueveined eyelids closed and his mouth rosy and parted like that of a slumbering child and above his golden head a star rose in the purple night oneiros standing next was a youth whose eyes smiled as though they beheld visions that were welcome to him in his hand among the white roses he held a black wand of sorcery and around his bended head there hovered a dim silvery nimbus thanatos alone was a man fully grown and on his calm and colorless face there were blended an unutterable sadness and an unspeakable peace his eyes were fathomless farreaching heavy laden with thought as though they had seen at once the heights of heaven and the depths of hell and he having thus seen and knowing all things had learned that there was but one good possible in all the universethat one gift which his touch gave and which men in their blindness shuddered from and cursed and above him and around him there was a great darkness so the gods stood and so they spoke even to her they seemed to her as brethren masters friendsthese three immortals who looked down on her in their mute majesty they are the gods of the poor of the wretched of the proscribedthey are the gods who respect not persons nor palaceswho stay with the exile and flee from the kingwho leave the tyrant of a world to writhe in torment and call a smile beautiful as the morning on the face of a beggar childwho turn from the purple beds where wealth and lust and brutal power lie and fill with purest visions the darkest hours of the loneliest nights for genius and youththey are the gods of consolation and of compensationthe gods of the orphan of the outcast of the poet of the prophet of all whose bodies ache with the infinite pangs of famine and whose hearts ache with the infinite woes of the world of all who hunger with the body or with the soul and looking at them she seemed to know them as her only friendsas the only rulers who ever could loose the bands of her fate and let her forth to freedomsleep and dreams and death they were above her where she sank upon the stone floor the shadows were dark upon the ground but the sunrays striking through the distant window against the opposite wall fell across the golden head of the boy hypnos and played before his silver sandaled feet she sat gazing at him forgetful of her woe her task the populace that had hooted her abroad the stripes that awaited her at home the answering gaze of the gods magnetized her the poetic virus which had stirred dumbly in her from her birth awoke in her bewildered brain without knowing what she wanted she longed for freedom for light for passion for peace for love shadowy fancies passed over her in a tumultuous pageantry the higher instincts of her nature rose and struggled to burst the bonds in which slavery and ignorance and brutish toil had bound them she knew nothing knew no more than the grass knew that blew in the wind than the passionflower knew that slept unborn in the uncurled leaf and yet withal she felt saw trembled imagined and desired all mutely all blindly all in confusion and in pain the weakness of tears rushed into her fearless eyes that had never quailed before the fury of any living thing her head fell on her chest she wept bitterlynot because the people had injured hernot because her wounded flesh ached and her limbs were sorebut because a distance so immeasurable so unalterable severed her from all of which these gods told her without speech the sunrays still shone on the three brethren whilst the stones on which she sat and her own form were dark in shadow and as though the bright boy hypnos pitied her as though he the worlds consoler had compassion for this thing so lonely and accursed of her kind the dumb violence of her weeping brought its own exhaustion with it the drowsy heat of noon pain weariness the faintness of fasting the fatigue of conflict the dreamy influences of the place had their weight on her crouching there half on her knees looking up ever in the faces of the three immortals the gift of hypnos descended upon her and stilled her its languor stole through her veins its gentle pressure closed her eyelids gradually her rigid limbs and her bent body relaxed and unnerved she sank forward her head lying on her outstretched arms and the stillness of a profound sleep encompassed her oneiros added his gift also and a throng of dim delirious dreams floated through her brain and peopled her slumber with fairer things than the earth holds and made her mouth smile while yet her lids were wet thanatos alone gave nothing but looked down on her with his dark sad eyes and held his finger on his closepressed lips as though he saidnot yet chapter iii her sleep remained unbroken there was no sound to disturb it the caw of a rook in the top of the poplartree the rushing babble of the water the cry of a fieldmouse caught among the rushes by an otter the faroff jingle of mules bells from the great southern road that ran broad and white beyond the meadows the gnawing of the rats in the network of timbers which formed the vaulted roof these were all the noises that reached this solitary place and these were both too faint and too familiar to awaken her heat and pain made her slumber heavy and the forms on which her waking eyes had gazed made her sleep full of dreams hour after hour went by the shadows lengthened the day advanced nothing came to rouse her at length the vesper bell rang over the pastures and the peals of the ave maria from the cathedral in the town were audible in the intense stillness that reigned around as the chimes died arslan crossed the threshold of the granary and entered the desolate place where he had made his home for once his labor had been early completed and he had hastened to employ the rare and precious moments of the remaining light he had almost stepped upon her ere he saw her lying beneath his cartoons of the sons of nyx he paused and looked down her attitude had slightly changed and had in it all the abandonment of youth and of sleep her face was turned upward with quick silent breathings parting the lips her bare feet were lightly crossed the linen of her loose tunic was open at the throat and had fallen back from her right arm and shoulder the whole supple grace and force that were mingled in her form were visible under the light folds of her simple garments the sun still lingered on the bright bowed head of hypnos but all light had died from off the stone floor where she was stretched as she had once looked on himself so he now looked on her but in him there arose little curiosity and still less pity he recognized her as the girl whom with a face of old egypt he had seen rowing her boatload of corn down the river and whom he had noticed for her strange unlikeness to all around her he supposed that mere curiosity had brought her there and sleep overtaken her in the drowsiness of the first heat of the budding year he did not seek to rouse her nor to spare her any shame or pain which at her waking she might feel he merely saw in her a barbaric yet beautiful creature and his only desire was to use the strange charms in her for his art a smoothplaned panel stood on an easel near turning it where best the light fell he began to sketch her attitude rapidly in black and white it was quickly done by a hand so long accustomed to make such transcripts and he soon went further to that richer portraiture which color alone can accomplish the gray stone pavement the brown and slender limbs the breadth of scarlet given by the sash about her loins the upturned face whose bloom was as brilliant as that of a red carnation blooming in the twilight of some old wooden gallery the eyelids tearladen still the mouth that smiled and sighed in dreaming while on the wall above the radiant figure of the young god remained in full sunlight whilst all beneath was darkthese gave a picture which required no correction from knowledge no addition from art he worked on for more than an hour until the wood began to beam with something of the hues of flesh and blood and the whole head was thrown out in color although the body and the limbs still remained in their mere outline once or twice she moved restlessly and muttered a little dully as though the perpetual unsparing gaze bent on her with a scrutiny so cold and yet so searching disturbed or magnetized her even in her sleep but she never awakened and he had time to study and to trace out every curve and line of the halfdeveloped loveliness before him with as little pity with as cruel exactitude as that with which the vivisector tears asunder the living animal whose sinews he severs or the botanist plucks to pieces the newborn flower whose structure he desires to examine the most beautiful women who had bared their charms that he might see them live again upon his canvas had seldom had power to make his hand tremble a moment in such translation to the surgeon all sex is dead all charm is gone from the female corpse that his knife ravages in search of the secrets of science and to arslan the women whom he modeled and portrayed were nearly as sexless nearly as powerless to create passion or emotion they were the tools for his art no more when in the isolation of the long northern winters he had sat beside the pinewood that blazed on his hearth while the wolves howled down the deserted village street and the snow drifted up and blocked from sight the last pane of the lattice and the last glimpse of the outer world he had been more enamored of the visions which visited him in that solitude than he had ever been since of the living creatures whose beauty he had recorded in his works he had little passion in him or passion was dormant and he had sought women even in the hours of love with coldness and with something of contempt for that license which in the days of his comparative affluence he had not denied himself he thought always de ces baisers puissants comme un dictame de ces transports plus vifs que des rayons que restetil cest affreux o mon ame rien quun dessin fort pale aux trois crayons and for those glowing colors of passion which burned so hotly for an instant only so soon to fade out into the pallor of indifference or satiety he had a contempt which almost took the place and the semblance of chastity he worked on and on studying the sleeper at his feet with the keenness of a science that was as merciless in its way as the science which tortures and slaughters in order to penetrate the mysteries of sentient existence she was beautiful in her way this dark strange foreign child who looked as though her native home must have been where the nile lily blooms and the black brows of the sphinx are bent against the sun she was beautiful like a young leopard like a young python coiled there lightly breathing and mute and motionless and unconscious he painted her as he would have painted the leopard or python lying asleep in the heavy hush of a noon of the tropics and she was no more to him than these would have been the shadows grew longer the sunlight died off the bright head of the boy hypnos the feathery reeds on the bank without got a red flush from the west there came a sudden burst of song from a boatload of children going home from the meadows where they had gathered the first cowslips of the season in great sheaves that sent their sweetness on the air through the open window as they went by beneath the walls the shouts of the joyous singing rang shrilly through the silence they pierced her ear and startled her from her slumber she sprang up suddenly with a bound like a hart that scents the hounds and stood fronting him her eyes opened wide her breath panting her nerves strained to listen and striving to combat for in the first bewildered instant of her awakening she thought that she was still in the marketplace of the town and that the shouts were from the clamor of her late tormentors he turned and looked at her what do you fear he asked her in the tongue of the country she started afresh at the sound of his voice and drew her disordered dress together and stood mute with her hands crossed on her bosom and the blood coming and going under her transparent skin what do you fear he asked again i fear she echoed the cowardly word with a halftremulous defiance the heroism of her nature which an hour earlier had been lashed to its fullest strength cast back the question as an insult but her voice was low and husky and the blood dyed her face scarlet as she spoke for she feared him and for the moment she had forgotten how she had come there and all that had passed except that some instinct of the longhunted animal was astir in her to hide herself and fly but he stood between her and the passage outward and pride and shame held her motionless moreover she still listened intently the confused voices of the children still seemed to her like those of the multitude by whom she had been chased and she was ready to leap tigerlike upon them rather than let them degrade her in his sight he looked at her with some touch of interest she was to him only some stray beggargirl who had trespassed into his solitude yet her untamed regard her wideopen eyes the staglike grace of her attitude the sullen strength which spoke in her replyall attracted him to closer notice of these why are you in this place he asked her slowly you were asleep here when i came more than an hour ago the color burned in her face she said nothing the singing of the children was waxing fainter as the boat floated from beneath the wall on its homeward way into the town she ceased to fancy these cries the cries of her foes and recollection began to revive in her why did you come he repeated musing how he should persuade her to return to the attitude sketched out upon his easel she returned his look with the bold truthfulness natural to her joined with the apprehensiveness of chastisement which becomes second nature to every creature that is forever censured cursed and beaten for every real or imagined fault i came to see those she answered him with a backward movement of her hand which had a sort of reverence in it up to the forms of the gods above her the answer moved him he had not thought to find a feeling so high as this in this ragged lonely sunburnt child and to the man for whom throughout a youth of ambition and of disappointment the world had never found the voice of favor even so much appreciation as lay in this outcasts homage had its certain sweetness for a man may be negligent of all sympathy for himself yet never if he be poet or artist will he be able utterly to teach himself indifference to all sympathy for his works those he echoed in surprise what can they be to you she colored at the unconcealed contempt that lay in his last word her head drooped she knew that they were much to herfriends masters teachers divine and full of pity but she had no language in which to tell him this and if she could have told him she would have been ashamed also the remembrance of those benefits to him of which he was ignorant had now come to her through the bewilderment of her thoughts and it locked her lips to silence her eyes dropped under his the strange love she bore him made her blind and giddy and afraid she moved restlessly glaring round with the halftimid halffierce glances of a wild animal that desires to escape and cannot watching her more closely he noticed for the first time the stains of blood upon her shoulder and the bruise on her chest where the rent in her linen left it bare you have been hurt he asked her or wounded she shook her head it is nothing nothing you have fallen or been ill treated surely the people struck me struck you with what stones and why i am follefarine she answered him with the quiet calm of one who offers an allsufficient reply but the reply to him told nothing he had been too shunned by the populace who dreaded the evil genius which they attributed to him to have been told by them of their fancies and their follies and he had never essayed to engage either their companionship or their confidence to be left to work or to die in solitude undisturbed was the uttermost that he had ever asked of any strange people amidst whom he had dwelt because you are follefarine he repeated is that a reason to hate you she gave a gesture of assent and you hate them in return she paused a moment glancing still hither and thither all round as a trapped bird glances seeking his way outward i think so she muttered and yet i have had their little children in my reach many a time by the water when the woods were all quiet and i have never killed one yet he looked at her more earnestly than he had done before the repressed passion that glanced under her straight dusky brows the unspoken scorn which curled on her mouth the nervous meaning with which her hands clinched on the folds of linen on her breast attracted him there was a force in them all which aroused his attention there were in her that conscious power for ferocity and that contemptuous abstinence from its exercise which lie so often in the fathomless regard of the lion he moved nearer to her and addressed her more gently who are you he asked and why have these people such savage violence against you i am follefarine she answered him again unable to add anything else have you no other name no but you must have a home you livewhere at the mill with flamma does he also ill use you he beats me when you do wrong she was silent wrong right they were but words to herempty and meaningless she knew that he beat her more often because she told truth or refused to cheat for aught that she was sure of she might be wrong and he right arslan looked at her musingly all the thought he had was to induce her to return to the attitude necessary to the completion of his picture he put a few more questions to her but the replies told him little at all times silent before him a thousand emotions held her dumb she was afraid besides that at every word he might suspect the debt he owed to her and she dreaded its avowal with as passionate a fear as though in lieu of the highest sacrifice and service her action had been some crime against him she felt ashamed of it as of some unholy thing it seemed to her impious to have dared to give him back a life that he had wearied of and might have wished to lose he must never know he must never know she said to herself she had never known what fear meant until she had looked on this mans face now she dreaded with an intensity of apprehension which made her start like a criminal at every sound lest he should ever know of this gift of life which unbidden she had restored to him this gift which being thus given her instinct told her he would only take as a burden of an intolerable debt of an unmeasurable shame perfect love casts out fear runs the tradition rather surely does the perfect love of a woman break the courage which no other thing could ever daunt and set foot on the neck that no other yoke would ever touch by slow degrees he got from her such fragments of her obscure story as she knew that this child so friendless ill treated and abandoned had been the savior of his own existence he never dreamed a creature beaten and half starved herself could not for an instant seem to him one likely to have possessed even such humble gifts as food and fuel besides his thoughts were less with her than with the interrupted study on his easel and his one desire was to induce her to endure the same watch upon her awakening which had had power to disturb her even in her unconsciousness she was nothing to him save a thing that he wished to turn to the purpose of his artlike a flower that he plucked on his way through the fields for the sake of its color to fill in some vacant nook in a mountain foreground you have come often here he asked her whilst she stood before him flushing and growing pale irresolute and embarrassed with her hands nervously gathering the folds of her dress across her chest and her sad lustrous troubled eyes glancing from side to side in a bewildered fear often she muttered you will not beat me for it i did no harm beat you among what brutes have you lived tell me why did you care to come her face drooped and grew a deeper scarlet where the warm blood was burning they are beautiful and they speak to me she murmured with a pathetic apologetic timidity in her voice he laughed a little bitterly are they they have few auditors but you are beautiful too in your way has no one ever told you so i she glanced at him half wistfully half despairingly she thought that he spoke in derision of her you he answered why not look at yourself here all imperfect as it is you can see something of what you are her eyes fell for the first time on the broad confused waves of dull color out of whose depths her own face arose like some fair drowned thing tossed upward on a murky sea she started with a cry as if he had wounded her and stood still trembling she had looked at her own limbs floating in the opaque water of the bathing pool with a certain sense of their beauty wakening in her she had tossed the soft thick goldflecked darkness of her hair over her bare shoulder with a certain languor and delight she had held a knot of poppies against her breast to see their hues contrast with her own white skinbut she had never imagined that she had beauty he watched her letting the vain passion he thus taught her creep with all its poison into her veins he had seen such wonder and such awed delight before in nubian girls with limbs of bronze and eyes of night who had never thought that they had lovelinessthough they had seen their forms in the clear water of the wells every time that they had brought their pitchers thitherand who had only awakened to that sweet supreme sense of power and possession when first they had beheld themselves live again upon his canvas you are glad he asked her at length she covered her face with her hands i am frightened frightened she knew not why and utterly ashamed to have lain thus in his sight to have slept thus under his eyes and yet filled with an ecstasy to think that she was lovely enough to be raised amidst those marvelous dreams that peopled and made heaven of his solitude well thenlet me paint you there he said after a pause i am too poor to offer you reward for it i have nothing i want nothing she interrupted him quickly while a dark shadow half wrath half sorrow swept across her face he smiled a little i cannot boast the same but since you care for all these hapless things that are imprisoned here do me their painter this one grace lie there in the shadow again as you were when you slept and let me go on with this study of you till the sun sets a glory beamed over all her face her mouth trembled her whole frame shook like a reed in the wind if you care she said brokenly and paused it seemed to her impossible that this form of hers which had been only deemed fit for the whip for the rope for the shower of stones could have any grace or excellence in his sight it seemed to her impossible that this face of hers which nothing had ever kissed except the rough tongue of some honest dog and which had been blown on by every stormwind beaten on by every summer sun could have color or shape or aspect that could ever please him certainly i care go yonder and lie as you were lying a few moments agothere in the shadow under these gods she was used to give obediencethe dumb unquestioning obedience of the packhorse or the sheepdog and she had no idea for an instant of refusal it was a great terror to her to hear his voice and feel his eyes on her and be so near to him yet it was equally a joy sweeter and deeper than she had ever dreamed of as possible he still seemed to her like a god this man under whose hand flowers bloomed and sunrays smiled and waters flowed and human forms arose and the gracious shapes of a thousand dreams grew into substance and yet in herself this man saw beauty he motioned her with a careless gentle gesture as a man motions a timid dog to the spot over which the three brethren watched hand in hand and she stretched herself down passively and humbly meekly as the dog stretches himself to rest at his masters command over all her body the blood was leaping her limbs shuddered her breath came and went in broken murmurs her brighthued skin grew dark and white by turns she was filled with a passionate delight that he had found anything in her to desire or deem fair and she quivered with a tumultuous fear that made her nervous as any panting hare her heart beat as it had never done when the people had raged in their fury around her one living creature had found beauty in her one human voice had spoken to her gently and without a curse one man had thought her a thing to be entreated and not scorneda change so marvelous in her fate transfigured all the world for her as though the gods above had touched her lips with fire but she was mute and motionless the habit of silence and of repression had become her second nature no statue of marble could have been stiller or in semblance more lifeless than she was where she rested on the stones arslan noticed nothing of this he was intent upon his work the sun was very near its setting and every second of its light was precious to him the world indeed he knew would in all likelihood never be the wiser or the richer for anything he did in all likelihood he knew all these things that he created were destined to moulder away undisturbed save by the rats that might gnaw and the newts that might traverse them he was buried here in the grave of a hopeless penury of an endless oblivion they were buried with him and the world wanted neither him nor them still having the madness of genius he was as much the slave of his art as though an universal fame had waited his lowliest and lightest effort with a deep breath that had half a sigh in it he threw down his brushes when the darkness fell while he wrought he forgot the abject bitterness of his life when he ceased work he remembered how hateful a thing it is to live when life means only deprivation obscurity and failure he thanked her with a few words of gratitude to her for her patience and released her from the strain of the attitude she rose slowly with an odd dazzled look upon her face like one coming out of great darkness into the full blaze of day her eyes sought the portrait of her own form which was still hazy and unformed amidst a mist of varying hues that she should be elected to have a part with those glorious things which were the companions of his loneliness seemed to her a wonder so strange and so immeasurable that her mind still could not grasp it for it was greatness to her a greatness absolute and incredible the men had stoned the women cursed the children hooted her but he selected herand her alonefor that supreme honor which his hand could give not noticing the look upon her face he placed before her on the rude bench which served in that place for a table some score of small studies in color trifles brilliant as the rainbow birds flowers insects a leaf of fern an orchid in full bloom a nest with a blue warbler in it a few peasants by a wayside cross a child at a well a mule laden with autumn fruitanything which in the district had caught his sight or stirred his fancy he bade her choose from them there is nothing else here he added but since you care for such things take as many of them as you will as recompense her face flushed up to the fringes of her hair her eyes looked at the sketches in thirsty longing except the scarlet scarf of marcellin this was the only gift she had ever had offered her and all these reproductions of the world around her were to her like so much sorcery owning one she would have worshiped it revered it caressed it treasured it her life was so desolate and barren that such a gift seemed to her as handfuls of gold and silver would seem to a beggar were he bidden to take them and be rich she stretched her arms out in one quick longing gesture then as suddenly withdrew them folding them on her chest whilst her face grew very pale something of its old dark proud ferocity gathered on it i want no payment she said huskily and she turned to the threshold and crossed it he stayed her with his hand wait i did not mean to hurt you will you not take them as reward no she spoke almost sullenly there was a certain sharpness and dullness of disappointment at her heart she wanted she wished she knew not what but not that he should offer her payment can you return tomorrow or any other day he asked her thinking of the sketch unfinished on the sheet of pinewood he did not notice the beating of her heart under her folded arms the quick gasp of her breath the change of the rich color in her face if you wish she answered him below her breath i do wish surely the sketch is all unfinished yet i will come then she moved away from him across the threshold as she spoke she was not afraid of the people but she was afraid of this strange passionate sweetness which seemed to fill her veins with fire and make her drunk and blind shall i go with you homeward she shook her head but the people who struck youthey may attack you again she laughed a little low in her throat i showed them a knifethey are timid as hares you are always by yourself always she drew herself with a rapid movement from him and sprang into her boat where it rocked amidst the rushes against the steps in another instant she had thrust it from its entanglement in the reeds and pulled with swift steady strokes down the stream into the falling shadows of the night you will come back he called to her as the first stroke parted the water yes she answered him and the boat shot forward into the shadow night was near and the darkness soon inclosed it the beat of the oars sounding faintly through the silence of the evening there was little need to exact the promise from her like persephone she had eaten of the fatal pomegranateseed which whether she would or no would make her leave the innocence of youth and the light of the sun and the blossoms of the glad green springtime world and draw her footsteps backward and downward to that hell which noneonce having entered itcan ever more forsake she drifted away from him into the shadows of evening as they died from the shore and the stream into the gloom of the night he thought no more of pursuing her than he thought of chasing the melted shadows returning to his chamber he looked for some minutes at the panel where it leaned against the wall catching the first pallid moongleam of the night if she should not come it will be of little moment he thought i have nearly enough for remembrance there and he went away from the painting and took up charcoal and turned to those anatomical studies whose severity he never spared himself and for whose perfection he pursued the science of form even in the bodies of the dead from the moment that his hand touched the stylus he forgot her for she was no more to him than a chance bird that he might have taken from its home among the ripe red autumn foliage and caged for awhile to study its grace and color its longing eye and drooping wing and then tossed up into the air again when he had done with it to find its way to freedom or to fall into the fowlers snarewhat matter which the boat went on into the darkness under the willow banks past the great calvary whose lantern was just lit and glimmered through the gloom she knew by heart the old familiar way and the water was as safe to her as the broadest and straightest road at noonday she loved it best thus dusky half seen muttering on through the silence full of the shadows of the clouds and of the boughs black as a freshdug grave where some ruined wall leaned over it broken into little silvery gleams where it caught the light from a saints shrine or a smiths forge by day a river is but the highway of men it is but a public bridge betwixt the country and the town but at night it grows mystical silent solitary unreal with the sound of the sea in its murmurings and the peace of death in its calm at night through its ceaseless whisperings there always seem to come echoes from all the voices of the multitudes of the ocean whence it comes and from all the voices of the multitudes of the city whither it goes it was quite dark when she reached the landing steps the moon was just rising above the sharp gables of the millhouse and a lantern was moving up and down behind the budded boughs as claudis flamma went to and fro in his woodyard at the jar of the boat against the steps he peered through the branches and greeted her with a malignant reprimand he timed her services to the minute and here had been a full half day of the spring weather wasted and lost to him he drove her indoors with sharp railing and loud reproaches not waiting for an answer but heaping on her the bitterest terms of reviling that his tongue could gather in the kitchen a little low burning lamp lit dully the poverty and dreariness of the place and shed its orange rays on the illtempered puckered gloomy face of the old woman pitchou sitting at her spindle there was a curious odor of sundried herbs and smokedried fish that made the air heavy and pungent the great chimney yawned black and fireless a starveling cat mewed dolorously above an empty platter under a tawdrycolored print of the flight into egypt there hung on a nail three dead blackbirds shot as they sang the praises of the spring on a dresser beside a little white basin of holy water there lay a gray rabbit dead likewise with limbs broken and bleeding from the trap in which it had writhed helpless all through the previous night the penury dullness and cruelty the hardness and barrenness and unloveliness of this life in which she abode had never struck her with a sense so sharp as that which now fell on her crossing the threshold of this dreary place after the shadows of the night the beauty of the gods the voice of praise the eyes of arslan she came into the room bringing with her the cool fragrance of damp earth wet leaves and wild flowers the moisture of the evening was on her clothes and hair her bare feet sparkled with the silvery spray of dew her eyes had the look of blindness yet of luster that the night air lends and on her face there was a mingling of puzzled pain and of rapturous dreaming wonder which new thought and fresh feeling had brought there to break up its rich darkness into light the old woman twirling a flaxen thread upon her wheel looked askance at her and mumbled like mother like child the old man catching up the lamp held it against her face and peered at her under his gray bent brows a whole day wasted he swore for the twentieth time in his teeth beast what hast thou to say for thyself the old dogged ferocity gathered over her countenance chasing away the softened perplexed radiance that had been newly wakened there i say nothing she answered nothing nothing he echoed after her then we will find a way to make thee speak nothingwhen three of the clock should have seen thee back hither at latest and five hours since then have gone by without account you have spent it in brawling and pleasurein shame and iniquityin vice and in violence thou creature of sin since you know why ask she spoke with steady contemptuous calm she disdained to seek refuge from his fury by pleading the injuries that the townsfolk had wrought her and of the house by the river she would not have spoken though they had killed her the storm of his words raged on uninterrupted five hours five mortal hours stolen from me your lawful work left undone that you may riot in some secret abomination that you dare not to name say where you have been what you have done you spawn of hell or i will wring your throat as i wring a sparrows i have done as i chose she looked him full in the eyes as she spoke with the look in her own that a bulls have when he lowers his head to the charge and attack as you choose ohho you would speak as queens speakyoua thing less than the worm and the emmet as you chooseyouwho have not a rag on your back not a crust of rye bread not a leaf of salad to eat not a lock of hay for your bed that is not mineminemine as you choose youyou thing begotten in infamy you slave you beggar you sloth you are nothingnothingless than the blind worm that crawls in the sand you have the devil that bred you in you no doubt but it shall go hard if i cannot conquer him when i bruise your body and break your will as he spoke he seized to strike her in his hand he already gripped an oak stick that he had brought in with him from his timberyard and he raised it to rain blows on her expecting no other course than that dumb passive scornful submission with which she had hitherto accepted whatsoever he had chosen to do against her but the creature silent and stirless who before had stood to receive his lashes as though her body were of bronze or wood that felt not was changed a leonine and superb animal sprang up in full rebellion she started out of his grasp her lithe form springing from his seizure as a willowbough that has been bent to earth springs back released into the air she caught the staff in both her hands wrenched it by a sudden gesture from him and flung it away to the farther end of the chamber then she turned on him as a hart turns brought to bay her supple body was erect like a young pine her eyes flashed with a luster he had never seen in them the breath came hard and fast through her dilated nostrils touch me again she cried aloud while her voice rang full and imperious through the stillness touch me again and by the heaven and hell you prate of i will kill you so sudden was the revolt so sure the menace that the old man dropped his hands and stood and gazed at her aghast and staring not recognizing the mute patient doglike thing that he had beaten at his will in this stern fearless splendid terrible creature who faced him in all the royalty of wrath in all the passion of insurrection he could not tell what had altered her what had wrought this transformation what had changed her as by sorcery he could not tell that what had aroused a human soul in her had been the first human voice that she had listened to in love he could not tell that her body had grown sacred to her because a stranger had called her beautiful and that her life for the first time had acquired a worth and dignity in her sight because one man had deemed it fair he could not tell he could only see that for the first time his slave had learned somewhere and in somewise what freedom meant and had escaped him this alone he saw and seeing it was startled and afraid she waited watching him some moments with cold eyes of disdain in which a smouldering fire slept ready to burst into an alldevouring flame there was not a sound in the place the woman spinning stopped her wheel wondering in a halfstupid savage fashion the lean cat ceased its cries there was only the continual swish of the water in the sluices under the wall without and the dull ticking of an old black forest clock that kept a fitful measure of the days and nights in its cracked case of painted wood high up where the thyme and the sage and the onions hung among the twisted rafters follefarine stood still her left hand resting on her hip her lips curved scornfully and close her face full of passion which she kept still as the dead birds hanging on the wall whilst all the time the tawny smoky hues of the oillamp were wavering with an odd fantastic play over her head and limbs before this night she had always taken every blow and stripe patiently without vengeance without effort as she saw the mule and the dog the horse and the ox take theirs in their pathetic patience in their noble fortitude she had thought that such were her daily portion as much as was the daily bread she broke but now since she had awakened with the smile of the gods upon her now she felt that sooner than endure again that indignity that outrage she would let her tyrant kill her in his hate if so he chose and cast her body to the millstream moaning through the trees beneath the moon the water at least would bear her with it tranquil and undefiled beneath the old gray walls and past the eyes of arslan there was that in her look which struck dumb the mouth and held motionless the arm of claudis flamma caustic savage hard as his own ash staff though he was he was for the moment paralyzed and unmanned some vague sense of shame stirred heavily in him some vague remembrance passed over him that whatsoever else she might be she had been once borne in his daughters bosom and kissed by his daughters lips and sent to him by a dead womans will with a dead womans wretchedness and loneliness as her sole birthgifts he passed his hands over his eyes with a blinded gesture staring hard at her in the dusky lamplight he was a strong and bitter old man made cruel by one great agony and groping his way savagely through a dark hungry superstitious ignorant life but in that moment he no more dared to touch her than he would have dared to tear down the leaden christ from off its crucifix and trample it under foot and spit on it he turned away muttering in his throat and kicking the cat from his path while he struck out the light with his staff get to thy den he said with a curse we are abed too late tomorrow i will deal with thee she went without a word out of the dark kitchen and up the ladderlike stairs up to her lair in the roof she said nothing it was not in her nature to threaten twice or twice protest but in her heart she knew that neither the next day nor any other day should that which arslan had called beauty be stripped and struck whilst life was in her to preserve it by death from that indignity from the time of her earliest infancy she had been used to bare her shoulders to the lash and take the stripes as food and wages she had no more thought to resist them than the brave hound who fears no foe on earth has to resist his masters blows the dull habits of a soulless bondage had been too strong on her to be lightly broken and the resignation of the loyal beasts that were her comrades had been the one virtue that she had seen to follow but now at length she had burst her bonds and had claimed her freedom she had tasted the freshness of liberty and the blood burned like fire in her face as she remembered the patience and the shame of the years of her slavery there was no mirror in her little room in the gabled eaves all the mirror she had ever known had been that which she had shared with the waterlilies when together she and they had leaned over the smooth dark surface of the millpond but the moon streamed clearly through the one unshuttered window a moon full and clear and still cold the springtide moon from which the pale primroses borrow those tender hues of theirs which never warm or grow deeper however golden be the sun that may shine its clear colorless crescent went sailing past the little square lattice hole in the wall masses of gorgeous cloud white and black swept by in a fresh west wind the fresh breath of a spring night chased away the heat and languor of the day the smell of all the blossoms of the spring rose up from wood and orchard the cool drowsy murmuring of the millstream beneath was the only sound on the stillness except when now and then there came the wild cry of a mating owl the moonbeams fell about her where she stood and she looked down on her smooth skin her glistening shoulders her lustrous and abundant hair on which the wavering light played and undulated the most delicious gladness that a womans life can know was in tumult in her conflicting with the new and deadly sense of shame and ignorance she learned that she was beautiful at the same time that she awoke to the knowledge of her dumb lifeless slavish inferiority to all other human things beautiful she muttered to herself only as a poppy as a snake as a nightmoth are beautifulbeautiful and without fragrance or sweetness or worth and her heart was heavy even amidst all its pleasure and triumph heavy with a sense of utter ignorance and utter worthlessness the poppy was snapped asunder as a weed the snake was shunned and cursed for his poison the nightmoth was killed because his nature had made him dwell in the darkness none of the three might have any fault in truth in them all of the three might have only the livery of evil and no more might be innocent and ask only to breathe and live for a little brief space in their world which men called gods world yet were they condemned by men and slain being what they were although god made them even so she felt without reasoning had it been and would it be with herself chapter iv in the room below the old norman woman who did not fear her taskmaster unbarred the shutter to let the moon shine in the room and by its light put away her wheel and work and cut a halved lettuce up upon a platter with some dry bread and ate them for her supper the old man knelt down before the leaden image and joined his knotted hands and prayed in a low fierce eager voice while the heavy pendulum of the clock swung wearily to and fro the clock kept fitful and uncertain time it had been so long imprisoned in the gloom there among the beams and cobwebs and in this place life was so dull so colorless so torpid that it seemed to have forgotten how time truly went and to wake up now and then with a shudder of remembrance in which its works ran madly down the old woman ended her supper munching the lettuceleaves thirstily in her toothless mouth and not casting so much as a crumb of the crusts to the cat who pitifully watched and mutely implored with great ravenous ambercircled eyes then she took her stick and crept out of the kitchen her wooden shoes clacking loud on the bare red bricks prayer did little to keep holy the other one she muttered unless indeed the devil heard and answered but claudis flamma for all that prayed on entreating the mercy and guidance of heaven whilst the gore dripped from the dead rabbit and the silent songbirds hung stiff upon the nail thou hast a good laborer said the old woman pitchou with curt significance to her master meeting him in the raw of the dawn of the morrow as he drew the bolts from his housedoor take heed that thou dost not drive her away flamma one may beat a saddled mule safely but hardly so a wolfs cub she passed out of the door as she spoke with mop and pail to wash down the paved court outside but her words abode with her master he meddled no more with the wolfs cub when follefarine came down the stairs in the crisp cool sweetsmelling spring morning that was breaking through the mists over the land and water he motioned to her to break her fast with the cold porridge left from overnight and looking at her from under his bent brows with a glance that had some apprehension underneath its anger apportioned her a task for the early day with a few bitter words of command but he molested her no further nor referred ever so faintly to the scene of the past night she ate her poor and tasteless meal in silence and set about her appointed labor without protest so long as she should eat his bread so long she said to herself would she serve him thus much the pride and honesty of her nature taught her was his due he watched her furtively under his shaggy eyebrows his instinct told him that this nameless dumb captive desert animal which he had bound as a beast of burden to his millwheels had in some manner learned her strength and would not long remain content to be thus yoked and driven he had blinded her with the blindness of ignorance and goaded her with the goad of ignominy but for all that some way her bandaged eyes had sought and found the light some way her numbed hide had thrilled and swerved beneath the barb she also is a saint let god take her said the old man to himself in savage irony as he toiled among his millgear and his sacks his heart was ever sore and in agony because his god had cheated him letting him hold as purest and holiest among women the daughter who had betrayed him in his way he prayed still but chiefly his prayer was a passionate upbraiding a cynical reproach shehis beloved his marvel his choicest of maidens his fairest and coldest of virginshad escaped him and duped him and been a thing of passion and of foulness of treachery and of lust all the while that he had worshiped her therefore he hated every breathing thing therefore he slew the birds in their song the insects in their summer bravery the lamb in its gambols the rabbit in its play amidst the primroses therefore he cried to the god whom he still believed in thou lettest that which was pure escape me to be defiled and be slaughtered and now thou lettest that which is vile escape me to become beautiful and free and strong and now and then in this woe of his which was so pitiful and yet so brutal he glanced at her where she labored among the unbudded vines and leafless fruit trees and whetted a sickle on the whirling grindstone and felt its edge and thought to himself she was devilbegotten would it not be well once and for all to rid men of her for he reasoned being thus conceived in infamy and branded from her birth upward how should she be ever otherwise than to men a curse where she went at her labors to and fro among the bushes and by the glancing water she saw the steel hook and caught his sideway gaze and read his meditation she laughed and did not fear only she thought he shall not do it till i have been back there before the day was done thither she went he had kept her close since the sunrise not sending her out on any of the errands to and fro the country which had a certain pleasure to her because she gained by them liberty and air and the contentment of swift movement against fresh blowing winds nor did he send her to the town he employed her through ten whole hours in outdoor garden labor and in fetching and carrying from his yard to his lofts always within sight of his own quick eye and within call of his harsh voice she did not revolt she did what he bade her do swiftly and well there was no fault to find in any of her labors when the last sack was carried the last sod turned the last burden borne the sun was sinking he bade her roughly go indoors and winnow last years wheat in the store chambers till he should bid her cease she came and stood before him her eyes very quiet in their look of patient strength i have worked from daybreak through to sunset she said slowly to him it is enough for man and beast the rest i claim before he could reply she had leaped the low stone wall that parted the timberyard from the orchard and was out of sight flying far and fast through the twilight of the boughs he muttered a curse and let her go his head drooped on his breast his hands worked restlessly on the stone coping of the wall his withered lips muttered in wrath there is hell in her he said to himself let her go to her rightful home there is one thing there is one thing echoed the old woman hanging washed linen out to dry on the boughs of the halfbloomed almondshrubs he gave a dreary greedy misers chuckle one thingi have made the devil work for me hard and well ten whole years through the devil mumbled the woman pitchou in contemptuous iteration dost think the devil was ever such a fool as to work for thy wage of blows and of black bread why he rules the world they say and how should he rule unless he paid his people well follefarine fled on through the calm woodlands through the pastures where the leek herds dreamed their days away through the young wheat and the springing colza and the little fields all bright with promise of the spring and all the sunsets wealth of golden light the league was but as a step to her trained as her muscles were to speed and strength until her feet were as fleet as are the does when she had gained her goal then only she paused stricken with a sudden shyness and terror of what she hardly knew an instinct rather than a thought turned her towards a little grasshidden pool behind the granary whose water never stirred save by a pigeons rosy foot or by a timid plovers beak was motionless and clear as any mirror instinct rather than thought bent her head over it and taught her eyes to seek her own reflection it had a certain wonder in it to her now that fascinated her with a curious indefinable attraction for the first time in her life she had thought of it and done such slight things as she could to make it greater they were but fewlinen a little whiter and less coarsethe dust shaken from her scarlet sash her bronzehued hair burnished to richer darkness a knot of wild narcissi in her bosom gathered with the dew on them as she came through the wood this was all yet this was something something that showed the dawn of human impulses of womanly desires as she looked she blushed for her own foolishness and with a quick hand cast the white woodflowers into the center of the pool it seemed to her now though only a moment earlier she had gathered them so senseless and so idle to have decked herself with their borrowed loveliness as if for such things as these he cared then slowly and with her head sunk she entered his dwellingplace arslan stood with his face turned from her bending down over a trestle of wood he did not hear her as she approached she drew quite close to him and looked where she saw that he looked down on the wooden bench what she saw were a long falling stream of lighthued hair a gray still face closed eyes and naked limbs which did not stir save when his hand moved them a little in their posture and which then dropped from his hold like lead she did not shudder nor exclaim she only looked with quiet and incurious eyes in the life of the poor such a sight has neither novelty nor terror it did not even seem strange to her to see it in such a place he started slightly as he grew sensible of her presence and turned and threw a black cloth over the trestle do not look there he said to her i had forgotten you otherwise i have looked there it is only a dead woman only what makes you say that i do not know there are manyare there not he looked at her in surprise seeing that this utter lack of interest or curiosity was true and not assumed that awe and reverence and dread and all emotions which rise in human hearts before the sight or memory of death were wholly absent from her there are many indeed he made answer slowly just there is the toughest problemit is the insect life of the world it is the clouds of human ephemerae begotten one summer day to die the next it is the millions on millions of men and women born as it were only to be choked by the reek of cities and then fade out to nothing it is the numbers that kill ones dreams of immortality she looked wearily up at him not comprehending and indeed he had spoken to himself and not to her she lifted up one corner of the cere cloth and gazed a little while at the dead face the face of a girl young and in a slight soft youthful manner fair it is fortis the ragpickers daughter she said indifferently and dropped back the sheltering cloth she did not know what nor why she envied and yet she was jealous of this white dead thing that abode there so peacefully and so happily with the caress of his touch on its calm limbs yes he answered her it is his daughter she died twenty hours agoof low fever they sayfamine no doubt why do you have her here she felt no sorrow for the dead girl the girl had mocked and jibed her many a time as a dark witch devilborn she only felt a jealous and restless hatred of her intrusion here the dead sit to me often he said with a certain smile that had sadness and yet coldness in it why that they may tell me the secrets of life do they tell them a fewmost they keep seei paint death i must watch it to paint it it is dreary work you think it is not so to me the surgeon seeks his kind of truth i seek mine the man fortis came to me on the riverside last night he said to me you like studying the dead they say have my dead for a copper coin i am starvingand it cannot hurt her so i gave him the cointhough i am as poor as heand i took the dead woman why do you look like that it is nothing to you the girl shall go to her grave when i have done with her she bent her head in assent it was nothing to her and yet it filled her with a cruel feverish jealousy it weighed on her with a curious pain she did not care for the body lying thereit had been but the other day that the dead girl had shot her lips out at her in mockery and called her names from a balcony in an old ruined house as the boat drifted past it but there passed over her a dreary shuddering remembrance that she likewise might one day lie thus before him and be no more to him than this the people said that he who studied death brought death the old wistful longing that had moved her when marcellin had died to lay her down in the cool water and let it take her to long sleep and to complete forgetfulness returned to her again since the dead were of value to him best she thought be of them and lie here in that dumb still serenity caressed by his touch and his regard for in a manner she was jealous of this woman as of some living rival who had in her absence filled her place and been of use to him and escaped his thought any ghastliness or inhumanity in this search of his for the truth of his art amidst the frozen limbs and rigid muscles of a corpse never occurred to her to her he was like a deity to her these poor weak shreds of broken human lives these fragile empty vessels whose wine of life had been spilled like water that runs to waste seemed beyond measurement to be exalted when deemed by him of value she would have thought no more of grudging them if his employ and in his service than priests of isis or of eleusis would have begrudged the sacrificed lives of beasts and birds that smoked upon their temple altars to die at his will and be of use to himthis seemed to her the most supreme glory fate could hold and she envied the ragpickers daughter lying there in such calm content why do you look so much at her he said at length i shall do her no harm if i did what would she know i was not thinking of her she answered slowly with a certain perplexed pain upon her face i was thinking i might be of more use to you if i were dead you must not kill me because men would hurt you for that but if you wish i will kill myself tonight i have often thought of it lately he started at the strangeness and the suddenness of the words spoken steadily and with perfect sincerity and simplicity in the dialect of the district with no sense in their speaker of anything unusual being offered in them his eyes tried to search the expression of her face with greater interest and curiosity than they had ever done and they gained from their study but little for the innumerable emotions awakening in her were only dimly shadowed there and had in them the confusion of all imperfect expression he could not tell whether here was a great soul struggling through the bonds of an intense ignorance and stupefaction or whether there were only before him an animal perfect wonderfully perfect in its physical development but mindless as any clod of earth he did not know how to answer her why should you think of death he said at last is your life so bitter to you she stared at him is a beaten dogs bitter or is a goaded oxs sweet but you are so youngand you are handsome and a woman she laughed a little a woman marcellin said that well what is there strange in saying it she pointed to the corpse which the last sunrays were brightening till the limbs were as alabaster and the hair was as gold that was a womana creature that is white and rose and has yellow hair and laughs in the faces of men and has a mother that kisses her lips and sees the children come to play at her knees i am not one i am a devil they say his mouth smiled with a touch of sardonic humor whose acrimony and whose irony escaped her what have you done so good or so great that your world should call you so her eyes clouded and lightened alternately you do not believe that i am a devil how should i tell if you covet the title claim ityou have a rightyou are a woman always a woman she muttered with disappointment and with impatience always a woman he echoed as he pointed to the god hermes and there is your creator he she looked rapidly and wistfully at the whitewinged god yes he made woman for he made her mind out of treachery and her words out of the empty wind hephaestus made her heart fusing for it brass and iron their work has worn well it has not changed in all these ages but what is your history go and lie yonder where you were last night and tell me your story while i work she obeyed him and told him what she knew lying there where he had motioned her in the shadow under the figures of the three grandsons of chaos he listened and wrought on at her likeness the story as she told it in her curt imperfect words was plain enough to him though to herself obscure it had in some little measure a likeness to his own it awakened a certain compassion for her in his heart which was rarely moved to anything like pity for to him nature was so much and man so little the one so majestic and so exhaustless the other so small and so ephemeral that human wants and human woes touched him but very slightly his own even at their darkest moved him rather to selfcontempt than to selfcompassion for these were evils of the body and of the senses as a boy he had had no ear to the wail of the frozen and famishing people wandering homeless over the waste of drifted snow where but the night before a village had nestled in the mountain hollow all his senses had been given in a trance of awe and rapture to the voices of the great winds sweeping down from the heights through the pineforests and the furious seas below gnashing and raging on the wreckstrewn strand it was with these last that he had had kinship and communion these endured always but for the men they slew what were they more in the great sum of time than forestleaves or ocean driftwood and indeed to those who are alive to the nameless universal eternal soul which breathes in all the grasses of the fields and beams in the eyes of all creatures of earth and air and throbs in the living light of palpitating stars and thrills through the young sap of forest trees and stirs in the strange loves of windborne plants and hums in every song of the bee and burns in every quiver of the flame and peoples with sentient myriads every drop of dew that gathers on a harebell every bead of water that ripples in a brookto these the mortal life of man can seem but little save at once the fiercest and the feeblest thing that does exist at once the most cruel and the most impotent tyrant of direst destruction and bondsman of lowest captivity hence pity entered very little into his thoughts at any time the perpetual torture of life did indeed perplex him as it perplexes every thinking creature with wonder at the universal bitterness that taints all creation at the universal death whereby all forms of life are nurtured at the universal anguish of all existence which daily and nightly assails the unknown god in piteous protest at the inexorable laws of inexplicable miseries and mysteries but because such suffering was thus universal therefore he almost ceased to feel pity for it of the two he pitied the beasts far more than the human kindthe horse staggering beneath the lash in all the feebleness of hunger lameness and old age the ox bleeding from the goad on the hard furrows or stumbling through the hooting crowd blind footsore and shivering to its last home in the slaughterhouse the dog yielding up its noble life inch by inch under the tortures of the knife loyally licking the hand of the vivisector while he drove his probe through its quivering nerves the unutterable hell in which all these gentle kindly and longsuffering creatures dwelt for the pleasure or the vanity the avarice or the brutality of menthese he pitied perpetually with a tenderness for them that was the softest thing in all his nature but when he saw men and women suffer he often smiled not ill pleased it seemed to him that the worst they could ever endure was only such simple retribution such mere fair measure of all the agonies they cast broadcast therefore he pitied her now for what repulsed all others from herthat she had so little apparent humanity and that she was so like an animal in her strength and weakness and in her ignorance of both her rights and wrongs therefore he pitied her and there was that in her strange kind of beauty in her halfsavage halftimid attitudes in her curt unlearned yet picturesque speech which attracted him besides although solitude was his preference he had been for more than two years utterly alone his loneliness broken only by the companionship of boors with whom he had not had one thought in common the extreme poverty in which the latter months of his life had been passed had excluded him from all human society since he could have sought none without betraying his necessities the almsseeking visit of some man even more famished and desperate than himself such as the ragpicker who had brought the dead girl to him for a few brass coins had been the only relief to the endless monotony of his existence a relief that made such change in it worse than its continuance in follefarine for the first time in two long bitter colorless hated years there was something which aroused his interest and his curiosity some one to whom impulse led him to speak the thoughts of his mind with little concealment she seemed indeed scarcely more than a wild beast half tamed inarticulate defiant shy it might be even if aroused ferocious but it was an animal whose eyes dilated in quickening sympathy with all his moods and an animal whom at a glance he knew would in time crawl to him or combat for him as he chose he talked to her now much on the same impulse that moves a man long imprisoned to converse with the spider that creeps on the floor with the mouse that drinks from his pitcher and makes him treat like an intelligent being the tiny flower growing blue and bright between the stones which is all that brings life into his loneliness the prison door once flung open the sunshine once streaming across the darkness the fetters once struck off the captive once free to go out again among his fellows thenthe spider is left to miss the human love that it has learnt the mouse is left to die of thirst the little blue flower is left to fade out as it may in the stillness and the gloom alone then they are nothing but while the prison doors are still locked they are much here the jailer was poverty and the prison was the worlds neglect and they who lay bound were high hopes great aspirations impossible dreams immeasurable ambitions all swathed and fettered and straining to be free with dumb mad force against bonds that would not break and in these in their bondage there were little patience or sympathy or softness and to them even nature itself at times looked horrible though never so horrible because never so despicable as humanity yet still even in these an instinct of companionship abided and this creature with a womans beauty and an animals fierceness and innocence was in a manner welcome why were women ever made then she said after awhile following though imperfectly the drift of his last words where she lay stretched obedient to his will under the shadow of the wall he smiled the smile of one who recalls some story he has heard from the raving lips of some friend feverstricken once long ago in the far east there dwelt a saint in the desert he was content in his solitude he was holy and at peace the honey of the wild bee and the fruit of the wild tamarisktree sufficed to feed him the lions were his ministers and the hyenas were his slaves the eagle flew down for his blessing and the winds and the storms were his messengers he had killed the beast in him and the soul alone had dominion and day and night upon the lonely air he breathed the praise of god years went with him thus and he grew old and he said to himself i have lived content so shall i die purified and ready for the kingdom of heaven for it was in the day when that wooden god who hangs on the black cross yonder was not a lifeless effigy as now but had a name of power and of might adjuring which his people smiled under torture and died in the flame dreaming of a land where the sun never set and the song never ceased and the faithful forever were at rest so the years i say went by with him and he was glad and at peace one night when the thunder rolled and the rain torrents fell to the door of his cave there came a wayfarer fainting sickly lame trembling with terror of the desert and beseeching him to save her from the panthers he was loth and dreaded to accede to her prayer for he said wheresoever a woman enters there the content of a man is dead but she was in dire distress and entreated him with tears and supplications not to turn her adrift for the lightning and the lions to devour and he felt the old human pity steal on him and he opened the door to her and bade her enter and be at sanctuary there in gods name but when she had entered age and sickness and want fell from off her her eyes grew as two stars her lips were sweet as the rose of the desert her limbs had the grace of the cheetah her body had the radiance and the fragrance of frankincense on an altar of gold and she laughed in his beard and cried saying thou thinkest thou hast lived and yet thou hast not loved oh sage oh saint oh fool fool fool then into his veins there rushed youth and into his brain there came madness the life he had led seemed but death and eternity loathsome since passionless and he stretched his arms to her and sought to embrace her crying stay with me though i buy thee with hell and she stayed but when the morning broke she left him laughing gliding like a phantom from his arms and out into the red sunlight and across the desert sand laughing laughing always and mocking him whilst she beckoned he pursued her chasing her through the dawn through the noon through the night he never found her she had vanished as the rose of the rainbow fades out of the sky he searched for her in every city and in every land some say he searches still doomed to live on through every age and powerless to die he had a certain power over words as over color like all true painters the fiber of his mind was sensuous and poetic though the quality of passionate imagination was in him welded with a coldness and a stillness of temper born in him with his northern blood he had dwelt much in the asiatic countries and much of the philosophies and much of the phraseology of the east remained with him something even there seemed in him of the mingled asceticism and sensualism the severe selfdenial with the voluptuous fancy of the saints who once had peopled the deserts in which he had in turn delighted to dwell free and lonely scorning women and deserting men he spoke seldom being by nature silent but when he did speak his language was unconsciously varied into picturelike formations she listened breathless with the color in her cheeks and the fire brooding in her eyes her unformed mind catching the swift shadowy allegories of his tale by force of the poetic instincts in her no one had ever talked to her thus and yet it seemed clear to her and beautiful like the story that the great sunflowers told as they swayed to and fro in the light like the song that the bright brookwater sung as it purred and sparkled under the boughs that is true she said suddenly at length it is a saints story in substance it is true in spirit for all time her breath came with a sharp swift panting sound she was blinded with the new light that broke in on her if i be a woman shall i then be such a woman as that arslan rested his eyes on her with a grave halfsad halfsardonic smile why not you are the devils daughter you say of such are mens kingdom of heaven she pondered long upon his answer she could not comprehend it she had understood the parable of his narrative yet the passion of it had passed by her and the evil shut in it had escaped her do then men love what destroys them she asked slowly always he made answer still with that same smile as of one who remembers hearkening to the delirious ravings round him in a madhouse through which he has walkedhimself sanein a bygone time i do not want love she said suddenly while her brain half strong half feeble struggled to fit her thoughts to words i wanti want to have power as the priest has on the people when he says pray and they pray power he echoed as the devotee echoes the name of his god who does not but do you think the woman that tempted the saint had none if ever you reach that kingdom such power will become yours a proud glad exultation swept over her face for a moment it quickly faded she did not believe in a future how many times had she not since the hand of claudis flamma first struck her prayed with all the passion of a childs dumb agony that the dominion of her fathers power might come to her and the great evil had never hearkened he whom all men around her feared had made her no sign that he heard but left her to blows to solitude to continual hunger to perpetual toil i have prayed to the devil again and again and he will not hear she muttered marcellin says that he has ears for all but for me he has none he has too much to do to hear all all the nations of the earth beseech him yonder man on the cross they adjure with their mouths indeed but it is your god only whom in their hearts they worship see how the christ hangs his head he is so weary of lip service but since they give the christ so many temples why do they raise none to the devil chut no man builds altars to his secret god look you i will tell you another story once in an eastern land there was a temple dedicated to all the various deities of all the peoples that worshiped under the sun there were many statues and rare ones statues of silver and gold of ivory and agate and chalcedony and there were altars raised before all on which every nation offered up sacrifice and burned incense before its divinity now no nation would look at the god of another and each people clustered about the feet of its own fetich and glorified it crying out there is no god but this god the noise was fearful and the feuds were many and the poor king whose thought it had been to erect such a temple was confounded and very sorrowful and murmured saying i dreamed to beget universal peace and tolerance and harmony and lo there come of my thought nothing but discord and war then to him there came a stranger veiled and claiming no country and he said you were mad to dream religion could ever be peace yet be not disquieted give me but a little place and i will erect an altar whereat all men shall worship leaving their own gods the king gave him permission and he raised up a simple stone and on it he wrote to the secret sin and being a sorcerer he wrote with a curious power that showed the inscription to the sight of each man but blinded him whilst he gazed on it to all sight of his fellows and each man forsook his god and came and kneeled before this nameless altar each bowing down before it and each believing himself in solitude the poor forsaken gods stood naked and alone there was not one man left to worship one of them she listened her eloquent eyes fixed on him her lips parted her fancy fantastic and full of dreams strengthened by loneliness and unbridled through ignorance steeping itself in every irony and every fantasy and every shred of knowledge that chance her only teacher cast to her she sat thinking full of a vague sad pity for that denied and forsaken god on the cross by the river such as she had never felt before since she had always regarded him as the symbol of cruelty of famine and of hatred not knowing that these are only the colors which all deities alike reflect from the hearts of the peoples that worship them if i had a god she said suddenly if a god cared to claim mei would be proud of his worship everywhere arslan smiled all women have a god that is why they are at once so much weaker and so much happier than men who are their gods their name is legion innocent women make gods of their offspring of their homes of their housework of their duties and are as cruel as tigresses meanwhile to all outside the pale of their temples othersless innocentmake gods of their own forms and faces of bright stones dug from the earth of vessels of gold and silver of purple and fine linen of passions and vanities and desires gods that they consume themselves for in their youth and that they curse and beat and upbraid in the days of their age which of these gods will be yours she thought awhile none of them she said at last none what will you put in their stead then she thought gravely some moments again although a certain terse and even poetic utterance was the shape which her spoken imaginations naturally took at all times ignorance and solitude had made it hard for her aptly to marry her thoughts to words i do not know she said wearily marcellin says that god is deaf he must be deafor very cruel look everything lives in pain and yet no god pities and makes an end of the earth i wouldif i were he lookat dawn the other day i was out in the wood i came upon a little rabbit in a trap a little pretty soft blackandwhite thing quite young it was screaming in its horrible misery it had been screaming all night its thighs were broken in the iron teeth the trap held it tight it could not escape it could only screamscreamscream all in vain its god never heard when i got it free it was mangled as if a wolf had gnawed it the iron teeth had bitten through the fur and the flesh and the bone it had lost so much blood and it was in so much pain that it could not live i laid it down in the bracken and put water to its mouth and did what i could but it was of no use it had been too much hurt it died as the sun rose a little harmless shy happy thing you know that never killed any creature and only asked to nibble a leaf or two or sleep in a little round hole and run about merry and free how can one care for a god since all gods let these things be arslan smiled as he heard childmen care for a god only as a god means a good to them men are heirs of heaven they say and in right of their heritage they make life hell to every living thing that dares dispute the world with them you do not understand thattut you are not human then if you were human you would begrudge a blade of grass to a rabbit and arrogate to yourself a lease of immortality she did not understand him but she felt that she was honored by him and not scorned as others scorned her for being thus unlike humanity it was a bitter perplexity to her this earth on which she had been flung amidst an alien people that she should suffer herself seemed little to her it had become as a second nature but the sufferings of all the innumerable tribes of creation things of the woods and the field and the waters and the sky that toiled and sweated and were hunted and persecuted and wrenched in torment and finally perished to gratify the appetites or the avarice of humanitythese sufferings were horrible to her always inexplicable hideous unpardonablea crime for which she hated god and man there is no god pitiful then she said at length no godnot one only those three he answered her as he motioned towards the three brethren that watched above her are they your gods a smile that moved her to a certain fear of him passed a moment over his mouth my godsno they are the gods of youth and of agenot of manhood what is yours then minea moloch who consumes my offspring yet in whose burning brazen hands i have put them and myselfforever she looked at him in awe and in reverence she imagined him the priest of some dark and terrible religion for whose sake he passed his years in solitude and deprivation and by whose powers he created the wondrous shapes that rose and bloomed around him those are gentler gods she said timidly raising her eyes to the brethren above her do you neverwill you neverworship them i have ceased to worship them in timewhen the world has utterly beaten meno doubt i shall pray to one at least of them to that one see the eldest of the brethren who holds his torch turned downward and that god is death she was silent was this god not her god also had she not chosen him from all the rest and cast her life down at his feet for this mans sake he must never know he must never know she said again in her heart and thanatos she knew would not betray her for thanatos keeps all the secrets of menhe who alone of all the gods reads the truths of mens souls and smiles and shuts them in the hollow of his hand and lets the braggart time fly on with careless feet above a million graves telling what lies he will to please the world a little space thanatos holds silence and can wait for him must all things ripen and to him must all things fall at last chapter v when she left him that night and went homeward he trimmed his lamp and returned to his labors of casting and modeling from the body of the ragpickers daughter the work soon absorbed him too entirely to leave any memory with him of the living woman he did not knowand had he known would not have heededthat instead of going on her straight path back to ypres she turned again and hidden among the rushes upon the bank crouched half sitting and half kneeling to watch him from the riverside it was all dark and still without nothing came near except now and then some hobbled mule turned out to forage for his evening meal or some nightbrowsing cattle straying out of bounds once or twice a barge went slowly and sullenly by its single light twinkling across the breadth of the stream and the voices of its steersman calling huskily through the fog a drunken peasant staggered across the fields singing snatches of a republican march that broke roughly on the silence of the night the young lambs bleated to their mothers in the meadows and the bells of the old clock towers in the town chimed the quarters with a laus deo in which all their metal tongues joined musically she remained there undisturbed among the long grasses and the tufts of the reeds gazing always into the dimlylighted interior where the pale rays of the oil flame lit up the white forms of the gods the black shadows of the columns the shapes of the wrestling lion and the strangled gladiator the gray stiff frame and hanging hair of the dead body and the bending figure of arslan as he stooped above the corpse and pursued the secret powers of his art into the hidden things of death to her there seemed nothing terrible in a night thus spent in a vigil thus ghastly it seemed to her only a part of his strength thus to make deathmens conquerorhis servant and his slave she only begrudged every passionless touch that his grasp gave to those frozen and rigid limbs which he moved to and fro like so much clay she only envied with a jealous thirst every cold caress that his hand lent to that loose and lifeless hair which he swept aside like so much flax he did not see he did not know to him she was no more than any bronzewinged goldeneyed insect that should have floated in on a night breeze and been painted by him and been cast out again upon the darkness he worked more than half the nightworked until the small store of oil he possessed burned itself out and left the hall to the feeble light of a young moon shining through dense vapors he dropped his tools and rose and walked to and fro on the width of the great stone floor his hands felt chilled to the bone with the contact of the dead flesh his breathing felt oppressed with the heavy humid air that lay like ice upon his lungs the dead woman was nothing to him he had not once thought of the youth that had perished in her of the laughter that hunger had hushed forever on the colorless lips of the passion blushes that had died out forever on the ashen cheeks of the caressing hands of mother and of lover that must have wandered among that curling hair of the children that should have slept on that white breast so smooth and cold beneath his hand for these he cared nothing and thought as little the dead girl for him had neither sex nor story and he had studied all phases and forms of death too long to be otherwise than familiar with them all yet a certain glacial despair froze his heart as he left her body lying there in the flicker of the struggling moonbeams and himself pacing to and fro in his solitude suffered a greater bitterness than death in his doom of poverty and of obscurity the years of his youth had gone in fruitless labor and the years of his manhood were gliding after them and yet he had failed so utterly to make his mark upon his generation that he could only maintain his life by the common toil of the common handlaborer and if he died on the morrow there would not be one hand stretched out to save any one work of his creation from the housewifes fires or the limeburners furnace cold to himself as to all others he said bitterly in his soul what is failure except feebleness and what is it to miss ones mark except to aim wildly and weakly he told himself that harsh and inexorable truth a score of times again and again as he walked backward and forward in the solitude which only that one dead woman shared he told himself that he was a madman a fool who spent his lifetime in search and worship of a vain eidolon he told himself that there must be in him some radical weakness some inalienable fault that he could not in all these years find strength enough to compel the world of men to honor him agony overcame him as he thought and thought and thought until he scorned himself the supreme agony of a strong nature that for once mistrusts itself as feebleness of a great genius that for once despairs of itself as selfdeception had he been the fool of his vanities all his youth upward and had his fellowmen been only wise and clear of sight when they had denied him and refused to see excellence in any work of his hand almost he told himself it must be so he paused by the open casement and looked outward scarcely knowing what he did the mists were heavy the air was loaded with damp exhalations the country was profoundly still abovehead only a few stars glimmered here and there through the haze the peace the silence the obscurity were abhorrent to him they seemed to close upon him and imprison him far away were the lands and the cities of men that he had known far away were all the color and the strength and the strain and the glory of living it seemed to him as though he were dead also like the woman on the trestle yonder dead in some deep seagrave where the weight of the waters kept him down and held his hands powerless and shut his eyelids from all sight while the living voices and the living footsteps of men came dimly on his ear from the world above voices not one of which uttered his name footsteps not one of which paused by his tomb it grew horrible to himthis death in life to which in the freshness of manhood he found himself condemned oh god he who believed in no god muttered half aloud let me be without love wealth peace health gladness all my life longlet me be crippled childless beggared hated to the latest end of my days give me only to be honored in my works give me only a name that men cannot if they wish let die whether any hearer greater than man heard the prayer who shall say daily and nightly through all the generations of the world the human creature implores from his creator the secrets of his existence and asks in vain there is one answer indeed but it is the answer of all the million races of the universe which only cry we are born but to perish is humanity a thing so high and pure that it should claim exemption from the universal and inexorable law one mortal listener heard hidden among the hollow sighing rushes bathed in the moonlight and the mists and the impersonal passion which absorbed him found echo in this inarticulate imperfect soul just wakened in its obscurity to the first faint meanings of its mortal life as a nestbird rouses in the dawn to the first faint pipe of its involuntary cry she barely knew what he sought what he asked and yet her heart ached with his desire and shared the bitterness of his denial what kind of life he craved in the ages to come what manner of remembrance he yearned for from unborn races of man what thing it was that he besought should be given to him in the stead of all love all peace all personal woes and physical delights she did not know the future to her had no meaning and the immortal fame that he craved was an unknown god of whose worship she had no comprehension and yet she vaguely felt that what he sought was that his genius still should live when his body should be destroyed and that those mute motionless majestic shapes which arose at his bidding should become characters and speak for him to all the generations of men when his own mouth should be sealed dumb in death this hunger of the soul which unmanned and tortured him though the famine of the flesh had had no power to move him thrilled her with the instinct of its greatness this thirst of the mind which could not slake itself in common desire or sensual satiety or any peace and pleasure of the ordinary life of man had likeness in it to that dim instinct which had made her nerves throb at the glories of the changing skies and her eyes fill with tears at the sound of a birds singing in the darkness of dawn and her heart yearn with vain nameless longing as for some lost land for some forgotten home in the radiant hush of earth and air at sunrise he suffered as she suffered and a sweet newborn sense of unity and of likeness stirred in her amidst the bitter pity of her soul to her he was as a king and yet he was powerless to give him power she would have died a thousand deaths the gods gave me life for him she thought his life instead of mine will they forgetwill they forget and where she crouched in the gloom beneath the bulrushes she flung herself down prostrate in supplication her face buried in the long damp rivergrass oh immortals she implored in benighted wistful passionate faith remember to give me his life and take mine do what you choose with me forsake me kill me cast my body to fire and my ashes to the wind let me be trampled like the dust and despised as the chaff let me be bruised beaten nameless hated always let me always suffer and always be scorned but grant me this one thingto give him his desire unless the gods gave him greatness she knew that vain would be the gift of lifethe gift of mere length of years which she had bought for him her mind had been left blank as a desert whilst in its solitude dreams had sprung forth windsown like wayside grasses and vague desires wandered like wild doves but although blank the soil was rich and deep and virgin because she had dwelt sundered from her kind she had learned no evil a stainless though savage innocence had remained with her she had been reared in hardship and inured to hunger until such pangs seemed to her scarce worth the counting save perhaps to see if they had been borne with courage and without murmur on her profoundly unconscious of the meaning of any common luxury or any common comfort the passions of natures more worldlywise and better aware of the empire of gold had no hold at any moment to toil dully and be hungry and thirsty and fatigued and footsore had been her daily portion she knew nothing of the innumerable pleasures and powers that the rich command she knew scarcely of the existence of the simplest forms of civilization therefore she knew nothing of all that he missed through poverty she only perceived by an unerring instinct of appreciation all that he gained through genius her mind was profoundly ignorant her character trained by cruelty only to endurance yet the soil was not rank but only untilled not barren but only unsown nature had made it generous though fate had left it untilled it grasped the seed of the first great idea cast to it and held it firm until it multiplied tenfold the imagined danger to them which the peasants had believed to exist in her had been as a strong buckler between the true danger to her from the defilement of their companionship and example they had cursed her as they had passed and their curses had been her blessing blinded and imprisoned instincts had always moved in her to the great and the good things of which no man had taught her in anywise left to herself and uncontaminated by humanity because proscribed by it she had known no teachers of any sort save the winds and the waters the sun and the moon the daybreak and the night and these had breathed into her an unconscious heroism a changeless patience a fearless freedom a strange tenderness and callousness united ignorant though she was and abandoned to the darkness of all the superstitions and the sullen stupor amidst which her lot was cast there was yet that in her which led her to veneration of the purpose of his life he desired not happiness nor tenderness nor bodily ease nor sensual delight but only this one thinga name that should not perish from among the memories of men and this desire seemed to her sublime divine not comprehending it she yet revered it she who had seen the souls of the men around her set on a handful of copper coin a fleece of wool a load of fruit a petty pilfering a small gain in commerce saw the greatness of a heros sacrifice in this supreme selfnegation which was willing to part with every personal joy and every physical pleasure so that only the works of his hand might live and his thoughts be uttered in them when his body should be destroyed it is true that the great artist is as a fallen god who remembers a time when worlds arose at his breath and at his bidding the barren lands blossomed into fruitfulness the sorcery of the thyrsus is still his though weakened the powers of lost dominions haunt his memory the remembered glory of an eternal sun is in his eyes and makes the light of common day seem darkness the heartsickness of a long exile weighs on him incessantly he labors to overtake the mirage of a loveliness which fades as he pursues it in the poetic creation by which the bondage of his material life is redeemed he finds at once ecstasy and disgust because he feels at once his strength and weakness for him all things of earth and air and sea and cloud have beauty and to his ear all voices of the forestland and waterworld are audible he is as a god since he can call into palpable shape dreams born of impalpable thought as a god since he has known the truth divested of lies and has stood face to face with it and been not afraid a god thus but a cripple inasmuch as his hand can never fashion the shapes which his vision beholds and alien because he has lost what he never will find upon earth a beast since ever and again his passions will drag him to wallow in the filth of sensual indulgence a slave since oftentimes the divinity that is in him breaks and bends under the devilry that also is in him and he obeys the instincts of vileness and when he would fain bless the nations he curses them some vague perception of this dawned on her the sense was in her to feel the beauty of art and to be awed by it though she could not have told what it was nor why she cared for it and the man who ministered to it who ruled it and yet obeyed it seemed to her ennobled with a greatness that was the grandest thing her blank and bitter life had known this was all wonderful dreamful awful to her and yet in a halfsavage halfpoetic way she comprehended the one object of his life and honored it without doubt or question no day from that time passed by without her spending the evening hours under the roof of the haunted corntower she toiled all the other hours through from the earliest time that the first flush of day lightened the starlit skies did not he toil too but when the sun set she claimed her freedom and her taskmaster did not dare to say her nay a new and wondrous and exquisite life was shortly opening to her the life of the imagination all these many years since the last song of phratos had died off her ear never again to be heard she had spent with no more culture and with no more pleasure than the mule had that she led with his load along the miry ways in the sharp wintertime yet even through that utter neglect and that torpor of thought and feeling some wild natural fancy had been awake in her some vague sense stir that brought to her in the rustle of leaves in the sound of waters the curling breath of mists the white birth of lilies in all the notes and hues of the openair world a mystery and a loveliness that they did not bear for any of those around her now in the words that arslan cast to heroften as idly and indifferently as a man casts bread to frozen birds on snow birds that he pities and yet cares nothing forthe old religions the old beliefs became to her living truths and divine companions the perplexities of the world grew little clearer to her indeed and the miseries of the animal creation no less hideous a mystery the confusion of all things was in nowise clearer to her even it might be they deepened and grew more entangled he could imbue her with neither credulity nor contentment for he possessed neither and despised both as the fools paradise of those who having climbed a sandhill fancy that they have ascended zion the weariness the unrest the desire the contempt of such a mind as his can furnish anodynes neither to itself nor any other but such possessions and consolationsand these are limitlessas the imagination can create he placed within her reach before she had dreameddreamed all through the heaviness of toil and the gall of tyranny but she had dreamed as a goatherd may upon a mistswept hill by the western seas while all the earth is dark and only its dim fugitive waking sounds steal dully on the drowsy ear but now through the myths and parables which grew familiar to her ear she dreamed almost as poets dream bathed in the full flood of a setting sun on the wild edge of the campagna a light in which all common things of daily life grow glorious and through whose rosy hues the only sound that comes is some rich dulcet bell that slowly swings in all the majesty and melody of prayer the land was no more to her only a hard and cruel place of labor and butchery in which all creatures suffered and were slain all things rose to have their story and their symbol for her nature remaining to her that one sure solace and immeasurable mystery which she had feebly felt it even in her childhood was brought closer to her and made fuller of compassion all the forms and voices of the fair dead years of the world seemed to grow visible and audible to her with those marvelous tales of the old heroic age which little by little he unfolded to her in the people around her and in their faiths she had no belief she wanted a faith and found one in all these strange sweet stories of a perished time she had never thought that there had been any other generation before that which was present on earth with her any other existence than this narrow and sordid one which encircled her that men had lived who had fashioned those aerial wonders of the tall cathedral spires and stained those vivid hues in its ancient casements had been a fact too remote to be known to her though for twelve years her eyes had gazed at them in reverence of their loveliness through arslan the exhaustless annals of the worlds history opened before her the present ceased to matter to her in its penury and pain for the treasuryhouses of the golden past were opened to her sight most of all she loved the myths of the homeric and hesiodic ages and every humble and homely thing became ennobled to her and enriched beholding it through the halo of poetry and tradition when aloft in the red and white appleblossoms two sparrows pecked and screamed and spent the pleasant summer hours above in the flowerscented air in shrill dispute and sharp contention she thought that she heard in all their noisy notes the arrogant voices of alcyone and cyx when the wild hyacinths made the ground purple beneath the poplars and the pines she saw in them the transformed loveliness of one who had died in the fullness of youth at play in a summers noon and died content because stricken by the hand of the greatest and goodliest of all gods the god that loved him best as the cattle with their sleek red hides and curling horns came through the fogs of the daybreak across the level meadows and through the deep dockleaves they seemed to her no more the mere beasts of stall and share but even as the milkwhite herds that grazed of yore in the blest pastures of pieria all night in the heart of the orchards when the song of the nightingales rose on the stillness it was no longer for her a little brown bird that sang to the budding fruit and the closed daisies but was the voice of aedon bewailing her son through the ages or the woe of philomela crying through the wilderness when through the white hard brilliancy of noonday the swift swallow darted down the beams of light she saw no longer in it an insecthunter a housenesting creature but saw the shape of procne slaughterhaunted seeking rest and finding none and when she went about her labors hewing wood drawing water bearing the corn to the grindstones leading the mules to the millstream she ceased to despair for she had heard the old glad story of the children of zeus who dwelt so long within a herdsmans hut nameless and dishonored yet lived to go back crowned to thebes and see the beasts of the desert and the stones of the streets rise up and obey the magic of their song arslan in his day had given many evil gifts but this one gift that he gave was pure and full of solace this gift of the beauty of the past imperfect obscure broken in fragments obscured by her own ignorance it was indeed when it reached her yet it came with a glory that time could not dim and a consolation that ignorance could not impair chapter vi what has come to that evil one she walks the land as though she were a queen the people of ypres said to one another watching the creature they abhorred as she went through the town to the riverstair or to the marketstall she seemed to them transfigured a perpetual radiance shone in the dark depths of her eyes a proud elasticity replaced the old sullen defiance of her carriage her face had a sweet musing mystery and dreaminess on it and when she smiled her smile was soft and sudden like the smile of one who bears fair tidings in her heart unspoken even those people dull and plodding and taciturn absorbed in their small trades or in their continual field labor were struck by the change in her and looked after her and listened in a stupid wonder to the sonorous songs in an unknown tongue that rose so often on her lips as she strode among the summer grasses or led the laden mules through the fords they saw even with their eyes purblind from hate that she had thrown off their yoke and had escaped from their narrow world and was happy with some rich mute nameless happiness that they could neither evade nor understand the fall of evening always brought her to him he let her come finding a certain charm in that savage temper which grew so tame to him in that fierce courage which to him was so humble in that absolute ignorance which was yet so curiously blended with so strong a power of fancy and so quick an instinct of beauty but he let her go again with indifference and never tried by any word to keep her an hour later than she chose to stay she was to him like some handsome dangerous beast that flew at all others and crouched to him he had a certain pleasure in her color and her grace in making her great eyes glow and seeing the light of awakening intelligence break over all her beautiful clouded fierce face as she learned too to hear more often the sound of her own voice and to use a more varied and copious language a rude eloquence came naturally to her and when her silence was broken it was usually for some terse vivid picturesque utterance which had an artistic interest for him in this simple and monotonous province with its tedious sameness of life and its green arable country that tired the sight fed in youth on the grandeur of cloudreaching mountains and the tumults of icetossing seas this creature so utterly unlike her kind so golden with the glow of tawny desert suns and so strong with the liberty and the ferocity and the dormant passion and the silent force of some free forest animal was in a way welcome all things too were so new and strange to her all common knowledge was so utterly unknown to her all other kinds of life were so unintelligible to her and yet with all her ignorance she had so swift a fancy so keen an irony so poetic an instinct that it seemed to him when he spoke with her that he talked with some creature from another planet than his own he liked to make her smile he liked to make her suffer he liked to inflame to wound to charm to tame her he liked all these without passion rather with curiosity than with interest much as he had liked in the season of his boyhood to ruffle the plumage of a captured seabird to see its eye sparkle and then grow dull and flash again with pain and then at the last turn soft with weary wistful tenderness having been taught at once the misery of bondage and the tyranny of a human love she was a bronzed barefooted fleetlimbed young outcast he told himself with the scowl of an habitual defiance on her straight brows and the curl of an untamable scorn upon her rich red lips and a curious sovereignty and savageness in her dauntless carriage and yet there was a certain nobility and melancholy in her that made her seem like one of a great and fallen race and in her eyes there was a look repellant yet appealing and lustrous with sleeping passion that tempted him to wake what slumbered there but in these early springtide days he suffered her to come and go as she listed without either persuasion or forbiddance on his own part the impassioned reverence which she had for the things he had created was only the untutored unreasoning reverence of the barbarian or of the peasant but it had a sweetness for him he had been alone so long and so long had passed since any cheek had flushed and any breast had heaved under the influence of any one of those strange fancies and noble stories which he had pictured on the walls of his lonely chamber he had despaired of and despised himself despised his continual failure had despaired of all power to sway the souls and gain the eyes of his fellowmen it was a little thinga thing so little that he called himself a fool for taking any count of it yet the hot tears that dimmed the sight of this young barbarian who was herself of no more value than the milldust that drifted on the breeze the soft vague breathless awe that stole upon her as she gazed at the colorless shadows in which his genius had spent itselfthese were sweet to him with a sweetness that made him ashamed of his own weakness she had given the breath of life back to his body by an act of which he was ignorant and now she gave back the breath of hope to his mind by a worship which he contemned even whilst he was glad of it meanwhile the foul tongues of her enemies rang with loud glee over this new shame which they could cast at her she has found a loverohhothat brown wicked thing a lover meet for hera man who walks abroad in the moonless nights and plucks the mandrake and worships the devil and paints people in their own likeness so that as the color dries the life wastesso the women screamed after her often as she went she nothing understanding or heeding but lost in the dreams of her own waking imagination at times such words as these reached claudis flamma but he turned a deaf ear to them he had the wisdom of the world in him though he was only an old miller who had never stirred ten leagues from his home and whilst the devil served him well he quarreled not with the devil in a grim way it was a pleasure to him to think that the thing he hated might be accursed body and soul he had never cared either for her body or her soul so that the first worked for him the last might destroy itself in its own darknesshe had never stretched a finger to hold it back the pride and the honesty and the rude candor and instinctive purity of this young life of hers had been a perpetual hinderance and canker to him begotten of evil by all the laws of justice in evil she should live and die so flamma reasoned and to the sayings of his countryside he gave a stony ear and a stony glance she never once after the first day breathed a word to arslan of the treatment that she received at ypres it was not in her nature to complain and she abhorred even his pity whatever she endured she kept silence on it when he asked her how her grandsire dealt with her she always answered him it is well enough with me now he cared not enough for her to doubt her and in a manner she had learned how to keep her tyrant at bay he did not dare to lay hands on her now that her eyes had got that new fire and her voice that stern serene contempt his wolf cub had shown her teeth at last at the lash and he did not venture to sting her to revolt with too long use of scourge and chain so she obtained more leisure and what she did not spend in arslans tower she spent in acquiring another artshe learned to read there was an old herbseller in the marketplace who was not so harsh to her as the others were but who had now and then for her a rough kindly word out of gentleness to the memory of reine flamma this woman was better educated than most and could even write a little to her follefarine went see here she said you are feeble and i am strong i know every nook and corner in the woods i know a hundred rare herbs that you never find i will bring you a basketful of them twice in each week if you will show me how to read those signs that the people call letters the old woman hesitated it were as much as my life is worth to have you seen with me the lads will stone my window still the wish for the rare herbs and the remembrance of the fatigue that would be spared to her rheumatic body by compliance prevailed over her fears she consented three times a week follefarine rose while it was still dark and scoured the wooded lands and the mossgreen orchards and the little brooks in the meadows in search of every herb that grew she knew those green places which had been her only kingdom and her only solace as no one else knew them and the old dames herbstall was the envy and despair of all the marketplace now and then a laborer earlier than the rest or a vagrant sleeping under a hedgerow saw her going through the darkness with her green bundle on her head or stooping among the watercourses ankledeep in rushes and he crossed himself and went and told how he had seen the evil spirit of ypres gathering the poisonweeds that made ships founder and strong men droop and die and women love unnatural and horrible things and all manner of woe and sickness overtake those she hated often too at this lonely time before the day broke she met arslan it was his habit to be abroad when others slept studies of the night and its peculiar loveliness entered largely into many of his paintings the beauty of water rippling in the moonbeam of gray reeds blowing against the first faint red of dawn of dark fields with sleeping cattle and folded sheep of dreamy pools made visible by the shine of their folded white liliesthese were all things he cared to study the earth has always most charm and least pain to the poet or the artist when men are hidden away under their roofs they do not then break its calm with either their mirth or their brutality the vile and revolting coarseness of their works only built to blot it with so much deformity is softened and obscured in the purple breadths of shadow and the dim tender gleam of stars and it was thus that arslan loved best to move abroad sometimes the shepherd going to his flocks or the housewife opening her shutter in the wayside cabin or the huckster driving early his mule seawards to meet the fish that the nighttrawlers had brought saw them together thus and talked of it and said that these two accursed of all honest folk were after some unholy workcoming from the orgy of some witches sabbath or seeking some devils root that would give them the treasured gold of misers tombs or the power of life and death for these things are still believed by many a peasants hearth and whispered darkly as night closes in and the wind rises wading in the shallow streams with the breeze tossing her hair and the dew bright on her sheaf of herbs follefarine paid thus the only wages she could for learning the art of letters the acquisition was hard and hatefula dull plodding task that she detested and her teacher was old and ignorant of all the grace and the lore of books she could only learn too at odd snatches of time with the cabinwindow barred up and the light shut out for the old peasant was fearful of gaining a bad name among her neighbors if she were seen in communion with the wicked thing of ypres still she the child persevered and before long possessed herself of the rudiments of letters though she had only one primer to learn from that belonged to the herbsellera rude old tattered pamphlet recounting the life and death of catherine of siena it was not that she had cared to read for readings sake books she heard only told the thoughts and the creeds of the human race and she cared nothing to know these but one day he had said to her half unconsciously if only you were not so ignorantand since that day she had set herself to clear away her ignorance little by little as she would have cleared brushwood with her hatchet it was the sweetest hour she had ever known when she was able to stand before him and say the characters that men print are no longer riddles to me he praised her and she was glad and proud it was love that had entered into her but a great and noble love full of intense humility of supreme selfsacrificea love that unconsciously led her to chasten into gentleness the fierce soul in her and to try and seek light for the darkness of her mind he saw the influence he had on her but he was careless of it a gipsychild working for bread at a little millhouse in these norman woodswhat use would be to her beauty of thought grace of fancy the desire begotten of knowledge the poetry learned from the past still he gave her these partly because he pitied her partly because in his exhaustion and solitude this creature in her beauty and her submission was welcome to him and yet he thought so little of her and chiefly when he thought of her chose to perplex her or to wound her that he might see her eyes dilate in wondering amaze or her face quiver and flush and then grow dark with the torment of a mute and subdued pain she was a study to him as was the scarlet rose in the gardenways or the purplebreasted pigeon in the woods he dealt with her as he would have dealt with the flower or the bird if he had wished to study them more nearly by tearing the rose open at its core or casting a stone at the bluerock on the wing this was not cruelty in him it was only habithabit and the callousness begotten by his own continual pain the pain as of a knife forever thrust into the loins of a cord forever knotted hard about the temples which is the daily and nightly penalty of those mad enough to believe that they have the force in them to change the sluggard appetites and the hungry cruelties of their kind into a life of high endeavor and divine desire he held that a mans chief passion is his destiny and will shape his fate roughhew his fate as circumstance or as hazard may his chief his sole passion was a great ambitiona passion pure as crystal since the eminence he craved was for his creations not for his name yet it had failed to compel the destiny that he had believed to be his own and yet every hour he seemed to sink lower and lower into oblivion further and further from the possibility of any fulfillment of his dreams and the wasted years of his life fell away one by one into the gulf of the past vain unheard unfruitful as the frozen words on the deck of the ship of pantagruel what is the use he muttered half aloud one day before his paintings what is the use if i die tomorrow they will sell for so much rubbish to heat a bakery store it is only a mad waste of hourswaste of color of canvas of labor the world has told me so many years the world always knows what it wants it selects unerringly it must know better than i do the man is a fool indeed who presumes to be wiser than all his generation if the world will have nothing to do with you go and hang yourselfor if you fear to do that dig a ditch as a grave for a daily meal give over dreams the world knows what it wants and if it wanted you would take you it has brazen lungs to shout for what it needs the lungs of a multitude it is no use what your own voice whispers you unless those great lungs also shout before you hosannah so he spoke to himself in bitterness of soul standing before his cartoons into which he had thrown all the genius there was in him and which hung there unseen save by the spider that wove and the moth that flew over them follefarine who was that day in his chamber looked at him with the wistful farreaching comprehension which an unerring instinct taught her of a winter night she said slowly i have heard old pitchou read aloud to flamma and she read of their god the one they hang everywhere on the crosses here and the story was that the populace scourged and nailed to death the one whom they knew afterwards when too late to have been the great man they looked for and that then being bidden to make their choice of one to save they choose to ransom and honor a thief one called barabbas is it trueif the worlds choice were wrong once why not twice arslan smiled the smile she knew so well and which had no more warmth than the ice floes of his native seas why not twice why not a thousand times a thief has the worlds sympathies always it is always the barabbasthe trickster in talent the forger of stolen wisdom the bravo of political crime the huckster of plundered thoughts the charlatan of false art whom the vox populi elects and sets free and sends on his way rejoicing will ye have christ or barabbas every generation is asked the same question and every generation gives the same answer and scourges the divinity out of its midst and finds its idol in brute force and low greed she only dimly comprehended not well knowing why her words had thus roused him she pondered awhile then her face cleared but the end she asked the dead god is the god of all these people round us now and they have built great places in his honor and they bow when they pass his likeness in the highway or the marketplace but with barabbaswhat was the end it seems that they loathe and despise him arslan laughed a little his end in syria maybe the vultures picked his bones where they lay whitening on the plainsthose times were primitive the world was young but in our day barabbas lives and dies in honor and has a tomb that stares all men in the face setting forth his virtues so that all who run may read in our day barabbasthe barabbas of money greeds and delicate cunning and the theft which has risen to science and the assassination that destroys souls and not bodies and the crime that deals moral death and not material deathour barabbas who is crowned fraud in the place of mailed forcelives always in purple and fine linen and ends in the odor of sanctity with the prayers of priests over his corpse he spoke with a certain fierce passion that rose in him whenever he thought of that world which had rejected him and had accepted so many others weaker in brain and nerve but stronger in one sense because more dishonest and as he spoke he went straight to a wall on his right where a great sea of gray paper was stretched untouched and ready to his hand she would have spoken but he made a motion to silence hush be quiet he said to her almost harshly i have thought of something and he took the charcoal and swept rapidly with it over the dull blank surface till the vacancy glowed with life a thought had kindled in him a vision had arisen before him the scene around him vanished utterly from his sight the gray stone walls the square windows through which the fading sunrays fell the level pastures and sullen streams and pallid skies without all faded away as though they had existed only in a dream all the empty space about him became peopled with many human shapes that for him had breath and being though no other eye could have beheld them the old syrian world of eighteen hundred years before arose and glowed before him the things of his own life died away and in their stead he saw the fierce flame of eastern suns the gleaming range of marble palaces the purple flush of pomegranate flowers the deep color of oriental robes the soft silver of hills olivecrested the tumult of a city at high festival and he could not rest until all he thus saw in his vision he had rendered as far as his hand could render it and what he drew was this a great thirsty heated seething crowd a crowd that had manhood and womanhood age and infancy youths and maidens within its ranks a crowd in whose faces every animal lust and every human passion were let loose a crowd on which a noonday sun without shadow streamed a sun which parched and festered and engendered all corruption in the land on which it looked this crowd was in a city a city on whose flat roofs the myrtle and the cystus bloomed above whose gleaming marble walls the silver plumes of olives waved upon whose distant slopes the darkling cedar groves rose straight against the sky and on whose lofty temple plates of gold glistened against the shining heavens this crowd had scourges and stones and goads in their hands and in their midst they had one clothed in white whose head was thorncrowned and whose eyes were filled with a gods pity and a mans reproach and him they stoned and lashed and hooted and triumphant in the throng whose choice he was seated aloft upon mens shoulders with a purple robe thrown on his shoulders there sat a brawny grinning bloated jibbering thing with curled lips and savage eyes and satyrs leer the creature of greed of lust of obscenity of brutality of avarice of desire this man the people followed rejoicing exceedingly content in the guide whom they had chosen victorious in the fiend for whom they spurned a deity crying with wideopen throats and brazen lungsbarabbas there was not a form in all this closedpacked throng which had not a terrible irony in it which was not in itself a symbol of some lust or of some vice for which women and men abjure the godhead in them one gorged drunkard lay asleep with his amphora broken beneath him the stream of the purple wine lapped eagerly by ragged children a moneychanger had left the receipt of custom eager to watch and shout and a thief clutched both hands full of the forsaken coins and fled a miser had dropped a bag of gold and stopped to catch at all the rolling pieces regardless in his greed how the crowd trampled and trod on him a mother chid and struck her little brown curly child because he stretched his arms and turned his face towards the thorncrowned captive a priest of the temple with a bloodstained knife thrust in his girdle dragged beside him by the throat a little tender lamb doomed for the sacrifice a dancingwoman with jewels in her ears and half naked to the waist sounding the brazen cymbals above her head drew a score of youths after her in barabbas train on one of the flat rooftops reclining on purple and fine linen looking down on the street below from the thick foliage of her citron boughs and her red syrian roses was an egyptian wanton and leaning beside her tossing golden apples into her bosom was a young centurion of the roman guard languid and laughing with his fair chest bare to the heat and his armor flung in a pile beside him and thus in like manner every figure bore its parable whilst above all was the hard hot cruel cloudless sky of blue without one faintest mist to break its horrible serenity and high in the azure ether and against the sun an eagle and a vulture fought locked close and tearing at each others breasts six nights the conception occupied himhis days were not his own he spent them in a rough mechanical labor which his strength executed while his mind was far away from it but the nights were all his and at the end of the sixth night the thing arose perfect as far as his hand could perfect it begotten by a chance and ignorant word as have been many of the greatest works the world has seenoaks sprung from the acorn that a careless child has let fall when he had finished it his arm dropped to his side he stood motionless the red glow of the dawn lighting the dreamy depths of his sleepless eyes he knew that his work was good the artist for one moment of ecstasy realizes the content of a god when resting from his labors he knows that those labors have borne their full fruit it is only for a moment the greater the artist the more swiftly will discontent and misgiving overtake him the more quickly will the feebleness of his execution disgust him in comparison with the splendor of his ideal the more surely will hethough the world ring with applause of himbe enraged and derisive and impatient at himself but while the moment lasts it is a rapture keen pure intense surpassing every other in it fleeting though it be he is blessed with a blessing that never falls on any other creature the work of his brain and of his hand contents himit is the purest joy on earth arslan knew that joy as he looked on the vast imagination for which he had given up sleep and absorbed in which he had almost forgotten hunger and thirst and the passage of time he had known no rest until he had embodied the shapes that pursued him he had scarcely spoken barely slumbered an hour tired out consumed with restless fever weak from want of sleep and neglect of food he had worked on and on and on until the vision as he had beheld it lived there recorded for the world that denied him as he looked on it he felt his own strength and was glad he had faith in himself though he had faith in no other thing he ceased to care what other fate befell him so that only this supreme power of creation remained with him his lamp died out the bell of a distant clock chimed the fourth hour of the passing night the day broke in the east beyond the gray levels of the fields and plains the dusky crimson of the dawn rose over the cool dark skies the light of the morning stars came in and touched the visage of his fettered christ all the rest was in shadow he himself remained motionless before it he knew that in it lay the best achievement the highest utterance the truest parable that the genius in him had ever conceived and put forthand he knew too that he was as powerless to raise it to the public sight of men as though he were stretched dead beneath it he knew that there would be none to heed whether it rotted there in the dust or perished by moth or by flame unless indeed some illness should befall him and it should be taken with the rest to satisfy some petty debt of bread or oil or fuel there on that wall he had written with all the might there was in him his warning to the age in which he lived his message to future generations his claims to mens remembrance after death and there were none to see none to read none to believe great things beautiful things things of wisdom things of grace things terrible in their scorn and divine in their majesty rose up about him incarnated by his mind and his handand their doom was to fade and wither without leaving one human mind the richer for their story one human soul the nobler for their meaning to the humanity around him they had no value save such value of a few coins as might lie in them to liquidate some miserable scare at the bakehouse or the oilshop in the streets of the town a year of labor and the cartoon could be transferred to the permanent life of the canvas and he was a master of color and loved to wrestle with its intricacies as the mariner struggles with the storm but what were the use he pondered as he stood there what the use to be at pains to give it its full life on canvas no man will ever look on it all labors of his art were dear to him and none wearisome yet he doubted what it would avail to commence the perpetuation of this work on canvas if the world were never to know that it existed it would be as well to leave it there on its gray sea of paper to be moved to and fro with each wind that blew through the broken rafters and to be brushed by the wing of the owl and the flittermouse the door softly unclosed he did not hear it across the chamber follefarine stole noiselessly she had come and gone thus a score of times through those six nights of his vigil and he had seldom seen her never spoken to her now and then she had touched him and placed before him some simple meal of herbs and bread and he had taken it half unconsciously and drunk great draughts of water and turned back again to his work not noticing that she had brought to him what he sorely needed and yet would not of himself have remembered she came to him without haste and without sound and stood before him and lookedlooked with all her soul in her awed eyes the dawn was brighter now red and hazy with curious faint gleams of radiance from the sun that as yet was not risen all the light there was fell on the crowd of jerusalem one ray white and pure fell upon the bowed head of the bound god she stood and gazed at it she had watched it all grow gradually into being from out the chaos of dull spaces and confused lines this art which could call life from the dry wastes of wood and paper and shed perpetual light where all was darkness was even to her an alchemy incomprehensible immeasurable a thing not to be criticised or questioned but adored in all its unscrutable and majestic majesty to her it could not have been more marvelous if his hand had changed the riversand to gold or his touch wakened the dead cornflowers to bloom afresh as living asphodels but now for once she forgot the sorcery of the art in the terror and the pathos of the story that it told now for once she forgot in the creation its creator all she saw was the face of the christthe pale bent face in whose eyes there was a patience so perfect a pity so infinite a reproach that had no wrath a scorn that had no cruelty she had hated the christ on the cross because he was the god of the people she hated and in whose name they reviled her but this christ moved her strangelythere in the light alone betrayed and forsaken while the crowd rushed on lauding barabbas ignorant though she was the profound meanings of the parable penetrated her with their ironies and with their woethe parable of the genius rejected and the thief exalted she trembled and was silent and in her eyes sudden tears swam they have talked of their godoftenso often she muttered but i never knew till now what they meant arslan turned and looked at her he had not known that she was there is it so he said slowly wellthe world refuses me fame but i do not know that the world could give me a higher tribute than your admiration the world she echoed with her eyes still fastened on the head of the christ and the multitudes that flocked after barabbas the world you care for the worldyouwho have painted that arslan did not answer her he felt the rebuke he had drawn the picture in all its deadly irony in all its pitiless truth only himself to desire and strive for the wine streams and the painted harlotry and the showers of gold and the false gods of a worldly success was he a renegade to his own religion a skeptic of his own teaching it was not for the first time that the dreamy utterances of this untrained and imperfect intelligence had struck home to the imperious and mature intellect of the man of genius he flung his charcoal away and looked at the sun as it rose even i he answered her we who call ourselves poets or painters can see the truth and can tell itwe are prophets so farbut when we come down from our horeb we hanker for the fleshpots and the dancingwomen and the bags of gold like all the rest we are no better than those we preach to perhaps we are worse our eyes are set to the light but our feet are fixed in the mire she did not hear him and had she heard would not have comprehended her eyes were still fastened on the christ and the blood in her cheeks faded and glowed at every breath she drew and in her eye there was the wistful wondering trustful reverence which shone in those of the child who breaking from his mothers arms and regardless of the soldiers stripes clung to the feet of the scourged captive and there kneeled and prayed without looking at her arslan went out to his daily labor on the waters the sun had fully risen the day was red and clear the earth was hushed in perfect stillness the only sounds there were came from the wings and voices of innumerable birds and yet i desire nothing for myself he thought i would lie down and die tomorrow gladly did i know that they would live yet he knew that to desire a fame after death was as idle as to desire with a childs desire the stars for the earth is crowded full with clay gods and false prophets and fresh legions forever arriving to carry on the old strife for supremacy and if a man pass unknown all the time that his voice is audible and his hand visible through the sound and smoke of the battle he will dream in vain of any remembrance when the gates of the grave shall have closed on him and shut him forever from sight when the world was in its youth it had leisure to garner its recollections even to pause and look back and to see what flower of a fair thought what fruit of a noble art it might have overlooked or left downtrodden but now it is so old and is so tired it is purblind and heavy of foot it does not notice what it destroys it desires rest and can find none nothing can matter greatly to it its dead are so many that it cannot count them and being thus worn and dulled with age and suffocated under the weight of its innumerable memories it is very slow to be moved and swiftterribly swiftto forget why should it not be it has known the best it has known the worst that ever can befall it and the prayer which to the heart of a man seems so freshly born from his own desire what is it on the weary ear of the world save the same old old cry that it has heard through all the ages empty as the sound of the wind and foreverforever unanswered chapter vii one day while the year was still young though the first thunderheats of the early summer had come he asked her to go with him to the sea ere the sun set the sea she repeated what is that is it possible that you do not know he asked in utter wonder you who have lived all these years within two leagues of it i have heard often of it she said simply but i cannot tell what it is the man has never yet lived who could tellin fit language poseidon is the only one of all the old gods of hellas who still lives and reigns we will go to his kingdom sight is better than speech so he took her along the slow course of the inland water through the osiers and the willows down to where the slow river ripples would meet the swift salt waves it was true what she had said that she had never seen the sea her errands had always been to and fro between the mill and the quay in the town no farther she had exchanged so little communion with the people of the district that she knew nothing of whither the barges went that took away the corn and fruit nor whence the big boats came that brought the coals and fish when she had a little space of leisure to herself she had wandered indeed but never so far as the shore almost always in the woods and the meadows never where the river widening as it ran spread out between level banks until touching the sea it became a broad estuary she had heard speak of the sea indeed as of some great highway on which men traveled incessantly to and fro as of something unintelligible remote belonging to others indifferent and alien to herself when she had thought of it at all she had only thought of it as probably some wide canal black with mud and dust and edged by dull pathways slippery and toilsome along which tired horses towed heavy burdens all day long that men and women might be thereby enriched of the beauty and the mystery of the infinite sweetness and solace of the sea she knew no more than she knew of any loveliness or of any pity in human nature a few leagues off where the stream widened into a bay and was hemmed in by sandbanks in lieu of its flat green pastures there was a little fishingtown built under the great curve of beetling cliffs and busy with all the stir and noise of mart and wharf there the sea was crowded with many masts and ruddy with redbrown canvas and the air was full of the salt scent of rotting seaweed of stiff sails spread out to dry of great shoals of fish poured out upon the beach and of dusky noisome cabins foul smelling and made hideous by fishwives oaths and the deathscreams of scalded shellfish he did not take her thither he took her half way down the stream whilst it was still sleepily beautiful with pale gray willows and green meadowland and acres of silvery reeds and here and there some quaint old steeple or some applehidden roofs on either side its banks but midway he left the water and stretched out across the country she beside him moving with that rapid lithe and staglike ease of limbs that have never known restraint some few people passed them on their way a child taking the cliffroad to his home under the rocks with a big blue pitcher in his bands an old man who had a fishingbrig at sea and toiled up there to look for her with a gray dog at his heels and the smell of salt water in his clothes a goatherd clad in rough skins wool outward and killing birds with stones as he went a woman with a blue skirt and scarlet hose and a bundle of boughs and brambles on her head with here and there a stray winter berry glowing red through the tender green leafage all these looked askance at them and the goatherd muttered a curse and the woman a prayer and gave them wide way through the stunted furze for they were both of them accursed in the peoples sight you find it hard to live apart from your kind he asked her suddenly as they gained the fields where no human habitation at all was left and over which in the radiance of the still sunlit skies there hung the pale crescent of a weekold moon to live apartshe did not understand yeslike this to have no child smile no woman gossip no man exchange goodmorrow with you is it any sorrow to you her eyes flashed through the darkness fiercely what does it matter it is best so one is free one owes nothingnot so much as a fair word that is well i think it is wellif one is strong enough for it it wants strength i am strong she spoke quietly with the firm and simple consciousness of force which has as little of vanity in it as it has of weakness to live apart she said after a pause in which he had not answered i know what you meannow it is wellit was well with those men you tell me of when the world was young who left all other men and went to live with the watercourse and the wild dove and the rose and the palm and the great yellow desert was it not well so well with them that men worshiped them for it but there is no such worship now the cities are the kingdom of heaven not the deserts and he who hankers for the wilderness is stoned in the streets as a fool and how should it be well with you who have neither wild rose nor wild dove for compensation but are only beaten and hooted and hated and despised her eyes glittered through the darkness and her voice was hard and fierce as she answered him see herethere is a pretty golden thing in the west road of the town who fears me horribly yvonne the pottery painters daughter she says to her father at evening i must go read the offices to old mother margot and he says go my daughter piety and reverence of age are twin blossoms on one stem of a tree that grows at the right hand of god in paradise and she goes not to margot but to a little booth where there is dancing and singing and brawling that her father has forbade her to go near by a league there is an old man at the corner of the marketplace ryno the fruitseller who says that i am accursed and spits out at me as i pass he says to the people as they go by his stall see these peaches they are smooth and rosy as a childs cheek sweet and firm not their like betwixt this and paris i will let you have them cheap so cheap i need sorely to send money to my sick son in africa and the people pay greedily and when the peaches are home they see a little black speck in each of them and all save their bloom is rottenness there is a woman who makes lace at the window of the house against the fourth gate marion silvis she is white and sleek and blueeyed the priests honor her and she never misses a mass she has an old blind mother whom she leaves in her room she goes out softly at nightfall and she slips to a wineshop full of soldiers and her lovers kiss her on the mouth and the old mother sits moaning and hungry at home and a night ago she was badly burned being alone nowis it well or no to be hated of those people if i had loved them and they me i might have become a liar and have thieved and have let men kiss me likewise she spoke with thoughtful and fierce earnestness not witting of the caustic in her own words meaning simply what she said and classing the kisses of men as some sort of weakness and vileness like those of a theft and a lie as she had come to do out of a curious proud true instinct that was in her and not surely from the teaching of any creature she in her way loved the man who walked beside her but it was a love of which she was wholly unconscious a pity a sorrow a reverence a passion a deification all combined that had little or nothing in common with the loves of human kind and which still left her speech as free and her glance as fearless with him as with any other he knew that and he did not care to change it it was singular and gave her half her charm of savageness and innocence commingled he answered her merely with a smile you are only a barbarian how should you understand that the seductions of civilization lie in its multiplications of the forms of vice men would not bear its yoke an hour if it did not in return facilitate their sins you are an outcast from itso you have kept your hands honest and your lips pure you may be right to be thankfuli would not pretend to decide at leasti would not be as they are she answered him with a curl of the mouth and a gleam in her eyes the pride of the old nomadic tribes whose blood was in her asserting itself against the claimed superiority of the tamed and hearthbound racesblood that ran free and fearless to the measure of boundless winds and rushing waters that made the forest and the plain the dawn and the darkness the flight of the wild roe and the hidingplace of the wood pigeon dearer than any rooftree sweeter than any nuptial bed she had left the old life so longso long that even her memories of it were dim as dreams and its language had died off her lips in all save the broken catches of her songs but the impulses of it were in her vivid and ineradicable and the scorn with which the cowed and timid races of hearth and of homestead regarded her she the daughter of taric gave back to them in tenfold measure i would not be as they are she repeated her eyes glancing through the sunshine of the cloudless day to sit and spin to watch their souppot boil to spend their days under a close roof to shut the stars out and cover themselves in their beds as swine do with their straw in the sty to huddle all together in thousands fearing to do what they will lest the tongue of their neighbor wag evil of it to cheat a little and steal a little and lie always when the false word serves them and to mutter to themselves god will wash us free of our sins and then to go and sin again stealthily thinking men will not see and sure that their god will give them a quittancethat is their life i would not be as they are and her spirits rose and her earliest life in the liebana seemed to flash on her for one moment clear and bright through the veil of the weary years and she walked erect and swiftly through the gorse singing by his side the bold burden of one of the old sweet songs and for the first time the thought passed over arslan this tameless wild doe would crouch like a spaniel and be yoked as a beast of burdenif i chose whether or no he chose he was not sure she was beautiful in her way barbaric dauntless innocent savage he cared to hurt to please to arouse to study to portray her but to seek love from her he did not care and yet she was most lovely in her own wild fashion like a young desert mare or a seagull on the wing and he wondered to himself that he cared for her no more as he moved beside her through the thickets of the gorse and against the strong wind blowing from the sea there was so little passion left in him he had tossed aside the hair of dead women and portrayed the limbs and the features of living ones till that ruthless pursuit had brought its own penalty with it and the beauty of women scarcely moved him more than did the plumage of a bird or the contour of a marble his senses were drugged and his heart was dead it was well that it should be so he had taught himself to desire it and yet as they left the cliffroad for the pathless downs that led toward the summit of the rocks they passed by a wayside hut red with climbing creepers and all alone on the sandy soil like the little nest of a yellowhammer through its unclosed shutter the light of the sun streamed into it the interior was visible it was very poora floor of mud a couch of rushes a hearth on which a few dry sticks were burning walls lichencovered and dropping moisture before the sticks kneeling and trying to make them burn up more brightly to warm the one black pot that hung above them was a poor peasant girl and above her leaned a man who was her lover a fisher of the coast as poor as hardy and as simple as herself in the mans eye the impatience of love was shining and as she lifted her head after breathing with all her strength on the smoking sticks he bent and drew her in his arms and kissed her rosy mouth and the white lids that drooped over her bright blue smiling northern eyes she let the fuel lie still to blaze or smoulder as it would and leaned her head against him and laughed softly at his eagerness arslan glanced at them as he passed poor brutes he muttered yet how happy they are it must be well to be so easily content and to find a readymade fools paradise in a womans lips follefarine hearing him paused and looked also she trembled suddenly and walked on in silence a new light broke on her and dazzled her and made her afraid this forestborn creature who had never known what fear was the ground ascended as it stretched seaward but on it there were only wide dull fields of colza or of grass lying sickly and burning under the fire of the late afternoon sun the slope was too gradual to break their monotony above them was the cloudless weary blue below them was the faint parched green other color there was none one little dusky panting bird flew by pursued by a kite that was the only change she asked him no questions she walked mutely and patiently by his side she hated the dull heat the colorless waste the hard scorch of the air the dreary changelessness of the scene but she did not say so he had chosen to come to them a league onward the fields were merged into a heath uncultivated and covered with short prickly furze on the brown earth between the stunted bushes a few goats were cropping the burntup grasses here the slope grew sharper and the earth seemed to rise up between the sky and them steep and barren as a houseroof once he asked her are you tired she shook her head her feet ached and her heart throbbed her limbs were heavy like lead in the heat and the toil but she did not tell him so she would have dropped dead from exhaustion rather than have confessed to him any weakness he took the denial as it was given and pressed onward up the ascent the sun was slanting towards the west the skies seemed like brass the air was sharp yet scorching the dull brown earth still rose up before them like a wall they climbed it slowly and painfully their hands and their teeth filled with its dust that drifted in a cloud before them he bade her close her eyes and she obeyed him he stretched his arm out and drew her after him up the ascent that was slippery from drought and prickly from the stunted growth of furze on the summit he stood still and released her now look she opened her eyes with the startled halfquestioning stare of one led out from utter darkness into a full and sudden light then with a cry she sank down on the rock trembling weeping laughing stretching out her arms to the new glory that met her sight dumb with its grandeur delirious with its delight for what she saw was the sea before her dazzled sight all its beauty stretched the blueness of the waters meeting the blueness of the skies radiant with all the marvels of its countless hues softly stirred by a low wind that sighed across it bathed in a glow of gold that streamed on it from the westward rolling from north to south in slow sonorous measure filling the silent air with ceaseless melody the luster of the sunset beamed upon it the cool fresh smell of its water shot like new life through all the scorch and stupor of the day its white foam curled and broke on the brown curving rocks and wooded inlets of the shores innumerable birds that gleamed like silver floated or flew above its surface all was still still as death save only for the endless movement of those white swift wings and the susurrus of the waves in which all meaner and harsher sounds of earth seemed lost and hushed to slumber and to silence the sea alone reigned as it reigned in the sweet young years of the earth when men were not as maybe it will be its turn to reign again in the years to come when men and all their works shall have passed away and be no more seen nor any more remembered arslan watched her in silence he was glad that it should awe and move her thus the sea was the only thing for which he cared or which had any power over him in the northern winter of his youth he had known the ocean in one wild nights work undo all that men had done to check and rule it and burst through all the barriers that they had raised against it and throw down the stones of the altar and quench the fires of the hearth and sweep through the fold and the byre and flood the cradle of the child and the grave of the grandsire he had seen the storms wash away at one blow the corn harvests of years and gather in the sheep from the hills and take the life of the shepherd with the life of the flock he had seen it claim lovers locked in each others arms and toss the fair curls of the firstborn as it tossed the ribbonweeds of its deeps and he had felt small pity it had rather given him a sense of rejoicing and triumph to see the water laugh to scorn those who were so wise in their own conceit and bind beneath its chains those who held themselves masters over all beasts of the field and birds of the air other men dreaded the sea and cursed it but he in his way loved it almost with passion and could he have chosen the manner of his death would have desired that it should be by the sea and through the sea a death cold and serene and dreamily voluptuous a death on which no woman should look and in which no man should have share he watched her now for some time without speaking when the first paroxysm of her emotion had exhausted itself she stood motionless her figure like a statue of bronze against the sun her head sunk upon her breast her arms outstretched as though beseeching the wondrous brightness which she saw to take her to itself and make her one with it her whole attitude expressed an unutterable worship she was like one who for the first time hears of god what is it you feel he asked her suddenly he knew without asking but he had made it his custom to dissect all her joys and sufferings with little heed whether he thus added to either at the sound of his voice she started and a shiver shook her as she answered him slowly without withdrawing her gaze from the waters it has been there alwaysalwaysso near me before the land the sea was and i never knew her head drooped on her breast tears rolled silently down her checks her arms fell to her sides she shivered again and sighed she knew all she had lostthis is the greatest grief that life holds you never knew he made answer there was only a sandhill between you and all this glory but the sandhill was enough many people never climb theirs all their lives long the words and their meaning escaped her she had for once no remembrance of him nor any other sense save of this surpassing wonder which had thus burst on herthis miracle that had been near her for so long yet of which she had never in all her visions dreamed she was quite silent sunk there on her knees motionless and gazing straight with eyes unblenching at the light there was no sound near them nor was there anything in sight except where above against the deepest azure of the sky two curlews were circling around each other and in the distance a single ship was gliding with sails silvered by the sun all signs of human life lay far behind severed from them by those steep scorched slopes swept only by the plovers and the bees and all the while she looked the slow tears gathered in her eyes and fell and the loud hard beating of her heart was audible in the hushed stillness of the upper air he waited awhile then he spoke to her since it pains you come away a great sob shuddered through her give me that pain she muttered sooner than any joy pain painit is life heaven liberty for suddenly those words which she had heard spoken around her and which had been scarcely more to her than they were to the deaf and the dumb became real to her with a thousand meanings men use them unconsciously figuring by them all the marvels of their existence all the agonies of their emotions all the mysteries of their pangs and passions for which they have no other names even so she used them now in the tumult of awe in the torture of joy that possessed her arslan looked at her and let her be passionless himself except in the pursuit of his art the passions of this untrained and intense nature had interest for himthe cold interest of analysis and dissection not of sympathy as he portrayed her physical beauty scarcely moved by its flush of color and grace of mould so he pursued the development of her mind searchingly but with little pity and little tenderness the seagulls were lost in the heights of the air the ship sailed on into the light till the last gleam of its canvas vanished the sun sank westward lower and lower till it glowed in a globe of flame upon the edge of the water she never moved standing there on the summit of the cliff with her head dropped upon her breast her form thrown out dark and motionless against the gold of the western sky on her face still that look of one who worships with intense honor and passionate faith an unknown god the sun sank entirely leaving only a trail of flame across the heavens the waters grew gray and purple in the shadows one boat black against the crimson reflections of the west swept on swiftly with the inrushing tide the wind rose and blew long curls of seaweed on the rocks the shores of the bay were dimmed in a heavy mist through which the lights of the little hamlets dimly glowed and the distant voices of fishermen calling to each other as they drew in their deepsea nets came faint and weirdlike still she never moved the sea at her feet seemed to magnetize her and draw her to it with some unseen power she started again as arslan spoke this is but a landlocked bay he said with some contempt he who had seen the white aurora rise over the untraversed ocean of an arctic world and it lies quiet enough there like a duckpool in the twilight tell me why does it move you so she gave a heavy stifled sigh it looks so free and i on her there had vaguely come of late the feeling that she had only exchanged one tyranny for another that leaving the dominion of ignorance she had only entered into a slavery still sterner and more binding in every vein of her body there leaped and flashed and lived the old free blood of an ever lawless of an often criminal race and yet though with its instincts of rebellion so strong in her moving her to break all bonds and tear off all yokes she was the slave of a slavesince she was the slave of love this she did not know but its weight was upon her he heard with a certain pity he was bound himself in the chain of poverty and of the worlds forgetfulness and he had not even so much poor freedom as lies in the gilded imprisonment of fame it is not free was all he answered her it obeys the laws that govern it and cannot evade them its flux and reflux are not liberty but obediencejust such obedience to natural law as our life shows when it springs into being and slowly wears itself out and then perishes in its human form to live again in the motes of the air and the blades of the grass there is no such thing as liberty men have dreamed of it but nature has never accorded it the words passed coldly over her with her senses steeped in the radiance of light that divinity of calm that breadth of vision that trance of awe the chilliness and the bitterness of fact recoiled from off her intelligence unabsorbed as the cold raindrops roll off a rose it is so free she murmured regardless of his words if i had only knowni would have asked it to take me so long ago to float dead on itas that bird floatsit would be so quiet there and it would not fling me back i think it would have pity her voice was dreamy and gentle the softness of an indescribable desire was in it is it too late he said with that cruelty which characterized all his words to her can you have grown in love with life you live she said simply he was silent the brief innocent words rebuked him they said so clearly yet so unconsciously the influence that his life already had gained on hers whilst hers was to him no more than the brown seaweed was to the rock on which the waters tossed it let us go down he said abruptly at length it grows late with one longing backward look she obeyed him moving like a creature in a dream as she went away along the side of the cliff through the shadows while the goats lying down for their nights rest started and fled at the human footsteps chapter viii she was his absolute slave and he used his influence with little scruple whatever he told her she believed whatever he desired she obeyed with little effort he persuaded her that to lend her beauty to the purpose of his art was a sacrifice pure and supreme repaid it might be with immortality like the immortality of the mona lisa it was ever painful and even loathsome to her to give her beauty to the callous scrutiny and to the merciless imitations of art it stung the dignity and the purity that were inborn in this daughter of an outlawed people it wounded and hurt and humiliated her she knew that these things were only done that one day the eyes of thousands and of tens of thousands might gaze on them and the knowledge was hateful to her but as she would have borne wood or carried water for him as she would have denied her lips the least morsel of bread that his might have fed thereon as she would have gone straight to the rivers edge at his bidding and have stood still for the stream to swell and the floods to cover her so she obeyed him and let him make of her what he would he painted or sketched her in nearly every attitude and rendered her the center of innumerable stories he placed her form in the crowd of dancingwomen that followed after barabbas he took her for persephone as for phryne he couched her on the bleak rocks and the seasands on barren tenedos he made her beauty burn through the purple vines and the roses of silence of the venusberg he drew her as the fairest spirit fleeing with the autumn leaves in her streaming hair from the pursuit of his own storm god othyr he portrayed her as daphne with all her soft human form changing and merging into the bitter roots and the poisonous leaves of the laurel that was the fruit of passion he drew her as leonice whose venal lips yet being purified by a perfect love were sealed mute unto death and for loves sake spoke not he sketched her in a hundred shapes and for a hundred stories taking her wild deerlike grace and her supple mountainbred strength and her beauty which had all the richness and the freshness that sun and wind and rain and the dews of the nights can give taking these as he in other years had taken the bloom of the grape the blush of the seashell the red glow of the desert reed the fleeting glory of anything that by its life or by its death would minister to his dreams or his desires of all the studies he made from herhe all the while cold to her as any priest of old to the bird that he seethed in its blood on his altars of sacrificethose which were slightest of all yet of all pleased him best were those studies which were fullest of that ruthless and unsparing irony with which in every stroke of his pencil he cut as with a knife into the humanity he dissected in the first he painted her in all the warm dreaming palpitating slumber of youth asleep in a field of poppies thousands of brilliant blossoms were crushed under her slender pliant folded limbs the intense scarlet of the dreamflowers burned everywhere above beneath around her purple shadow and amber light contended for the mastery upon her her arms were lightly tossed above her head her mouth smiled in her dreams over her a butterfly flew spreading golden wings to the sun against her breast the great crimson cups of the flowers of sleep curled and glowed among them hiding and gibbering and glaring at her with an elfs eyes was the red mouse of the brockenthe one touch of pitiless irony of unsparing metaphor that stole like a snake through the hush and the harmony and the innocence of repose in the second there was still the same attitude the same solitude the same rest but the sleep was the sleep of death stretched on a block of white marble there were the same limbs but livid and lifeless and twisted in the contortions of a last agony there was the same loveliness but on it the hues of corruption already had stolen the face was still turned upward but the blank eyes stared hideously and the mouth was drawn back from teeth closely clinched upon the stone there lay a surgeons knife and a sculptors scalpel between her lips the red mouse sat watching mouthing triumphant all the beauty was left still but it was left ghastly discolored ruinedready for the mockery of the clay for the violation of the knifeready for the feast of the blind worm for the narrow home dug in darkness and in dust and these two pictures were so alike and yet so unlike so true to all the glory of youth so true to all the ghastliness of death that they were terrible they were terrible even to the man who drew them with so unsparing and unfaltering a hand only to her they were not terrible because they showed his power because they were his will and work she had no share in the shudder which even he felt at that visible presentiment of the corruption to which her beauty in its human perfection was destined since it pleasured him to do it that was all she cared she would have given her beauty to the scourge of the populace or to the fish of the sea at his bidding she had not asked him even what the red mouse meant she was content that he should deal with her in all things as he would that such portrayals of her were cruel she never once thought to her all others had been so brutal that the cruelties of arslan seemed sweet as the south wind to be for one instant a thing in the least wished for and endeared was to her a miracle so wonderful and so undreamt of that it made her life sublime to her is that all the devil has done for you cried the gardeners wife from the vinehung lattice leaning out while the boat from ypres went down the waterstreet beneath it were

saysooner or laterto every creature that lives again for him in his art follefarine beneath in the dense brown shadows cast from the timbers of the leaning houses raised her eyes the eyes smiled and yet they had a look in them that chilled even the mocking careless wanton temper of the woman who leaned above among the roses i have heard it she said simply as her oar broke the shadows and you have no fear i have no fear the gardeners wife laughed aloud the silver pins shaking in her yellow tresses wellthe devil gives strength no doubt but i will not say much for the devils wage a fine office he

cleave close to the saints and the angels henceforth though they do take all the gems and the gold and the lace for their altars and bestow so little in answer the boat had passed on with slow and even measure no words of derision which they could cast at her had power to move her any more than the fret of the ruffling rooks had power to move the cathedral spires around which they beat with their wings the empty air the old dull gray routine of perpetual toil was illumined and enriched if any reviled she heard not if any flung a stone at her she caught it and dropped it safely on the grass and went on with a glance of pardon when the children ran after her footsteps bawling and mouthing she turned and looked at them with a sweet dreaming tenderness in her eyes that rebuked them and held them silenced and afraid now she hated none nor could she envy any the women were welcome to their little joys of hearth and home they were welcome to look for their lovers across the fields with smiling eyes shaded from the sun or to beckon their infants from the dusky orchards to murmur fond foolish words and stroke the curls of flaxen downshe begrudged them nothing she too had her portion and her treasure she too knew the unutterable and mystical sweetness of a human joy base usage cannot make base a creature that gives itself nobly purely with unutterable and exhaustless love and whilst the people in the country round muttered at her for her vileness and disgrace she all unwitting and raised high above the reach of taunt and censure by a deep speechless joy that rendered hunger and labor and pain and brutal tasks and jibing glances indifferent to hernay unfeltwent on her daily ways with a light richer than the light of the sun in her eyes and in her step the noble freedom of one who has broken from bondage and entered into a heritage of grace she was proud as with the pride of one selected for some great dignity proud with the pride that a supreme devotion and a supreme ignorance made possible to her he was as a god to her and she had found favor in his sight although by all others despised to him she was beautiful a thing to be desired not abhorred to be caressed not cursed it seemed to her so wonderful that night and day in her heart she praised god for itthat dim unknown god of whom no man had taught her but yet whom she had vaguely grown to dream of and to honor and to behold in the setting of the sun and in the flush of the clouds and in the mysteries of the starlit skies of shame to her in it she had no thought a passion strong as fire in its force pure as crystal in its unselfishness possessed her for him and laid her at his feet to be done with as he would she would have crouched to him like a dog she would have worked for him like a slave she would have killed herself if he had bidden her without a word of resistance or a moan of regret to be caressed by him one moment as his hand in passing caressed a flower even though with the next to be broken like the flower and cast aside in a ditch to die was to her the greatest glory life could know to be a pleasure to him for one hour to see his eyes tell her once however carelessly or coldly that she had any beauty for him was to her the sweetest and noblest fate that could befall her to him she was no more than the cluster of grapes to the wayfarer who brushes their bloom off and steals their sweetness then casts them down to be trampled on by whosoever the next comer be but to this creature who had no guide except her instincts of passion and sacrifice who had no guard except the pure scorn that had kept her from the meanness and coarseness of the vices around her this was unintelligible unsuspected and if she had understood it she would have accepted it mutely in that abject humility which had bent the fierce and dauntless temper in her to his will to be of use to himto be held of any worth to himto have his eyes find any loveliness to study in herto be to him only as a flower that he broke off its stem to copy its bloom on his canvas and then cast out on the land to wither as it wouldthis even this seemed to her the noblest and highest fate to which she could have had election that he only borrowed the color of her cheek and the outline of her limbs as he had borrowed a thousand times ere then the venal charms of the dancingwomen of taverns and playhouses and the luring graces of the wanton that strayed in the public ways was a knowledge that never touched her with its indignity to her his art was a religion supreme passionless eternal whose sacrificial fires ennobled and consecrated all that they consumed though i shall die as the leaf dies in my body yet i shall live forever embalmed amidst the beauty of his thoughts she told herself perpetually and all her life became transfigured chapter ix one evening he met her in the fields on the same spot where marcellin first had seen her as a child among the scarlet blaze of the poppies the lands were all yellow with saffron and emerald with the young corn she balanced on her head a great brass jar the red girdle glowed about her waist as she moved the wind stirred the folds of her garments her feet were buried in the shining grass clouds tawny and purple were behind her she looked like some moorish phantom seen in a dream under a sky of spain he paused and gazed at her with eyes half content half cold she was of a beauty so uncommon so strange and all that was his for his arta great artist whether in words in melody or in color is always cruel or at the least seems so for all things that live under the sun are to him created only to minister to his one inexorable passion art is so vast and human life is so little it is to him only supremely just that the insect of an hour should be sacrificed to the infinite and eternal truth which must endure until the heavens themselves shall wither as a scroll that is held in a flame it might have seemed to arslan base to turn her ignorance and submission to his will to the gratification of his amorous passions but to make these serve the art to which he had himself abandoned every earthly good was in his sight justified as the death agonies of the youth whom they decked with roses and slew in sacrifice to the sun were in the sight of the mexican nation the youth whom the mexicans slew on the high hill of the city with his face to the west was always the choicest and the noblest of all the opening flower of their manhood for it was his fate to be called to enter into the realms of eternal light and to dwell face to face with the unbearable brightness without whose rays the universe would have perished frozen in perpetual night so the artist who is true to his art regards every human sacrifice that he renders up to it how can he feel pity for a thing which perishes to feed a flame that he deems the life of the world the steel that he draws out from the severed heart of his victim he is ready to plunge into his own vitals no other religion can vaunt as much of its priests what are you thinking of tonight he asked her where she came through the fields by the course of a little flowersown brook fringed with tall bulrushes and waving willowstems she lifted her eyelids with a dreamy and wistful regard i was thinkingi wonder what the reed felt that you told me ofthe one reed that a god chose from all its millions by the waterside and cut down to make into a flute ahyou see there are no reeds that make music nowadays the reeds are only good to be woven into creels for the fruits and the fish of the market that is not the fault of the reeds not that i know it is the fault of men most likely who find the chink of coin in barter sweeter music than the song of the syrinx but what do you think the reed felt thenpain to be so sharply severed from its fellows noor the god would not have chosen it what then a troubled sigh parted her lips these old fables were fairest truths to her and gave a grace to every humblest thing that the sun shone on or the waters begat from their foam or the winds blew with their breath into the little life of a day i was trying to think but i cannot be sure these reeds have forgotten they have lost their soul they want nothing but to feed among the sand and the mud and grow in millions together and shelter the toads and the newtsthere is not a note of music in them allexcept when the wind rises and makes them sigh and then they remember that longlongago the breath of a great god was in them arslan looked at her where she stood her eyes resting on the reeds and the brook at her feet the crimson heat of the evening all about her on the brazen amphora on the red girdle on her loins on the thoughtful parted lips on the proud bent brows above which a golden butterfly floated as above the brows of psyche he smiled the smile that was so cold to her look away over the fields there comes a peasant with a sickle he comes to mow down the reeds to make a bed for his cattle if he heard you he would think you mad they have thought me many things worse what matter nothing at allthat i know but you seem to envy that reedso long agothat was chosen who would not are you so sure the life of the reed was always pleasantdancing there in the light playing with the shadows blowing in the winds with the cool waters all about it all day long and the yellow daffodils and the blue bellflowers for its brethren nayhow do you know her voice was low and thrilled with a curious eager pain how do you know she murmured rather it was born in the sands among the stones of the chance winds of the stray germsno one asking no one heeding brought by a sunbeam spat out by a toadno one caring where it dropped ratherit grew there by the river and such millions of reeds grew with it that neither waters nor winds could care for a thing so common and worthless but the very snakes twisting in and out despised it and thrust the arrows of their tongues through it in scorn and theni think i seethe great god walked by the edge of the river and he mused on a gift to give man on a joy that should be a joy on the earth forever and he passed by the lily white as snow by the thyme that fed the bees by the gold heart in the arum flower by the orange flame of the tall sandrush by all the great waterblossoms which the sun kissed and the swallows loved and he came to the one little reed pierced with the snakes tongues and all alone amidst millions then he took it up and cut it to the root and killed itkilled it as a reedbut breathed into it a song audible and beautiful to all the ears of men was that death to the reedor life would a thousand summers of life by the waterside have been worth that one thrill of song when a god first spoke through it her face lightened with a radiance to which the passion of her words was pale and poor the vibrations of her voice grew sonorous and changing as the sounds of music itself her eyes beamed through unshed tears as planets through the rain she spoke of the reed and the godshe thought of herself and of him he was silent the reaper came nearer to them through the rosy haze of the evening and cast a malignant eye upon them and bent his back and drew the curve of his hook through the rushes arslan watched the sweep of the steel the reeds only fall now for the market he said with a smile that was cruel and the gods are all deadfollefarine she did not understand but her face lost its color her heart sunk her lips closed she went on treading down the long coils of the wild strawberries and the heavy grasses wet with the dew the glow from the west died a young moon rose the fields and the skies grew dark he looked and let her goalone in her hermes pitiful for once had given him a syrinx through which all sweetest and noblest music might have been breathed but hermes when he gives such a gift leaves the mortal on whom he bestows it to make or to miss the music as he may and to arslan his reed was but a reed as the rest werea thing that bloomed for a summerevea thing of the stagnant water and drifting sanda thing that lived by the breath of the winda thing that a man should cut down and weave in a crown for a day and then cast aside on the stream and neither regret nor in any wise remembera reed of the river as the rest were book v chapter i only a little gold he thought one day looking on the cartoon of the barabbas as much as i have flung away on a dancingwoman or the dancingwoman on the jewel for her breast only a little gold and i should be free and with me these the thought escaped him unawares in broken words one day when he thought himself alone this was a perpetual torture to him this captivity and penury this aimlessness and fruitlessness in which his years were drifting spent in the dull bodily labor that any brainless human brute could execute as well as he consuming his days in physical fatigues that a roof he despised might cover him and a bread which was bitter as gall to him might be his to eat knowing all the while that the real strength which he possessed the real power that could give him an empire amidst his fellows was dying away in him as slowly but as surely as though his brain were feasting fishes in the rivermud below so littlejust a few handfuls of the wealth that cheats and wantons fools and panders gathered and scattered so easily in that world with which he had now no more to do than if he were lying in his graveand having this he would be able to compel the gaze of the world and arouse the homage of its flinching fear even if it should still continue to deny him other victories it was not the physical privations of poverty which could daunt him his boyhood had been spent in a healthful and simple training amidst a strong and hardy mountainpeople it was nothing to him to make his bed on straw to bear hunger unblenchingly to endure cold and heat and all the freaks and changes of wild weather in the long nights of a northern winter he had fasted for weeks on a salted fish and a handful of meal on the polar seas he had passed a winter iceblocked with famine kept at bay only by the flesh of the seal and men dying around him raving in the madness of thirst none of the physical ills of poverty could appall him but its imprisonment its helplessness the sense of utter weakness the impotence to rise and go to other lands and other lives the perpetual narrowness and darkness in which it compelled him to abide all these were horrible to him he loathed them as a man loathes the irons on his wrists and the stone vault of his prisoncell if i had only money he muttered looking on his barabbas ever so littleever so little for he knew that if he had as much gold as he had thrown away in earlier times to the syrian beggar who had sat to him on his housetop at damascus he could go to a city and make the work live in color and try once more to force from men that wonder and that fear which are the highest tributes that the multitude can give to the genius that arises amidst it there was no creature in the chamber with him except the spiders that wove in the darkness among the timbers it was only just then dawn the birds were singing in the thickets of the waters edge a blue kingfisher skimmed the air above the rushes and a dragonfly hunted insects over the surface of the reeds by the shore the swallows that built in the stones of the tower were wheeling to and fro glad and eager for the sun otherwise it was intensely silent in the breadth of shadow still cast across the stream by the walls of the tower the marketboat of ypres glided by and the soft splash of the passing oars was a sound too familiar to arouse him but unseen follefarine resting one moment in her transit to look up at that grim gray pile in which her paradise was shut watching and listening with the finestrung senses of a great love heard through the open casement the muttered words which out of the bitterness of his heart escaped his lips unconsciously she heard and understood although a paradise to her to him it was only a prison it is with him as with the great black eagle that they keep in the bridgetower in a hole in the dark with wings cut close and a stone tied to each foot she thought as she went on her way noiselessly down with the ebbtide on the river and she sorrowed exceedingly for his sake she knew nothing of all that he remembered in the years of his pastof all that he had lost whilst yet young as men should only lose their joys in the years of their old age she knew nothing of the cities and the habits of the worldnothing of the worlds pleasures and the worlds triumphs to her it had always seemed strange that he wanted any other life than this which he possessed to her the freedom the strength the simplicity of it seemed noble and all that the heart of a man could desire from fate going forth at sunrise to his daily labor on the broad golden sheet of the waters down to the sight and the sound and the smile of the sea and returning at sunset to wander at will through the woods and the pastures in the soft evening shadows or to watch and portray with the turn of his wrist the curl of each flower the wonder of every cloud the smile in any womans eyes the gleam of any moonbeam through the leaves or to lie still on the grass or the sand by the shore and see the armies of the mists sweep by over his head and hearken to the throb of the nightingales voice through the darkness and mark the coolness of the dews on the hollow of his hand and let the night go by in dreams of worlds beyond the starssuch a life as this seemed to her beyond any other beautiful a life in the air on the tide in the light in the wind in the sound of salt waves in the smell of wild thyme with no roof to come between him and the sky with no need to cramp body and mind in the cage of a streeta life spent in the dreaming of dreams and full of vision and thought as the summer was full of its blossom and fruitsit seemed to her the life that must needs be best for a man since the life that was freest simplest and highest she knew nothing of the lust of ambition of the desire of fame of the ceaseless unrest of the mind which craves the worlds honor and is doomed to the worlds neglect of the continual fire which burns in the hands which stretch themselves in conscious strength to seize a scepter and remain empty only struck in the palm by the buffets of fools of these she knew nothing she had no conception of themof the weakness and the force that twine one in another in such a temper as his she was at once above them and beneath them she could not comprehend that he who could so bitterly disdain the fleshpots and the wineskins of the common crowd yet could stoop to care for the crowds hosannas but yet this definite longing which she overheard in the words that escaped him she could not mistake it was a longing plain to her one that moved all the dullest and most brutal souls around her all her years through she had seen the greed of gold or the want of it the twin rulers of the only little dominion that she knew money in her estimate of it meant only some little sum of copper pieces such as could buy a hank of flax a load of sweet chestnuts a stack of wood a swarm of bees a sack of autumn fruits what in cities would have been penury was deemed illimitable riches in the homesteads and cabins which had been her only world a little golda little gold she pondered ceaselessly as she went on down the current she knew that he only craved it not to purchase any pleasure for his appetites or for his vanities but as the lever whereby he would be enabled to lift off him that iron weight of adverse circumstance which held him down in darkness as the stones held the caged eagle a little gold she said to herself again and again as the boat drifted on to the town with the scent of the mulberries and the herbs and the baskets of roses which were its cargo for the market fragrant on the air a little gold it seemed so slight a thing and the more cruel because so slight to stand thus between him and that noonday splendor of fame which he sought to win in his obscurity and indigence as the blinded eagle in his den still turned his aching eyes by instinct to the sun her heart was weary for him as she went what use for the gods to have given him back life she thought if they must give him thus with it the incurable fever of an endless desire it was a gift as poisoned a granted prayer as vain as the immortality which they had given to tithonus a little gold he had said it seemed a thing almost within her grasp had she been again willing to steal from flamma she could have taken it as soon as the worth of the load she carried should have been paid to her but by a theft she would not serve arslan now no gifts would she give him but what should be pure and worthy of his touch she pondered and pondered cleaving the waters with dull regular measure and gliding under the old stone arches of the bridge into the town when she brought the boat back up the stream at noonday her face had cleared her mouth smiled she rowed on swiftly with a light sweet and glad in her eyes a thought had come to her in the marketplace that day she had heard two women talk together under the shade of their great red umbrellas over their heaps of garden produce so thou hast bought the brindled calf after all thou art in luck ay in luck indeed for the boy to rout up the old peartree and find those queer coins beneath it the tree had stood there all my fathers and grandfathers time and longer too for aught i know and no one ever dreamed there was any treasure at the root but he took a fancy to dig up the tree he said it looked like a ghost with its old gray arms and he wanted to plant a young cherry there must have been a mass of coin noonly a few little shabby bent pieces but the lad took them up to the prince sartorian and he is always crazed about the like and he sent us for them quite a roll of gold and said that the coins found were beyond a doubt of the julian timewhatever he might mean by that sartorian will buy any rubbish of that sort for my part i think if one buried a brass button only long enough he would give one a banknote for it they say there are marble creatures of his that cost more than would dower a thousand brides or pension a thousand soldiers i do not know about that my boy did not get far in the palace but he said that the hall he waited in was graven with gold and precious stones one picture he saw in it was placed on a golden altar as if it were a god to worship old coins and rags of canvas and idols of stone like thathow vile it is while we are glad to get a nettlesalad off the edge of the road but the coins gave thee the brindled calf that was no goodness to us sartorian has a craze for such follies follefarine had listened and standing by them for once spoke who is sartorian will you tell me the women were from a fardistant village and had not the infinite horror of her felt by those who lived in the near neighborhood of the mill of ypres he is a great noble they answered her eyeing her with suspicion and where is his dwelling near rioz what do the like of you want with the like of the prince she gave them thanks for their answers and turned away in silence with a glow at her heart what is that wicked one thinking of now that she asks for such as the prince sartorian said the women crossing themselves repentant that they had so far forgotten themselves as to hold any syllable of converse with the devils daughter an old man plucking birds near at hand chuckled low in his throat maybe she knows that sartorian will give yet more gold for new faces than for old coins andhow handsome she is the blackbrowed witch she had passed away through the crowds of the market and did not hear i go to rioz myself in two days time with the mules she thought and her heart rose her glance lightened she moved through the people with a step so elastic and a face so radiant from the flush of a new hope that they fell away from her with an emotion which for once was not wholly hatred that night when the millhouse was quiet and the moonbeams fell through all its small dim windows and checkered all its wooden floors she rose from the loft where she slept and stole noiselessly down the steep stairway to the chamber where the servant pitchou slept it was a little dark chamber with jutting beams and a casement that was never unclosed on a nail hung the blue woolen skirt and the linen cap of the womans workingdress in a corner was a little image of a saint and a string of leaden beads on a flock pallet the old wrinkled creature slept tired out with the labor of a long days work among the cabbagebeds and rows of lettuces muttering as she slept of the little daily peculations that were the sweet sins of her life and of her masters she cared for her soulcared very much and tried to save it but cheating was dear to her and cruelty was natural she tricked the fatherless child in his measure of milk for the tenth of a sou and wrung the throat of the bullfinch as it sang lest he should peck the tenth of a cherry follefarine went close to the straw bed and laid her hand on the sleeper wake i want a word with you pitchou started struggled glared with wideopen eyes and gasped in horrible fear follefarine put the other hand on her mouth listen the night i was brought here you stole the sequins off my head give them back to me now or i will kill you where you lie the grip of her left hand on the womans throat and the gleam of her knife in the right were enough as she had counted they would be old pitchou struggled lied stammered writhed strove to scream and swore her innocence of this theft which had waited eleven years to rise against her to mary and her angels but in the end she surrendered and tottered on her shuddering limbs and crept beneath her bed and with terror and misery brought forth from her secret hole in the rafters of the floor the little chain of shaking sequins it had been of no use to her she had always thought it of inestimable value and could never bring herself to part from it visiting it night and day and being perpetually tormented with the dread lest her master should discover and claim it follefarine seized it from her silently and laugheda quiet cold laughat the threats and imprecations of the woman who had robbed her in her infancy how can you complain of me without telling also of your own old sin she said with contempt as she quitted the chamber shriek away as you choose the chain is mine not yours i was weak when you stole it i am strong enough now you had best not meddle or you will have the worst of the reckoning and she shut the door on the old womans screams and left her knowing well that pitchou would not dare to summon her master it was just daybreak all the world was still dark she slipped the sequins in her bosom and went back to her own bed of hay in the loft there was no sound in the darkness but the faint piping of young birds that felt the coming of day long ere the grosser senses of humanity could have seen a glimmer of light on the black edge of the eastern clouds she sat on her couch with the moorish coins in her hand and gazed upon them they were very precious to her she had never forgotten or ceased to desire them though to possess herself of them by force had never occurred to her until that night their theft had been a wrong which she had never pardoned yet she had never avenged it until now as she held them in her hand for the first time in eleven years a strong emotion came over her the time when she had worn them came out suddenly in sharp relief from the haze of her imperfect memories all the old forestlife for a moment revived for her the mists of the mountains the smell of the chestnutwoods the curl of the white smoke among the leaves the sweet wild strains of the music the mad grace of the old moorish dances the tramp through the hillpasses the leap and splash of the tumbling watersall arose to her for one moment from the oblivion in which years of toil and exile had buried them the tears started to her eyes she kissed the little glittering coins she thought of phratos she had never known his fate the gypsy who had been found dead in the fields had been forgotten by the people before the same snows which had covered his body had melted at the first glimmer of the wintry sun flamma could have told her but he had never spoken one word in all her life to her except in curt reprimand or in cruel irony all the old memories had died out and no wanderers of her fathers race had ever come into the peaceful and pastoral district of the northern seaboard where they could have gained no footing and could have made no plunder the sight of the little band of coins which had danced so often among her curls under the moonlit leaves in the liebana to the leaping and tuneful measures of the viol moved her to a wistful longing for the smile and the voice of phratos i would never part with them for myself she thought i would die of hunger firstwere it only myself and still she was resolved to part with them to sell her single little treasurethe sole gift of the only creature who had ever loved her even in the very first hour that she had recovered it the sequins were worth no more than any babys woven crown of faded daisies but to her as to the old peasant they seemed by their golden glitter a source of wealth incalculable at twilight that day as she stood by arslan she spoke to him timidly i go to rioz with the two mules at daybreak tomorrow with flour for flamma it is a town larger than the one yonder is there anything i might do therefor you do what should you do he answered her with inattention and almost impatience for his heart was sore with the terrible weariness of inaction she looked at him very wistfully and her mouth parted a little as though to speak but his repulse chilled the words that rose to her lips she dared not say her thoughts to him lest she should displease him if it come to naught he had best not know perhaps she said to herself so she kept silence on the morrow before the sun was up she set out on her way with the two mules to rioz it was a town distant some five leagues lying to the southward both the mules were heavily laden with as many sacks as they could carry she could ride on neither she walked between them with a bridle held in either hand the road was not a familiar one to her she had only gone thither some twice or thrice and she did not find the way long being full of her own meditations and hopes and taking pleasure in the gleam of new waters and the sight of fresh fields and the green simple loveliness of a pastoral country in late summer she met few people a marketwoman or two on their asses a walking peddler a shepherd or a swineherdthese were all the day was young and none but the country people were astir the quiet roads were dim with mists and the tinkle of a sheeps bell was the only sound in the silence it was midday when she entered rioz a town standing in a dell surrounded with appleorchards and fields of corn and colza with a quaint old square tower of the thirteenth century arising among its roofs and round about it old mossgreen ramparts whereon the bramble and the gorse grew wild but as the morning advanced the mists lifted the sun grew powerful the roads were straight and without shadow the mules stumbled footsore she herself grew tired and fevered she led her fatigued and thirsty beasts through the nearest gateway where a soldier sat smoking and a girl in a blue petticoat and a scarlet bodice talked to him resting her hands on her hips and her brass pails on the ground she left the sacks of flour at their destination which was a great bakehouse in the center of the town stalled the mules herself in a shed adjoining the little crazy wineshop where flamma had bidden her bait them and with her own hands unharnessed watered and foddered them the wineshop had for sign a white pigeon it was tumbledown dusky half covered with vines that grew loose and entwined over each other at their own fancy it had a little court in which grew a great walnuttree there was a bench under the tree the shelter of its boughs was cool and very welcome in the full noon heat the old woman who kept the place wrinkled shriveled and cheery bade her rest there and she would bring her food and drink but follefarine with one wistful glance at the shadowing branches refused and asked only the way to the house of the prince sartorian the woman of the cabaret looked at her sharply and said as the marketwomen had said what does the like of you want with the prince i want to know the way to it if you do not tell it another will she answered as she moved out of the little courtyard the old woman called after her that it was out by the west gate over the hill through the fields for more than two leagues if she followed the wind of the water westward she could not go amiss what is that baggage wanting to do with sartorian she muttered watching the form of the girl as it passed up the steep sunshiny street some evil no doubt answered her assistant a stalwart wench who was skinning a rabbit in the yard you know she sells bags of wind to founder the ships they say and the wicked herb bon plaisir and the philters that drive men mad she is as bad as a cajote her old mistress going within to toss a fritter for one of the mendicant friars chuckled grimly to herself no one would ask the road there for any good that is sure no doubt she had heard that sartorian is a choice judge of color and shape in all the arts follefarine went out by the gate and along the water westward in a little satchel she carried some half score of oilsketches that he had given her rich graceful shadowy thingsgirls faces coils of foliage riverrushes in the moonlight a purple passionflower blooming on a gray ruin a child goldenheaded and barelimbed wading in brown watersthings that had caught his sight and fancy and had been transcribed and then tossed aside with the lavish carelessness of genius she asked one or two peasants whom she met her way they stared and grumbled and pointed to some distant towers rising out of wooded slopesthose they said were the towers of the dwelling of prince sartorian one henhuckster leading his ass to market with a load of live poultry looked over his shoulder after her and muttered with a grin to his wife there goes a handsome piece of porcelain for the old man to lock in his velvetlined cupboards and the wife laughed in answer ay she will look well gilded as sartorian always gilds what he buys the words came to the ear of follefarine she wondered what they could mean but she would not turn back to ask her feet were weary like her mules the sun scorched her she felt feeble and longed to lie down and sleep but she toiled on up the sharp ascent that rose in cliffs of limestone above the valley where the river ran at last she came to gates that were like those of the cathedral all brazen blazoned and full of scrolls and shields she pushed one openthere was no one there to say her nay and boldly entered the domain which they guarded at first it seemed to be only like the woods at home the trees were green the grass long the birds sang the rabbits darted but byandby she went farther she grew bewildered she was in a world strange to her trees she had never seen rose like the pillars of temples gorgeous flowers she had never dreamed of played in the sun vast columns of water sprang aloft from the mouths of golden dragons or the silver breasts of dolphins nude women wondrous and white and still stood here and there amidst the leavy darkness she paused among it all dazzled and thinking that she dreamed she had never seen any gardens save the gardens of the poor a magnoliatree was above her she stooped her face to one of its great fragrant creamy cups and kissed it softly a statue of clytio was beside her she looked timidly up at the musing face and touched it wondering why it was so very cold and would not move or smile a fountain flung up its spray beside her she leaned and caught it thinking it so much silver and gazed at it in sorrowful wonder as it changed to water in her grasp she walked on like one enchanted silently and thinking that she had strayed into some sorcerers kingdom she was not afraid but glad she walked on for a long while always among these mazes of leaves these splendors of blossom these cloudreaching waters these marble forms so motionless and thoughtful at last she came on the edge of a great pool fringed with the bulrush and the lotos and the white pampasgrass and the flamelike flowering reed of the east and of the west all around the pool was sheltered with dark woods of cedar and thickets of the seapine beyond them stood aloof a great pile that seemed to her to blaze like gold and silver in the sun she approached it through a maze of roses and ascended a flight of marble steps on to a terrace a door stood open near she entered it she was intent on the object of her errand and she had no touch of fear in her whole temper hall after hall room after room opened to her amazed vision an endless spectacle of marvelous color stretched before her eyes the wonders that are gathered together by the worlds luxury were for the first time in her sight she saw for the first time in her life how the rich lived she moved forward curious astonished bewildered but nothing daunted on the velvet of the floors her steps trod as firmly and as freely as on the moss of the orchard at ypres her eyes glanced as gravely and as fearlessly over the frescoed walls the gilded woods the jeweled cups the broidered hangings as over the misty pastures where the sheep were folded it was not in the daughter of taric to be daunted by the dazzle of mere wealth she walked through the splendid and lonely rooms wondering indeed and eager to see more but there was no spell here such as the gardens had flung over her to the creature free born in the liebana no life beneath a roof could seem beautiful she met no one at the end of the fourth chamber which she traversed she paused before a great picture in a heavy golden frame it was the seizure of persephone she knew the story for arslan had told her of it she saw for the first time how the pictures that men called great were installed in princely splendor this was the fate which he wanted for his own a little lamp burning perfume with a silvery smoke stood before it she recalled the words of the woman in the marketplace in her ignorance she thought the picture was worshiped as a divinity as the people worshiped the great picture of the virgin that they burned incense before in the cathedral she looked with something of gloomy contempt in her eyes at the painting which was mantled in massive gold with purple draperies opening to display it for it was the chief masterpiece upon those walls and he cares for that she thought with a sigh half of wonder half of sorrow she did not reason on it but it seemed to her that his works were greater hanging on their bare walls where the spiders wove who is he a voice asked behind her she turned and saw a small and feeble man with keen humorous eyes and an elfin face delicate in its form malicious in its meaning she stood silent regarding him herself a strange figure in that lordly place with her brown limbs her bare head and feet her linen tunic her red knotted girdle who are you she asked him curtly in counterquestion the little old man laughed i have the honor to be your host a disappointed astonishment clouded her face you are you sartorian she mutteredthe sartorian whom they call a prince even i he said with a smile i regret that i please you no more may i ask to what i am indebted for your presence you seem a fastidious critic he spoke with goodhumored irony taking snuff whilst he looked at the lustrous beauty of this barefooted gypsy as he thought her whom he had found thus astray in his magnificent chambers she amused him finding her silent he sought to make her speak how did you come in hither you care for pictures perhaps since you seem to feed on them like some woodpigeons on a sheaf of corn i know of finer than yours she answered him coldly chilled by the amused and malicious ridicule of his tone into a sullen repose i did not come to see anything you have i came to sell you these they say in ypres that you care for such bits of coin she drew out of her bosom her string of sequins and tendered them to him he took them seeing at a glance that they were of no sort of value such things as he could buy for a few coins in any bazaar of africa or asia but he did not say so he looked at her keenly as he asked whose were these she looked in return at him with haughty defiance they are mine if you want such things as they say you do take them and give me their valuethat is all do you come here to sell them yes i came three leagues today i heard a woman from near rioz say that you liked such things take them or leave them who gave them to you phratos her voice lingered sadly over the word she still loved the memory of phratos and who may phratos be her eyes flashed fire at the crossquestioning that is none of your business if you think that i stole them say so if you want them buy them one or the other the old man watched her amusedly you can be very fierce he said to her be gentle a little and tell me whence you came and what story you have but she would not i have not come here to speak of myself she said obstinately will you take the coins or leave them i will take them he said and he went to a cabinet in another room and brought out with him several shining gold pieces she fastened her eager eyes on them thirstily here is payment he said to her holding them to her her eyes fastened on the money entranced she touched it with a light halffearful touch and then drew back and gazed at it amazed all thatall that she muttered is it their worth are you sure quite sure he said with a smile he offered her in them some thirty times their value she paused for a moment incredulous of her own good fortune then darted on them as a swallow at a gnat and took them and put them to her lips and laughed a sweet glad laugh of triumph and slid them in her bosom i am grateful she said simply but the radiance in her eyes the laughter on her mouth the quivering excitement in all her face and form said the same thing for her far better than her words the old man watched her narrowly they are not for yourself he asked that is my affair she answered him all her pride rising in arms what concerned you was their value he smiled and bent his head fairly rebuked but say is this all you came for wherever you came from is this all that brought you here she looked awhile in his eyes steadily then she brought the sketches from their hidingplace she placed them before him look at those he took them to the light and scanned them slowly and critically he knew all the mysteries and intricacies of art and he recognized in these slight things the hand and the color of a master he did not say so but held them for some time in silence these also are for sale he asked at length she had drawn near him her face flushed with intense expectation her longing eyes dilated her scarlet lips quivering with eagerness that he was a stranger and a noble was nothing to her she knew he had wealth she saw he had perception see here she said swiftly the music of her voice rising and falling in breathless eloquent intonation those things are to the great works of his hand as a broken leaf beside your gardens yonder he touches a thing and it is beauty he takes a reed a stone a breadth of sand a womans face and under his hand it grows glorious and gracious he dreams things that are strange and sublime he has talked with the gods and he has seen the worlds beyond the sun all the day he works for his bread and in the gray night he wanders where none can follow him and he brings back marvels and mysteries and beautiful terrible stories that are like the sound of the sea yet he is poor and no man sees the things of his hand and he is sick of his life because the days go by and bring no message to him and men will have nothing of him and he has hunger of body and hunger of mind for me if i could do what he does i would not care though no man ever looked on it but to him it is bitter that it is only seen by the newt and the beetle and the nighthawk it wears his soul away because he is denied of men if i had gold if i had gold he says always when he thinks that none can hear him her voice trembled and was still for a second she struggled with herself and kept it clear and strong the old man never interrupted her he must not know he would kill himself if he knew he would sooner die than tell any man but look you you drape your pictures here with gold and with purple you place them high in the light you make idols of them and burn your incense before them that is what he wants for his they are the life of his life if they could be honored he would not care though you should slay him tomorrow go to him and make you idols of his they are worthier gods than yours and what his heart is sick for is to have them seen by men were i he i would not care but he cares so that he perishes she shivered as she spoke in her earnestness and eagerness she laid her hand on the strangers arm and held it there she prayed with more passion than she would have cast into any prayer to save her own life where is he and what do you call him the old man asked her quietly he understood the meaning that ran beneath the unconscious extravagance of her fanciful and impassioned language he is called arslan he lives in the granarytower by the river between the town and ypres he comes from the north far awayvery very far where the seas are all ice and the sun shines at midnight will you make the things that he does to be known to the people you have gold and gold he says is the compeller of men arslan he echoed the name was not utterly unknown to him he had seen works signed with it at paris and at romestrange things of a singular power of a union of cynicism and idealism which was too coarse for onehalf the world and too pure for the other half arslani think i remember i will see what i can do you will say nothing to him of me i could not say much who are you whence do you come i live at the watermill of ypres they say that reine flamma was my mother i do not know it does not matter what is your name follefarine they called me after the milldust a strange namesake what does it matter any name is only a little puff of breathless than the dust anyhow is it i see you are a communist what a communista socialist you know what that is you would like to level my house to the ashes i fancy by the look on your face no she said simply with a taint of scorn i do not care to do that if i had cared to burn anything it would have been the flandrins village it is odd that you should live in a palace and he should want for bread but then he can create things and you can only buy them so it is even perhaps the old man smiled amused you are no respecter of persons that is certain come in another chamber and take some wine and break your fast there will be many things here that you never saw or tasted she shook her head the thought is good of you she said more gently than she had before spoken but i never took a crust out of charity and i will not begin charity do you call an invitation a charity when the rich ask the pooryes he looked in her eyes with a smile but when a man old and ugly asks a woman that is young and beautiful on which side lies the charity then i do not favor fine phrases she answered curtly returning his look with a steady indifference you are hard to please in anything it would seem well come hither a moment at least she hesitated then thinking to herself that to refuse would seem like fear she followed him through several chambers into one where his own midday breakfast was set forth she moved through all the magnificence of the place with fearless steps and meditative glances and a grave measured easy grace as tranquil and as unimpressed as though she walked through the tall ranks of the seeding grasses on a meadow slope it was all full of the color the brilliancy the choice adornment the unnumbered treasures and the familiar luxuries of a great nobles residence but such things as these had no awe for her the mere splendors of wealth the mere accumulations of luxury could not impress her for an instant she passed through them indifferent and undaunted thinking to herself however they may gild their roofs the roofs shut out the sky no less only as she passed by some dream of a great poet cast in the visible shape of sculpture or of painting did her glance grow reverent and humid only when she recognized amidst the marble forms or the pictured stories some one of those dear gods in whom she had a faith as pure and true as ever stirred in the heart of an ionian child did she falter and pause a little to gaze there with a tender homage in her eyes the old man watched her with a musing studious glance from time to time let me tempt you he said to her when they reached the breakfastchamber sit down with me and eat and drink no taste these sweetmeats at the least to refuse to break bread with me is churlish i never owed any man a crust and i will not begin now she answered obstinately indifferent to the blaze of gold and silver before her to the rare fruits and flowers to the wines in their quaint flagons to the numerous attendants who waited motionless around her she was sharply hungered and her throat was parched with the heat and the dust and the sweet unwonted odors of the wines and the fruits assailed all her senses but he besought her in vain she poured herself out some water into a goblet of ruby glass rimmed with a band of pearls and drank it and set down the cup as indifferently as though she had drunk from the old wooden bowl chained among the ivy to the well in the millyard your denial is very churlish he said after many a honeyed entreaty which had met with no other answer from her how shall you bind me to keep bond with you and rescue your northern regner from his cave of snakes unless you break bread with me and so compel my faith she looked at him from under the dusky cloud of her hair with the golden threads gleaming on it like sunrays through darkness a word that needs compelling she answered him curtly is broken by the heart before the lips give it it is to plant a tree without a root to put faith in a man that needs a bond he watched her with keen humorous eyes of amusement where have you got all your wisdom he asked it is not wisdom it is truth and truth is not wisdom you would seem to know the world well she laughed a little short laugh whilst her face clouded i know it not at all but i will tell you what i have seen and that is i have seen a great toadstool spring up all in one night after rain so big and so white and so smooth and so roundand i knew its birth was so quick and its growth was so strong because it was a false thing that would poison all that should eat of it well wellwhen men speak overquick and overfair what is that but the toadstool that springs from their breath who taught you so much suspicion her face darkened in anger suspicion that is a thing that steals in the dark and is afraid i am afraid of nothing so it would seem he mused a moment whether he should offer her back her sequins as a gift he thought not he divined aright that she had only sold them because she had innocently believed in the fullness of their value he tried to tempt her otherwise she was young she had a beautiful face and a form like an atalanta she wore a scarlet sash girt to her loins and seemed to care for color and for grace there was about her a dauntless and imperious freedom she could not be indifferent to all those powers which she besought with such passion for another he had various treasures shown to hertreasures of jewels of gold and silver of fine workmanship of woven stuffs delicate and gorgeous as the wing of a butterfly she looked at them tranquilly as though her eyes had rested on such things all her days they are beautiful no doubt she said simply but i marvel that youbeing a mancare for such things as these nay i care to give them to beautiful women when such come to meas one has come today do me one trifling grace choose some one thing at least out of these to keep in remembrance of me her eyes burned in anger if i think your bread would soil my lips is it likely i should think to touch your treasure with my hands and have them still clean you are very perverse he said relinquishing his efforts with regret he knew how to wait for a netted fruit to ripen under the rays of temptation gold was a forcingheatslow but sure she watched him with musing eyes that had a gleam of scorn in them and yet a vague apprehension are you the red mouse she said suddenly he looked at her surprised and for the moment perplexed then he laughedhis little low cynical laugh what makes you think that i do not know you look like itthat is all he has made one sketch of me as i shall be when i am dead and the red mouse sits on my chest and it is glad you see that by its glance i never asked him what he meant by it some evil i think and you look like it you have the same triumph in your eye he laughed again not displeased as she had thought that he would be he has painted you so i must see that but believe me follefarine i shall wish for my triumph before your beauty is deadif i am indeed the red mouse she shrunk a little with an unconscious and uncontrollable gesture of aversion i must go she said abruptly the mules wait remember him and i will remember you he smiled wait have you thought what a golden key for him will do for you when it unlocks your eagles cage and unbinds his wings what she did not understand when she had come on this eager errand no memory of her own fate had retarded or hastened her footsteps well you look to take the same flight to the same heights i suppose i yes you you must know you are beautiful you must know so much a proud light laughed like sunshine over all her face ah yes she said with a low glad breath and the blaze of a superb triumph in her eyes he has painted me in a thousand ways i shall live as the rose lives on his canvasa thing of a day that he can make immortal the keen elfin eyes of the old man sparkled with a malign mirth he had found what he wantedas he thought and so if this dust of oblivion blots out his canvas forever from the worlds sight your beauty will be blotted with it i see well i can understand how eager you are to have your eagle fly free the fame of the farnarina stands only second to the fame of cleopatra farnarina what is that farnarina one who like you gave the days life of a rose and who got eternal life for itas you think to do she started a little and a tremulous pain passed over the dauntless brilliance of her face and stole its color for awhile i she murmured ah what does it matter for me if there be just a little placeanywherewherever my life can live with his on the canvas so that men say once now and then in all the centuries to each other see it is truehe thought her worthy of that though she was less than a grain of dust under the hollow of his foot it will be enough for memore than enough the old man was silent watching her the mockery had faded from his eyes they were surprised and contemplative she stood with her head drooped with her face pale an infinite yearning and resignation stole into the place of the exultant triumph which had blazed there like the light of the morning a moment earlier she had lost all remembrance of time and place the words died softly as in a sigh of love upon her lips he waited awhile then he spoke but if you were sure that even thus much would be denied to you if you were sure that in casting your eagle loose on the wind you would lose him forever in the heights of a heaven you would never enter yourself if you were sure that he would never give you one thought one wish one memory but leave every trace of your beauty to perish as fast as the damp could rot or the worm could gnaw it if you were sure that his immortality would be your annihilation say would you still bid me turn a gold key in the lock of his cage and release him she roused herself slowly from her reverie and gazed at him with a smile he could not fathom it was so far away from him so full of memory so pitiful of his doubt she was thinking of the night when she had found a man dying and had bought his life back for him with her own from the gods for the pact was sacred to her and the old wild faith to her was still a truth but of it her lips never spoke what is that to you she said briefly if you turn the key you will see it was not of myself that i came here to speak give him liberty and i will give you gratitude farewell before he had perceived what she was about to do she had left his side and had vanished through one of the doors which stood open on to the gardens without he sent his people to search for her on the terraces and lawns but vainly she was fleeter than they and had gone through the green glades in the sunlight as fast as a doe flies down the glades of her native forest the old man sat silent chapter ii when she had outrun her strength for the moment and was forced to slacken her speed she paused to take breath on the edge of the wooded lands she looked neither to right nor left on her backward flight the waters had no song the marble forms no charm the wonderflowers no magic for her as she went she had no ear for the melodies of the birds no sight for the paradise of the rosehung ways she had only one thought leftthe gold that she had gained the cruelty of his remarks had stabbed her with each of their slow keen words as with a knife the sickness of a mortal terror had touched her for the instant as she had remembered that it might be her fate to be not even so much as a memory in the life which she had saved from the grave but with the first breath of the outer air the feebleness passed the strength of the passion that possessed her was too pure to leave her long a prey to any thought of her own fate she smiled again as she looked up through the leaves at the noonday sun what will it matter how or when the gods take my life so only they keep their faith and give me his she thought and her step was firm and free and her glance cloudless and her heart content as she went on her homeward path through the heat of the day she was so young she was so ignorant she was still so astray in the human world about her that she thought she held a talisman in those nine gold pieces a little gold he had said and here she had ithonest clean worthy of his touch and usage her heart leaped to the glad and bounding music of early youth youth which does not reason which only believes and which sees the golden haze of its own faiths and thinks them the promise of the future as young children see the golden haze of their own hair and think it the shade of angels above their heads when she at length reached the millhouse the sun had sunk she had been sixteen hours on foot taking nothing all the while but a roll of rye bread that she had carried in her pouch and a few watercresses that she had gathered in a little brook when the mules had paused to drink there yet when she had housed the grain turned the tired animals into their own nook of meadow to graze and rest for the night she entered the house neither for repose nor food but flew off again through the dusk of the falling night she had no remembrance of hunger nor thirst nor fatigue she had only a buoyant sense of an ecstatic joy she felt as though she had wings and clove the air with no more effort than the belated starling which flew by her over the fields a little gold he had said and in her bosom wrapped in a green chestnut leaf were there not the little broad round glittering pieces which in the world of men seemed to have power to gain all love all honor all peace and all fealty phratos would have wished his gift to go so she thought to herself with a swift penitent remorseful memory for a moment she paused and took them once more out of their hidingplace and undid the green leaf that enwrapped them and kissed them and laughed the hot tears falling down her cheeks where she stood alone in the fields amid the honeysmell of the clover in the grass and the fruitfragrance of the orchards all about her in the dimness a little golda little gold she murmured and she laughed aloud in her great joy and blessed the gods that they had given her to hear the voice of his desire a little gold he had said only and here she had so much no sorcerer she thought ever had power wider than this wealth bestowed on her she did not know she had no measurement flammas eyes she had seen glisten over a tithe of such a sum as over the riches of an emperors treasury she slipped them in her breast again and ran on past the reeds silvering in the rising moon past the waters quiet on a windless air past the dark christ who would not lookwho had never looked or she had loved him with her earliest love even as for his pity she loved thanatos breathless and noiseless she severed the reeds with her swift feet and lightly as a swallow on the wing passed through the dreary portals into arslans chamber his lamp was lighted he stood before the cartoon of the barabbas touching it here and there with his charcoal adding those latest thoughts those aftergraces with which the artist delights to caress his picture with a hand as soft and as lingering as the hand with which a mother caresses the yellow sunshine of her firstborns curls his face as he stood was very pale passionless weary with a sadness sardonic and full of scorn for himself on his mouth and in his eyes those dreams which went so farso farinto worlds whose glories his hand could portray for no human sight he was thinking as he worked of the barabbas you must rot he thought you will feed the rat and the mouse the squirrel will come and gnaw you to line his nest and the beetle and the fly will take you for a spawningbed you will serve no other endsince you are mine and yet i am so great a fool that i love you and try to bring you closer and closer to the thing i see and which you are not and never can be for what man lives so happy as to see the canaan of his idealssave as moses saw it from afar off only to raise his arms to it vainly and die there came a soft shiver of the air as though it were severed by some eager bird she came and stood beside him a flash like the sunrise on her face a radiance in her eyes more lustrous than any smile her body tremulous and breathless from the impatient speed with which her footsteps had been winged about her all the dew and fragrance of the night here is the gold she cried her voice was eager and broken with its too great haste gold he turned and looked at her ignorant of her meaning astonished at her sudden presence there here is the gold she murmured her voice rising swift and clear and full of the music of triumph with which her heart was thrilling a little gold you said you rememberonly a little and this is much take ittake it do you not hear gold he echoed again shaken from his trance of thought and comprehending nothing and remembering nothing of the words that he had spoken in his solitude yes it is mine she said her voice broken in its tumult of ecstasyit is mineall mine it is no charity no gift to me the chain was worth it and i would only take what it was worth a little gold you said and now you can make the barabbas live forever upon canvas and compel men to say that it is great as the impetuous tremulous words broke from her she drew the green leaf with the coins in it from her bosom and thrust it into his hand eager exultant laughing weeping all the silence and the control of her nature swept away in the flood of this immeasurable joy possessing her the touch of the glittering pieces against his hands stung him to comprehension his face flushed over all its pallor he thrust it away with a gesture of abhorrence and rejection money he muttered what moneyyours yes mine entirely mine indeed she answered with a sweet glad ring of victory in her rejoicing voice it is true quite true they were the chains of sequins that phratos gave me when i used to dance to his music in the mountains and i have sold them a little gold you said and the barabbas can live forever why do you look so it is all mine all yours in the last words her voice lost all its proud exultation and sank low with a dull startled wonder in it why did he look so his gesture of refusal she had not noticed but the language his glance spoke was one plain to her it terrified her amazed her struck her chill and dumb in it there were disgust anger loathingeven horror and yet there was in it also an unwonted softness which in a womans would have shown itself by a rush of sudden tears what do you think that i have done she murmured under her breath the gold is minemine honestly i have not stolen it nor begged it i got it as i say why will you not take it why do you look at me so i your money god in heaven what can you think me she grew white to the lips all the impetuous radiant tumult of her innocent rapture frozen into terror i have done nothing wrong she murmured with a piteous wistfulness and wondernothing wrong indeed there is no shame in it will you not take itfor their sake he turned on her with severity almost savage it is impossible good god was i not low enough already how dared you think a thing so vile of me have i ever asked pity of any living soul his voice was choked in his throat he was wounded to the heart he had no thought that he was cruel he had no intent to terrify or hurt her but the sting of this last and lowest humiliation was so horrible to all the pride of his manhood and so bitterly reminded him of his own abject poverty and with all this there was an emotion in him that he had difficulty to controlbeing touched by her ignorance and by her gift as few things in his life had ever touched him she stood before him trembling wondering sorely afraid all the light had died out of her face she was very pale and her eyes dilated strangely for some moments there was silence between them you will not take it she said at last in a hushed fearful voice like that of one who speaks in the sight of some dead thing which makes all quiet around it take it he echoed i could sooner kill a man out yonder and rob him can you not understand greater shame could never come to me you do not know what you would do there may be beasts that fall as low no doubt but they are curs too base for hanging have i frightened you i did not mean to frighten you you mean well and nobly no doubtno doubt you do not know what you would do gifts of gold from man to man are bitter and sap the strength of the receiver but from woman to man they areto the man shameful can you not understand her face burned duskily she moved with a troubled confused effort to get away from his gaze no she said in her shut teeth i do not know what you mean flamma takes all the gold i make why not you if it be gold that is honest flamma is your grandsireyour keeperyour master he has a right to do as he chooses he gives you food and shelter and in return he takes the gains of your labor but iwhat have i ever given you i am a stranger to you and should have no claim on you if i could be base enough to seek one i am hideously poor i make no disguise with youyou know too well how i live but can you not seeif i were mean enough to take the worth of a crust from you i should be no more worthy of the very name of man it is for the man to give to the woman you see she heard him in silence her face still dark with the confused pain on it of one who has fallen or been struck upon the head and half forgets and half remembers i do not see she muttered whoever has gives what does it matter the folly in me was its littleness it could not be of use but it was all i had little or greatthe riches of empires or a beggars dolethere could be no difference in the infamy to me have i seemed to you a creature so vile or weak that you could have a title to put such shame upon me out of the bitter passion of his soul words more cruel than he had consciousness of rose to his lips and leaped to speech and stung her as scorpions sting she said nothing her teeth clinched her face changed as it had used to do when flamma had beaten her she said nothing but turned away and with one twist of her hand she flung the pieces through the open casement into the river that flowed below they sank with a little shiver of the severed water he caught her wrist a second too late what madness what have you done you throw your gold away to the riverswamp for me when i have not a shred worth a copperpiece to pay you back in their stead i did not mean to hurt you it was only the truthyou could not have shamed me more you bring on me an indignity that i can neither requite nor revenge you have no right to load me with debts that i cannot paywith gifts that i would die sooner than receive but then how should you knowhow should you know if i wounded you with sharp words i did wrong there was a softness that was almost tenderness in his voice as he spoke the last phrases in his selfreproach but her face did not change her eyes did not lose their startled horror she put her hand to her throat as though she choked you cannot do wrongto me she muttered true even in such a moment to the absolute adoration which possessed her then ere he could stay her she turned without another word and fled out from his presence into the dusk of the night the rushes in the moonlight sighed where they grew by the waterside above the sands where the gold had sunk a thing more precious than gold was dead and only the reeds mourned for it a thing of the river as they were born like them from the dust from the flood and the wind and the foam a thing that a god might desire a thing that a breeze might break chapter iii the day broke tranquilly there was a rosy light over all the earth in the cornlands a few belated sheaves stood alone on the reaping ground while children sought stray ears that might still be left among the wild flowers and the stubble the smell of millions of ripening autumn fruits filled the air from the orchards the women going to their labor in the fields gave each other a quiet goodday whilst their infants pulled down the blackberry branches in the lanes or bowled the early apples down the roads great clusters of black grapes were ready mellowed on the vines that clambered over cabin roof and farmhouse chimney the chimes of the angelus sounded softly from many a little steeple bosomed in the rolling woods an old man going to his work passed by a girl lying asleep in a hollow of the ground beneath a great tree of elder black with berries she was lying with her face turned upward her arms above her head her eyelids were wet her mouth smiled with a dreamy tenderness her lips murmured a little inaudibly her bosom heaved with fast uneven palpitating breaths it was sunrise in the elder thicket little chaffinches were singing and a misselthrush gave late in the year a song of the april weather the east was radiant with the promise of a fair day in which summer and autumn should be wedded with gorgeous pomp of color and joyous chorus of the birds the old man roughly thrust against her breast the heavy wooden shoe on his right foot get up he muttered is it for the like of you to lie and sleep at daydawn get up or your breath will poison the grasses that the cattle feed on and they will die of an elfshot surely she raised her head from where it rested on her outstretched arms and looked him in the eyes and smiled unconsciously then glanced around and rose and dragged her steps away in the passive mechanical obedience begotten by long slavery there was a shiver in her limbs a hunted terror in her eyes she had wandered sleepless all night long beast muttered the old man trudging on with a backward glance at her you have been at a witches sabbath i dare be bound we shall have fine sickness in the styes and byres i wonder would a silver bullet hurt you as the fables say if i were sure it would i would not mind having my old silver flagon melted down though it is the only thing worth a rush in the house she went on through the long wet rank grass not hearing his threats against her she drew her steps slowly and lifelessly through the heavy dews her head was sunk her lips moved audibly and murmured as she went a little gold a little gold maybe some one has shot her this very daydawn thought the peasant shouldering his axe as he went down into the little wood to cut ashsticks for the market she looks half dead already and they say the devilbegotten never bleed the old man guessed aright she had received her mortal wound though it was one bloodless and tearless and for which no moan was made lest any should blame the slayer the sense of some great guilt was on her as she stole through the rosy warmth of the early morning she had thought to take him liberty honor strength and dominion among his fellowsand he had told her that she had dealt him the foulest shame that his life had ever known what right have you to burden me with debt unasked he had cried out against her in the bitterness of his soul and she knew that unasked she had laid on him the debt of life if ever he should know she had wandered on and on aimlessly not knowing what she did all the night through hearing no other sound but the fierce hard scathing scorn of his reproaches he had told her she was in act so criminal and yet she knew herself in intent so blameless she felt like those of whom she had heard in the old hellenic stories who had been doomed by fate guiltless themselves to work some direful guilt which had to be wrought out to its bitter end the innocent yet the accursed instrument of destiny even as adrastus upon atys on and on through the watery moonlight she had fled when she left the watertower that night down the slope of the fields the late blossoms of the poppies and the feathery haze of the ripened grasses tossed in waves from right to left the long shadows of the clouds upon the earth chasing her like the specter hosts of the aaskarreya of his scandinavian skies she had dropped at last like a dying thing broken and breathless on the ground there she crouched and hid her face upon her hands the scorch of an intolerable shame burned on it she did not know what ailed her what consumed her with abhorrence of herself she longed for the earth to yawn and cover her for the lilies asleep in the pool to unclose and take her amidst them every shiver of a leaf under a nightbirds passage every motion of the water as the willow branches swept it made her start and shiver as though some great guilt was on her soul not a breath of wind was stirring not a sound disturbed the serenity of the early night she heard no voice but the plaintive cry of the cushat she saw no snakes but the keen stars which looked on her cold and luminous and indifferent to human woes as the eyes of arslan yet she was afraid afraid with a trembling horror of herself she who had once never known one pulse of fear and who had smiled in the eyes of death as children in their mothers the thrill of a newborn inexplicable cruel consciousness stole like fire through her she knew now that she loved him with that strange mystery of human love which had been forever to her until now a thing apart from her denied to her half scorned half yearned for viewed from afar with derision yet with desire as a thing at once beneath her and beyond her all the light died the moon rose the white lilies shivered in its pallid rays the nightbirds went by on the wind she never stirred the passionate warmth of her frame changed to a deadly cold her face was buried in her hands ever and again she shivered and glanced round as the sound of a hares step or the rustle of a bough by a squirrel broke the silence the calm nightworld around her the silvery seas of reeds the dusky woods the moon in its ring of golden vapor the flickering foliage the gleam of the glowworm in the dew all the familiar things amidst which her feet had wandered for twelve summers in the daily measure of those beaten tracks all these seemed suddenly strange to hermysterious unreal she longed for the day to dawn again though day was but an hour dead and yet she felt that at the first break of light she must flee and hide from his and every eye she had meant to give him honor and he had upbraided her gift as shame the bitterness the cruelty the passion of his reproaches stung her with their poison as in her vision of the reed she had seen the barbed tongues of a thousand snakes striking through and through the frail despised blossomless slave of the wind she had thought that as the god to the reed so might he to her say hereafter you are the lowliest and least of all the chanceborn things of the sands and the air and yet through you has an immortal music arisenand for the insanity of her thought he had cursed her towards dawn where she had sunk down in the moss and in the thickets of elder and thornwhere she had made her bed in her childhood many a summer night when she had been turned out from the doors of the millhousethere for a little while a fitful exhausted sleep came to her the intense exhaustion of bodily fatigue overcoming and drugging to slumber the fever and the wakefulness of the mind the thrush came out of the thorn while it was still quite dark and the morning stars throbbed in the skies and sang his daysong close about her head in her sleep she smiled for oneirus was merciful and she dreamed that she slept folded close in the arms of arslan and in her dreams she felt the kisses of his lips rain fast on hers then the old peasant trudging to his labor in the obscurity of the early day saw her and struck at her with his foot and woke her roughly and muttered get thee up is it such beggars as thee that should be abed when the sun breaks she opened her eyes and smiled on him unconsciously as she had smiled in her brief oblivion the passion of her dreams was still about her her mouth burned her limbs trembled the air seemed to her filled with music like the sound of the mavis singing in the thorn then she remembered and shuddered and arose knowing the sweet mad dream which had cheated her a lie for she awoke alone she did not heed the old mans words she did not feel his hurt yet she obeyed him and left the place and dragged herself feebly towards ypres by the sheer unconscious working of that instinct born of habit which takes the ox or the ass back undriven through the old accustomed ways to stand beside their plowshare or their harness faithfully and unbidden where the stream ran by the old millsteps the riverreeds were blowing in the wind with the sunrays playing in their midst and the silver wings of the swallows brushing them with a sweet caress i thought to be the reed chosen by the gods she said bitterly in her heart but i am not worthyeven to die for she would have asked of fate no nobler thing than thisto be cut down as the reed by the reaper if so be that through her the world might be brought to hearken to the music of the lips that she loved she drew her aching weary limbs feebly through the leafy ways of the old millgarden the first leaves of autumn fluttered down upon her head the last scarlet of the roses flashed in her path as she went the winelike odors of the fruits were all about her on the air it was then fully day the sun was up the bells rang the sixth hour far away from the high towers and spires of the town at the millhouse and in the millyard where usually every one had arisen and were hard at labor whilst the dawn was dark everything was still there was no sign of work the light blazed on the panes of the casements under the eaves but its summons failed to arouse the sleepers under the roof the bees hummed around their houses of straw the pigeons flew to and fro between the timbers of the walls and the boughs of the fruit trees the mule leaned his head over the bar of the gate and watched with wistful eyes the cow in her shed lowed impatient for some human hands to unbar her door and lead her forth to her greenclovered pasture a dumb boy who aided in the working of the mill sat astride of a log of timber kicking his feet among the long grasses and blowing thistle down above his head upon the breeze the silence and the inactivity startled her into a sense of them as no noise or movement curses or blows could have done she looked around stupidly the windowshutters of the housewindows were closed as though it were still night she signed rapidly to the dumb boy what has happened why is the mill not at work thus late the boy left off blowing the thistle feathers on the wind and grinned and answered on his hands flamma is almost dead they say and he grinned again and laughed as far as his uncouth and guttural noises could be said to approach the triumph and the jubilance of laughter she stared at him blankly for awhile bewildered and shaken from the stupor of her own misery she had never thought of death and her tyrant in unison he had seemed a man formed to live on and on and on unchanging for generations he was so hard so unyielding so hale so silent so callous to all pain it had ever seemed to herand to the country roundthat death itself would never venture to come to wrestle with him she stood among the red and the purple and the russet gold of the latest summer flowers in the millgarden where he had scourged her as a little child for daring to pause and cool her burning face in the sweetness of the white lilies could that ruthless arm be unnerved even by age or deathit seemed to her impossible all was quite still nothing stirred except the silvery gnats of the morning and the bees and the birds in the leaves there seemed a strange silence everywhere and the great wheels stood still in the millwater never within the memory of any in that countryside had those wheels failed to turn at sunrise unless locked by a winterfrost she hastened her steps and went within the clock ticked the lean cat mewed other sound there was none she left her wooden shoes at the bottom step and stole up the steep stairs the woman pitchou peered with a scared face out from her masters chamber where hast been all night she whispered in her grating voice thy grandsire lies adying dying ay muttered the old peasant he had a stroke yesternight as he came from the cornfair they brought him home in the cart he is as good as dead you are glad hush muttered the girl fiercely and she dropped down on the topmost step and rested her head on her hands she had nothing to grieve for and yet there was that in the coarse congratulation which jarred on her and hurt her she thought of manon dax dead in the snow she thought of the songbirds dead in the traps she thought of the poor comingcomingcomingthrough so many winters to beg bread and going away with empty hands and burdened hearts cursing god was this deathbed all their vengeance it was but poor justice and came late old pitchou stood and looked at her will he leave her the gold or no she questioned in herself musing whether or no it were better to be civil to the one who might inherit all his wealth or might be cast adrift upon the worldwho could say which after awhile follefarine rose silently and brushed her aside and went into the room it was a poor chamber with a bed of straw and a rough bench or two and a wooden cross with the picture of the ascension hung above it the square window was open a knot of golden pearleaves nodded to and fro a linnet sang on the bed claudis flamma lay dead already except for the twitching of his mouth and the restless wanderings of his eyes yet not so lost to life but that he knew her at a glance and as she entered glared upon her and clinched his numbed hands upon the straw and with a horrible effort in his almost lifeless limbs raised the right arm that alone had any strength or warmth left in it and pointed at her with a shriek she was a sainta saint god took her so i saidand was proud while all the while man begot on her that then with a ghastly rattle in his throat he quivered and lay paralyzed again only the eyes were alive and were still speakingawfully follefarine went up to his bed and stood beside it looking down on him you meanmy mother it was the first time that she had ever said the word her voice lingered on the word as though loath to leave its unfamiliar sweetness he lay and looked at her motionless impatient lifeless save only for the bleak and bloodshot stare of the stony eyes she thought that he had heard but he made no sign in answer she sank down on her knees beside his bed and put her lips close to him try and speak to me of my motheronceonce she murmured with a pathetic longing in her voice a shudder shook his frozen limbs he made no answer he only glared on her with a terrible stare that might be horror repentance grief memory fearshe could not tell old pitchou stretched her head from the corner as a hooded snake from its hole ask where the money is hid she hissed in a shrill whisper askaskwhile he can yet understand he understood for a smile grim and horrible disturbed his tight lips a moment follefarine did not hear tell me of my mothertell me tell me she muttered since a human love had been born in her heart she had thought often of that mother whose eyes had never looked on her and whose breast had never fed her his face changed but he did not speak he gasped for breath and lay silent his eyes trembled and confused it might be that in that moment remorse was with him and the vain regrets of cruel years it might be that dying thus he knew that from his hearth as from hell mother and child had both been driven whilst his lips had talked of god a little bell rang softly in the orchard below the casement the clear voice of a young boy singing a canticle crossed the voice of the linnet there was a gleam of silver in the sun the church bore its host to the dying man they turned her from the chamber the eyes of one unsanctified might not gaze upon mysteries of the blest she went out without resistance she was oppressed and stupefied she went to the stairs and there sat down again resting her forehead on her hands the door of the chamber was a little open and she could hear the murmurs of the priests words and smell the odors of the sacred chrism a great bitterness came on her mouth one crust in loveto themin the deadly winters had been better worth than all this oil and prayer she thought and she could see nothing but the old famished face of manon dax in the snow and the moonlight as the old woman had muttered god is good the officers of the church ceased there reigned an intense stillness a stillness as of cold suddenly the voice of claudis flamma rang out loud and shrill i loved her oh godthou knowest she rose and looked through the space of the open door into the deathchamber he had sprung half erect and with his arms outstretched gazed at the gladness and the brightness of the day in his eyes there was a mortal agony a passion of reproach with one last supreme effort he raised the crucifix which the priests had laid upon his bare anointed breast and held it aloft and shook it and spat on it and cast it forth from him broken upon the ground even thou art a liar he criedit was the cry of the soul leaving the bodywith the next moment he fell backdead in that one cry his heart had spoken the cold hard heart that yet had shut one great love and one great faith in it and losing these had broken and shown no wound for what agony had been like unto his since who could render him back on earth or in the grave that pure white soul he had believed in once yeawho not man not even god therefore had he suffered without hope she went away from the house and down the stairs and out into the ruddy noon she took her way by instinct to the orchard and there sat down upon a mossgrown stone within the shadow of the leaves all sense was deadened in her under a deep unutterable pity from where she sat she could see the wicket window the gabled end of the chamber and where the linnet sang and the yellow fruit of the peartree swung all about was the drowsy hot weather of the fruit harvest the murmur of bees the sweep of the boughs in the water never in all the years that they had dwelt together beneath one roof had any good word or fair glance been given her he had nourished her on bitterness and for his wage paid her a curse yet her heart was sore for him and judged him without hatred all things seemed clear to her now that a human love had reached her and this man also having loved greatly and been betrayed became sanctified in her sight she forgot his brutality his avarice his hatred she remembered only that he had loved and in his love been fooled and so had lost his faith in god and man and had thus staggered wretchedly down the darkness of his life hating himself and every other and hurting every other human thing that touched him and crying ever in his blindness o lord i believe help thou mine unbelief and now he was dead what did it matter whether any soul of his lived again or whether body and mind both died forever what would it benefit all those whom he had slainthe little fair birds poisoned in their song the little sickly children starved in the long winters the miserable women hunted to their graves for some small debt of fuel or bread the wretched poor mocked in their famine by his greed and gain it had been woe for him that his loved had wronged him and turned the hard excellence of his life to stone but none the less had it been woe to them to fall and perish because his hand would never spare his heart would never soften her heart was sick with the cold bitter and inexorable law which had let this man drag out his seventy years cursing and being cursed and lose all things for a dream of god and then at the last upon his deathbed know that dream likewise to be false it is so cruel it is so cruel she muttered where she sat with dry eyes in the shade of the leaves looking at that window where death was and she had reason for there is nothing so cruel in life as a faiththe faith whatever its name may be that draws a man on all his years through on one narrow path by one tremulous light and then at the last with a laugh drowns him chapter iv the summer day went by no one sought her she did not leave the precincts of the still millgardens a sort of secrecy and stillness seemed to bind her footsteps there and she dreaded to venture forth lest she should meet the eyes of arslan the notary had put seals upon all the cupboards and desks two hired watchers sat in the little darkened room above some tapers burned beside his bed the great clock ticked heavily all the house was closed without burned the great roses of the late summer and the scorch of a cloudless sun the wheels of the mill stood still people came and went many women among them the death of the miller of ypres was a shock to all his countryside there was scarce a face that did not lighten as the peasants going home at the evening met one another in the mellow fields and called across hast heard flamma is deadat last no woman came across the meadows with a little candle and kneeled down by his body and wept and blessed the stiff and withered hands for the good that they had wrought and for the gifts that they had given the hot dayhours stole slowly by all was noiseless there where she sat lost in the stupefied pain of her thoughts in the deep shadow of the leaves where the first breath of the autumn had gilded them and varied them here and there with streaks of red no one saw her no one remembered her no one came to her she was left in peace such peace as is the lot of those for whose sigh no human ear is open for whose need no human hand is stretched once indeed at noonday the old servingwoman sought her and had forced on her some simple meal of crusts and eggs for who can tell the shrewd old norway crone thought to herselfwho can tell she may get all the treasure who knows and if so it will be best to have been a little good to her this day and to seem as if one had forgiven about the chain of coins for pitchou like the world at large would pardon offenses if for pardon she saw a sure profit in gold who will he have left all the wealth to think you the old peasant muttered with a cunning glitter in her sunken eyes standing by her at noon in the solitude where the orchards touched the millstream the wealthwhose wealth follefarine echoed the word stupidly she had had no thought of the hoarded savings of that long life of theft and of oppression she had had no remembrance of any possible inheritance which might accrue to her by this sudden death she had been too long his goaded and galled slave to be able to imagine herself his heir ay his wealth answered the woman standing against the water with her wooden shoes deep in dockleaves and grass gazing with a curious eager grasping greed in her eyes at the creature whom she had always done her best to thwart to hurt to starve and to slander ay his wealth you who look so sharp after your bits of heathen coins cannot for sure pretend to forget the value he must have laid by living as he has lived all the days from his youth upward there must be a rare mass of gold hid away somewhere or anotherthe notary knows i supposeit is all in the place that i am sure he was too wise ever to trust money far from home he knew well it was a gadabout that once you part with never comes back to you it must be all in the secret places in the thatch under the hearthstone in the rafters under the bricks and maybe there will be quite a fortune he had so much and he lived so near where think you it will go a faint bitter smile flickered a moment over follefarines mouth it should go to the poor it belongs to them it was all coined out of their hearts and their bodies then you have no hope for yourselfyou i she muttered the word dreamily and raised her aching eyelids and stared in stupefaction at the old haggard dark ravenous face of pitchou pshaw you cannot cheat me that way said the woman moving away through the orchard branches muttering to herself as if a thing of hell like you ever served like a slave all these years on any other hope than the hope of the gold wellas for mei never pretend to lie in that fashion if it had not been for the hope of a share in the gold i would never have eaten for seventeen years the old wretchs mouldy crusts and lentilwashings she hobbled grumbling on her way back to the house through the russet shadows and the glowing gold of the orchards follefarine sat by the water musing on the future which had opened to her with the womans words of greed before another day had sped it was possibleso even said one who hated her and begrudged her every bit and drop that she had taken at the misers boardpossible that she would enter into the heritage of all that this long life spent in rapacious greed and gain had gathered together one night earlier paradise itself would have seemed to open before her with such a hope for she would have hastened to the feet of arslan and there poured all treasure that chance might have given her and would have cried out of the fullness of her heart take enjoy be free do as you will so that you make the world of men own your greatness i will live as a beggar all the years of my life and think myself richer than kings but now what use would it be though she were called to an empire she would not dare to say to him as a day earlier she would have said with her first breath all that is mine is thine she would not even dare to give him all and creep away unseen unthanked unhonored into obscurity and oblivion for had he not said you have no right to burden me with debt yet as she sat there lonely among the grasses with the great millwheels at rest in the water and the swallows skimming the surface that was freed from the churn and the foam of the wheels as though the day of flammas death had been a saints day the fancy which had been set so suddenly before her dazzled her and her aching brain and her sick despair could not choose but play with it despite themselves if the fortune of flamma came to her it might be possible she thought to spend it so as to release him from his bondage without knowledge of his own so to fashion with it a golden temple and a golden throne for the works of his hand that the world which as they all said worshiped gold should be forced to gaze in homage on the creations of his mind and hand and yet he had said greater shame there could come to no man than to rise by the aid of a woman the apple of life however sweet and fair in its color and savor would be as poison in his mouth if her hand held it that she knew and in the humility of her great and reverent love she submitted without question to its cruelty at night she went within to break her fast and try to rest a little the old peasant woman served her silently and for the first time willingly who can say the norman thought to herselfwho can say she may yet get it all who knows at night as she slept pitchou peered at her shading the light from her eyes if only i could know who gets the gold she muttered her sole thought was the money the money that the notary held under his lock and seal she wished now that she had dealt better with the girl sometimes it would have been safer and it could have done no harm with earliest dawn follefarine fled again to the refuge of the wood she shunned with the terror of a hunted doe the sight of people coming and going the priests and the gossips the sights and the sounds and none sought her all the day through she wandered in the cool dewy orchardways beyond the walls of the foliage she saw the shrouded window the flash of the crucifix the throngs of the mourners the glisten of the white robes she heard the deep sonorous swelling of the chants she saw the little procession come out from the doorway and cross the old wooden bridge and go slowly through the sunlight of the meadows many of the people followed singing and bearing tapers for he who was dead had stood well with the church and from such there still issues for the living a fair savor no one came to her what had they to do with hera creature unbaptized and an outcast she watched the little line fade away over the green and golden glory of the fields she did not think of herselfsince arslan had looked at her in his merciless scorn she had had neither past nor future it did not even occur to her that her home would be in this place no longer it was as natural to her as its burrow to the cony its hole to the fox it did not occur to her that the death of this her tyrant could not but make some sudden and startling change in all her ways and fortune she waited in the woods all day it was so strange a sense to her to be free of the bitter bondage that had lain on her life so long she could not at once arise and understand the meaning of her freedom she was like a captive soldier who has dragged the cannonball so long that when it is loosened from his limb it feels strange and his step sounds uncompanioned she was thankful too for the tortured beasts and the hunted birds she fed them and looked in their gentle eyes and told them that they were free but in her own heart one vain wish only achedshe thought always if only i might die for himas the reed for the god the people returned and then after awhile all went forth again they and their priests with them the place was left alone the old solitude had come upon it the sound of the wooddove only filled the quiet the day grew on in the orchards it was already twilight whilst on the waters and in the open lands farther away the sun was bright there was a wicket close by under the boughs a bridlepath ran by mossgrown and little used but leading from the public road beyond from the gleam of the twisted fruit trees a low flutelike noise came to her ear in the shadow of the solitude follefarinei go on your errand if you repent there is time yet to stay me saydo you bid me still set your norsegod free from the cave of the snakes she startled looked up into the roofing of the thick foliage she saw shining on her with a quiet smile the eyes which she had likened to the eyes of the red mouse they scanned her gravely and curiously they noted the change in her since the last sun had set what did he say to you for your gold the old man asked she was silent the blood of an intolerable shame burned in her face she had not thought that she had betrayed her motive in seeking a price for her chain of coins he laughed a little softly ah you fancied i did not know your design when you came so bravely to sell your moorish dancinggear oh follefarinefemale things with eyes like yours must never hope to keep a secret she never answered she had risen and stood rooted to the ground her head hung down her breast heaving the blood coming and going in her intolerable pain as though she flushed and froze under a surgeons probe what did he say to you pursued her questioner there should be but one language possible from a man of his years to a woman of yours she lifted her eyes and spoke at last he said that i did him a foul shame the gold lies in the sands of the river she was strong to speak the truth inflexibly to the full for its degradation to herself she knew was honor to the absent it showed him strong and cold and untempted preferring famine and neglect and misery to any debt or burden of a service done the old man leaning on the wooden bar of the gate among the leaves looked at her long and thoughtfully he would not take your poor little pieces you mean that she gave a sign of assent that was a poor reward to you follefarine her lips grew white and shut together mine was the fault the folly he was right no doubt you are very royal i think your northern god was only thus cold because your gift was such a little one follefarine a strong light flashed on him from her eyes it would have been the same if i had offered him an empire you are so sure does he hate you thenthis god of yours she quivered from head to foot but her courage would not yield her faith would not be turned need a man hate the dust under his foot she muttered in her teeth because it is a thing too lowly for him to think of as he walks you are very truthful she was silent standing there in the shadow of the great milltimbers the old man watched her with calm approving eyes as he might have watched a statue of bronze he was a great man a man of much wealth of wide power of boundless selfindulgence of a keen serene wisdom which made his passions docile and ministers to his pleasure and never allowed them any mastery over himself he was studying the shape of her limbs the hues of her skin the lofty slender stature of her and the cloud of her hair that was like the golden gleaming mane of a young desert mare all these in paris he was thinking just as she is with just the same bare feet and limbs the same untrammeled gait the same flash of scarlet round her loins only to the linen tunic a hem of gold and on the breast a flame of opals paris would say that even i had never in my many years done better the poor barbarian she sells her little brazen sequins and thinks them her only treasure whilst she has all that is arslan blind or is he only tired but he spake none of his thoughts aloud he was too wary to scare the prey he meant to secure with any screams of the sped arrow or any sight of the curled lasso well he said simply i understand your eagle in recompense for your endeavors to set him free only tears your heart with his talons it is the way of eagles he has wounded you sorely and the wound will bleed many a day she lifted her head have i complainedhave i asked your pity or any mans oh no you are very strong so is a lioness but she dies of a mans wound sometimes he has been very base to you he has done as he thought it right to do who shall lay blame on him for that your loyalty says so you are very brave no doubt but tell me do you still wish this man who wounds you so cruelly set free yes what still why not why not only this that once he is let loose your very memory will be shaken from his thoughts as the dust of the summer to which you liken yourself is shaken from his feet no doubt she thought she did not let him see the agony he dealt her she stood unflinching her hands crossed upon her breast her head drooped her eyes looking far from him to where the fading sunlight gleamed still upon the reaches of the river no doubt he echoed and yet i think you hardly understand this man is a great artist he has a great destiny if he once can gain the eye and the ear of the world the world will fear him and curse him always he is very merciless to it but if he once conquer fame that fame will be one to last as long as the earth lasts that i believe well give this man what he longs for and strives for a life in his fame which shall not die so long as men have breath to speak of art what will you be in that great drunken dream of his if once we make it true for him not even a remembrance follefarine for though you have fancied that you by your beauty would at least abide upon his canvas and so go on to immortality with his works and name you seem not to know that so much also will do any mime who lets herself for hire on a tavern stage or any starveling who makes her daily bread by giving her face and form to a painters gaze child what you have thought noble men and women have decreed one of the vilest means by which a creature traffics in her charms the first lithelimbed model that he finds in the cities will displace you on his canvas and in his memory shall he go freeto forget you she listened dumbly her attitude unchanging as she had stood in other days under the shadow of the boughs to receive the stripes of her master he shall be freeto forget me the words were barely audible but they were inflexible as they were echoed through her locked teeth the eyes of her tormentor watched her with a wondering admiration yet he could not resist the pleasure of an added cruelty as the men of the torturechambers of old strained once more the fair fettered form of a female captive that they might see a little longer those bright limbs quiver and those bare nerves heave well be it so if you will it only think long enough for strong though you are you are also weak for you are of your mothers sex follefarine you may repent think well you are no more to him than your eponym the milldust you have said so to yourself but you are beautiful in your barbarism and here you are always near him and with a man who has no gold to give a woman need have few rivals to fear if his heart eat itself out here in solitude soon or late he will be yours follefarine a man be he what he will cannot live long without some love more or less for some woman a little while and your norsegod alone here disappointed embittered friendless galled by poverty and powerless to escape will turn to you and find a sweetness on your lips a balm in your embrace an opium draught for an hour at least in that wonderful beauty of yours a woman who is beautiful and who has youth and who has passion need never fail to make a lovelight beam in the eyes of a man if only she know how to wait if only she be the sole blossom that grows in his pathway the sole fruit within reach of his hands keep him here and soon or late out of sheer despair of any other paradise he will make his paradise in your breast do you doubt child i have known the world many years but this one thing i have ever known to be stronger than any strength a man can bring against it to withstand itthis one thing which fate has given you the bodily beauty of a woman his voice ceased softly in the twilightthis voice of mephistopheleswhich tempted her but for the sheer sole pleasure of straining this strength to see if it should breakof deriding this faith to see if it would bendof alluring this soul to see if it would fall she stood abased in a piteous shamethe shame that any man should thus read her heart which seemed to burn and wither up all liberty all innocence all pride in her and leave her a thing too utterly debased to bear the gaze of any human eyesto bear the light of any noonday sun and yet the terrible sweetness of the words tempted her with such subtle force the passions of a fierce amorous race ran in her bloodthe ardor and the liberty of an outlawed and sensual people were bred with her flesh and blood to have been the passiontoy of the man she loved for one single dayto have felt for one brief summer hour his arms hold her and his kisses answer hers she would have consented to die a hundred deaths in uttermost tortures when the morrow should have dawned and would have died rejoicing crying to the last breath i have lived it is enough he might be hers the mere thought uttered in anothers voice thrilled through her with a tumultuous ecstasy hot as flame potent as wine he might be hersall her owneach pulse of his heart echoing hers each breath of his lips spent on her own he might be hersshe hid her face upon her hands a million tongues of fire seemed to curl about her and lap her life the temptation was stronger than her strength she was a friendless loveless nameless thing and she had but one idolatry and one passion and for this joy that they set to her lips she would have given her body and her soul her soulif the gods and man allowed her oneher soul and all her life mortal and immortal for one single day of arslans love her soul forever to any hell they wouldbut his not for this had she sold her life to the godsnot for this not for the rapture of passion the trance of the senses the heaven of self what she had sworn to them if they saved him was forever to forget in him herself to suffer dumbly for him and whensoever they would in his stead to die choose said the soft wooing voice of her tempter while his gaze smiled on her through the twilight shall he consume his heart here in solitude till he loves you perforce or shall he go free among the cities of men to remember you no more than he remembers the reeds by the river the reeds by the river the chance words that he used by the mere hazards of speech cut the bonds of passion which were binding so closely about her as the riverreed to the god so she had thought that her brief span of life might be to the immortality of his was this the fulfilling of her faithto hold him here with his strength in chains and his genius perishing in darkness that she the thing of an hour might know delight in the reluctant love in the wearied embrace of a man heartsick and heartbroken she shook the deadly sweetness of the beguilement off her as she would have shaken an asps coils off her wrist and rose against it and was once more strong what have you to do with me she muttered feebly while the fierce glare of her eyes burned through the gloom of the leaves keep your word set him free his freedom let him useas he will then ere he could arrest her flight she had plunged into the depths of the orchards and was lost in their flickering shadows sartorian did not seek to pursue her he turned and went thoughtfully and slowly back by the grassgrown footpath through the little wood along by the riverside to the watertower his horses and his people waited near but it suited him to go thither on this errand on foot and alone the red mouse does not dwell in that soul as yet that sublime unreasonthat grand barbaric madness and yet both will fall to gold as that fruit falls to the touch he thought as he brushed a ripe yellow pear from the shelter of the reddening leaves and watched it drop and crushed it gently with his foot and smiled as he saw that though so golden on the rind and so white and so fragrant in the flesh at the core was a rotten speck in which a little black worm was twisting he had shaken it down from idleness where he left it crushed in the public pathway a swarm of ants and flies soon crawled and flew and fought and fastened and fed on the fallen purity which the winds had once tossed up to heaven and the sun had once kissed into bloom through the orchards as his footsteps died away there came a shrill scream on the silence which only the sighing of the cushats had broken it was the voice of the old servingwoman who called on her name from the porch in the old instinct born of long obedience she drew herself wearily through the tangled ways of the gardens and over the threshold of the house she had lost all remembrance of flammas death and of the inheritance of his wealth she only thought of those great and noble fruits of a mans genius which she had given up all to save she only thought ceaselessly in the sickness of her heart will he forgetforget quitewhen he is free the peasant standing in the porch with arms akimbo and the lean cat rubbing ravenous sides against her wooden shoes peered forth from under the rich red leaves of the creepers that shrouded the pointed roof of the doorway her wrinkled face was full of malignity her toothless mouth smiled her eyes were full of a greedy triumph before her was the shady quiet leafy garden with the water running clear beneath the branches behind her was the kitchen with its floor of tiles its strings of food its woodpiled hearth its crucifix and its images of saints she looked at the tired limbs of the creature whom she had always hated for her beauty and her youth at the droop of the proud head at the pain and the exhaustion which every line of the face and the form spoke so plainly at the eyes which burned so strangely as she came through the gray pure air and yet had such a look in them of sightlessness and stupor she has been told thought the old servingwoman she has been told and her heart breaks for the gold the thought was sweet to herprecious with the preciousness of vengeance come within she said with a grim smile about her mouth i will give thee a crust and a drink of milk none shall say i cannot act like a christian and tonight i will let thee rest here in the loft but no longer with the break of day thou shalt tramp we are christians here follefarine looked at her with blind eyes comprehending nothing that she spoke you called me she asked the old mechanical formula of servitude coming to her lips by sheer unconscious instinct ay i called i would have thee to know that i am mistress here now and i will have no vile things gad about in the night so long as they eat of my bread tonight thou shalt rest here i say so much will i do for sake of thy mother though she was a foul light o love when all men deemed her a saint but tomorrow thou shalt tramp such hellspawn as thou art mayst not lie on a bed of holy church follefarine gazed at her confused and still not comprehending scarcely awake to the voice which thus adjured her all her strength spent and bruised after the struggle of the temptation which had assailed her you mean she muttered you meanwhat would you tell me i do not know the familiar place reeled around her the saints and the satyrs on the carved gables grinned on her horribly the yellow houseleek on the roof seemed to her so much gold which had a tongue and muttered you prate of the soul i alone am the soul of the world all the green shadowy tranquil ways grew strange to her the earth shook under her feet the heavens circled around herand pitchou looking on her thought that she was stunned by the loss of the misers treasure she in whose whole burning veins there ran only one passion in whose crushed brain there was only one thoughtwill he forgetforget quitewhen he is free the old woman stretched her head forward and cackled out eager hissing tumultuous words hast not heard no well see then some said you should be sent for but the priest and i said no neither law nor church count the lovebegotten flamma died worth forty thousand francs set aside all his land and household things god rest his soul he was a man he forgot my faithful service true but the good almoner will remember all that to me forty thousand francs what a man and hardly a nettle boiled in oil would he eat some days together where does this money goeh eh canst guess go pitchou watched her grimly and laughed aloud ah ah i know so you dared to hope too oh fool what thing did ever he hate as he hated your shadow on the wall the money and the lands and the thingsevery coin every inch every crumbis willed away to the church to the holy chapter in the town yonder to hold for the will of god and the glory of his kingdom and masses will be said for his soul daily in the cathedral and the gracious almoner has as good as said that the mill shall be let to francvron the baker who is old and has no women to his house and that i shall dwell here and manage all things and rule francvron and end my days in the chimney corner and i will stretch a point and let you lie in the hay tonight but tomorrow you must tramp for the devils daughter and holy church will scarce go to roost together follefarine heard her stupidly and stupidly gazed around she did not understand she had never had any other home and in a manner even in the apathy of a far greater woe she clove to this place to its familiarity and its silence and its old woodlandways goshe looked down through the aisles of the boughs dreamily in a vague sense she felt the sharpness of desolation that repulses the creature whom no human heart desires and whom no human voice bids stay yes go and that quickly said the peasant with a sardonic grin i serve the church now it is not for me to harbor such as thee nor is it fit to take the bread of the poor and the pious to feed lips as accursed as are thine thou mayst lie here tonighti would not be overharshbut tarry no longer take a sup and a bit and to bed dost hear follefarine without a word in answer turned on her heel and left her the old woman watched her shadow pass across the threshold and away down the gardenpaths between the green lines of the clipped box and vanish beyond the fall of drooping figboughs and the walls of ivy and of laurel then with a chuckle she poured out her hot coffee and sat in her corner and made her evening meal well pleased comfort was secured her for the few years which she had to live and she was revenged for the loss of the sequins how well it is for me that i went to mass every saintsday she thought foreseeing easy years and plenty under the rule of the church and of old deaf francvron the baker follefarine mounted the wooden ladder to the hayloft which had been her sleepingchamber there took the little linen and the few other garments which belonged to her folded them together in her winter sheepskin and went down the wooden steps once more and out of the millgarden across the bridge into the woods she had no fixed purpose even for the immediate hour she had not even a tangible thought for her future she acted on sheer mechanical impulse like one who does some things unconsciously walking abroad in the trance of sleep that she was absolutely destitute scarcely bore any sense to her she had never realized that this begrudged roof and scanty fare which flamma had bestowed on her had wretched though they were yet been all the difference between home and homelessnessbetween existence and starvation she wandered on aimlessly through the woods she paused a moment on the riversand and turned and looked back at the mill and the house from where she stood she could see its brown gables and its peaked roof rising from masses of orchardblossom white and wide as seafoam further round it closed the dark belt of the sweet chestnut woods she looked and great salt tears rushed into her hot eyes and blinded them she had been hated by those who dwelt there and had there known only pain and toil and blows and bitter words and yet the place itself was dear to her its homely and simple look its quiet gardenways its dells of leafy shadow its bright and angry waters its furred and feathered creatures that gave it life and lovelinessthese had been her consolations oftenthese in a way she loved such as it was her life had been bound up with it and though often its cool pale skies and level lands had been a prison to her yet her heart clove to it in this moment when she left itforever she looked once at it long and lingeringly then turned and went on her way she walked slowly through the cool evening shadows while the birds fluttered about her head she did not comprehend the terrible fate that had befallen her she did not think that it was horrible to have no canopy but the clear sky and no food but the grain rubbed from the ripe wheatears the fever of conscious passion which had been born in her and the awe of the lonely death that she had witnessed wore on her too heavily and with too dreamy and delirious an absorption to leave any room in her thoughts for the bodily perils or the bodily privations of her fate some vague expectancy of some great horror she knew not what was on her she was as in a trance her brain was giddy her eyes blind though she walked straightly bearing her load upon her head on and on as through the familiar paths she yet had no goal no sense of what she meant to do or whither she desired to go the people were still about going from their work in the fields and their day at the townmarket to their homesteads and huts every one of them cast some word at her for the news had spread by sunset over all the countryside that flammas treasure was gone to holy church they were spoken in idleness but they were sharp flouting merciless arrows of speech that struck her hardly as the speakers cast them and laughed and passed by her she gave no sign that she heard not by so much as the quiver of a muscle or the glance of an eye but she nevertheless was stung by them to the core and her heart hardened and her blood burned not one of them man or boy but made a mock of her as they marched by through the purpling leaves or the tall seedgrasses not one of them mother or maiden that gave a gentle look at her or paused to remember that she was homeless and knew no more where to lay her head that night than any sick hart driven from its kind she met many in the soft gray and golden evening in the fruithung ways along the edge of the meadows fathers with their little children running by them laden with plumes of meadowsweet mothers bearing their youngest born before them on the high sheepskin saddle young lovers talking together as they drove the old cow to her byre old people counting their market gains cheerily children paddling kneedeep in the brooks for cresses none of them had a kindly glance for herall had a flouting word there was not one who offered her so much as a draught of milk not one who wished her so much as a brief goodnight she will quit the country now that is one good thing she heard many of them say of her and they spoke of flamma and praised him saying how pure as myrrh in the nostrils was the death of one who feared god the night came on nearer the ways grew more lonely the calf bleating sought its dam the sheep folded down close together the lights came out under the lowly roofs now and then from some open window in the distance there came the sound of voices singing together now and then there fell across her path two shadows turning one to the other she only was alone what did she seek to do she paused on a little slip of mossgreen timber that crossed the water in the open plain and looked down at herself in the shining stream none desired hernone remembered her none said to her stay with us a little for loves sake surely i must be vile as they say that all are against me she thought and she pondered wearily in her heart where her sin against them could lie that brief delirious trance of joy that had come to her with the setting of the last days sun had with the sun sunk away the visions which had haunted her sleep under the thorntree whilst the thrush sang had been killed under the cold and bitterness of the waking world she wondered while her face burned red with shame what she had been mad enough to dream of in that sweet cruel slumber for himshe felt that sooner than again look upward to his eyes she would die by a thousand deaths what was she to hima barbarous worthless and unlovely thing whose very service was despised whose very sacrifice was condemned i would live as a leper all the days of my life if first i might be fair in his sight one hour she thought and she was conscious of horror or of impiety in the ghastly desire because she had but one religion thisher love she crossed the little bridge and sat down to rest on the root of an old oak on the edge of the fields of poppies the evening had fallen quite there was a bright moon on the edge of the plain the cressetlights of the cathedral glowed through the dusk all was purple and gray and still there were the scents of heavy earths and of wild thymes and the breath of grazing herds the little hamlets were but patches of darker shade on the soft brown shadows of the night white seamists curling and rising chased each other over the dim world she sat motionless leaning her head upon her hand she could not weep as other creatures could the hours drew on she had no home to go to but it was not for this that she sorrowed afar off a step trod down the grasses a hawk rustled through the gloom a rabbit fled across the path the boughs were put aside by a human hand arslan came out from the darkness of the woods before her with a sharp cry she sprang to her feet and fled impelled by passionate reasonless instinct to hide herself forever and forever from the only eyes she loved before her were the maze of the poppyfields in the moonlight their blossoms so gorgeous at sunset or at noon lost all their scarlet gaud and purple pomp and drooped like discrowned kings stripped bare in the midnight of calamity their colorless flowers writhed and twined about her ankles her brown limbs glistened in the gleam from the skies she tightened her red girdle round her loins and ran as a doe runs to reach the sanctuary long withes of trailing grasses weeds that grew among the grasses caught her fleet feet and stopped her the earth was wet with dew a tangle of boughs and brambles filled the path for once her sure steps failed her she faltered and fell ere he could touch her she rose again the scent of the wet leaves was in her hair the raindrops glistened on her feet the light of the stars seemed in her burning eyes around her were the gleam of the night the scent of the flowers the smell of woods on her face the moon shone she was like a creature born from the freshness of dews from the odor of foliage from the hues of the clouds from the foam of the brooks from all things of the woods and the water in that moment she was beautiful with the beauty of women if only she could content me he thought if only he had cared for the song of the reed by the river but he cared nothing at all for anything that lived and a pursuit that was passionless had always seemed to him base and his feet were set on a stony and narrow road where he would not incumber his strength with a thing of her sex lest the burden should draw him backward one rood on his way he had never loved her he never would love her his senses were awake to her beauty indeed and his reason awed it beyond all usual gifts of her sex but he had used it in the service of his art and therein had scrutinized and portrayed and debased until it had lost to him all that fanciful sanctity all that halfmysterious charm which arouse the passion of love in a man to a woman so he let her be and stood by her in the dusk of the night with no light in his own eyes do not fly from me he said to her i have sought you to ask your forgiveness and she stood silent her head bent her hands were crossed upon her chest in the posture habitual to her under any pain her face was hidden in the shadow her little bundle of clothes had dropped on the grasses and was hidden by them of flammas death and of her homelessness he had heard nothing i was harsh to you he said gently i spoke in the bitterness of my heart unworthily i was stung with a great shamei forgot that you could not know can you forgive the madness was mine she muttered it was i who forgot her voice was very faint and left her lips with effort she did not look up she stood bloodless breathless swaying to and fro as a young tree which has been cut through near the root sways ere it falls she knew well what his words would say you are generous and you shame meindeedthus he said with a certain softness as of unwilling pain in his voice which shook its coldness and serenity this greatness in her this wondrous faithfulness to himself this silence which bore all wounds from his hand and was never broken to utter one reproach against him these moved him he could not choose but see that this nature which he bruised and forsook was noble beyond any common nobility of any human thing i have deserved little at your hands and you have given me much he said slowly i feel base and unworthy fori have sought you to bid you farewell she had awaited her deathblow she received its stroke without a sound she did not move nor cry out nor make any sign of pain but standing there her form curled within itself as a withered fern curls and all her beauty changed like a fresh flower that is held in a flame she did not look at him but waited with her head bent and her hands crossed on her breast as a criminal waits for his doom his nerve nearly failed him his heart nearly yielded he had no love for her she was nothing to him no more than any one of the dark nude savage women who had sat to his art on the broken steps of ruined temples of the sun or the antelopeeyed creatures of desert and plain who had come on here before him in the light of the east and had passed as the shadows passed and like them were forgotten she was nothing to him and yet he could not choose but thinkall this mighty love all this majestic strength all this superb and dreamy loveliness would die out here as the evening colors had died out of the skies in the west none pausing even to note that they were dead he knew that he had but to say to her come and she would go beside him whether to shame or ignominy or famine or death triumphant and rejoicing as the martyrs of old went to the flames which were to them the gates of paradise he knew that there would not be a blow his hand could deal which could make her deem him cruel he knew that there would be no crime which he could bid her commit for him which would not seem to her a virtue he knew that for one hour of his love she would slay herself by any death he told her he knew that the deepest wretchedness lived through by his side would be sweeter and more glorious than any kingdom of the world or heaven and he knew well that to no man is it given to be loved twice with such love as this yethe loved not her and he was therefore strong and he drove the deathstroke home with pity with compassion with gentleness yet surely hometo the heart a stranger came to me an hour or more ago he said to her and it seemed even to him as though he slew a life godlier and purer and stronger than his ownan old man who gave no name i have seen his facefar away long agoi am not sure the memory is too vague he seemed a man of knowledge and a man critical and keen that study of youthe one among the poppiesyou remembertook his eyes and pleased him he bore it away with him and left in its stead a roll of paper moneymoney enough to take me back among mento set me free for a little space oh child you have seenthis hell on earth kills me it is a death in life it has made me brutal to you sometimes sometimes i must hurt something or go mad she was silent her attitude had not changed but all her loveliness was like one of the poppies that his foot had trodden on discolored broken ruined she stood as though changed to a statue of bronze he looked on her and knew that no creature had ever loved him as this creature had loved but of love he wanted nothingit was wearying to him all he desired was power among men i have been cruel to you he said suddenly i have stung and wounded you often i have dealt with your beauty as with this flower under my foot i have had no pity for you can you forgive me ere i go you have no sins to me she made answer to him she did not stir nor did the deadly calm on her face change but her voice had a harsh metallic sound like the jar of a bell that is broken he was silent also the coldness and the arrogance of his heart were pained and humbled by her pardon of them he knew that he had been pitiless to herwith a pitilessness less excusable than that which is born of the fierceness of passion and the idolatrous desires of the senses man would have held him blameless here because he had forborne to pluck for his own delight this red and gold reed in the swamp but he himself knew well that nevertheless he had trodden its life out and so bruised it as he went that never would any wind of heaven breathe music through its shattered grace again when do you go she asked her voice had still the same harsh broken sound in it she did not lift the lids of her eyes her arms were crossed upon her breastall the ruins of the trampled poppyblossom were about her bloodred as a field where men have fought and died he answered her at dawn and where to paris i will find fameor a grave a long silence fell between them the church chimes far away in the darkness tolled the ninth hour she stood passive colorless as the poppies were bloodless from the thick dull beating of her heart the purple shadow and the white stars swam around her her heart was broken but she gave no sign it was her nature to suffer to the last in silence he looked at her and his own heart softened almost he repented him he stretched his arms to her and drew her into them and kissed the dewladen weight of her hair and the curling meek form while all warmth had died and the passionate loveliness which was cast to him to be folded in his bosom or thrust away by his footas he chose oh child forgive me and forget me he murmured i have been base to youbrutal and bitter and cold oftentimesyet i would have loved you if i could love would have been youth folly oblivion all the nearest likeness that men get of happiness on earth but love is dead in me i think otherwise she burned like fire and grew cold as ice in his embrace her brain reeled her sight was blind she trembled as she had never done under the sharpest throes of flammas scourge suddenly she cast her arms about his throat and clung to him and kissed him in answer with that strange mute terrible passion with which the lips of the dying kiss the warm and living face that bends above them on which they know they never again will rest then she broke from him and sprang into the maze of the moonlit fields and fled from him like a stag that bears its deathshot in it and knows it and seeks to hide itself and die unseen he pursued her urged by a desire that was cruel and a sorrow that was tender he had no love for her and yetnow that he had thrown her from him foreverhe would fain have felt those hot mute lips tremble again in their terrible eloquence upon his own but he sought her in vain the shadows of the night hid her from him he went back to his home alone it is best so he said to himself for the life that lay before him he needed all his strength all his coldness all his cruelty and she was only a female thinga reed of the river songless and blown by the wind as the rest were he returned to his solitude and lit his lamp and looked on the creations that alone he loved they shall liveor i will die he said to his own heart with the war to which he went what had any amorous toy to do that night hermes had no voice for him else might the wise god have said many reeds grow together by the river and men tread them at will and none are the worse but in one reed of a million song is hidden and when a man carelessly breaks that reed in twain he may miss its music often and longyea all the years of his life but hermes that night spake not and he brake his reed and cast it behind him chapter v when the dawn came it found her lying face downward among the rushes by the river she had run on and on and on blindly not knowing whither she fled with the strange force that despair lends then suddenly had dropped as a young bull drops in the circus with the steel sheathed in its brain there she had remained insensible the blood flowing a little from her mouth it was quite lonely by the waterside a crane among the sedges an owl on the wind a waterlizard under the stones such were the only moving things it was in a solitary bend of the stream its banks were green and quiet there were no dwellings near and there was no light anywhere except the dull glow of the lamp above the calvary no one found her a young fox came and smelt at her and stole frightened away that was all a sharp wind rising with the reddening of the east blew on her and recalled her to consciousness after many hours when her eyes at length opened with a blank stare upon the grayness of the shadows she lifted herself a little and sat still and wondered what had chanced to her the first rays of the sun rose over the dim blue haze of the horizon she looked at it and tried to remember but failed her brain was sick and dull a little beetle green and bronze climbed in and out among the sand of the rivershore her eyes vacantly followed the insects aimless circles she tried to think and could not her thoughts went feebly and madly round and round round and round as the beetle went in his maze of sand it was all so gray so still so chill she was afraid of it her limbs were stiffened by the exposure and dews of the night she shivered and was cold the sun rosea globe of flame above the edge of the world memory flashed on her with its light she rose a little staggering and blind and weakened by the loss of blood she crept feebly to the edge of the stream and washed the stains from her lips and let her face rest a little in the sweet silent flowing water then she sat still amidst the long rushlike grass and thought and thought and wondered why life was so tough and merciless a thing that it would ache on and burn on and keep misery awake to know itself even when its deathblow had been dealt and the steel was in its side she was still only half sensible of her wretchedness she was numbed by weakness and her brain seemed deadened by a hot pain that shot through it as with tongues of flame the little beetle at her feet was busied in a yellower soil than sand he moved round and round in a little dazzling heap of coins and trembling paper thin as gauze she saw it without seeing for awhile then all at once a horror flashed on her she saw that the money had fallen from her tunic she guessed the truththat in his last embrace he had slid into her bosom in notes and in coin half that sum whereof he had spoken as the ransom which had set him free her bloodless face grew scarlet with an immeasurable shame she would have suffered far less if he had killed her he who denied her love to give her gold better that when he had kissed her he had covered her eyes softly with one hand and with the other driven his knife straight through the white warmth of her breast the sight of the gold stung her like a snake goldsuch wage as men flung to the painted harlots gibing at the corners of the streets the horror of the humiliation filled her with loathing of herself unless she had become shameful in his sight she thought he could not have cast this shame upon her she gathered herself slowly up and stood and looked with blind aching eyes at the splendor of the sunrise her heart was breaking her one brief dream of gladness was severed sharply as with a sword and killed forever she did not reasonall thought was stunned in her but as a woman who loves looking on the face she loves will see sure death written there long ere any other can detect it so she knew by the fatal and unerring instinct of passion that he was gone from her as utterly and as eternally as though his grave had closed on him she did not even in her own heart reproach him her love for him was too perfect to make rebuke against him possible to her had he not a right to go as he would to do as he chose to take her or leave her as best might seem to him only he had no right to shame her with what he had deemed shame to himself no right to insult what he had slain she gathered herself slowly up and took his money in her hand and went along the riverbank whither she had no knowledge at first but as she moved against the white light and the cool currents of the morning air her brain cleared a little the purpose that had risen in her slowly matured and strengthened without its sustenance she would have sunk down and perished like a flower cut at the root of all the world that lay beyond the pale of those golden and russet orchards and scarlet lakes of blowing poppies she had no more knowledge than the lizard at her feet cities he had often said were as fiery furnaces that consumed all youth and innocence which touched them for such as she to go to them was he had often said to cast a luscious and golden peach of the summer into the core of a waspsnest nevertheless her mind was resolute to follow himto follow him unknown by him so that if his footsteps turned to brighter paths her shadow might never fall across his ways but so that if need were if failure still pursued him and by failure came misery and death she would be there beside him to share those fatal gifts which none would dispute with her or grudge her to follow him was to her an instinct as natural and as irresistible as it is to the dog to track his masters wanderings she would have starved ere ever she would have told him that she hungered she would have perished by the roadside ere ever she would have cried to him that she was homeless she would have been torn asunder for a meal by wolves ere she would have bought safety or succor by one coin of that gold he had slid into her bosom like the wages of a thing that was vile but to follow him she never hesitated unless this had been possible to her she would have refused to live another hour the love in her at once savage and sublime at once strong as the lions rage and humble as the camels endurance made her take patiently all wrongs at his hands but made her powerless to imagine a life in which he was not she went slowly now through the country in the hush of the waking day he had said that he would leave at dawn in her unconscious agony of the night gone by she had run far and fast ere she had fallen and now upon her waking she had found herself some league from the old millwoods and farther yet from the tower on the river where he dwelt she was weak and the way seemed very long to her ever and again too she started aside and hid herself thinking each step were his she wanted to give him back his gold yet she felt as though one look of his eyes would kill her it was long and the sun was high ere she had dragged her stiff and feeble limbs through the long grasses of the shore and reached the ruined granary crouching down and gazing through the spaces in the stones from which so often she had watched him she saw at once that the place was desolate the great barabbas and the painted panels and canvases and all the pigments and tools and articles of an artists store were gone but the figures on the walls were perforce left there to perish the early light fell full upon them sad and calm and pale living their life upon the stone she entered and looked at them she loved them greatly it pierced her heart to leave them therealone the bound helios working at the mill with white hermes watching mute and contentand persephone crouching in the awful shadow of the dread winged kingthe greek youths with doves in their breasts and golden apples in their handsthe women dancing upon cithaeron in the moonlightthe young gladiator wrestling with the libyan lionall the familiar shapes and stories that made the gray walls teem with the old sweet life of the heroic times were thereleft to the rat and the spider the dust and the damp the slow sad death of a decay which no heart would sorrow for nor any hand arrest the days would come and go the suns would rise and set the nights would fall and the waters flow and the great stars throb above in the skies and they would be therealone to her they were living things beautiful and divine they were bound up with all the hours of her love and at their feet she had known the one brief dream of ecstasy that had sprung up for her great and golden as the prophets gourd and as the gourd in a night had withered she held them in a passionate tendernessthese the first creatures who had spoken to her with a smile and had brought light into the darkness of her life she flung herself on the ground and kissed its dust and prayed for them in an agony of prayerprayed for them that the hour might come and come quickly when men would see the greatness of their maker and would remember them and seek them and bear them forth in honor and in worship to the nations she prayed in an agony prayed blindly and to whom she knew not prayed in the sightless instinct of the human heart towards some greater strength which could bestow at once retribution and consolation nor was it so much for him as for them that she thus prayed in loving them she had reached the pure and impersonal passion of the artist to have them live she would have given her own life then the bonds of her agony seemed to be severed and for the first time she fell into a passion of tears and stretched there on the floor of the forsaken chamber wept as women weep upon a grave when she arose at length she met the eyes of hypnos and oneiros and thanatosthe gentle gods who give forgetfulness to men they were her dear gods her best beloved and most compassionate yet their look struck coldly to her heart sleep dreams and deathwere these the only gifts with which the gods being merciful could answer prayer chapter vi at the little quay in the town many boats were lading and unlading and many setting their sails to go southward with their loads of eggs or of birds of flowers of fruit or of herbage all smelling of summer rain and the odors of freshly plowed earths turned up with the nest of the lark and the root of the cowslip laid bare in them follefarine lost herself in its little busy crowd and learned what she needed without any asking in turn question of her arslan had sailed at sunrise there was a little boat with an old man in it loaded with russian violets from a flowerfarm the old man was angered and in trouble the lad who steered for him had failed him and the young men and boys on the canals were all too busied to be willing to go the voyage for the wretched pittance he offered she heard and leaned towards him do you go the way to paris the old man nodded i will steer for you then she said to him and leaped down among his fragrant freight he was a stranger to her and let her be she did for him as well as another since she said that she knew those waters well he was in haste and without more words he loosened his sail and cut his moorrope and set his little vessel adrift down the waterways of the town the violets filling the air with their odors and blue as the eyes of a child that wakes smiling all the old familiar streets all the dusky gateways and dim passages all the ropes on which the lanterns and the linen hung all the wide carved stairways waterwashed all the dim windows that the women filled with pots of ivy and the song of birdsshe was drifting from them with every pulse of the tide never again to return but she looked at them without seeing them indifferent and having no memory of them her brain and her heart and her soul were with the boat that she followed it was the day of the weekly market the broad flatbottomed boats were coming in at sunrise in each some cargo of green food or of farm produce a strong girl rowing with bare arms and the sun catching the white glint of her headgear boys with coils of spotted birds eggs children with lapfuls of woodgathered primroses old women nursing a wicker cage of cackling hens or hissing geese mules and asses shaking their bells and worsted tassels bearing their riders high on sheepskin saddlesthese all went by her on the river or on the towing path or on the broad highroad that ran for a space by the waters edge all of these knew her well all of these some time or another had jeered her jostled her flouted her or fled from her but no one stopped her no one cared enough for her to care even to wonder whither she went she glided out of the town past the banks she knew so well along the line of the wood and the orchards of ypres but what at another time would have had pain for her and held her with the bonds of a sad familiarity now scarcely moved her one great grief and one great passion had drowned all lesser woes and scorched all slighter memories all day long they sailed at noon the old man gave her a little fruit and a crust as part of her wage she tried to eat them knowing she would want all her strength they left the course of the stream that she knew and sailed farther than she had ever sailed passed towns whose bells were ringing and noble bridges gleaming in the sun and watermills black and gruesome and bright orchards and vineyards heavy with the promise of fruit she knew none of them there were only the water flowing under the keel and the blue sky above with the rooks circling in it which had the look of friends to her the twilight fell still the wind served and still they held on the mists came white and thick and stars rose and the voices from the shores sounded strangely with here and there a note of music or the deep roll of a drum so she drifted out of the old life into an unknown world but she never once looked back why should shehe had gone before when it was quite night they drew near to a busy town whose lights glittered by hundreds and thousands on the bank there were many barges and small boats at anchor in its wharves banging out lanterns at their mastheads the old man bade her steer his boat among them and with a cord he made it fast this is paris she asked breathlessly the old man laughed paris is days sail away i asked you if you went to paris the old man laughed again i said i came the paris way so i have done land her face set with an anger that made him wince dull though his conscience was you cheated me she said briefly and she climbed the boats side and shaking the violets off her set her foot upon the pier not stopping to waste more words but a great terror fell on her she had thought that the boat would bring her straight to paris and once in paris she had thought that it would be as easy to trace his steps there as it had been in the little town that she had left she had had no sense of distanceno knowledge of the size of cities the width and noise and hurry and confusion of this one waterside town made her helpless and stupid she stood like a young lost dog upon the flags of the landingplace not knowing whither to go nor what to do the old man busied in unlading his violets into the wicker creels of the women waiting for them took no notice of her why should he he had used her so long as he had wanted her there were incessant turmoil outcry and uproar round the landingstairs where large cargoes of beetroot cabbages and fish were being put on shore the buyers and the sellers screamed and swore the tawny light of oillamps flickered over their furious faces the people jostled her pushed her cursed her for being in the way she shrank back in bewilderment and disgust and walked feebly away from the edge of the river trying to think trying to get back her old health and her old force the people of the streets were too occupied to take any heed of her only one little ragged boy danced before her a moment shrieking the gypsy the gypsy good little fathers look to your pockets but she was too used to the language of abuse to be moved by it she went on as though she were deaf through the yelling of the children and the chattering and chaffering of the trading multitude there was a little street leading off the quay picturesque and ancient with parquetted houses and quaint painted signs at the corner of it sat an old woman on a wooden stool with a huge fan of linen on her head like a mushroom she was selling roasted chestnuts by the glare of a little horn lantern by this woman she paused and asked the way to paris paris this is a long way from paris how farto walk that depends my boy went up there on foot last summer he is a young fool blotting and messing with ink and paper while he talks of being a great man and sups with the rats in the sewers he i think was a week walking it it is pleasant enough in fair weather but youyou are a gypsy where are your people i have no people she did not know even what this epithet of gypsy which they so often cast at her really meant she remembered the old life of the liebana but she did not know what manner of life it had been and since phratos had left her there no one of his tribe or of his kind had been seen in the little norman town among the orchards the old woman grinned trimming her lantern if you are too bad for them you must be bad indeed you will do very well for paris no doubt and she began to count her chestnuts lest this stranger should steal any of them follefarine took no notice of the words will you show me which is the road to take she asked meanwhile the streetboy had brought three or four of his comrades to stare at her and they were dancing round her with grotesque grimace and singing houpe la houpe la burn her for a witch the woman directed her which road to go as well as she could for the falling darkness and she thanked the woman and went the streetchildren ran at her heels like little curs yelling and hissing foul language but she ran too and was swifter than they and outstripped them the hardy training of her limbs standing her in good service how far she ran or what streets she traversed she could not tell the chestnutseller had said leave the polestar behind you and the star was shining behind her always and she ran south steadily great buildings lighted casements high stone walls groups of people troopers drinking girls laughing men playing dominoes in the taverns women chattering in the coffeehouses a line of priests going to a deathbed with the bell ringing before the host a line of soldiers filing through great doors as the drums rolled the rentree au casernethousands of these pictures glowed in her path a moment with the next to fade and give place to others but she looked neither to the right nor left and held on straightly for the south once or twice a man halloed after her or a soldier tried to stop her once going through the gateway in the southern wall a sentinel challenged her and leveled his bayonet only a second too late but she eluded them all by the swiftness of her flight and the suddenness of her apparition and she got out safe beyond the barriers of the town and on to the road that led to the countrya road quiet and white in the moonlight and bordered on either side with the tall poplars and the dim bare reapen fields which looked to her like dear familiar friends it was lonely and she sat down on a stone by the wayside and rested she had no hesitation in what she was doing he had gone south and she would go likewise that she might fail to find him there never occurred to her of what a city was she had not yet any conception her sole measurement of one was by the little towns whither she had driven the mules to sell the fruits and the fowls to have been cheated of paris and to find herself thus far distant from it appalled her and made her heart sink but it had no power to make her hesitate in the course she took she had no fear and no doubt the worst thing that could have come to her had come already the silence and the strength of absolute despair were on her besides a certain thrill of liberty was on her for the first time in all her life she was absolutely free with the freedom of the will and of the body both she was no longer captive to one place bondslave to one tyranny she was no longer driven with curses and commands and yoked and harnessed every moment of her days to her with the blood of a tameless race in her there was a certain force and elasticity in this deliverance from bondage that lifted some measure of her great woe off her she could not be absolutely wretched so long as the open sky was above her and the smell of the fields about her and on her face the breath of the blowing winds she had that love which is as the bezoar stone of fablean amulet that makes all wounds unfelt and death a thing to smile at in derision without some strong impulsion from without she might never have cut herself adrift from the tyranny that had held her down from childhood and even the one happiness she had known had been but little more than the exchange of one manner of slavery for another but now she was freeabsolutely free and in the calm cool nightin the dusk and the solitude with the smell of the fields around her and above her the stars she knew it and was gladglad even amidst the woe of loneliness and the agony of abandonment the daughter of taric could not be absolutely wretched so long as the open air was about her and the world was before her wherein to roam she sat awhile by the roadside and counted his gold by the gleam of the stars and put it away securely in her girdle and drank from a brook beside her and tried to eat a little of the bread which the old boatman had given her as her wages with three pieces of copper money but the crust choked her she felt hot with fever and her throat was parched and full of pain the moon was full upon her where she sat the red and white of her dress bore a strange look her face was colorless and her eyes looked but the larger and more lustrous for the black shadows beneath them and the weary swollen droop of their lids she sat there and pondered on the next step she had best take a woman came past her and stopped and looked the moonlight was strong upon her face you are a handsome wench said the wayfarer who was elderly and of pleasant visage too handsome a vast deal to be sitting alone like one lost what is the matter nothing she answered the old reserve clung to her and fenced her secret in as the prickles of a cactushedge may fence in the magnolias flowers of snow what then have you a home no eh you must have a lover follefarines lips grew whiter and she shrunk a little but she answered steadily no no and at your age and handsome as a ripe red applewith your skin of satin and your tangle of hair fie for shame are the men blind where do you rest tonight i am going onsouth and mean to walk all night pooh come home with me and sup and sleep i live hard by just inside the walls follefarine opened her great eyes wide it was the first creature who had ever offered her hospitality it was an old woman too there could be nothing but kindness in the offer she thought and kindness was so strange to her that it troubled her more than did cruelty you are good she said gratefullyvery good but i cannot come cannot come why then because i must go on to paris i cannot lose an hour nevertheless it is good of you the old woman laughed roughly ohho the red apple must go to paris no other market grand enough is that it i do not know what you mean but stay with me tonight the roads are dangerous there are vagrants and illlivers about there are great fogs too in this district and you will meet drunken soldiers and beggars who will rob you come home with me i have a pretty little place though poor and you shall have such fare as i give my own daughters and maybe you will see two or three of the young nobles they look in for a laugh and a songall innocent my girls are favorites come it is not a stones throw through the south gate you are good but i cannot come as for the road i am not afraid i have a good knife and i am strong she spoke in all unconsciousness in her heart thankful to this the first human creature that had ever offered her shelter or good nature the woman darted one sharp look at her venomous as an adders bite then bade her a short goodnight and went on her way to the gates of the town follefarine rose up and walked on taking her own southward road she was ignorant of any peril that she had escaped she did not know that the only animals which prey upon the young of their own sex and kind are women she was very tired long want of sleep anguish and bodily fatigue made her dull and too exhausted to keep long upon her feet she looked about her for some place of rest and she knew that if she did not husband her strength it might fail her ere she reached him and stretch her on a sickbed in some hospital of the poor she passed two or three cottages standing by the roadside with light gleaming through their shutters but she did not knock at any one of them she was afraid of spending her three copper coins and she was too proud to seek food or lodging as an alms byandby she came to a little shed standing where no house was she looked into it and saw it full of the last seasons hay dry and sweetsmelling tenanted only by a cat rolled round in slumber she crept into it and laid herself down and slept the bright starry skies shining on her through the open space that served for entrance the clatter of a little brook under the poplartrees the only sound upon the quiet air footsteps went past twice or thrice and once a wagon rolled lumbering by but no one came thither to disturb her and she sank into a fitful heavy sleep at daybreak she was again afoot always on the broad road to the southwest with one of her coins she bought a loaf and a draught of milk at a hamlet through which she went she was surprised to find that people spoke to her without a curse or taunt and dealt with her as with any other human being insensibly with the change of treatment and with the fresh sweet air and with the brisk movement that bore her on her way her heart grew lighter and her old dauntless spirit rose again she would find him she thought as soon as ever she entered paris and she would watch over him and only go near him if he needed her and then and then but her thoughts went no further she shut the future out from her it appalled her only one thing was clear before herthat she would get him the greatness that he thirsted for if any payment of her body or her soul her life or her death could purchase it a great purpose nerves the life it lives in so that no personal terrors can assail nor any minor woes afflict it hunger thirst fatigue hardship dangerthese were all in her path and she had each in turn but not one of them unnerved her to reach paris she felt that she would have walked through flames or fasted forty days for two days and nights she went ondays cloudless nights fine and mild then came a day of stormsharp hail and loud thunder she went on through it all the same the agony in her heart made the glare of lightning and the roar of winds no more to her than the sigh of an april breeze over a primrose bank she had various fortunes on her way a party of tramps crossing a meadow set on her and tried to insult her she showed them her knife and with the blade bare against her throat made them fall back and scattered them a dirty and tattered group of gypsies swatting in a dry ditch under a tarpaulin hailed her and wanted her to join with them and share their broken food she eluded them with disgust they were not like the gitanos of the liebana and she took them to be beggars and thieves as indeed they were at a little wayside cabin a girl with a bright rosy face spoke softly and cheerily to her and bade her rest awhile on the bench in the porch under the vines and brought out some white pigeons to show her and asked her with interest whence she came and she in her fierceness and her shyness was touched and wondered greatly that any female thing could be thus good she met an old man with an organ on his back and a monkey on his shoulder he was old and infirm she carried his organ for him awhile as they went along the same road and he was gentle and kind in return and made the route she had to take clear to her and told her with a shake of his head that paris would be either hell or heaven to such as she and she hearing smiled a little for the first time since she had left ypres and thoughtheaven or hell what would it matter which so long as she found arslan of dante she had never heard but the spirit of the questi chi mai da me non piu diviso dwells untaught in every great love once at night a vagrant tried to rob her having watched her count the gold and notes which she carried in her girdle he dragged her to a lonely place and snatched at the red sash grasping the money with it but she was too quick for him and beat him off in such a fashion that he slunk away limping and told his fellows to beware of her for she had the spring of a cat and the stroke of a swans wing on the whole the world seemed better to her than it had done the men were seldom insolent taking warning from the look in her flashing eyes and the straight carriage of her flexile frame and the women more than once were kind many peasants passed her on their marketmules and many carriers carts and farmwagons went by along the sunny roads sometimes their drivers called to her to get up and gave her a lift of a league or two on their piles of grass of straw or among their crates of cackling poultry as they made their slow way between the lines of the trees with their horses nodding heavily under the weight of their uncouth harness all this while she never touched the gold that he had given her very little food sufficed to her she had been hardily reared and for the little she had she worked always on her way a load carried a lost sheep fetched in some wood hewn and stacked a crying calf fed a cabbagepatch dug or watered these got her the simple fare which she fed on and for lodging she was to none indebted preferring to lie down by the side of the cows in their stalls or under a stack against some little blossoming garden the people had no prejudice against her she found few foes when she had left the district that knew the story of reine flamma they were on the contrary amused with her strange picturelike look and awed with the sad brevity of her speech to them sometimes it chanced to her to get no tasks of any sort to do and at these times she went without food touch his gold she would not on the road she did what good she could she walked a needless league to carry home a child who had broken his leg in a lonely lane she sought in a foggy night for the straying goat of a wretched old woman she saved an infant from the flames in a little cabin burning in the midst of the green fields she did what came in her path to do for her heart was half broken and this was her way of prayer so by tedious endeavor she won her passage wearily towards paris she had been nine days on the road losing her way at times and having often wearily to retrace her steps on the tenth day she came to a little town lying in a green hollow amidst woods it had an ancient church the old sweet bells were ringing their last midday mass salutaris hostia a crumbling fortress of the angevine kings gave it majesty and shadow it was full of flowers and of trees and had quaint quiet gray streets hilly and shady that made her think of the streets round about the cathedral of her mothers birthplace away northwestward in the white seamists when she entered it noon had just sounded from all its many clocks and chimes the weather was hot and she was very tired she had not eaten any food save some berries and green leaves for more than forty hours she had been refused anything to do in all places and she had no moneyexcept that gold of his there was a little tavern vineshaded and bright with a quatre saisons rose that hid its casements she asked there timidly if there were any task she might doto fetch water to sweep to break wood to drive or to stable a mule or a horse they took her to be a gypsy they ordered her roughly to be gone through the square window she could see fooda big juicy melon cut in halves sweet yellow cakes warm and crisp from the oven a white chicken cold and dressed with cresses a jug of milk an abundance of bread and her hunger was very great nine days of sharper privation than even that to which she had been inured in the penury of ypres had made her cheeks hollow and her limbs fleshless and a continual consuming heat and pain gnawed at her chest she sat on a bench that was free to all wayfarers and looked at the food in the tavern kitchen it tempted her with the terrible animal ravenousness begotten by long fast she wanted to fly at it as a starved dog flies a rosyfaced woman cut up the chicken on a china dish singing follefarine outside looked at her and took courage from her smiling face will you give me a little work she murmured anythinganythingso that i may get bread you are a gypsy answered the woman ceasing to smile go to your own folk and she would not offer her even a plate of broken victuals follefarine rose and walked wearily away she could not bear the sight of the food she felt that if she looked at it longer she would spring on it like a wolf but to use his gold never occurred to her she would have bitten her tongue through in famine ere she would have taken one coin of it as she went being weak from long hunger and the stroke of the sunrays she stumbled and fell she recovered herself quickly but in the fall the money had shaken itself from her sash and been scattered with a ringing sound upon the stones the woman in the tavern window raised a loud cry ohhe the wicked liarto beg bread while her waistband is stuffed with gold like a turkey with chestnuts what a rogue to try and dupe poor honest people like us take her to prison the woman cried loud there were half a dozen stout servingwenches and stablelads about in the little street with several boys and children indignant at the thought of an attempted fraud upon their charity and amazed at the flash and the fall of the money they rushed on her with shrieks of rage and scorn with missiles of turf and stone with their brooms raised aloft or their dogs set to rage at her she had not time to gather up the coins and notes she could only stand over and defend them two beggarboys made a snatch at the tempting heap she drew her knife to daunt them with the sight of it the people shrieked at sight of the bare blade a woman selling honeycomb and pots of honey at a bench under a limetree raised a cry that she had been robbed it was not true but a street crowd always loves a lie and never risks spoiling by sifting it the beggarlads and the two servingwenches and an old virago from a cottage door near set upon her and scrambled together to drive her away from the gold and share it resolute to defend it at any peril she set her heel down on it and with her back against the tree stood firm not striking but with the point of the knife outward one of the boys maddened to get the gold darted forward twisted his limbs round her and struggled with her for its possession in the struggle he wounded himself upon the steel his arm bled largely he filled the air with his shrieks the people furious accused her of his murder before five minutes had gone by she was seized overpowered by numbers cuffed kicked upbraided with every name of infamy and dragged as a criminal up the little steep stony street in the blaze of the noonday sun whilst on each side the townsfolk looked out from their doorways and their balconies and cried out what is it ohhe a brawling gypsy who has stolen something and has stabbed poor little freki the blind mans son because he found her out what is it au violonau violon to which the groups called back again a thief of a gypsy begging alms while she had stolen gold on her she has stabbed poor little freki the blind cobblers son too we think he is dead and the people above in horror lifted their hands and eyes and shouted afresh au violonau violon meanwhile the honeyseller ran beside them crying aloud that she had been robbed of five broad golden pieces it was a little sunny countryplace very green with trees and grass filled usually with few louder sounds than the cackling of geese and the dripping of the wellwater but its stones were sharp and rough its voices were shrill and fierce its gossips were cruel and false of tongue its justice was very small and its credulity was measureless a girl barefoot and bareheaded with eyes of the east and a knife in her girdle teeth that met in their youngsters wrist and gold pieces that scattered like dust from her bosomsuch a one could have no possible innocence in their eyes such a one was condemned so soon as she was looked at when she was dragged among them up their hilly central way she had had money on her and she had asked for food on the plea of being starved that was fraud plain enough even for those who were free to admit that the seller of the honeypots had never been overtrue of speech and had never owned so much as five gold pieces ever since her first bees had sucked their first spray of heathbells no one had any mercy on a creature who had money and yet asked for work as to her guilt there could be no question she was hurried before the village tribune and cast with horror into the cell where all accused waited their judgment it was a dusky loathsome place dripping with damp half underground strongly grilled with iron and smelling foully from the brandy and strong smoke of two drunkards who had been its occupants the previous night there they left her taking away her knife and her money she did not resist it was not her nature to rebel futilely and they had fallen on her six to one and had bound her safely with cords ere they had dragged her away to punishment the little den was visible to the highway through a square low grating through this they came and stared and mouthed and mocked and taunted and danced before her to bait a gypsy was fair pastime everywhere from door to door the blind cobbler with his little son and the woman who sold honey told their talehow she had stabbed the little lad and stolen the gold that the brave bees had brought their mistress and begged for food when she had had money enough on her to buy a rich mans feast it was a tale to enlist against her all the hardest animosities of the poor the village rose against her in all its little homes as though she had borne fire and sword into its midst if the arm of the law had not guarded the entrance of her prisoncell the women would have stoned her to death or dragged her out to drown in the pondshe was worse than a murderess in their sight and one weak man thinking to shelter her a little from their rage quoted against her her darkest crime when he pleaded for mercy for her because she was young and was so handsome the long hot day of torment passed slowly by outside there were cool woods flowerfilled paths broad fields of grass children tossing blowballs down the wind lovers counting the leaves of yelloweyed autumn daisies but within there were only foul smells intense nausea cruel heats the stings of a thousand insects the buzz of a hundred carrionflies muddy water and black mouldy bread she held her silence she would not let her enemies see that they hurt her when the day had gone down and the people had tired of their sport and left her a little while an old feeble man stole timidly to her glancing round lest any should see his charity and quote it as a crime and tendered her through the bars with a gentle hand a little ripe autumnal fruit upon a cool green leaf the kindness made the tears start to eyes too proud to weep for pain she took the peaches and thanked him lovingly and gratefully cooled her aching burning dustdrenched throat with their fragrant moisture hush it is nothing he whispered frightenedly glancing over his shoulder lest any one should see but tell metell mewhy did you say you starved when you had all that gold i did starve she answered him but whywith all that gold it was anothers the old man stared at her trembling and amazed whatwhat die of hunger and keep your hands off money in your girdle a dreary smile came on her face what is that inhuman too inhuman he murmured oh childoh child tell any tale you will save such a tale as that and he stole away sorrowful because sure that for his fruit of charity she had given him back a lie he shambled away afraid that his neighbors should see the little thing which he had done she was left alone it began to grow dark she felt scorched with fever and her head throbbed long hunger intense fatigue and all the agony of thought in which she had struggled on her way had their reaction on her she shivered where she sat on the damp straw which they had cast upon the stones and strange noises sang in her ears and strange lights glimmered and flashed before her eyes she did not know what ailed her the dogs came and smelt at her and one little early robin sang a twilight song in an elderbush near these were the only things that had any pity on her byandby when it was quite night they opened the grated door and thrust in another captive a vagrant they had found drunk or delirious on the highroad whom they locked up for the night that on the morrow they might determine what to do with him he threw himself heavily forward as he was pushed in by the old soldier whose place it was to guard the miserable den she shrank away into the farthest corner of the den and crouched there breathing heavily and staring with dull dilated eyes she thoughtsurely they could not mean to leave them there alone all the night through in the horrible darkness the slamming of the iron door answered her and the old soldier as he turned the rusty key in the lock grumbled that the world was surely at a pretty pass when two tramps became too coy to roost together and he stumbled up the ladderlike stairs of the guardhouse to his own little chamber and there smoking and drinking and playing dominoes with a comrade dismissed his prisoners from his recollection meanwhile the man whom he had thrust into the cell was stretched where he had fallen drunk or insensible and moaning heavily she crouching against the wall as though praying the stones to yield and hold her gazed at him with horror and pity that together strove in the confusion of her dizzy brain and made her dully wonder whether she were wicked thus to shrink in loathing from a creature in distress so like her own the bright moon rose on the other side of the trees beyond the grating its light fell across the figure of the vagrant whom they had locked in with her as in the wildbeast shows of old they locked a lion with an antelope in the same cageout of sport she saw the looming massive shadow of an immense form couched like a crouching beast she saw the fire of burning wideopen sullen eyes she saw the restless feeble gesture of two lean hands that clutched at the barren stones with the futile action of a chained vulture clutching at his rock she saw that the man suffered horribly and she tried to pity himtried not to shrink from himtried to tell herself that he might be as guiltless as was herself but she could not prevail nature instinct youth sex sickness exhaustion all conquered her and broke her strength she recoiled from the unbearable agony of that horrible probation she sprang to the grated aperture and seized the iron in her hands and shook it with all her might and tore at it and bruised her chest and arms against it and clung to it convulsively shriek after shriek pealing from her lips no one heard or no one answered to her prayer a stray dog came and howled in unison the moon sailed on behind the trees the old soldier above slept over his toss of brandy at the only dwelling near they were dancing at a bridal and had no ear to hear the passionate outcries wailed themselves to silence on her trembling mouth her strained hands gave way from their hold on the irons she grew silent from sheer exhaustion and dropped in a heap at the foot of the iron door clinging to it and crushed against it and turning her face to the night without feeling some little sense of solace in the calm clear moonsome little sense of comfort in the mere presence of the dog meanwhile the dusky prostrate form of the man had not stirred he had not spoken save to curse heaven and earth and every living thing he had not ceased to glare at her with eyes that had the red light of a tigers in their pain he was a man of superb stature and frame he was worn by disease and delirium but he had in him a wild leonine tawny beauty still his clothes were of rags and his whole look was of wretchedness yet there was about him a certain reckless majesty and splendor still as the scattered beams of the white moonlight broke themselves upon him of a sudden he spoke aloud with a glitter of terrible laughter on his white teeth and his flashing eyes he was delirious and had no consciousness of where he was the fourth bull i had killed that easterday look do you see it was a red andalusian he had wounded three picadors and ripped the bellies of eight horsesa brave bull but i was one too many for him she was there all the winter she had flouted over and taunted me all the winter she had cast her scorn at methe beautiful brown thing with her cruel eyes but she was there when i slew the great red bullstraight above there looking over her fan do you see and when my sword went up to the hilt in his throat and the brave blood spouted she laughed such a little sweet laugh and cast her yellow jasmine flower at me down in the blood and the sand there and that night after the red bull died the rope was thrown from the balcony soso only a year ago only a year ago then he laughed loud again and laughing sang avezvous vu en barcelonne une belle dame au sein bruni pale comme un beau soir dautomne cest ma maitresse ma lionne la marchesa damagui the rich loud challenge of the lovesong snapped short in two with a groan and a curse he flung himself on the mud floor and clutched at it with his empty hands winewine he moaned lying athirst there as the red bull had lain on the sands of the circus longing for the purple draughts of his old feastnights as the red bull had longed for the mountain streams so cold and strong of its own andalusian birthplace then he laughed again and sang old songs of spain broken and marred by discordtheir majestic melodies wedded strangely to many a stave of lewd riot and of amorous verse then for awhile he was quiet moaning dully staring upward at the white face of the moon after awhile he mocked itthe cold chaste thing that was the meek trickster of so many moleeyed lords through the terror and the confusion of her mind with the sonorous melody of the tongue with the flaming darkness of the eyes with the wild barbaric dissolute grandeur of this shattered manhood vague memories floated distorted and intangible before her of deep forests whose shade was cool even in midsummer and at midday of glancing torrents rushing through their beds of stone of mountain snows flashing in sunset to all the hues of the roses that grew in millions by the riverwater of wondrous nights sultry and serene in which women with flashing glances and bare breasts danced with their spangled anklets glittering in the rays of the moon of roofless palaces where the crescent still glistened on the colors of the walls of marble pomps empty and desolate where only the oleander held pomp and the wild figvine held possession of a dead nation which at midnight thronged through the desecrated halls of its kings and passed in shadowy hosts through the fated land which had rejected the faith and the empire of islam sowing as they went upon the bloodsoaked soil the vengeance of the dead in pestilence in feud in anarchy in barren passions in endless riot and revolt so that no sovereign should sit in peace on the ruined throne of the moslem and no light shine ever again upon the people whose boast it once had been that on them the sun in heaven never setall these memories floated before her and only served to make her fear more ghastly her horror more unearthly there he lay deliriousa madman chained at her feet so close in the little den that shrink as she would against the wall she could barely keep from the touch of his hands as they were flung forth in the air from the scorch of his breath as he raved and cursed and there was no light except the fire in his fierce hot eyes except the flicker of the moonbeam through the leaves she spent her strength in piteous shrieks they were the first cries that had ever broken from her lips for human aid and they were vain the guard above slept heavy with brandy and a dotards dreams the village was not aroused what cared any of its sleepers how these outcasts fared she crouched in the farthest corner when her agony had spent itself in the passion of appeal the nightwould it ever end besides its horror all the wretchedness and bondage of her old life seemed like peace and freedom writhing in his pain and frenzy the wounded drunkard struck herall unconscious of the blowacross her eyes and fell contorted and senseless with his head upon her knees he had ceased to shout his amorous songs and vaunt his lustful triumphs his voice was hollow in his throat and babbled with a strange sound low and fast and inarticulate in the little green woodin the little green wood he muttered hark do you hear the millwater run she looked so white and so cold and they all called her a saint what could a man do but kill that does she cry out against me you say so you lie you liebe you devil or god you sit on a great white throne and judge us all so they say you can send us to hell well do you shall never wring a word from her to my hurt she thinks i killed the child naythat i swear phratos knew i think but he is deadso they say ask him my brown queen who saw me kill the red bullare you there too ay how the white jewels shine in your breast stoop a little and kiss me so your mouth burns and the yellow jasmine flowerthere is a snake in it look you love meohhowhat does your priest say and your lord loveso many of you swore that but sheshe standing next to her god therei hurt her most and yet she alone of you all says nothing when at daylight the people unbarred the prisondoor they found the sightless face of the dead man lying full in the light of the sun beside him the girl crouched with a senseless stare in the horror of her eyes and on her lips a ghastly laugh for follefarine had entered at length into her fathers kingdom chapter viii for many months she knew nothing of the flight of time all she was conscious of were burning intolerable pain continual thirst and the presence of as an iron hand upon her head weighing down the imprisoned brain all she saw in the horrible darkness which no ray of light ever broke was the face of thanatos with the white rose pressed against his mouth to whom endlessly she stretched her arms in vain entreaty but who said only with the passionless pity of his gaze i come in my own time and neither tarry nor hasten for any supplication of a mortal creature she lived as a reed torn up from the root may live by the winds that waft it by the birds that carry it by the sands that draw its fibers down into themselves to root afresh whether it will or no the reed was worthy to diethe reed was worthy to die was all that she said again and again lying staring with her hot distended eyes into the void as of perpetual night which was all that she saw around her the words were to those who heard her however the mere meaningless babble of madness when they had found her in the cell of the guardhouse she was far beyond any reach of harm from them or any sensibility of the worst which they might do to her she was in a delirious stupor which left her no more sense of place or sound or time than if her brain had been drugged to the agonies and ecstasies of the opiumeater they found her homeless friendless nameless a thing accursed destitute unknown as useless and as rootless as the dead spanish vagrant lying on the stones beside her they cast him to the public ditch they sent her to the public sick wards a league away an ancient palace whose innumerable chambers and whose vast corridors had been given to a sisterhood of mercy and employed for nigh a century as a public hospital in this prison she lay without any sense of the passing of hours and days and months the accusation against her fell to the ground harmless no one pursued it the gold was gonesomewhere nowhere no one knew unless it were the beewife and she held her peace she was borne senseless to the old hospice in the great dull saintly historic town and there perished from all memories as all time perished to her once or twice the sister of charity who had the charge of her sought to exorcise the demon tormenting this stricken brain and burning body by thrusting into the hands that clinched the air a leaden image or a cross of sacred wood but those heathen hands even in delirium threw those emblems away always and the captive would mutter in a vague incoherence that froze the blood of her hearers the old gods are not dead they only waitthey only wait i am theirstheirs they forget perhaps but i remember i keep my faith they must keep theirs for shames sake heaven or hell what does it matter can it matter to me so that he has his desire and that they must give or break faith as men do persephone ate the pomegranateyou knowand she went back to hell so will iif they will it what can it matter how the reed diesby fire by steel by stormwhat matter so that the earth hear the music ah god the reed was found worthy to die and ii am too vile too poor too shameful even for that and then her voice would rise in a passion of hysteric weeping or sink away into the feeble wailing of the brain mortally stricken and yet dimly sensible of its own madness and weakness and all through the hours she in her unconsciousness would lament for thisfor this alonethat the gods had not deemed her worthy of the stroke of death by which through her a divine melody might have arisen and saved the world for the fablewhich had grown to hold the place of so implicit a faith to herwas in her delirium always present with her and she had retained no sense of herself except as the bruised and trampled reed which man and the gods alike had rejected as unworthy of sacrifice all the late autumn and the early winter came and went and the cloud was dark upon her mind and the pain of the blow dealt to her by tarics hand gnawed at her brain when the winter turned the darkness in which her reason had been engulfed began to clear little by little as the first small trill of the wren stirred the silence in the old elmboughs as the first feeble gleam of the newyear sunshine struggled through the matted branches of the yews as the first frail blossom of the pale hepatica timidly peeped forth in the damp mossgrown walls without so consciousness slowly returned to her she was so young the youth in her refused to be quenched and recovered its hold upon life as did the song of the birds the light in the skies the corn in the seedsown earth she awakened to strength to health to knowledge though she awoke thus blinded and confused and capable of little save the sense of some loathsome bondage of some irreparable loss of some great duty which she had left undone of some great errand to which she had been summoned and found wanting she saw four close stone walls around her she saw her wrists and her ankles bound she saw a hole high up above her head braced with iron bars which served to let in a few pallid streaks of daylight which alone ever found their way thither she saw a black cross in one corner and before it two women in black who prayed she tried to rise and could not being fettered she tore at the rope on her wrists with her teeth like a young tigress at her chains they essayed to soothe her but in vain they then made trial first of threats then of coercion neither affected her she bit at the knotted cords with her white strong teeth and being unable to free herself fell backward in a savage despair glaring in mute impotent rage upon her keepers i must go to paris she muttered again and again i must go to paris so much escaped herbut her secret she was still strong to keep buried in silence in her heart as she had still kept it even in her madness her old strength her old patience her old ferocity and stubbornness and habits of mute resistance had revived in her with the return of life and reason slowly she remembered all thingsremembered that she had been accused and hunted down as a thief and brought thither into this prison as she deemed it where the closeness of the walls pent her in and shut out the clouds and the stars the water and the moonrise the flicker of the green leaves against the gold of sunset and all the liberty and loveliness of earth and air for which she was devoured by a continual thirst of longing like the thirst of the caged lark for the fair heights of heaven so when they spoke of their god she answered always as the lark answers when his jailers speak to him of songset me free but they thought this madness no less and kept her bound there in the little dark stone den where no sound ever reached unless it were the wailing of a bell and no glimpse of the sky or the trees could ever come to charm to peaceful rest her aching eyes at length they grew afraid of what they did she refused all food she turned her face to the wall she stretched herself on her bed of straw motionless and rigid the confinement the absence of air were a living death to the creature whose lungs were stifled unless they drank in the fresh cool draught of winds blowing unchecked over the width of the fields and forests and whose eyes ached and grew blind unless they could gaze into the depths of freeflowing water or feed themselves in farreaching sight upon the radiant skies the errant passions in her the inborn instincts towards perpetual liberty and the life of the desert and of the mountains which came with the blood of the zingari made her prisonhouse a torture to her such as is unknown to the houseborn and hearthfettered races if this wild moorbird died of selfimposed famine rather than live only to beat its cut wings against the four walls of their pent prisonhouse it might turn ill for themselves so the religious community meditated they became afraid of their own work one day they said to her eat and live and you will be set free tomorrow she turned for the first time and lifted her face from the straw in which she buried it and looked them in the eyes is that true she asked ay they answered her we swear it by the cross of our blessed master if a christian swear itit must be a lie she said with the smile that froze their timid blood but she accepted the food and the drink which they brought her and broke her fast and slept through many hours strengthened as by strong wine by that one hope of freedom beneath the wide pure skies she asked them on awakening what the season of the year was then they told her it was the early spring the spring she echoed dullyall the months were a blank to her which had rolled by since that red autumn evening when in the cell of the guardhouse the voice of taric had chanted in drink and delirium the passion songs of spain yes it is spring they said again and one sister younger and gentler than the rest reached from its place above the crucifix the bough of the golden catkins of the willow which served them at their holy season as an emblem of the palms of palestine she looked at the drooping grace of the branches with their buds of amber long and in silence then with a passion of weeping she turned her face from them as from the presence of some intolerable memory all down the shore of the river amongst the silver of the reeds the willows had been in blossom when she had first looked upon the face of arslan stay with us the women murmured drawn to her by the humanity of those the first tears that she had ever shed in her imprisonment stay with us and it shall go hard if we cannot find a means to bring you to eternal peace she shook her head wearily it is not peace that i seek she murmured peace he would care nothing for peace on earth or in heaven she knew what she had sought to gain for himwhat she would seek still when once she should get freewas the eternal conflict of a great fame in the world of men since this was the only fate which in his sight had any grace or any glory in it they kept their faith with her they opened the doors of her prisonhouse and bade her depart in peace pagan and criminal though they deemed her she reeled a little dizzily as the first blaze of the full daylight fell on her she walked out with unsteady steps into the open air where they took her and felt it cool and fresh upon her cheek and saw the blue sky above her the gates which they unbarred were those at the back of the hospital where the country stretched around they did not care that she should be seen by the people of the streets she was left alone on a road outside the great building that had been her prisonhouse the road was full of light it was straight and shadowless there was a tall tree near her full of leaf there was a little bird fluttering in the sand at her feet the ground was wet and sparkled with raindrops all the little things came to her like the notes of a song heard far awayfar awayin another world they were all so familiar yet so strange there was a little yellow flower growing in a tuft of grasses straight in front of her a little wayside weed a root and blossom of the fieldborn celandine she fell on her knees in the dust by it and laughed and wept and quivering kissed it and blessed it that it grew there it was the first thing of summer and of sunshine that she had seen for so long a man in the gateway saw her and shook her and bade her get from the ground you are fitter to go back again he muttered you are mad still i think like a hunted animal she stumbled to her feet and fled from him winged by the one ghastly terror that they would claim her and chain her back again they had said that she was free but what were words they had taken her once they might take her twice she ran and ran and ran the intense fear that possessed her lent her irresistible force she coursed the earth with the swiftness of a hare she took no heed whence she went she only knew that she fled from that one unutterable horror of the place she thought that they were right that she was mad it was a level green silent country which was round her with little loveliness and little color but as she went she laughed incessantly in the delirious gladness of her liberty she tossed her head back to watch the flight of a single swallow she caught a handful of green leaves and buried her face in them she listened in a very agony of memory to the rippling moisture of a little brook she followed with her eyes the sweeping vapors of the rainclouds and when a west wind rose and blew a cluster of loose appleblossoms between her eyes she could no longer bear the passionate pain of all the longlost sweetness but flinging herself downward sobbed with the ecstasy of an exiles memories the hell in which she had dwelt had denied them to her for so long ah god she thought i know nowone cannot be utterly wretched whilst one has still the air and the light and the winds of the sky and she arose calmer and went on her way wondering even in that hour why men and women trod the daily measures of their lives with their eyes downward and their ears choked with the dust hearkening so little to the sound of the breeze in the grasses looking so little to the passage of the clouds against the sun when the first blindness and rapture of her liberty had a little passed away and abated in violence she stood in the midst of the green fields and the fresh woods a strange sad lonely figure of absolute desolation her clothes were in rags her red girdle had been changed by weather to a dusky purple her thick clustering hair had been cut to her throat her radiant hues were blanched and her immense eyes gazed woefully from beneath their heavy dreamy lids like the eyes of an antelope whom men vainly starve in the attempt to tame she knew neither where to go nor what to do she had not a coin nor a crust upon her she could not tell where she then stood nor where the only home that she had ever known might lie she had not a friend on earth and she was seventeen years old and was beautiful and was a woman she stood and looked she did not weep she did not pray her heart seemed frozen in her she had the gift she had cravedand how could she use it the light was obscured by clouds great sweet rainclouds which came trooping from the west woods were all round and close against her were low brown cattle cropping clovered grass away on the horizon was a vague vast golden cloud like a million threads of gossamer glowing in the sun she did not know what it was yet it drew her eyes to it she thought of the palaces a herdsman came by her to the cattle she pointed to the cloud what is that light she asked him the cowherd stared and laughed that light it is only the sun shining on the domes and the spires of paris paris she echoed the name with a great sob and crossed her hands upon her breast and in her way thanked god she had had no thought that she could be thus near to it she asked no more but set straight on her way thither it looked quite close she had exhausted the scanty strength which she had in her first flight she could go but slowly and the roads were heavy across the plowed lands and through the edges of the woods she walked on and on till it grew dusk then she asked of a woman weeding in a field how far it might be yet to paris the woman told her four leagues and more she grew deadly cold with fear she was weak and she had no hope that she could reach it before dawn and she had nothing with which to buy shelter for the night she could see it still a cloud now as of fireflies upon the purple and black of the night and in a passionate agony of longing she once more bent her limbs and ranthinking of him to her the city of the world the city of the kings the city of the eagles was only of value for the sake of this one life it held it was useless all the strength she possessed was already spent the feebleness of fever still sang in her ears and trembled in her blood she was sick and faint and very thirsty she struck timidly at a little cottage door and asked to rest the night there the woman glanced at her and slammed to the door at another and yet another she tried but at neither had she any welcome they muttered of the hospitals and drove her onward finally tired out she dropped down on the curled hollow of an old oak stump that stood by the wayside and fell asleep seeing to the last through her sinking lids that cloud of light where the great city lay the night was cold the earth damp she stretched her limbs out wearily and sighed and dreamed that thanatos touched her with his asphodels and whispered come chapter ix when she awoke she was no longer in the open air by the roadside and the gray of the falling night about her and the wet leaves for her bed she was in a wide painted chamber sweet with many roses hung with deep hues of violet filled with gold and color and sculpture and bronze duskily beautiful and dimly lighted by a great wood fire that glowed upon andirons of brass on the wall nearest her hung all alone a picturea picture of a girl asleep in a scarlet blaze of poppies above her head a purple butterfly and on her breast the red mouse of the brocken opposite to it beside the hearth watching her with his small brilliant eyes and quite motionless sat the old man sartorian who had kept his faith with her though the gods had not kept theirs and the picture and the reality grew confused before her and she knew not which was herself and which her painted likeness nor which was the little red mouse that gibbered among the red flowers and which the little old man who sat watching her with the firegleams bright in his eyes and it seemed to her that she and the picture were one and he and the mouse were one likewise and she moaned and leaned her head on her hands and tried to think the heat of the chamber and the strong nourishment which they had poured down her throat when she was insensible of anything they did to her had revived the life in her memory and sense returned slowly to her what first awakened was her one passionate desire so intense that it became an instinct stifling every other to go on her way to the city that had flashed in its golden glory on her sight one moment only the next to disappear into the eternal night paris she muttered mechanically as she lifted her face with a hopeless bewildered prayer tell me the way to paris she muttered instinctively and she tried to rise and walk not well knowing what she did the old man laughed a little silently ahhh women are the only peaches that roll of their own accord from the wall to the wasps nest at the sound of his voice her eyes opened wide upon him she knew his face again where am i she asked him with a sharp terror in her voice in my house he said simply i drove by you when you lay on the roadside i recognized you when people dream of immortality they generally die in a ditch you would have died of a single night out there i sent my people for you you did not wake you have slept here five hours is this rioz she could not comprehend a horror seized her lest she should have strayed from paris back into her mothers province no it is another home of mine smaller but choicer maybe who has cut your hair close she shuddered and turned paler with the memory of that ghastly prisonhouse well i am not sure but that you are handsomeralmost a sculptor would like you more nowwhat a head you would make for an anteros or an icarus or a hyacinthus yesyou are best so you have been ill she could not answer she only stared at him blankly with sad mindless dilated eyes a little gold she muttered a little gold he looked at her awhile then rose and went and sent his handwomen who took her to an inner chamber and bathed and attended her with assiduous care she was stupefied and knew not what they did they served her tenderly they bathed her tired limbs and laid her as gently as though she were some wounded royal captive upon a couch of down she had no force to resist her eyes were heavy and her senses were obscured the potence of the draught which they had forced through her lips when she had been insensible acted on her as an anodyne she sank back unconsciously and she slept again all through the night and half the day that followed through all the hours she was conscious at intervals of the fragrance of flowers of the gleams of silver and gold of the sounds of distant music of the white calm gaze of marble fauns and dryads who gazed on her from amidst the coolness of hanging foliage she who had never rested on any softer couch than her truss of hay or heap of bracken dreamed that she slept on roses the fragrance of innumerable flowers breathed all around her a distant music came through the silence on her drowsy ear for the first time in her life of toil and pain she knew how exquisite a pleasure mere repose can be at noon she awoke crying aloud that the red mouse claimed her soul from thanatos when her vision cleared and her dream passed away the music the flowers the color the coolness were all real around her she was lying on a couch as soft as the rosebeds of sybaris about her were the luxuries and the graces amidst which the rich dwell above her head from a golden height a painted eros smiled the light on to which her startled eyes opened came to her veiled through soft rosy hues the blossom of flowers met her everywhere gilded lattices and precious stones and countless things for which she knew neither the name nor use and wondrous plants with birds like living blossoms on the wing above them and the marble heads of women rising cold and pure above the dreamy shadows all the color and the charm and the silence and the grace of the life that is rounded by wealth were around her she lay silent and breathless awhile with wideopen eyes motionless from the languor of her weakness and the confusion of her thoughts wondering dully whether she belonged to the hosts of the living or the dead she was in a small sleepingchamber in a bed like the cup of a lotos there was perfect silence round her except for the faint faroff echo of some music a drowsy subtle fragrance filled the air the solemn measure of a clocks pendulum deepened the sense of stillness for the first time in her life she learned how voluptuous a thing the enjoyment of simple rest can be all her senses were steeped in it lulled by it magnetized by it and so far as every thought was conscious to her she thought that this was deathdeath amidst the fields of asphodel and in the eternal peace of the realm of thanatos suddenly her eyes fell on a familiar thing a little picture close at hand the picture of herself amidst the poppies she leapt from her bed and fell before it and clasped it in her arms and wept over it and kissed it because it had been the work of his hand and prayed to the unknown gods to make her suffer all things in his stead and to give him the desire of his soul and the red mouse had no power on her because of her great love she rose from that prayer with her mind clear and her nerves strung from the lengthened repose she remembered all that had chanced to her where are my clothes she muttered to the servingwoman who watched beside her it is broad dayi must go onto paris they craved her to wear the costly and broidered stuffs strewn around her masterpieces of many an eastern and southern loom but she put them all aside in derision and impatience drawing around her with a proud loving action the folds of her own poor garments weatherstained torn by bush and brier soaked with nightdew and discolored by the dye of many a crushed flower and bruised berry of the fields and woods she yet would not have exchanged these poor shreds of woven flax and goats wool against imperial robes for poor though they were they were the symbols of her independence and her liberty the women tended her gently and pressed on her many rare and fair things but she would not have them she took a cup of milk and passed out into the larger chamber she was troubled and bewildered but she had no fear for she was too innocent too wearied and too desperate with that deathless courage which having borne the worst that fate can do can know no dread she stood with her arms folded on her breast drawing together the tattered folds of the tunic gazing at the riches and the luxury and the blended colors of the room so softly that she never heard his footfall the old man entered behind her and came to the hearth and looked on her you are better he asked are you better follefarine she looked up and met the eyes of sartorian they smiled again on her with the smile of the red mouse the one passion which consumed her was stronger than any fear or any other memory she only thoughtthis man must know she sprang forward and grasped his arm with both hands with the seizure of a tigress her passionate eyes searched his face her voice came hard and fast what have you doneis he living or deadyou must know his eyes still smiled i gave him his golden keyhow he should use it that was not in our bond but truly i will make another bond with you any day follefarine she shuddered and her hands dropped from their hold you know nothing she murmured of your norse god nay nothing an eagle soars too high for a mans sight to follow you knowoftentimes and he laughed his little soft laugh the eagles often soared so highso highthat the icy vapors of the empyrean froze them dead and they dropped to earth a mere bruised helpless useless masshe knew she stood stunned and confused her horror of sartorian was struggling into life through the haze in which all things of the past were still shrouded to her dulled remembranceall things save her love rest awhile he said gently rest and we maywho knowslearn something of your northern god first tell me of yourself i have sought for tidings of you vainly her eyes glanced round her on every side let me go she muttered naya moment yet you are not well i am well indeed then wait a moment she rested where he motioned he looked at her in smiling wonder she leaned on one of the cushioned couches calm motionless negligent giving no sign that she saw the chamber round her to be any other than the wooden barn or thatched cattlesheds of the old millhouse her feet were crossed her limbs were folded in that exquisite repose which is inborn in races of the east the warmth of the room and the long hours of sleep had brought the natural bloom to her face the natural luster to her eyes which earlier fatigue and long illness had banished he surveyed her with that smile which she had resented on the day when she had besought pity of him for arslans sake do you not eat was all he said not here he laughed his low humorous laugh that displeased her so bitterly though it was soft of tone and all those silks and stuffs and lacesdo they please you no better they are not mine pooh do you not know yet a female thing as beautiful as you are makes hers everything she looks upon that is a fine phrase and an empty one you think on my soul no everything you see here is yours if it please you she looked at him with dreaming perplexed eyes what do you want of me she said suddenly naywhy ask all men are glad to give to women with such a face as yours she laughed a little with the warmth the rest the wonder the vague sense of some unknown danger her old skill and courage rose she knew that she had promised to be grateful always to this man otherwiseoh godhow she could have hated him she thought why she answered why oh only this when i bought a measure of pears for flamma in the marketplace the seller of them would sometimes pick me out a big yellow bonchretien soft as butter sweet as sugar and offer it to me for myself well when he did that i always knew that the weight was short or the fruit rotten this is a wonderful pear you would give me but is your measure false he looked at her with a curious wonder and admiration he was angered humbled incensed and allured and yet he was glad she looked so handsome thus with the curl on her quiet lips and her spirited head fit for a bronze cast of atalanta he was an old man he could bear to pause and rightly appreciate the charm of scorn the spur of irony the good of hatred he knew the full value of its sharp spears to the wonderblooming aloe he left the subject for a happier moment and seating himself opened his hands to warm them by the wood fire still watching her with that smile which for its very indulgence its merry banter she abhorred you lost your norse god as i prophesied he asked carelessly he saw her whole face change as with a blow and her body bend within itself as a young tree bends under a storm he went when you gave him the gold she said below her breath of course he went you would have him set free he said with the little low laugh still in his throat did i not say you must dream of nothing else if once you had him freed you would be full of faith and unbar your eagles prisonhouse and then because he took wing through the open door you wonder still that is not very wise follefarine i do not wonder she said with fierce effort stifling her misery he had a right to do as he would have i said any otherwise no you are very faithful still i see yet i cannot think that you believed my prophecy or youa womanhad never been so strong you think i can tell you of his fate nay on my soul i know nothing men do not speak his name he may be deadyou shrink so can it matter so much he is dead to you he is a great man but he is a fool half his genius would give him the fame he wants with much greater swiftness than the whole ever will the world likes talent which serves it it hates genius which rules it men would adore his technical treatment his pictorial magnificence his anatomical accuracy but they will always be in awe of his intensity of meaning of his marvelous fertility of his extraordinary mingling of the chillest of idealisms and the most unsparing of sensualitiesbut i talk idly let us talk of you see i chose your likeness and he let me have itdid you dream that he would part with it so lightly why not he had a million things more beautiful he looked at her keenly he could measure the superb force of this unblenching and mute courage in any other creature such a humility would be hypocrisy but it is not so in you why will you carry yourself as in an enemys house will you not even break your fast with me nay that is sullen that is barbaric is there nothing that can please you see hereall women love these the gypsy as well as the empress hold them a moment she took them old oriental jewels lying loose in an agate cup on a table near there were among them three great sapphires which in their way were priceless from their rare size and their perfect color her mouth laughed with its old scorn she who had lost life soul earth heaven to be consoled with the glass beads of a bauble this man seemed to her more foolish than any creature that had ever spoken on her ear she looked then laid themindifferentlydown three sparrows eggs are as big and almost as blue among the moss in any month of may he moved them away chagrined how do you intend to live he asked dryly it will come as it comes she answered with the fatalism and composure that ran in her eastern blood what have you done up to this moment since you left my house at rioz she told him briefly she wanted to hide that she had suffered aught or had been in any measure coldly dealt with and she spoke with the old force of a happier time seeking rather to show how well it was with her that she should thus be free and have no law save her own will and know that none lived who could say to her come hither or go there almost she duped him she was so brave not quite his eyes had read the souls and senses of women for half a century and none had ever deceived him as he listened to her he knew well that under her desolation and her solitude her heart was brokenthough not her courage but he accepted her words as she spoke them perhaps you are wise to take your fate so lightly he said to her but do you know that it is a horrible thing to be alone and penniless and adrift and without a home or a friend when one is a woman and young it is worse when one is a woman and old but who pities it then she said with the curt and caustic meaning that had first allured him in her and a woman is so soon old he added with as subtle a significance she shuddered a little no female creature that is beautiful and vigorous and young can coldly brook to look straight at the doom of age death is far less appalling because death is uncertain mystical and may still have beauty what do you intend to do with yourself he pursued intend it is for the rich to intend the poor must take what chances she spoke calmly leaning down on one of the cushioned benches by the hearth resting her chin on her hand her brown slender feet were crossed one over another her eyelids were heavy from weakness and the warmth of the room the soft dim light played on her tenderly he looked at her with a musing smile no beautiful woman need ever be poor he said slowly spreading out the delicate palms of his hands to the fire and you are beautifulexceedingly i know she gave a quick gesture of her head tired insolent indifferent and a terrible darkness stole over her face what matter how beautiful she might be she had no beauty in her own sight for the eyes of arslan had dwelt on her cold calm unmoved whilst he had said i would love youif i could you know your value sartorian said dryly well then why talk of poverty and of your future together they need never be companions in this world she rose and stood before him in the rosy glow of the fire that bathed her limbs until they glowed like jade and porphyry no beautiful woman need be poornono beautiful woman need be honest i dare say he smiled holding his delicate palms to the warmth of his hearth your lover drew a grand vision of barabbas wellwe choose barabbas still just as jerusalem chose only now our barabbas is most often a woman why do you rise it is a wet day out there and for the springtime cold is it and you have been ill so they say you will die of cold and exposure so best wait a moment in such weather i would not let a dog stir you would if the dog chose to go to a master who forsook itfor a kick and a curse her face burned she hung her head instinctively she sank down again on the seat which she had quitted the old horror of shame which she had felt by the waterside under the orchards bent her strength under this mans unmerciful pressure she knew that he had her secret and the haughty passion and courage of her nature writhed under his taunt of it to refuse to stay is uncouth he said to her i am uncouth no doubt and it is ungrateful i would not be that ungrateful i did what you asked of me i unloosed your othyr of art to spend his strength as he will in essaying to raise a stormblast which shall have force enough to echo through the endless tunnels of the time to come you gave him a handful of gold pieces for that ah if you thought that i should offer him the half of my possessions you were disappointed no doubt but you forgot that that would not sell in the world as yet for a handful of wheat she touched the three sapphires are your blue stones of less worth because i being ignorant esteem them of no more value than three sparrows eggs in the hedge my poor jewels well stay here tonight you need rest shelter and warmth and tomorrow you shall go as poor as you came if you wish but the world is very hard the world is always winterto the poor he added carelessly resting his keen farreaching eyes upon her despite herself she shuddered he recalled to her that the world was close at handthe world in which she would be houseless friendless penniless alone a hard world to those who will not worship its gods he repeated musingly and you astray in it you poor barbarian with your noble madness and your blindness of faith and of passion do you know what it is to be famished and have none to hear your cries do i know her voice suddenly gathered strength and scorn and rang loud on the stillness do you the empty dish the chill stove the frozen feet the long nights with the roof dripping rain the sour berries and hard roots that mock hunger the mud floors with the rats fighting to get first at your bed the bitter black months whose saints days are kept by new pains and whose holy days are feasted by fresh diseases do i know do you he did not answer her he was absorbed in his study of her face he was thinking how she would look in paris in some theatres spectacle of egypt with anklets of dull gold and a cymar of dead white and behind her a sea of palms and a red and sullen sky what a fool he must have been he thought as his eyes went from her to the study of her sleeping in the poppies what a fool he left his lantern of aladdin behind him you remember unlovely things he said aloud no i do not know them and i should not have supposed that you who did could so much have cared to know them more or could have clung to them as the only good as you now seem to do you cannot love such hardships i have never known luxuries and i do not wish to know them then you are no woman what is your idea of the most perfect life i do not knowto be always in the open air and to be quite free and forever to see the sun not a low ideal you must await the peruvian paradise meanwhile there is a dayspring that represents the sun not ill we call it wealth ah she could not deride this god for she knew it was the greatest of them all when the rod of riches had been lost had not the farstriking king himself been brought low and bound down to a slaves drudgery the small keen elfin satiric face bent on her did not change from its musing study its slow vigilant smile holding her under the subtle influence of his gaze sartorian began to speakspeak as he could at choice with accents sweet as silver slow words persuasive as sorcery with the terse dainty facile touches of a master he placed before her that world of which she knew no more than any one of the reeds that blew by the sands of the river he painted to her that life of all others which was in most vital contrast and unlikeness to her own the life of luxury of indolence of carelessness of sovereignty of endless pleasure and supreme delight he painted to her the years of a woman rich caressed omnipotent beautiful supreme with all the world before her from which to choose her lovers her playthings her triumphs her victories her cruelties and her seductions he painted the long cloudless invigorating day of such a favorite of fortune with its hours winged by love and its laughter rhymed to music and its wishes set to gold the same day for the same woman whether it were called of rome or of corinth of byzantium or of athens of babylon or of paris and whether she herself were hailed hetaira or imperatrix he drew such things as the skill of his words and the deep knowledge of his many years enabled him in language which aroused her even from the absorption of her wretchedness and stirred her dull disordered thoughts to a movement of restless discontent and of strange wonderarslan had never spoken to her thus he let his words dwell silently on her mind awhile then suddenly he asked her such lives are do you not envy them she thoughtenvy them she what could she envy save the eyes that looked on arslans face what were the use she said aloud all my life i have seen all things are for others nothing is for me your life is but just opening henceforth you shall see all things for you instead she flashed her eyes upon him how can that be listen to me you are alone in the world follefarine alone yes you have not a coin to stand a day between you and hunger not one you know of no roof that will shelter you for so much as a night not one you have just left a public place of pestilence yes and you know that every ones hand is against you because you are nameless and bastard and come of a proscribed people who are aliens alike in every land i am follefarine yes for a moment he was silent the simple pathetic acceptance of the fate that made her namemerely because hersa symbol of all things despised and desolate and forsaken touched his heart and moved him to a sorrowful pity but the pity died and tie cruelty remained alive behind it he bent on her the magnetic power of his bright sardonic meaning eyes wellbe follefarine still why not but let follefarine mean no longer a beggar an outcast a leper a thing attainted proscribed and forever suspected but let it mean on the ear of every man that hears it the name of the most famous the most imperious the most triumphant the most beautiful woman of her time a woman of whom the world says look on her face and dieyou have lived enough her breath came and went as she listened the blood in her face flushed and paled she trembled violently and her whole frame seemed to dilate and strengthen and vibrate with the electric force of that subtlest temptation i she murmured brokenly yes you all that i say you shall be homeless tribeless nameless nationless though you stand there now follefarine the wondrous promise swept her fancy for the moment on the strong current of its imagery as a river sweeps a leaf this empire hersherswhen all mankind had driven and derided her and shunned her sight and touch and cursed and flouted her and barely thought her worthy to be called thou dog he looked at her and smiled and bent towards the warmth of the fire all that i say you shall be andthe year is all winter for the poor follefarine the light on her face faded a sudden apprehension tightened at her heart on her face gathered the old fierce deadly antagonism which constant insult and attack had taught her to assume on the first instant of menace as her only buckler she knew not what evil threatened but vaguely she felt that treason was close about her if you do not mock me she said slowly if you do nothow will you make me what you promise i will show the world to you you to the world your beauty will do the rest the darkness and the perplexed trouble deepened on her face she rose and stood and looked at him her teeth shut together with a quick sharp ring her straight proud brows drew together in stormy silence all the tigress in her was awoke and rising ready to spring yet amid that dusky passion that withering scorn of doubt there was an innocent pathetic wonder a vague desolation and disappointment that were childlike and infinitely sad this is a wondrous pear you offer me she said bitterly and so cheapit must be rotten somewhere it is golden who need ask more and he laughed his little low laugh in his throat then and then only she understood him with a sudden unconscious instinctive action her hand sought her knife but the girdle was empty she sprang erect her face on fire with a superb fury her eyes blazing like the eyes of a wild beasts by night a magnificence of scorn and rage upon her quivering features her voice rang clear and hard and cold as ring the blows of steel i ask morethat i should pluck it with clean hands and eat of it with pure lips strange quibble for a beggarhomeless penniless tribeless nationless so you think no doubt but we who are born outlawed are born freeand do not sell our freedom let me go he watched her with a musing smile a dreamy calm content all this tempest of her scorn all this bitterness of her disdain all this whirlwind of her passion and her suffering seemed but to beguile him more and make him surer of her beauty of her splendor of her strength she would be a great creature to show to the world he thought as he drooped his head and watched her through his halfclosed eyelids as the red mouse watched the sleeper in the poppies let you go he said with that slow ironic smilelet you go why should i let you go follefarine she stooped as a tigress stoops to rise the stronger for her death spring and her voice was low on a level with his ear why why to save your own lifeif you are wise he laughed in his throat again ah ah it is never wise to threaten follefarine i do not threaten you are foolish you are unreasonable and that is the privilege of a woman i am not angered at it on the contrary it adds to your charm you are a beautiful reckless stubborn halfmad halfsavage creature passion and liberty become youbecome you like your ignorance and your ferocity i would not for worlds that you should change them let me go she cried across his words oh fool the winter will be hardand you are bare of footand you have not a crust let me go ah goto beg your way to paris and to creep through the cellars and the hospitals till you can see your lovers face and to crouch a moment at his feet to hear him mutter a curse on you in payment for your pilgrimage and then to slit your throat or hisin your despair and lie dead in all your loveliness in the common ditch let me go i say or else more like come back to me in a weeks time and say i was mad but now i am wise give me the golden pear what matter a little speck what is golden may be rotten but to all lips it is sweet let me go she stood at bay before him pale in her scorn of rags her right hand clinched against her breast her eyes breathing fire her whole attitude instinct with the tempest of contempt and loathing which she held down thus passive and almost wordless because she once had promised never to be thankless to this man he gazed at her and smiled and thought how beautiful that chained whirlwind of her passions looked but he did not touch her nor even go nearer to her there was a dangerous gleam in her eyes that daunted him moreover he was patient humorous gentle cruel wiseall in one and he desired to tame and to beguile her and to see her slowly drawn into the subtle sweetness of the powers of gold and to enjoy the yielding of each moral weakness one by one as the southern boy slowly pulls limb from limb wing from wing of the cicala i will let you go surely he said with his low grim laugh i keep no woman prisoner against her will but think one moment longer follefarine you will take no gift at my hands none you want to gopenniless

never a look of softness from your northern god he has no love for you and he is in his grave most likely icarus fallsalways for the first time she quailed as though struck by a sharp blow but her voice remained inflexible and serene i can live without love or pity as i can without home or gold once for alllet me go i will let you go he said slowly as he moved a little away i will let you go in seven days time for seven days you shall do as you please eat drink be clothed be housed be feasted be served be beguiledas the rich are you shall taste all these things that gold gives and which you being ignorant dare rashly deride and refuse if when seven days end you still choose you shall go and as poor as you came but you will not choose for you are a woman follefarine ere she knew his intent he had moved the panel and drawn it behind him and left her aloneshut in a trap like the birds that claudis flamma had netted in his orchards that night when the night without was quite dark she knelt down before the study of the poppies and kissed it softly and prayed to the unknown god of whom none had taught her in anywise yet whose light she still had found and followed in a dim wondering imperfect fashion as a little child lost in the twilight of some pathless wood pursues in trembling the gleam of some great still planet looming far above her through the leaves when she arose from her supplication her choice was already made and the red mouse had no power on her because of her great love chapter x at sunrise a great peacock trailing his imperial purple on the edge of a smooth lawn pecked angrily at a torn fragment of a scarlet scarf a scarf that had been woven in his own eastern lands but which incensed his sight fluttering there so idly as it seemed on the feathery sprays of a little low almondtree that grew by the waters edge the water was broad and full of lilyleaves and of rare reeds and rushes it had been so stemmed and turned by art that it washed the basement walls and mirrored the graceful galleries and arches of the garden palace where the bird of here dwelt twenty feet above the level of the gardens where the peacock swept in the light there was an open casement a narrow balcony of stone a group of pale human faces looking out awestricken a leap in the nightthe night wet and moonlesswaters a fathom deepa bed of sand treacherous and shifting as the ways of love what could all these be save certain death of death they were afraid but they were more afraid yet of the vengeance of their flutevoiced lord on the wall the red mouse sat among the flowers of sleep he could have told he who for once had heard another prayer than the blasphemies of the brocken but the red mouse never tells any secret to men he has lived too long in the breast of the women whom men love the sun came from the east and passed through the pale stricken faces that watched from the casement and came straight to where the red mouse sat amidst the poppies have you let a female soul escape you said the sun the red mouse answered love is stronger than i when he keeps his hands pure where he guards the door of the soul i enter not i sit outside and watch and watch and watch but it is time lost love is strong the door is barred to me said the sun that is strange to hear my sister the moon has told me oftentimes that eros is your panderalways anteros only said the red mouse the sun wondering said again and yet i have heard that it is your boast that into every female soul you enter at birth and dwell there unto death is it then not so the red mouse answered the boast is not mine it is mans chapter xi in the dark of the night she had leapt to what as she thought would prove her grave but the waters with humanlike caprice had cast her back upon the land with scarce an effort of her own given back thus to life whether she would or no she by sheer instinct stumbled to her feet and fled as fast as she could in the wet gloomy night through the grassy stretches of the unknown gardens and lands in which she found herself she was weighted with her soaked clothes as with lead but she was made swift by terror and hatred as though hermes for once had had pity for anything human and had fastened to her feet his own winged sandals she ran on and on not knowing whither only knowing that she ran from the man who had tempted her by the strength of the rod of wealth the rains were ceaseless the skies had no stars in the dense mist no lights far or near of the city or planets of palace or house were seen she did not know where she went she only ran on away and away anywhere from the red mouse and its master when the daybreak grew gray in the heavens she paused and trembling crept into a cattleshed to rest and take breath a little she shrank from every habitation she quivered at every human voice she was afraidhorribly afraidin those clinging vapors those damp deathly smells those ghostly shadows of the dawn those indistinct and unfamiliar creatures of a country strange to her that old man with the elfs eyes who had tempted her was he a god too she wondered since he had the rod that metes power and wealth he might stretch his hand anywhere she supposed and take her the gentle cattle in their wooden home made way for her and humbly welcomed her she hid herself among their beds of hay and in the warmth of their breath and their bodies she was wet and wretched like any halfdrowned dog but the habits of her hardy life made cold and hunger and exposure almost powerless to harm her she slept from sheer exhaustion of mind and body the cattle could have trodden her to death or tossed her through the open spaces of their byres but they seemed to know they seemed to pity and they stirred so that they did not brush a limb of her nor shorten a moment of her slumbers when she awoke the sun was high a herdswoman entering with the loud harsh clash of brazen pails kicked her in the loins and rated her furiously for daring to rest there she arose at the kick and went out from the place passively not well knowing what she did the morning was warm and radiant the earth and the trees were dripping with the rains of the night the air was full of sweet odors and of a delicious coldness as far as she saw there was no token far or near of the gleaming cloud of the city of her dreams she ventured to ask at a wayside cabin if she were near to or far from paris the woman of the cottage looked up searchingly from the seat before the porch and for answer cried to her paris poufff get out you drowned rat she had lost for the time the mental force and even the physical force to resent or to persevere she was weak with hunger and bewildered with her misery she had only sense enough left to rememberand be thankfulthat in the night that was past she had been strong the sun beat on her head the road was hard and sharpset with flint she was full of pain her brain throbbed with fever and reeled with weakness a sudden horror seized her lest she might die before she had looked again on the face of arslan she saw the dusky shade of a green wood by sheer instinct she crept into it as a stricken deer into its sanctuary she sat in the darkness of the trees in the coolness of the wood and rested her head on her hands and let the big salt tears drop one by one as the death tears of the llama fall this was the young year round her that she knew the winter had gone by its many months had passed over her head whilst she was senseless to any flight of night or day death might have taken the prey which it had once been robbed of by her in all this weary season which to her was as a blank his old foes of failure and famine might have struggled for and vanquished him she not being by his body might lie in any plagueditch of the nameless poor his hand might rot fleshless and nerveless in any pit where the world cast its useless and dishonored dead the mould of his brain might make a feast for eyeless worms not more stone blind than was the human race he had essayed to serve the beauty of his face might be a thing of loathsomeness from which a toad would turn oh god would death never take her likewise was she an outcast even from that one tribeless and uncounted nation of the dead that god whom she had loved whom she had chosen whose eyes had been so full of pity whose voice had murmured nay the wise know me as mans only friendeven he thanatos had turned against her and abandoned her vague memories of things which she had heard in fable and tradition of bodies accursed and condemned to wander forever unresting and wailing of spirits which for their curse were imprisoned in a living flesh that they could neither lose nor cast away so long as the world itself endured creatures that the very elements had denied and that were too vile for fire to burn or water to drown or steel to slay or old age to whither or death to touch and take in any wise all these memories returned to her and in her loneliness she wondered if she were such a one as these she did not know indeed that she had done any great sin she had done none willingly and yet all people called her vile and they must know even the old man mocking her had said never wrestle with fate he throws the strongest soon or late and your fate is shame it was your birthgift it will be your burialcloth can you cast it off no but you can make it potent as gold and sweet as honey if you choose follefarine and she had not chosen yet of any nobility in the resistance she did not dream she had shut her heart to it by the unconscious instinct of strength as she had shut her lips under torture and shut her hands against life she sat there in the wood roofless penniless friendless and every human creature was against her her tempter had spoken only the bare and bleak truth a dog stoned and chased and mad could be the only living thing on the face of the earth more wretched and more desolate than herself the sun of noon was bright abovehead in a cloudless sky but in the little wood it was cool and shady and had the moisture of a heavy morning dew millions of young leaves had uncurled themselves in the warmth little butterflies some azure some yellow some white danced in the light brown rills of water murmured under the grasses the thrushes sang to one another through the boughs and the lizard darted hither and thither green as the arrowy leaves that made its shelter a little distance from her there was a group of joyous singers who looked at her from time to time their laughter hushing a little and their simple carousal under the green boughs broken by a nameless chillness and involuntary speculation she did not note them her face being bowed down upon her hands and no sound of the thrushes song or of the human singers voices rousing her from the stupefaction of despair which drugged her senses they watched her long her attitude did not change one of them at length rose up and went hesitating a step or two forwards a girl with winking feet clad gayly in bright colors though the texture of her clothes was poor she went and touched the crouched sad figure softly are you in trouble the figure lifted its bowed head its dark hopeless eyes follefarine looked up with a stare and a shiver it is no matter i am onlytired are you all alone yes come and sit with us a moment you are in the damp and the gloom we are so pleasant and sunny there come you are good but let me be the blueeyed girl called to the others they lazily rose and came heaven she is handsome the men muttered to one another she looked straight at them all and let them be you are all alone they asked her again always she answered them you are goingwhere to paris what to do there i do not know you look wetsufferingwhat is the matter i was nearly drowned last nightan accidentit is nothing where have you slept in a shed with some cattle could you get no shelter in a house i did not seek any what do you do what is your work anythingnothing what is your name follefarine that means the chaffless than the chaffthe dust it means me they were silent only bending on her their bright curious eyes they saw that she was unspeakably wretched that some great woe or shock had recently fallen on her and given her glance that startled horror and blanched her rich skin to an ashen pallor and frozen as it were the very current of the young blood in her veins they were silent a little space then whispered together come with us they urged we too go to paris we are poor we follow art we will befriend you she was deaf to them long being timid and wild of every human thing but they were urgent they were eloquent these young girls with their bright eyes these men who spoke of art these wanderers who went to the great city in the end they pressed on her their companionship they too were going to paris they spoke of perils she would run of vouchers she would need she wondered at their charity but in the end walked on with themfearing the red mouse they were mirthful gentle people so she thought they said they followed art they told her she could never enter paris nameless and alone so she went the chief of the little troop watched wonderingly her step her posture her barbaric and lustrous beauty brilliant still even through the pallor of grief and the weariness of fatigue of these he had never seen the like before and he knew their almost priceless value in the world and of the working classes and street mobs of paris listen he said suddenly to her we shall play tonight at the next town will you take a part walking along through the glades of the wood lost in thought she started at his voice i do not know what you mean i meanwill you show yourself with us we will give you no words it will be quite easy what money we make we divide among us all you shall do shall be to stand and be looked atyou are beautiful and you know it no doubt she made a weary sign of assent beautiful what could it matter if she were so or if she were not what the mere thought of it the beauty that she owned though so late a precious possession a crown of glory to her had lost all its fairness and all its wonder since it had been strengthless to bind to hers the only heart in which she cared to rouse a throb of passion since it had been unworthy to draw upon it with any lingering gaze of love the eyes of arslan he looked at her more closely this was a strange creature he thought who being a woman and in her first youth could thus acknowledge her own loveliness with so much candor yet so much indifference that afternoon they halted at a little town that stood in a dell across the fields a small place lying close about a great church tower it was almost dusk when they entered it but it was all alive with lights and shows and trumpets and banners it was the day of a great fair and the merrygorounds were whirling and the trades in gilded cakes and puppets of sugar were thriving fast and the narrow streets were full of a happy and noisy peasant crowd as soon as the little troop entered the first street a glad cry rose they were well known and well liked there the people clustered by dozens round them the women greeting them with kisses the children hugging the dogs the men clamoring with invitations to eat and to drink and be merry they bade her watch them at their art in a rough wooden house outside the wine tavern she stood in the shadow and looked as they bade her while the mimic life of their little stage began and lived its hour to the mind which had received its first instincts of art from the cold lofty passionless creations of arslan from the classic purity and from the divine conception of the old hellenic ideal the art of the stage could seem but poor and idle mimicry gaudy and fragrantless as any painted rose of paper blooming on a tinseled stem the crystal truthfulness the barbaric liberty the pure idealism of her mind and temper revolted in contempt from the visible presentment and the varicolored harlequinade of the actors art to her a note of song a gleam of light a shadowy shape a veiled word were enough to unfold to her passionate fancy a world of dreams a paradise of faith and of desire and for this very cause she shrank away in amazement and disgust from this realistic mockery of mere humanity which left nothing for the imagination to create which spoke no other tongue than the common language of human hopes and fears it could not touch her it could not move her it filled herso far as she could bring herself to think of it at allwith a cold and wondering contempt for to the reed which has once trembled under the melody born of the breath divine the voices of mortal mouths as they scream in rage or exult in clamor or contend in battle must ever seem the idlest and the emptiest of all the sounds under heaven that is your art she said wearily to the actors when they came to her well is it not art and a noble one a scornful shadow swept across her face it is no art it is human always it is never divine there is neither heaven nor hell in it it is all earth they were sharply stung what has given you such thoughts as that they said in their impatience and mortification i have seen great things she said simply and turned away and went out into the darkness and weptalone she who had knelt at the feet of thanatos and who had heard the songs of pan amidst the rushes by the river and had listened to the charmed steps of persephone amidst the flowers of the summercould she honor lesser gods than these they may forgetthey may forsake and he likewise but i never she thought if only she might live a little longer space to serve and suffer for them and for him still of fate she asked nothing higher that night there was much money in the bag the players pressed a share upon her but she refused have i begged from you she said i have earned nothing it was with exceeding difficulty that they ended in persuading her even to share their simple supper she took only bread and water and sat and watched them curiously the players were in high spirits their chief ordered a stoup of bright wine and made merry over it with gayer songs and louder laughter and more frequent jests than even were his wont the men and women of the town came in and out with merry interchange of words the youths of the little bourg chattered light amorous nonsense the young girls smiled and chattered in answer whilst the actors bantered them and made them a hundred love prophecies now and then a dog trotted in to salute the players poodles now and then the quaint face of a pig looked between the legs of its master the door stood open the balmy air blew in beyond the stars shone in a cloudless sky she sat without in the darkness where no light fell among the thick shroud of one of the blossoming boughs of peartrees and now and then she looked and watched their laughter and companionship and their gay and airy buffoonery together there within the winehouse doors all fools enjoy she thought with that bitter wonder that aching disdain that involuntary injustice with which the strong sad patience of a great nature surveys the mindless merriment of lighter hearts and brains more easily lulled into forgetfulness and content they came to her and pressed on her a draught of the wine a share of the food a handful of the honeyed cates of their simple banquet even a portion of their silver and copper pieces with which the little leathern sack of their receipts was fullfor onceto the mouth she refused all the money she threw passionately away am i a beggar she said in her wrath she remained without in the gloom among the cool blossoming branches that swayed abovehead in the still night while the carousal broke up and the peasants went on their way to their homes singing along the dark streets and the lights were put out in the winehouse and the trill of the grasshopper chirped in the fields around you will die of damp roofless in the open air this moonless night men as they passed away said to her in wonder the leaves are roof enough for me she answered them and stayed there with her head resting on the roll of her sheepskin wide awake through the calm dark hours for a bed within she knew that she could not pay and she would not let any charity purchase one for her at daybreak when the others rose she would only take from them the crust that was absolutely needful to keep life in her food seemed to choke her as it passed her lipssince how could she tell but what his lips were parched dry with hunger or were blue and cold in death that morning as they started one of the two youths who bore their traveling gear and the rude appliances of their little stage upon his shoulders from village to village when they journeyed thusbeing oftentimes too poor to permit themselves any other mode of transit and of porteragefell lame and grew faint and was forced to lay down his burden by the roadside she raised the weight upon her back and head as she had been wont to do the weights of timber and of corn for the millhouse and bore it onward in vain they remonstrated with her she would not yield but carried the wooden framework and the folded canvases all through the heat and weariness of the noonday you would have me eat of your supper last night i will have you accept of my payment today she said stubbornly for this seemed to her a labor innocent and just and even full of honor whatever men might say had not helios himself been bound as a slave in thessaly they journeyed far that day along straight sunlit highways and under the shadows of green trees the fields were green with the young corn and the young vines the delicate plumes of the first blossoming lilacs nodded in their footsteps the skies were blue the earth was fragrant at noonday the players halted and threw themselves down beneath a poplartree in a wild rose thicket to eat their noonday meal of bread and a green cress salad the shelter they had chosen was full of fragrance from raindrops still wet upon the grasses and the budding rose vines the hedge was full of honeysuckle and tufts of cowslips the sun was warmer the mildeyed cattle came and looked at them little redstarts picked up their crumbs from a white vinehung cottage an old woman brought them salt and wished them a fair travel but her heart was sick and her feet weary and she asked alwayswhere is paris at last they showed it her that gleaming golden cloud upon the purple haze of the horizon she crossed her hands upon her beating breast and thanked the gods that they had thus given her to behold the city of his desires the chief of the mimes watched her keenly you look at paris he said after a time there you may be great if you will great i she echoed the word with weary incredulity she knew he could but mock at her ay he made answer seriously even you why not there is no dynasty that endures in that golden city save only onethe sovereignty of a womans beauty she started and shuddered a little she thought that she saw the red mouse stir amidst the grasses i want no greatness she said slowly what should i do with it for in her heart she thought what would it serve me to be known to all the world and remembered by all the ages of men if he forgetforget quite chapter xii that night they halted in a little bright village of the leafy and fruitful zone of the cityone of the fragrant and joyous pleasureplaces among the woods where the students and the young girls came for draughts of milk and plunder of primroses and dances by the light of the spring moon and lovewords murmured as they fastened violets in each others breasts the next day she entered paris with them as one of their own people you may be great here if you choose they said to her and laughed she scarcely heard she only knew that here it was that arslan had declared that fameor deathshould come to him the golden cloud dissolved as she drew near to it a great city might be beautiful to others to her it was only as its gilded cage is to a mountain bird the wilderness of roofs the labyrinth of streets the endless walls of stone the ceaseless noises of the living multitude these were horrible to the freeborn blood of her she felt blinded caged pent deafened its magnificence failed to daunt its color to charm its pageantry to beguile her through the glad and gorgeous ways she went wearily and sick of heart for the rush of free winds and the width of free skies as a desertborn captive with limbs of bronze and the eyes of the lion went fettered past the palaces of rome in the triumphal train of africanus or pompeius the little band with which she traveled wondered what her eyes so incessantly looked for in that perpetual intentness with which they searched every knot of faces that was gathered together as a swarm of bees clusters in the sunshine they could not tell they only saw that her eyes never lost that look is it the past or the future that you search for always the shrewdest of them asked her she shuddered a little and made him no answer how could she tell which it waswhether it would be a public fame or a nameless grave that she would light on at the last she was a mystery to them she minded poverty so little she was as content on a draught of water and a bunch of cress as others are on rarest meats and wines she bore bodily fatigue with an arabs endurance and indifference she seemed to care little whether suns beat on her or storms drenched her to the bone whether she slept under a roof or the boughs of a tree whether the people hissed her for a foreign thing of foul omen or clamored aloud in the streets praise of her perfect face she cared nothing she was silent always and she never smiled i must keep my liberty she had said and she kept it by night she toiled ceaselessly for her new masters docile patient enduring laborious bearing the yoke of this labor as she had borne that of her former slavery rather than owe a crust to alms a coin to the gaze of a crowd but by day she searched the city ceaselessly and alone wandering wandering wandering always on a quest that was never ended for amidst the millions of faces that met her gaze arslans was not and she was too solitary too ignorant and locked her secret too tenaciously in her heart to be able to learn tidings of his name so the months of the spring and the summer time went by it was very strange and wondrous to her the human world seemed suddenly all about her the quiet earth on which the cattle grazed and the women threshed and plowed and the sheep browsed the thyme and the mists swept from stream to sea this was all gone and in its stead there was a world of tumult color noise change riot roofs piled on roofs clouds of dust yellow in the sun walls peopled with countless heads of flowers and of women throngs various of hue as gardenbeds of blown anemones endless harmonies and discords always rung together from silver bells and brazen trumpets and the clash of arms and the spray of waters and the screams of anguish and the laughs of mirth and the shrill pipes of an endless revelry and the hollow sighs of a woe that had no rest for the world of a great city of the world as it is mans was all about her and she loathed it and sickened in it and hid her face from it whenever she could and dreamed as poets dream in fever of pathless seas and tawny fields of weeds and dim woods filled with the song of birds and cool skies brooding over a purple moor and all the silence and the loveliness and the freedom of the world as it is gods you are not happy one man said to her happy she said no more but he thought just so had he seen a rosecrested goldeneyed bird of the great savannas look shut in a cage in a showmans caravan and dying slowly with dulled plumage and drooped head while the street mob of a town thrust their fingers through the bars and mocked it and called to it to chatter and be gay show your beauty oncejust once amidst us on the stage and on the morrow you can choose your riches and your jewels from the four winds of heaven as you will the players urged on her a hundred times but she refused always her beautyit was given to the gods to take or leave in life or death for him the months went on she searched for him always a horrible unending vigil that never seemed nearer its end vainly day by day she searched the crowds and the solitudes the gates of the palaces and the vaults of the cellars she thought she saw him a thousand times but she could never tell whether it were truth or fancy she never met him face to face she never heard his name there is no desert wider no maze more unending than a great city she ran hideous peril with every moment that she lived but by the strength and the love that dwelt together in her she escaped them her sad wide open pathetic eyes searched only for his face and saw no other her ear ever strained to listen for one voice was dead to every accent of persuasion or of passion when men tried to tell her she was beautiful she looked them full in the eyes and laughed a terrible dreary laugh of scorn that chilled them to the bone when the gay groups on balconies that glanced golden in the sun flung sweetmeats at her and dashed wine on the ground and called to her for her beautys sake to join them she looked at them with a look that had neither envy nor repugnance in it but only a cold mute weariness of contempt one day a great sculptor waylaid her and showed her a pouch full of money and precious stones all that and more you shall have if you will let me make a cast of your face and your body once in answer she showed him the edge of her hidden knife one day a young man unlike to all the ragged and toilworn crowds that alone beheld her came in those crowded quarters of the poor and watched her with eyes aglow like those of the youth in the old marketsquare about the cathedral and waylaid her later in solitude and slid in her palm a chain studded with precious stones of many colors i am rich he murmured to her i am a prince i can make your name a name of power if only you will come come whither she asked him come with meonly to my suppertablefor one hour my horses wait she threw the chain of stones at her feet i have no hunger she said carelessly go ask those that have to your feast and she gave no other phrase in answer to all the many honeyed and persuasive words with which in vain he urged her that night and many another night until he wearied one day in the green outskirts of the city passing by under a gilded gallery and a wide window full of flowers and hung with delicate draperies there looked out the fair head of a woman with diamonds in the ears and a shroud of lace about it while against the smiling scornful mouth a jeweled hand held a rose and a womans voice called to her mockingly has the devil not heard you yet that you still walk barefoot in the dust on the stones and let the sun beat on your head o fool there is gold in the air and gold in the dust and gold in the very gutter here for a woman and the face was the face and the voice the voice of the gardeners wife of the old town by the sea she raised to the gilded balcony above her great sorrowful musing eyes full of startled courage soon she comprehended and then her gaze gave back scorn for scorn does that brazen scroll shade you better than did the trellised vine she said with her voice ascending clear in its disdain and are those stones in your breast any brighter than the blue was in the eyes of your child the woman above cast the rose at her and laughed and withdrew from the casement she set her heel on the rose and trod its leaves down in the dust it was a yellow rose scentless and lovelessan emblem of pleasure and wealth she left it where it lay and went onward the sweet sins and all their rich profits that she might take as easily as she could have taken the rose from the dust had no power to allure her the gilded balcony the velvet couch the jewels in the ears the purple draperies the ease and the affluence and the joys of the sights and the senses these to her were as powerless to move her envy these to her seemed as idle as the blowballs that a childs breath floated down the current of a summer breeze when once a human ear has heard the whispers of the gods by night steal through the reeds by the river never again to it can there sound anything but discord and empty sound in the tinkling cymbals of brass and the fools bells of silver in which the crowds in their deafness imagine the songs of the heroes and the music of the spheres there are only two trades in a city said the actors to her with a smile as bitter as her own only two tradesto buy souls and to sell them what business have you here who do neither the one nor the other there was music still in this trampled reed of the river into which the gods had once bidden the stray winds and the wandering waters breathe their melody but there in the press the buyers and sellers only saw in it a frail thing of the sand and the stream only made to be woven for barter or bind together the sheaves of the roses of pleasure byandby they grew so impatient of this soul which knew its right errand so little that it would neither accept temptation itself nor deal it to others they grew so impatient to receive that golden guerdon from passion and evil which they had foreseen as their sure wage for her when they had drawn her with them to the meshes of the city that they betrayed her stung and driven into treachery by the intolerable reproach of her continual strength her continual silence they took a heavy price and betrayed her to the man who had set his soul upon her beauty to make it live naked and vile and perfect for all time in marble she saved herself by such madness of rage such fury of resistance as the native tigress knows in the glare of the torches or the bonds of the cords she smote the sculptor with her knife a tumult rose round voices shouted that he was stabbed the men who had betrayed her raised loudest the outcry in the darkness of a narrow street and of a night of tempest she fled from them and buried herself in the dense obscurity which is one of the few privileges of the outcasts it was very poor this quarter where she found refuge men and women at the lowest ebb of life gathered there together there was not much crime it was too poor even for that it was all of that piteous hopeless class that is honest and suffers and keeps silentso silent that no one notices when death replaces life here she got leave to dwell a little while in the topmost corner of a high tower which rose so high so high that the roof of it seemed almost like the very country itself it was so still there and so fresh and the clouds seemed so near and the pigeons flew so close about it all day long and at night so trustfully sought their roost there in a nook of it she made her home it was very old very desolate very barren yet she could bear it better than she could any lower range of dwelling she could see the sunrise and the sunset she could see the rainmists and the planets she could look down on all the white curl of the smoke and she could hear the bells ring with a strange peculiar sweetness striking straight to her ear across the wilderness of roofs and then she had the pigeons they were not much but they were something of the old fresh country life and now and then they brought a head of clover or a spray of grass in their beaks and at sight of it the tears would rush into her eyes and though it was pain it was yet a dearer one than any pleasure that she had she maintained herself still without alms buying her right to live there and the little food that sufficed for her by one of those offices in which the very poor contrive to employ those still poorer than themselves they slept so heavily those people who had the weight of twenty hours toil the pangs of hunger and the chills of cold upon them whenever they laid them down and who would so willingly have slept forever with any night they laid their heads upon their sacks of rags but so long as they woke at all they needed to wake with the first note of the sparrows in the dark she so long used to rise ere ever the first streak of day were seen roused scores of them and in payment they gave her the right to warm herself at their stove a handful of their chestnuts a fragment of their crust a little copper pieceanything that they could afford or she would consent to take a woman who had been the reveilleuse of the quarter many years had died and they were glad of herher eyes have no sleep in them they said and they found that she never failed it was a strange tradeto rise whilst yet for the world it was night and go to and fro the dreary courts up and down the gloom of the staircases and in and out the silent chambers and call all those sons and daughters of wretchedness from the only peace that their lives knew so often she felt so loath to wake them so often she stood beside the bundle of straw on which some dreaming creature sighing and smiling in her sleep murmured of her home and had not the heart rudely to shatter those mercies of the night it was a strange sad office to go alone among all those sleepers in the stillness that came before the dawn and move from house to house from door to door from bed to bed with the one little star of her lamp alone burning they were all so poor so poor it seemed more cruel than murder only to call them from their rest to work and keep alive in them that faculty of suffering which was all they gained from their humanity her pity for them grew so great that her heart perforce softened to them also those strong men gaunt with famine those white women with their starved children on their breasts those young maidens worn blind over the needle or the potters clay those little children who staggered up in the dark to go to the furnace or the wheel or the powdermill or the potatofields outside the wallsshe could neither fear them nor hate them nor do aught save sorrow for them with a dumb passionate wondering grief she saw these people despised for no shame wretched for no sin suffering eternally though guilty of no other fault than that of being in too large numbers on an earth too small for the enormous burden of its endless woe she found that she had companions in her misery and that she was not alone under that bitter scorn which had been poured on her in a manner she grew to care for these human creatures all strangers yet whose solitude she entered and whose rest she roused it was a human interest a human sympathy it drew her from the despair that had closed around her and some of these in turn loved her neither poverty nor wretchedness could dull the lustrous deephued flowerlike beauty that was hers by nature as she ascended the dark stone stairs with the little candle raised above her head and knocking low entered the place where they slept the men and the children alike dreamed of strange shapes of paradise and things of sorcery when she wakes us the children never cry said a woman whom she always summoned an hour before dawn to rise and walk two leagues to a distant factory it was new to her to be welcomed it was new to see the children smile because she touched them it lifted a little the ice that had closed about her heart it had become the height of the summer the burning days and the sultry nights poured down on her bare head and blinded her and filled her throat with the dust of the public ways and parched her mouth with the thirst of overdriven cattle all the while in the hard hot glare she searched for one face all the while in the hard brazen din she listened for one voice she wandered all the day half the night they wondered that she woke so surely with every dawn they did not know that seldom did she ever sleep she sought for him alwayssought the busy crowds of the living sought the burialgrounds of the dead as she passed through the endless ways in the wondrous city as she passed by the vast temples of art as she passed by the open doors of the sacred places which the country had raised to the great memories that it treasured it became clearer to herthis thing of his desires this deathless name amidst a nation this throne on the awed homage of a world for which his life had labored and striven and sickened and endlessly yearned the great purpose the great end to which he had lived grew tangible and present to her and in her heart as she went she said ever let me only die as the reed diedwhat matterso that only the world speak his name chapter xiii one night she stood on the height of the leads of the tower the pigeons had gone to roost the bells had swung themselves into stillness far below the changing crowds were moving ceaselessly but to that calm altitude no sound arose from them the stars were out and a great silver moon bathed half the skies in its white glory in the stones of the parapet windsown blossoms blew to and fro heavy with dew the day had been one of oppressive heat she had toiled all through it seeking seeking seeking what she never found she was covered with dust parched with thirst footweary sick at heart she looked down on the mighty maze of the city and thought how longhow long suddenly a cool hand touched her a soft voice murmured at her ear you are not tired follefarine turning in the gloom she faced sartorian a great terror held her mute and breathless there gazing in the paralysis of horror at this frail life which was for her the incarnation of the world and by whose lips the world said to her come eat and drink and sew your garments with gems and kiss men on the mouth whilst you slay them and plunder and poison and laugh and be wise for all your gods are dead and there is but one god nowthat god is gold you must be tired surely the old man said with soft insistance you never find what you seek you are always alone always hungered and poor always wretched follefarine ah you would not eat my golden pear it was not wise he said so little and yet those slow subtle brief phrases pierced her heart with the full force of their odious meaning she leaned against the wall breathing hard and fast mute for the moment paralyzed you fled away from me that night it was heroic foolish mad yet i bear no anger against it you have not loved the old dead gods for naught you have the temper of their times you obey them though they betray you and forget you follefarine she gazed at him fascinated by her very loathing of him as the bird by the snake who told you she muttered who told you that i dwell here the sun has a million rays so has gold a million eyes do you not know there is nothing you have not done that has not been told to me but i can always wait follefarine you are very strong you are very weak of courseyou have a faith and you follow it and it leads you on and on on and on and one day it will disappearand you will plunge after itand it will drown you you seek for this man and you cannot find even his grave you are like a woman who seeks for her lover on a battlefield but the world is a carnage where the vultures soon pick bare the bones of the slain and all skeletons look alike and are alike unlovely follefarine you cameto say this she said through her locked teeth nayi came to see your beauty your icegod tired soon but imy golden pear would have been better vengeance for a slighted passion than his beggars quarter and these wretched rags she held her misery and her shame and her hatred alike down under enforced composure there is no shame here she said between her teeth a beggars quarter perhaps but these poor copper coins and these rags i earn with clean hands he smiled with that benignant pity with that malign mockery which stung her so ruthlessly no shame oh follefarine did i not tell you that live as you may shame will be always your garment in life and in death youa thing beautiful nameless homeless accursed who dares to dream to be innocent likewise the world will clothe you with shame whether you choose it or not but the world as i say will give you one choice take its red robe boldly from it and weight it with gold and incrust it with jewels believe me the women who wear the white garments of virtue will envy you the red robe bitterly then her arms were crossed upon her breast her eyes gazed at him with the look he had seen in the gloom of the evening under the orchards by the side of the rushing millwater you cameto say this nay i came to see your beauty follefarine your northern god soon tired i say but ilook yonder a moment he pursued and he motioned downward to where the long lines of light gleamed in the wondrous city which was stretched at their feet and the endless murmur of its eternal sea of pleasure floated dimly to them on the soft night air see here follefarine you dwell with the lowest you are the slave of street mimes no eyes see you except those of the harlot the beggar the thief the outcast your wage is a crust and a copper coin you have the fate of your namesake the dust to wander a little while and then sink on the stones of the streets yet that you think worthy and faithful because it is pure of alms and of vice oh beautiful fool what would your lost lover say if beholding you here amidst the reek of the mob and the homage of thieves he would say of you the most bitter thing that a man can say of a woman she has sunk into sin but she has been powerless to gild her sin or make it of more profit than was her innocence and a man has no scorn like the scorn which he feels for a woman who sells her soulat a loss you seeah surely you see follefarine she shook like a leaf where she stood with the yellow and lustrous moonlight about her she sawshe saw now and she had been mad enough to dream that if she lived in honesty and by labor that she loathed won back with hands clean of crime as of alms the gold which he had left in her trust as the wage of her beauty and found him and gave it to him without a word he would at least believebelieve so much as this that her hunger had been famine and her need misery and her homelessness that of the stray dog which is kicked from even a ditch and hunted from even a graveyard but that through it all she had never touched one coin of that cruel and merciless gift you see pursued the low flutelike moaning mockery of her tormentors voice you see you have all the shame it is your birthright and you have nothing of the sweetness which may go with shame for a woman who has beauty now look yonder there lies the world which when i saw you last was to you only an empty name now you know itknow it at least enough to be aware of all you have not all you might have in it if you took my golden pear you must be tired follefarineto stand homeless under the gilded balconies to be footsore in the summer dust among the rolling carriages to stand outcast and famished before the palace gates to see the smiles upon a million mouths and on them all not one smile upon you to show yourself hourly among a mob that you may buy a little bread to eat a little straw to rest on you must be tired follefarine she was silent where she stood in the moonlight with the clouds seeming to lean and touch her and far beneath the blaze of the myriad of lights shining through the soft darkness of the summer night tiredah godtired indeed but not for any cause of which he spake you must be tired now eat of my golden pear and there where the world lies yonder at our feet no name shall be on the mouths of men as your name shall be in a day through the crowds you shall be borne by horses fleet as the winds or you shall lean above them from a gilded gallery and mock them at your fancy there on high in a cloud of flowers great jewels shall beam on you like planets and the only chains that you shall wear shall be links of gold like the chains of a priestess of old your mere wish shall be as a sorcerers wand to bring you the thing of your idlest desire you have been despisedwhat vengeance sweeter than to see men grovel to win your glance as the swine at the feet of circe you have been scorned and accursedwhat retribution fuller than for women to behold in you the sweetness and magnificence of shame and through you envy and fall and worship the evil which begot you has humanity been so fair a friend to you that you can hesitate to strike at its heart with such a vengeanceso symmetrical in justice so cynical in irony humanity cast you out to wither at your birtha thing rootless nameless only meet for the snake and the worm if you bear poison in your fruit is that your fault or the fault of the human hands that cast the chancesown weed out on the dunghill to perish i do not speak of passion i use no anomalous phrase i am old and illfavored and i know that any way you will forever hate me but the rage of the desertbeast is more beautiful than the meek submission of the animal timid and tame it is the lioness in you that i care to chain but your chain shall be of gold follefarine and all women will envy name your price set it high as you will there is nothing that i will refuse nay even i will find your lover who loves not you and i will let you have your fullest vengeance on him a noble vengeance for no other would be worthy of your strength living or dead his genius shall be made known to men and before another summer comes all the world shall toss aloft in triumph the name that is now nothing as the dust isnothing as you are follefarine she heard in silence to the end on the height of the rooftops all was still the stars seemed to beam close against her sight below was the infinite space of the darkness in which lines of light glittered where the haunts of pleasure lay all creatures near her slept the windsown plants blew to and fro rooted in the spaces of the stones as the last words died softly on the quiet of the air in answer she reached her hand upward and broke off a tuft of the yellow wallblossom and cast it out with one turn of her wrist down into the void of the darkness what do i say she said slowly what well this i could seize you and cast you down into the dark below there as easily as i cast that tuft of weed and why i hold my hand i cannot tell it would be just and she turned away and walked from him in the gloom slowly as though the deed she spake of tempted her chapter xiv the poverties of the city devoured her incessantly like wolves the temptations of the city crouched in wait for her incessantly like tigers she was always hungry always heartsick always alone and there was always at her ear some tempting voice telling her that she was beautiful and was a fool yet she never dreamed once of listening of yielding of taking any pity on herself was this virtue she never thought of it as such it was simply instinct the instinct of a supreme fidelity in which all slighter and meaner passions were absorbed and slain once or twice through some lighted casement in some lamplit wood where the little gay boats flashed on fairy lakes she would coldly watch that luxury that indolence that rest of the senses with a curl on her lips where she sat or stood in the shadow of the trees to wear soft stuffs and rich colors to have jewels in their breasts to sleep in satin to hear fools laugh to have both hands full of gold that is what women love she thought and laughed a little in her cold wonder and went back to her high cage in the tower and called the pigeons in from the rooftops at sunset and kissed their purple throats and broke among them her one dry crust and supperless herself sat on the parapet and watched the round white moon rise over the shining roofs of paris she was ignorant she was friendless she was savage she was very wretched but she had a supreme love in her and she was strong a hundred times the red mouse tried to steal through the lips which hunger his servile and unfailing minister would surely the red mouse thought disbar and unclose to him sooner or later you will tire and i can wait follefarine the red mouse had said to her by the tongue of the old man sartorian and he kept his word very patiently he was patient he was wise he believed in the power of gold and he had no faith in the strength of a woman he knew how to waitunseen so that this rare bird should not perceive the net spread for it in its wildness and weariness he did not pursue nor too quickly incense her only in the dark cheerless mists when she rose to go among the world of the sleeping poor at her threshold she would step on some gift worthy of a queens acceptance without date or word gleaming there against the stone of the stairs when she climbed to her hole in the roof at the close of a day all pain all fatigue all vain endeavor all bootless labor to and fro the labyrinth of streets there would be on her bare bench such fruits and flowers as dorothea might have sent from paradise and curled amidst them some thin leaf that would have bought the weight of the pines and of the grapes in gold when in the dusk of the night she went wearily and footsore through the byways and over the sharpset flints of the quarters of the outcasts and the beggars sick with the tumult and the stench and the squalor parched with dust worn with hunger blind with the endless search for one face amidst the millionsgoing homeoh mockery of the wordto a bed of straw to a cage in the roof to a handful of rice as a meal to a night of loneliness and cold and misery at such a moment now and then through the gloom a voice would steal to her saying are you not tired yet follefarine but she never paused to hear the voice nor gave it any answer the mill dust the reed by the river the nameless friendless rootless thing that her fate made her should have been weak and so lightly blown by every chance breezeso the red mouse told her should have asked no better ending than to be wafted up a little while upon the winds of praise or woven with a golden braid into a crown of pleasure yet she was so stubborn and would not yet she dared deride her tempters and defy her destiny and be strong for love was with her and though the red mouse lies often in loves breast and is cradled there a welcome guest yet when love once in a million times shakes off his sloth and flings the red mouse with it from him he flings with a hand of force and the beast crouches and flees and dares meddle with love no more in one of the first weeks of the wilder weather weather that had the purple glow of the autumnal storms and the chills of coming winter on it she arose as her habit was ere the night was altogether spent and lit her little taper and went out upon her rounds to rouse the sleepers she had barely tasted food for many hours all the means of subsistence that she had was the few coins earned from those as poor almost as herself often these went in debt to her and begged for a little time to get the piece or two of base metal that they owed her and she forgave them such debts always not having the heart to take the last miserable pittance from some trembling withered hand which had worked through fourscore years of toil and found no payment but its wrinkles in its palm not having the force to fill her own platter with crusts which could only be purchased by the hunger cries of some starveling infant or by the barter of some little valueless cross of ivory or rosary of berries long cherished in some aching breast after all else was lost or spent she had barely tasted food that day worst of all she had not had even a few grains to scatter to the hungry pigeons as they had fluttered to her on the housetop in the stormy twilight as the evening fell she had lain awake all the night hearing the strokes of the bells sound the hours and seeming to say to her as they beat on the silence dost thou dare to be strong thou a grain of dust a reed of the river a nothing when she rose and drew back the iron staple that fastened her door and went out on the crazy stairway she struck her foot against a thing of metal it glittered in the feeble beams from her lamp she took it up it was a little precious casket such as of old the red mouse lurked in among the pearls to spring out from their whiteness into the purer snow of gretchens bread with it was only one written line when you are tired follefarine she was already tired tired with the horrible thirsty weariness of the young lioness starved and cramped in a cage in a city an old crone sat on a niche on the wall she thrust her lean bony face lit with wolfs eyes through the gloom are you not tired she muttered in the formula taught her are you not tired follefarine if i be what of that she answered and she thrust the case away to the feet of the woman still shut and went on with her little dim taper down round the twist of the stairs she knew what she did what she put away she had come to know too what share the sex of her mother takes in the bringing to the lips of their kind the golden pear that to most needs no pressing if i had only your face and your chances had said to her that day a servinggirl young with sallow cheeks and a hollow voice and eyes of fever who lived in a den lower down on the stairway are you mad that you hunger here when you might hang yourself with diamonds like our lady of atocha cried a dancingwoman with sullen eyes and a yellow skin from the hither side of the mountains who begged in the streets all day so many tongues hissed to her in different fashions it seemed to many of them impious in one like her to dare be stronger than the gold was that assailed her to dare to live up there among the clouds and hunger and thirst and keep her silence and strike dumb all the mouths that tried to woo her down and shake aside all the hands that strove softly to slide their purchasemoneys into hers for they chimed in chorus as the bells did strength in the dustin a reedin a nothing it was a bitter windy morning the rain fell heavily there were no stars out and the air was sharp and raw she was too used to all changes of weather to take heed of it but her thin clothes were soaked through and her hair was drenched as she crossed the courts and traversed the passages to reach her various employers the first she roused was a poor sickly woman sleeping feverishly on an old rope mat the second an old man wrestling with nightmare as the rain poured on him through a hole in the roof making him dream that he was drowning the third was a woman so old that her quarter accredited her with a century of age she woke mumbling that it was hard at her years to have to go and pick rags for a crumb of bread the fourth was a little child not seven he was an orphan and the people who kept him sent him out to get herbs in the outlying villages to sell in the streets and beat him if he let other children be beforehand with him he woke sobbing he had dreamed of his dead mother and cried out that it was so cold so cold there were scores like them at whose doors she knocked or whose chambers she entered the brief kind night was over and they had to arise and workor die why do they not die she wondered and she thought of the dear gods that she had loved the gods of oblivion truly there were no gifts like their gifts and yet men knew their worth so littlebut thrust hypnos back in scorn dashing their winecups in his eyes and mocked oneiros calling him the guest of lovesick fools and of mad poets and against thanatos strove always in hatred and terror as against their dreaded foe it was a strange melancholy dreary labor this into which she had entered it was all dark the little light she bore scarcely shed its rays beyond her feet it was all still the winds sounded infinitely sad among those vaulted passages and the deep shafts of the stairways now and then a womans voice in prayer or a mans in blasphemy echoed dully through the old halfruined buildings otherwise an intense silence reigned there where all save herself were sleeping she used to think it was a city of the dead in which she alone was living and sometimes she had not the heart to waken them when there was a smile on some wan worn face that never knew one in its waking hours or when some childless mother in her lonely bed sleeping in fancy drew young arms about her throat this morning when all her tasks were done and all the toilers summoned to another day of pain she retraced her steps slowly bearing the light aloft and with its feeble rays shed on the colorless splendor of her face and on her luminous dilated troubled eyes that were forever seeking what they never found a long vaulted passage stretched between her and the foot of the steps that led to the tower many doors opened on it the winds wailed through it and the ragged clothes of the tenants blew to and fro upon the swaying cords she traversed it and slowly mounted her own staircase which was spiral and narrow with little loopholes ever and again that looked out upon the walls and higher on the roofs and higher yet upon the open sky by one of these she paused and looked out wearily it was dark still great low rainclouds floated by a little caged bird stirred with a sad note mighty rains swept by from the westward sweet with the smell of the distant fields her heart ached for the country it was so still there in the dusk she knew even in this wild autumn night which there would be so purple with leaf shadow so brown with embracing branches so gray with silvery faint mists of lily white with virgin snows ah god to reach it once again she thought if only to die in it and yet she stayed on in this which was to her the deepest hell stayed on because hein life or deathwas here she started as a hand touched her softly where she stood looking through the narrow space the eyes of sartorian smiled on her through the twilight do you shrink still he said gently put back your knife look at me quietly you will not have the casketvery well your strength is folly yet it is noble it becomes you i do you good for ill i have had search made for your lover who loves not you i have found him living she quivered from head to foot the gray walls reeled round her she feared she hoped she doubted she believed was it hell was it heaven she could not tell she cared not which so that only she could look once more upon the face of arslan living he answered her and still he smiled living come with me and see how he has used the liberty you gave come she staggered to her feet and rose and held her knife close in the bosom of her dress and with passionate eyes of hope and dread searched the face of the old man through the shadows it is the truth she muttered if you mock meif you lie your knife will sheathe itself in my body i know nay i have never lied to you one cannot wear a velvet glove to tame a lioness come with me fear nothing follefarine come with me and see with your own eyesight how the world of men has dealt with this your god i will come sartorian gazed at her in silence you are a barbarian and so you are heroic always i would not lie to you and here i have no need come it is very near to you a breadth of stone can sever two lives though the strength of all the world cannot unite them come she gripped the knife closer and with feet that stumbled as the feet of a dumb beast that goes out to its slaughter followed him through the dark and narrow ways she had no fear for herself she had no dread of treachery or peril for herself she could be strong always and the point of the steel was set hard against her breast but for himhad the gods forgotten had he forgot she was sick and cold and white with terror as she went she dreaded the unknown thing her eyes might look upon she dreaded the truth that she had sought to learn all through the burning months of summer all through the horrors of the crowded city was it well with him or ill had the gods remembered at last had the stubborn necks of men been bent to his feet was he freefree to rise to the heights of lofty desire and never look downward in pity once they passed in silence through many passageways of the great stone hive of human life in which she dwelt once only sartorian paused and looked back and spoke if you find him in a womans arms lost in a sloth of passion what then will you say still let him have greatness in the gloom he saw her stagger as though struck upon the head but she rallied and gazed at him in answer with eyes that would neither change nor shrink what is that to you she said in her shut teeth show me the truth and as for himhe has a right to do as he will have i said ever otherwise he led the way onward in silence this passion so heroic even in its barbarism so faithful even in its wretchedness so pure even in its abandonment almost appalled himand yet on it he had no pity by his lips the world spoke the world which to a creature nameless homeless godless friendless offered only one choiceshame or death and for such privilege of choice bade her be thankful to men and to their deity he led her through many vaulted ways and up the shaft of a stone stairway in a distant side of the vast pile which from holding many habitants of kings and monks and scholars had become the populous home of the most wretched travailers of a great city wait here he said and drew her backward into a hollow in the wall it was nearly dark as she stood there in the darkness looking down through the narrow space there came a shadow to her through the glooma human shadow noiseless and voiceless it ascended the shaft of the stairs with a silent swift tread and passed by her and went onward as it passed the rays of her lamp were shed on it and her eyes at last saw the face of arslan it was pale as death his head was sunk on his breast his lips muttered without the sound of words his fair hair streamed in the wind he moved without haste without pause with the pulseless haste the bloodless quiet of a phantom she had heard men talk of those who being dead yet dwelt on earth and moved amidst the living she had no thought of him in that moment save as among the dead but he dead or living could have no horror for her he dead or living ruled her as the moon the sea and drew her after him and formed the one law of her life she neither trembled nor prayed nor wept nor laughed nor cried aloud in her inconceivable joy her heart stood still as though some hand had caught and gripped it she was silent in the breathless silence of an unspeakable awe and with a step as noiseless as his own she glided in his path through the deep shaft of the stairs upward and upward through the hushed house through the innumerable chambers through the dusky shadows through the chill of the bitter dawn through the close hive of the sleeping creatures up and up into the very roof itself where it seemed to meet the low and lurid clouds and to be lifted from the habitations and the homes of men a doorway was open he passed through it beyond it was a bare square place through which there came the feeblest rays of dawn making the yellow oil flame that burned in it look dull and hot and garish he passed into the chamber and stood still a moment with his head dropped on his chest and his lips muttering sounds without meaning the light fell on his face she saw that he was living crouched on his threshold she watched him her heart leaping with a hope so keen a rapture so intense that its very strength and purity suffocated her like some mountain air too pure and strong for human lungs to breathe he walked in his sleep that sleep so strange and so terrible which drugs the senses and yet stimulates the brain in which the sleeper moves acts remembers returns to daily habits and resorts to daily haunts and yet to all the world around him is deaf and blind and indifferent as the dead the restless brain unstrung by too much travail and too little food had moved the limbs unconsciously to their old haunts and habits and in his sleep though sightless and senseless he seemed still to know and still to suffer for he moved again after a moments rest and passed straight to the wooden trestles on which a great canvas was outstretched he sank down on a rough bench in front of it and passed his hand before the picture with the fond caressing gesture with which a painter shows to another some wave of light some grace of color and then sat there stupidly steadfastly with his elbows on his knees and his head on his hands and his eyes fastened on the creation before him it was a rugged desolate windblown chamber set in the topmost height of the old pile beaten on by all snows drenched by all rains rocked by all storms bare comfortless poor to the direst stretch of poverty close against the clouds and with the brazen bells and teeming roofs of the city close beneath she had dwelt by him for many weeks and no sense of his presence had come to her no instinct had awakened in him towards the love which clung to him with a faithfulness only as great as its humility she praying always to see this man once more and diehad been severed from him by the breadth of a stone as by an oceans width and hedoomed to fail always spending his life in one endeavor and by that one perpetually vanquishedhe had had no space left to look up at a nameless creature with lithe golden limbs about whose head the whitewinged pigeons fluttered at twilight on the housetop his eyes had swept over her more than once but they had had no sight for her they were a poets eyes that saw forever in fancy faces more amorous and divine limbs lovelier and more lilylike mouths sweeter and more persuasive in their kiss than any they ever saw on earth one passion consumed him and left him not pause nor breath nor pity nor sorrow for any other thing he rested from his work and knew that it was good but this could not content him for this his fellowmen denied there was scarcely any light but there was enough for her to read his story bythe story of continual failure yet where she hid upon the threshold her heart beat with wildest music of recovered joy she had found him and she had found him alone no woman leaned upon his breast no soft tossed hair bathed his arms no mouth murmured against his own he was alone her only rival was that one great passion with which she had never in her humility dreamed to mete herself dead he might be to all the world of men dead in his own sight by a worse fate than that or any could give but for her he was livingto her what mattered failure or scorn famine or woe defeat or despair she saw his face once more she crouched upon his threshold now and trembled with the madness of her joy and courted its torture she dared not creep and touch his hand she dared not steal and kneel a moment at his feet he had rejected her he had had no need of her he had left her with the first hour that freedom came to him he had seen her beauty and learned its lines and hues and used them for his art and let it go again a soulless thing that gave him no delight a thing so slight he had thought it scarcely worth his while even to break it for an hours sport this was what he had deemed her that she knew she accepted the fate at his hands with the submission that was an integral part of the love she bore him she had never thought of equality between herself and him he might have beaten her or kicked her as a brute his dog and she would not have resisted nor resented to find him to watch him from a distance to serve him in any humble ways she might to give him his souls desire if any barter of her own soul could purchase itthis was all she asked she had told him that he could have no sins to her and it had been no empty phrase she crouched on his threshold scarcely daring to breathe lest he should hear her in the dull light of dawn and of the sickly lamp she saw the great canvas on the trestles that his eyes without seeing it yet stared atit was the great picture of the barabbas living its completed life in color beautiful fearful and divine full of its majesty of godhead and its mockery of man she knew then how the seasons since they had parted had been spent with him she knew then without any telling her in words how he had given up all his nights and days all his scant store of gold all leisure and comfort and peace all hours of summer sunshine and of midnight cold all laughter of glad places and all pleasures of passion or of ease to render perfect this one work by which he had elected to make good his fame or perish and she knew that he must have failed failed always that spending his life in one endeavor circumstance had been stronger than he and had baffled him perpetually she knew that it was still in vain that he gave his peace and strength and passions all the golden years of manhood and all the dreams and delights of the senses and that although these were a treasure which once spent came back nevermore to the hands which scatter them he had failed to purchase with them though they were his all this sole thing which he besought from the waywardness of fate i will find a name or a grave he had said when they had parted she with the instinct of that supreme love which clung to him with a faithfulness only equaled by its humility needed no second look upon his face to see that no gods had answered him save the gods of oblivionthe gods whose pity he rejected and whose divinity he denied for to the proud eyes of a man looking eaglewise at the faroff sun of a great ambition the coming of thanatos could seem neither as consolation nor as vengeance but only as the crowning irony in the mockery and the futility of life the dawn grew into morning a day broke full of winds and of showers with the dark masses of clouds tossed roughly hither and thither and the bells of the steeples blown harshly out of time and tune and the wet metal roofs glistening through a steam of rain the sleepers wakened of themselves or dreamed on as they might she had no memory of them she crouched in the gloom on his threshold watching him he sank awhile into profound stupor sitting there before his canvas with his head dropped and his eyelids closed then suddenly a shudder ran through him he awoke with a start and shook off the lethargy which drugged him he rose slowly to his feet and looked at the open shutters and saw that it was morning another dayanother day he muttered wearily and he turned from the barabbas towards the form on his threshold he had never looked she sat without and waited waitedfor what she did not know she did not dare even to steal to him and touch his hand with such a timid caress as a beaten dog ventures to give the hand of the master who has driven it from him for even a beaten dog is a creature less humble and timid than a woman that loves and whose love is rejected he took up a palette ready set and went to a blank space of canvas and began to cover it with shapes and shadows on the unconscious creative instinct of the surcharged brain faces and foliage beasts and scrolls the heads of gods the folds of snakes forms of women rising from flames and clouds the flowers of paradise blossoming amidst the corruption and tortures of antenora all were cast in confusion wave on wave shape on shape horror with loveliness air with flame heaven with hell in all the mad tumult of an artists dreams with a curse he flung his brushes from him and cast himself face downward on his bed of straw the riot of fever was in his blood famine sleepless nights unnatural defiance of all passions and all joys the pestilence rife in the crowded quarter of the poorall these had done their work upon him he had breathed in the foul air of plaguestricken places unconscious of its peril he had starved his body reckless of the flight of time he had consumed his manhood in one ceaseless ruthless and absorbing sacrifice and nature whom he had thus outraged and thought to outrage with impunity as mere bestial feebleness took her vengeance on him and cast him here and mocked him crying a deathless nameoh madman a little breath on the mouths of men in all the ages to comeoh fool hereafter you cryoh foolheaven and earth may pass away like a scroll that is burnt into ashes and the future you live for may never comeneither for you nor the world what you may gainwho shall say but all you have missed i know and no man shall scorn meand pass unscathed there came an old lame woman by laboriously bearing a load of firewood she paused beside the threshold you look yonder she said resting her eyes on the stranger crouching on the threshold are you anything to that man silence only answered her he has no friends muttered the cripple no human being has ever come to him and he has been here many months he will be madvery soon i have seen it before those men do not die their bodies are too strong but their brains golook you and their brains go and yet they liveto fourscore and ten many a timeshut up and manacled like wild beasts follefarine shivered where she crouched in the shadow of the doorway she still said nothing the crone mumbled on indifferent of answer and yet pitiful gazing into the chamber i have watched him often he is fair to look atone is never too old to care for that all winter spring and summer he has lived so hardso cold too and so silentpainting that strange thing yonder he looks like a kinghe lives like a beggar the picture was his godsee you and no doubt he has set his soul on famemen will all the world is mad one day in the springtime it was sent somewherethat great thing yonder on the trestlesto be seen by the world no doubt and whoever its fate lay with would not see any greatness in it or else no eyes would look it came back as it went no doubt they knew bestin the world that was in the spring of the year he has been like this ever since walking most nightsstarving most daysi think but he is always silent the speaker raised her wood and went slowly muttering as she limped down each steep stair there must hang a crown of stars i supposesomewheresince so many of them forever try to reach one but all they ever get here below is a crown of straws in a madhouse the woman says aright the voice of sartorian murmured low against her ear she had forgotten that he was near from the first moment that her eyes had once more fed themselves upon the face of arslan the woman says aright he echoed softly this man will perish his body may not die but his brain willsurely and yet for his life you would give yours she looked up with a gleam of incredulous hope she was yet so ignorant she thought there might yet be ways by which one life could buy anothers from the mercy of earth from the pity of heaven ah she murmured with a swift soft trembling eagerness if the gods would but rememberand take meinstead but they forgetthey forget always he smiled ay truly the gods forget but if you would give yourself to death for him why not do a lesser thinggive your beauty follefarine a scarlet flush burned her from head to foot for once she mistook his meaning she thought how could a beauty that hewho perished therehad scorned have rarity or grace in those cold eyes of force or light enough to lure him from his grave the low melody of the voice in her ear flowed on see youwhat he lacks is only the sinew that gold gives what he has done is great the world rightly seeing must fear it and fear is the highest homage the world ever gives but he is penniless and he has many foes and jealousy can with so much ease thrust aside the greatness which it fears into obscurity when that greatness is marred by the failures and the feebleness of poverty genius scorns the power of gold it is wrong gold is the war scythe on its chariot which mows down the millions of its foes and gives free passage to the suncoursers with which it leaves those heavenly fields of light for the gross battlefields of earth you were to give that gold she muttered in her throat nay not so i was to set him free to find his fame or his grave as he might he will soon find one no doubt nay you would make no bond with me follefarine you scorned my golden pear otherwisehow great they are that cruel scorn that burning color that icelike coldness if the world could be brought to see them once aright the world would know that no powers greater than these have been among it for many ages but who shall force the world to lookwho it is so deaf so slow of foot so blind unless the film before its eyes be opened by gold he paused and waited she watched silent on the threshold there the cruel skill of his words cast on her all the weight of this ruin which they watched her love must needs be weak her pledge to the gods must needs be but imperfectly redeemed since she who had bade them let her perish in his stead recoiled from the lingering living death of any shame if such could save him the sweet voice of sartorian murmured on nay it were easy he has many foes he daunts the world and scourges it men hate him and thrust him into oblivion yet it were easya few praises to the powerful a few bribes to the base and yonder thing once lifted up in the full light of the world would make him greatbeyond any mans disputeforever i could do it almost in a day and he need never know but then you are not tired follefarine she writhed from him as the doe struck to the ground writhes from the hounds at her throat kill me she muttered will not that serve you kill meand save him sartorian smiled ah you are but weak after all follefarine you would die for that mans single sakeso you say and yet it is not him whom you love it is yourself if this passion of yours were great and pure as you say would you pause could you ask yourself twice if what you think your shame would not grow noble and pure beyond all honor being embraced for his sake nay you are weak like all your sex you would die so you say to say it is easy but to live that were harder you will not sacrifice yourselfso and yet it were greater far follefarine to endure for his sake in silence one look of his scorn than to brave in visionary phrase the thrusts of a thousand daggers the pangs of a thousand deaths kill you vain words cost but little but to save him by sacrifice that he shall never acknowledge to reach a heroism which he shall ever regard as a cowardice to live and see him pass you by in cold contempt while in your heart you shut your secret and know that you have given him his souls desire and saved the genius in him from a madmans cell and from a paupers graveah that is beyond you beyond any woman perhaps and yet your love seemed great enough almost to reach such a height as this i thought he looked at her once then turned away he left in her soul the barbed sting of remorse he had made her think her faith her love her strength her sinless force were but the cowardly fruit of cruelest selflove that dared all things in wordsyet in act failed to save him by any martyrdom of her body or her soul so she had sworn yet nowsuddenly she seemed base to herself and timorous and false when daybreak came fully over the roofs of the city it found him senseless sightless dying in a garret the only freedom that he had reached was the delirious liberty of the brain which in its madness casts aside all bonds of time and place and memory and reason all the day she watched beside him there amidst the brazen clangor of the bells and scream of the rough winds above the roofs in the gloom of the place the burning color of the great canvas of jerusalem glowed in its wondrous pomp and power against all the gray cold poverty of the wretched place and the wanton laughed with her lover on the housetop and the thief clutched the rolling gold and the children lapped the purple stream of the wasted wine and the throngs flocked after the thief whom they had elected for their god and ever and again a stray flickering ray of light flashed from the gloom of the desolate chamber and struck upon it till it glowed like flamethis mighty parable whereby the choice of the people was symbolized for all time the choice eternal which never changes but forever turns from all diviner life to grovel in the dust before the beast the magnificence of thought the glory of imagination the radiance of color which the canvas held served only to make more naked more barren more hideous the absolute desolation which reigned around not one grace not one charm not one consolation had been left to the life of the man who had sacrificed all things to the inexorable tyranny of his genius destitution in its ghastliest and most bitter meaning was alone his recompense and portion save a few of the tools and pigments of his art and a little opium in a broken glass there was nothing there to stand between him and utter famine when her eyes had first dwelt upon him lying senseless under the gaze of the gods he had not been more absolutely destitute than he was now the hard sharp outlines of his fleshless limbs the sunken temples the hollow cheeks the heavy respiration which spoke each breath a pangall these told their story with an eloquence more cruel than lies in any words he had dared to scourge the world without gold in his hand wherewith to bribe it to bear his stripes and the world had been stronger than he and had taken its vengeance and had cast him here powerless all the day through she watched beside himwatched the dull mute suffering of stupor which was only broken by fierce unconscious words muttered in the unknown tongue of his birthcountry she could give him no aid no food no succor she was the slave of the poorest of the poor she had not upon her even so much as a copper piece to buy a crust of bread a stoup of wine a little cluster of autumn fruit to cool her burning lips she had nothingshe who in the world of men had dared to be strong and to shut her lips and to keep her hands clean and her feet straight she whose soul had been closed against the red mouse if she had gone down among the dancing throngs and rioted with them and feasted with them and lived vilely they would have hung her breast with gems and paved her path with gold that she knew and she could have saved him where she kneeled beside his bed she drew his hands against her hearttimidly lest consciousness should come to him and he should curse her and drive her thenceand laid her lips on them and bathed them in the scorching dew of her hot tears and prayed him to pardon her if it had been weakness in herif it had been feebleness and selfpity thus to shrink from any abasement any vileness any martyrdom if such could have done him service she did not know she felt astray and blind and full of guilt it might beso she thoughtthat it was thus the gods had tested her thus they had bade her suffer shame to give him glory thus they had tried her strengthand found her wanting herself she was so utterly nothing in her own sight and he was so utterly all in all her life was a thing so undesired and so valueless and his a thing so great and so measureless in majesty that it seemed to her she might have erred in thrusting away infamy since infamy would have brought with it gold to serve him dignity innocence strength pridewhat right had she to these what title had she to claim themshe who had been less than the dust from her birth upward to perish for him anyhowthat was all that she had craved in prayer of the gods and she watched him now all through the bitter day watched him dying of hunger of fever of endless desire of continual failureand was helpless more helpless even than she had been when first she had claimed back his life from thanatos seven days she watched thus by him amidst the metal clangor of the bells amidst the wailing of the autumn winds between the roofs she moistened his lips with a little water it was all he took a few times she left him and stole down amidst the people whom she had served and was met by a curse from most of them for they thought that she tended some unknown fever which she might bring amidst them so they drove her back and would hear naught of her a few more pitiful than the rest flung her twice or thrice a little broken bread she took it eagerly and fed on it knowing that she must keep life in her by some food or leave him utterly alone for him she had laid down all pride for him she would have kissed the feet of the basest or sued to the lowest for alms and when the peoplewhose debts to her she had often forgiven and whom she had once fancied had borne her a little lovedrove her from them with harshest reviling she answered nothing but dropped her head and turned and crept again up the winding stairs to kneel beside his couch of straw and wonder in the bewildered anguish of her aching brain if indeed evil were goodsince evil alone could save him seven days went by the chimes of the bells blown on the wild autumn winds in strange bursts of jangled sound the ceaseless murmur of the citys crowd surging ever on the silence from the far depths below sunrise and moonrise following one another with no change in the perishing life that she alone guarded whilst every day the light that freshly rose upon the world found the picture of the barabbas and shone on the god rejected and the thief adored every night during those seven days the flutelike voice of her tempter made its hated music on her ear it asked always are you tired follefarine her ears were always deaf her lips were always dumb on the eighth night he paused a little longer by her in the gloom he dies there he said slowly resting his tranquil musing gaze upon the bed of straw it is a pity so little would save him still a little wine a little fruit a little skillhis souls desire when his sense returns so littleand he would live and he would be great and the secret sins of the barabbas would scourge the nations and the nations out of very fear and very shame would lift their voices loud and hail him prophet and seer her strength was broken as she heard she turned and flung herself in supplication at his feet so littleso little and you hold your hand sartorian smiled nay you hold your silence follefarine she did not move her upraised face spoke without words the passion of her prayer save himsave him so little so you say and the gods will not hear the gods are all dead follefarine save him you are as a god save him i am but a mortal follefarine can i open the gates of the tomb or close them you can save himfor you have gold he smiled still ah you learn at last that there is but one god you have been slow to believe follefarine she clung to him she writhed around him she kissed with her soilless lips the base dust at his feet you hold the keys of the world you can save the life of his body you can give him the life of his soul you are a beast a devil a thing foul and unclean and without mercy and cruel as a lie and therefore you are the thing that men follow and worship and obey i knowi know you can save him if you will she laughed where she was stretched upon the ground a laugh that stayed the smile upon his mouth he stooped and the sweetness of his voice was low and soft as the south wind i will save him if you say that you are tired follefarine where she was stretched face downward at his feet she shuddered as though the folds of a snake curled round her and stifled and slew her with a touch i cannot she muttered faintly in her throat then let him die he said and turned away once again he smiled the hours passed she did not move stretched there she wrestled with her agony as the fatepursued wrestled with their doom on the steps of the temple while the dread eumenides drew round them and waitedwaiting in cold patience for the slow sure end she arose and went to his side as a dying beast in the public roadway under a blow staggers to its feet to breathe its last let him die she muttered with lips dry as the lips of the dead let him die once more the choice was left to her so men said and the gods were dead an old man with a vultures eyes and bony fingers and rags that were plaguestricken with the poisons of filth and of disease had followed and looked at her in the doorway and kicked her where she lay he owes me twenty days for the room he muttered while his breath scorched her throat with the fumes of drink a debt is a debt tomorrow i will take the canvas it will do to burn you shiverfool if you chose you could fill this garret with gold this very night but you love this man and so you let him perish while you prate of shame ohho that is a woman he went away through the blackness and the stench muttering as he struck his staff upon each stair the picture will feed the stove the law will give me that she heard and shivered and looked at the bed of straw and on the great canvas of the barabbas before another day had come and gone he would lie in the common ditch of the poor and the work of his hand would be withered as a scroll withers in a flame if she tried once more if she sought human pity human aid some deliverance some mercywho could saymight yet be found she thought the gods were dead but menwere they all more wanton than the snake more cruel than the scorpion for the first time in seven days she left his side she rose and staggered from the garret down the stairway into the lower stories of the wilderness of wood and stone she traced her way blindly to the places she had known they closed their doors in haste and fled from her in terror they had heard that she had gone to tend some madman plaguestricken with some nameless fever and those wretched lives to life clung closely with a frantic lore one woman she stayed and held with timid eager bands of this woman she had taken nothing all the summer long in wage for waking her tired eyes at daybreak have pity she muttered you are poor indeed i know but help me he dies there the woman shook her off and shrank get you gone she cried my little child will sicken if you breathe on her the others said the same some less harshly some more harshly twice or thrice they added you beg of us and send the jewels back go and be wise make your harvest of gold whilst you can reap while you may in the yellow fields with the sharp sure sickle of youth not one among them braved the peril of a touch of pity not one among them asked the story of her woe and when the little children ran to her their mothers plucked them back and cried art mad she is plaguestricken she went from them in silence and left them and passed out into the open air in all this labyrinth of roofs in all these human herds she yet thought surely there must be some who pity for even yet she was so young and even yet she knew the world so little she went out into the streets her brain was on fire and her heart seemed frozen her lips moved without sound and unconsciously shaped the words which night and day pursued her a little golda little gold so slight a thing they said and yet high above reach as aldebaran when it glistened through the stormwrack of the rain why could he have not been contentshe had beenwith the rush of the winds over the plains the strife of the flood and the hurricane the smell of the fruithung ways at night the cool green shadows of the summer woods the courses of the clouds the rapture of the keen air blowing from the sea the flight of a bird over the tossing poppies the daysong of the lark all these were life enough for her were freedom loveliness companionship and solace ah god she thought if only these had made the world of his desires likewise and even in her ghastlier grief her heart sickened for them in vain anguish as she wentthese the pure joys of earth and air which were her only heritage she went out into the streets it was a night of wind and rain the lamps flickered through the watery darkness beggars and thieves and harlots jostled her in the narrow ways it must be hellthe hell of the christians she muttered as she stood alone on the flints of the roads in the rancid smell in the hideous riot in the ghastly mirth in the choking stench in the thick steam of the darkness whose few dull gleams of yellow light served to show the false red on a harlots cheek or the bleeding wound on a crippled horse or the reeling dance of a drunkard it was the hell of the christians in it there was no hope for her she moved on with slow unconscious movement of her limbs her hair blew back her eyes had a pitiless wonder in their vacant stare her bloodless face had the horror in it that greek sculptors gave to the face of those whom a relentless destiny pursued and hunted down ever and again she looked back as she went as though some nameless shapeless unutterable horror were behind her in her steps the people called her mad and laughed and hooted her when they had any space to think of her at all a little food a little wine for pitys sake she murmured for her own needs she had never asked a crust in charity but for hisshe would have kissed the mud from the feet of any creature who would have had thus much of mercy in answer they only mocked her some struck her in the palm of her outstretched hand some called her by foul names some seized her with a drunken laugh and cursed her as she writhed from their lewd hold some and these often women whispered to her of the bagnio and the brothel some muttered against her as a thief one a youth who gave her the gentlest answer that she had murmured in her ear a beggar with that face come tarry with me tonight she went on through the sulphurous yellow glare and the poisonous steam of these human styes shuddering from the hands that grasped the voices that wooed her the looks that ravished her the laughs that mocked her it was the hell of the christians it was a city at midnight and its very stones seem to arise and give tongue in her derision and cry oh fool you dreamt of a sacrifice which should be honor of a death which should be release of a means whereby through you the world should hear the old songs of the gods oh fool we are christians here and we only gather the reeds of the river to bruise them and break them and thrust them songless and dead in the name of our lord she stumbled on through the narrow ways after a little space they widened and the lights multiplied and through the rushing rains she saw the gay casements of the houses of pleasure on the gust of wind there came a breath of fragrance from a root of autumn blossom in a balcony the old fresh woodland smell smote her as with a blow the people in the street looked after her she is mad they said to one another and went onward she came to a broad place which even in that night of storm was still a blaze of fire and seemed to her to laugh through all its marble mask and all its million eyes of golden light a cruel laugh which mocked and said the seven chords of the lyre who listens who cares who has ears to hear but the rod of wealth all women kiss and to its rule all men crawl forever you dreamt to give him immortalityfool give him goldgive him gold we are christians here and we have but one god under one of the burning cressets of flame there was a slab of stone on which were piled bedded in leaves all red and gold with pomp of autumn the fruits of the vine in great clear pyramids of white and purple tossed there so idly in such profusion from the past vintagetime that a copper coin or two could buy a feast for half a score of mouths some of the clusters rotted already from their overripeness she looked at them with the passionate woeful eyes of a dog mad with thirst which can see water and yet cannot reach it she leaned towards them she caught their delicious coldness in her burning hands she breathed in their old familiar fragrance with quick convulsive breath he dies there she muttered lifting her face to the eyes of the woman guarding them he dies there would you give me a little cluster ever such a little one to cool his mouth for pitys sake the woman thrust her away and raised shrill and sharp through all the clamor of the crowd the cry of thief a score of hands were stretched to seize her only the fleetness of her feet saved her she escaped from them and as a hare flies to her form so she fled to the place whence she came she had done all she could she had made one effort for his sake and all living creatures had repulsed her none would believe none would pity none would hear her last strength was broken her last faint hope had failed in her utter wretchedness she ceased to wonder she ceased to revolt she accepted the fate which all men told her was her heritage and portion it was i who was mad she thought so mad so vain to dream that i might ever be chosen as the reed was chosen if i can save him anyhow what matter what matter for me she went back to the place where he laydying unless help came to him she climbed the stairway and stole through the foulness and the darkness of the winding ways and retraced her steps and stood upon his threshold she had been absent but one hour yet already the last most abject most wretched penalty of death had come to him they robbed him in his senselessness the night was wet the rain dropped through the roof the rats fought on the floor and climbed the walls the broken lattice blew to and fro with every gust of wind a palsied crone with ravenous hands sheared the locks of his fair hair muttering they will fetch a stoup of brandy and they would take them tomorrow in the deadhouse the old man who owned the garret crammed into a wallet such few things of metal or of wood or of paper as were left in the utter poverty of the place muttering as he gathered the poor shreds of art they will do to burn they will do to burn at sunrise i will get help and carry the great canvas down the rats hurried to their holes at the light the hag let fall her shears and fled through an opening in the wall the old man looked up and smiled with a ghastly leer upon her in the shadows tomorrow i will have the great canvas he said as he passed out bearing his wallet with him and the students will give me a silver bit for certain for that fine corpse of his it will make good work for their knives and their mouldingclay and he will be dead tomorrowdead dead and he grinned in her eyes as he passed her a shiver shook her she said nothing it seemed to her as though she would never speak again she set down her lamp and crossed the chamber and kneeled beside the straw that made his bed she was quite calm she knew that the world gave her one chanceone only she knew that men alone reigned and that the gods were dead she flung herself beside him on the straw and wound her arms about him and laid his head to rest upon her heart one momenthe would never know between them there would be forever silence he would never know greatness would come to him and the dominion of gold and the work of his hands would pass amidst the treasures of the nations and he would live and arise and say the desire of my heart is mineand yet he would never know that one creature had so loved him that she had perished more horribly than by death to save him if he lived to the uttermost years of man he would never know how body and soul she had passed away to destruction for his sake to die with him she laughed to think how sweet and calm such sacrifice as that had been amidst the folded lilies on the white waters as the moon roseshe laughed to think how she had sometimes dreamed to slay herself in such tender summer peace for him that was how women perished whom men loved and loved enough to die with them their lips upon each others to the last but she death in peace sacrifice in honor a little memory in a human heart a little place in a great hereafter these were things too noble for herso they said a martyrdom in shame a life in ignominythese were all to which she might aspireso they said upon his breast women would sink to sleep among his hair their hands would wander and on his mouth their sighs would spend themselves shut in the folded leaves of the unblossomed years some dreams of passion and some flower of love must lie for himthat she knew she loved him with that fierce and envious force which grudged the wind its privilege to breathe upon his lips the earth its right to bear his footsteps which was forever jealous of the mere echo of his voice avaricious of the mere touch of his hand and when she gave him to the future she gave him to other eyes that would grow blind with passion meeting his to other forms that would burn with sweetest shame beneath his gaze to other lives whose memories would pass with his to the great hereafter made immortal by his touch all these she gave she knew almost it was stronger than her strength almost she yielded to the desire which burned in her to let him dieand die there with himand so hold him forever hers and not the worlds his and none others in the eternal union of the grave so that with hers his beauty should be consumed and so that with hers his body should be shut from human sight and the same corruption feed together on their hearts almost she yielded but the greatness of her love was stronger than its vileness and its humility was more perfect than its cruelty it seemed to hermad and bruised and stunned with her miserythat for a thing so worthless and loveless and despised as she to suffer deadliest shame to save a life so great as his was after all a fate more noble than she could have hoped for herwhat could it mattera thing baser than the dustwhether the feet of men trampled her in scorn a little more a little less before she sank away into the eternal night wherein all things are equal and all things forgotten chapter xv that night the moon found the red mouse and said did i not declare aright over every female thing you are victorioussoon or late but the red mouse answered nay not so for the soul still is closed against me and the soul still is pure but this men do not see and women cannot knowthey are so blind chapter xvi ere another year had been fully born the world spoke in homage and in wonder of two things the one a genius which had suddenly arisen in its midst and taken vengeance for the long neglect of bitter years and scourged the world with pitiless scorn until before this mighty struggle which it had dared once to deride and to deny it crouched trembling and wondered and did homage and said in fear truly this man is great and truth is terrible the otherthe bodily beauty of a woman a beauty rarely seen in open day but only in the innermost recesses of a sensualists palace a creature barefooted with chains of gold about her ankles and loose white robes which showed each undulation of the perfect limbs and on her breast the fires of a knot of opal a creature in whose eyes there was one changeless look as of some desert beast taken from the freedom of the air and cast to the darkness of some unutterable horror a creature whose lips were forever mute mute as the tortured lips of laena one day the man whom the nations at last had crowned saw the creature whom it was a tyrants pleasure to place beside him now and then in the public ways as a tribune of rome placed in his chariot of triumph the vanquished splendor of some imperial thing of asia made his slave across the clear hot light of noon the eyes of arslan fell on hers for the first time since they had looked on her amidst the pale poppies in the noonrise in the fields they smiled on her with a cold serene ironic scorn so soon he murmured and passed onward whilst the people made way for him in homage he had his hearts desire he was great he only smiled to thinkall women were alike her body shrank her head dropped as though a knife were thrust into her breast but her lips kept their silence to the last they were so strong they were so mute they did not even once cry out against him for thy sake chapter xvii in the springtime of the year three gods watched by the river the golden willows blew in the low winds the waters came and went the moon rose full and cold over a silvery stream the reeds sighed in the silence two winters had drifted by and one hot drowsy summer and all the white still shapes upon the walls of the granary already had been slain by the cold breath of time the green weeds waved in the empty casements the chancesown seeds of thistles and of bellflowers were taking leaf between the square stones of the paven floors on the deserted threshold lichens and brambles climbed together the filmy ooze of a rank vegetation stole over the loveliness of persephone and devoured one by one the immortal offspring of zeus about the feet of the bound sunking in phaeros and over the calm serene mockery of hermes smile the gray nets of the spiders webs had been woven to and fro around and across with the lacing of a million threads as fate weaves round the limbs and covers the eyes of mortals as they stumble blindly from their birthplace to their grave all things the damp and the dust the frost and the scorch the newts and the rats the fret of the flooded water and the stealing sure inroad of the mosses that everywhere grew from the dews and the fogs had taken and eaten in hunger or sport or had touched and thieved from then left gangrened and ruined the three gods alone remained who being the sons of eternal night are unharmed and unaltered by any passage of the years of earththe only gods who never bend beneath the yoke of time but unblenchingly behold the nations wither as uncounted leaves and the lands and the seas change places and the cities and the empires pass away as a tale that is told and the deities that are worshiped in the temples change name and attributes and cultus at the wanton will of the age that begat them in the still cold moonlit air they stand together hand in band looking outward through the white nightmists other gods perished with the faith of each age as it changed other gods lived by the breath of mens lips the tears of prayer the smoke of sacrifice but theytheir empire is the universe in every young soul that leaps into the light of life rejoicing blindly oneiros has dominion and he alone in every creature that breathes from the conqueror resting on a field of blood to the nestbird cradled in its bed of leaves hypnos holds a sovereignty which nothing mortal can long resist and live and thanatosto him belongs every created thing past present and to come beneath his foot all generations lie and in the hollow of his hand he holds the worlds though the earth be tenantless and the heavens sunless and the planets shrivel in their courses and the universe be desolate in an endless night yet through the eternal darkness thanatos still will reign and through its eternal solitudes he alone will wander and he still behold his work deathless as themselves their shadows stood and the worm and the lizard and the newt left them alone and dared not wind about their calm clear brows and dared not steal to touch the roses at their lipsknowing that ere the birth of the worlds these were and when the worlds shall have perished they still will reign onthe slow sure soundless changeless ministers of an eternal rest of an eternal oblivion a little light strayed in from the gray skies pale as the primroseflowers that grow among the reeds upon the shore and found its way to them trembling and shone in the farseeing depths of their unfathomable eyes to eyes which spake and said sleep dreams and deathwe are the only gods that answer prayer with the faint gleam of the tender evening light there came across the threshold a human form barefooted bareheaded with broken links of golden chains gleaming here and there upon her limbs with white robes hanging heavily soaked with dews and rains with sweet familiar smells of nightborn blossoms of wet leaves of budding palmboughs of rich dark seedsown fields and the white flowerfoam of orchards shedding their fragrance from about her as she moved her face was bloodless as the faces of the gods her eyes had a look of blindness her lips were closelocked together her feet stumbled often yet her path was straight she had hidden by day she had fled by night all human creatures had scattered from her path in terror of her as of some unearthly thing she had made her way blindly yet surely through the sweet cool air through the shadows and the grasses through the sighing sounds of bells through the leafy ways through the pastures where the herds were sleeping through the daffodils blowing in the shallow brooksthrough all the things for which her life had been athirst so long and which she reached too latetoo late for any coolness of sweet grass beneath her limbs to give her rest too late for any twilight song of misselthrush or merle to touch her dumb dead heart to music too late for any kiss of clustering leaves to heal the blistering shame that burned upon her lips and withered all their youth and yet she loved themloved them never yet more utterly than now when she came back to them as persephone to the pomegranateflowers of hell she crossed the threshold whilst the reeds that grew in the water by the steps bathed her feet and blew together softly against her limbs sorrowing for this life so like their own which had dreamed of the songs of the gods and had only heard the hiss of the snakes she fell at the feet of thanatos the bonds of her silence were loosened the lips dumb so long for loves sake found voice and cried out how longhow long wilt thou never take pity and stoop and say enough i have kept faith i have kept silence to the end the gods know my life for his my soul for his so i said so i have given i would not have it otherwise nayi am glad i am content i am strong seei have never spoken the gods have let me perish in his stead nay i suffer nothing what can it matterfor me nay i thank thee that thou hast given my vileness to be the means of his glory he is immortal and i am less than the dustwhat matter he must not know he must never know and one day i might be weak or mad and speak take me whilst still i am strong a little while agone in the space in the crowds he saw me so soon he saidand smiled and yet i live keep faith with me keep faithat last slay me nowquicklyfor pitys sake just oncei speak thanatos in answer laid his hand upon her lips and sealed them and their secret with them mute for evermore she had been faithful to the end to such a faith there is no recompense of men or of the gods save only death on the shores of the river the winds swept through the reeds and sighing amidst them mourned saying a thing as free as we are and as fair as the light has perished a thing whose joys were made like ours from song of the birds from sight of the sun from sound of the waters from smell of the fields from the tossing spray of the white fruitboughs from the play of the grasses at sunrise from all the sweet and innocent liberties of earth and air she has perished as a trampled leaf as a broken shell as a rose that falls in the public ways as a star that is cast down on an autumn night she has died as the dust dies and none sorrow what matterwhat matter men are wise and gods are justthey say the moon shone cold and clear the breath of the wild thyme was sweet upon the air the leaves blew together murmuring the shadows of the clouds were dark upon the stream she lay dead at the feet of the sons of night the red mouse sat without and watched and said to the end she hath escaped me the noisome creatures of the place stole away trembling the nameless things begotten by loneliness and gloom glided to their holes as though afraid the blind newts crept into the utter darkness afar off the pure cool winds alone hovered near her and moved her hair and touched her limbs with all the fragrance of forest and plain of the pure young year and the blossoming woodlands of the green gardenways and the silvery sea the lives of the earth and the air and the waters alone mourned for this life which was gone from amidst them free even in basest bondage pure though every hand had cast defilement on it incorrupt through all corruptionfor loves sake chapter xviii in the springtime of the year three reapers cut to the roots the reeds that grew by the river they worked at dawn of day the skies were gray and dark the still and misty current flowed in with a full tide the air was filled with the scent of white fruitblossoms in the hush of the daybreak the song of a lark thrilled the silence under the sweep of the steel the reeds fell resting from their labors with the rushes slain around them they looking vacantly through the hollow casements saw her body lying there at the feet of the gods of oblivion at first they were shaken and afraid then the gleam of the gold upon her limbs awakened avarice and avarice was more powerful than fear they waded through the rushes and crossed the threshold and venturing within stood looking on her in awe and wonder then timorously touched her and turned her face to the faint light then they said that she was dead it is that evil thing come back upon us they muttered to one another and stood looking at one another and at her afraid they spoke in whispers they were very fearful it was still twilight it were a righteous act to thrust her in a grave they murmured to one another at the lastand paused ay truly they agreed otherwise she may break the bonds of the tomb and rise again and haunt us always who can say but the gold and then they paused again it were a sin one murmuredit were a sin to bury the pure good gold in darkness even if it came from hell the priests will bless it for us answered the other twain against the reddening skies the lark was singing the three reapers waited a little still afraid then hastily as men slaughter a thing they dread may rise against them they stripped the white robes from her and drew off the anklets of gold from her feet and the chains of gold that were riven about her breast and limbs when they had stripped her body bare they were stricken with a terror of the dead whom they thus violated with their theft and being consumed with apprehension lest any as the day grew lighter should pass by there and see what they had done they went out in trembling haste and together dug deep down into the wet sands where the reeds grew and dragged her still warm body unshrouded to the air and thrust it down there into its nameless grave and covered it and left it to the rising of the tide then with the gold they hurried to their homes the waters rose and washed smooth the displaced soil and rippled in a sheet of silver as the sun rose over the place and effaced all traces of their work so that no man knew this thing which they had done in her death as in her life she was friendless and alone and none avenged her the reeds blew together by the river now red in the daybreak now white in the moonrise and the winds sighed through them wearily for they were songless and the gods were dead the seasons came and went the waters rose and sank in the golden willows the young birds made music with their wings the softfooted things of brake and brush stole down through the shade of the leaves and drank at the edge of the shore and fled away the people passed down the slow current of the stream with lily sheaves of the blossoming spring with ruddy fruitage of the summer woods with yellow harvest of the autumn fieldspassed singing smiting the frail songless as they went but none paused there for thanatos alone knewthanatos who watched by day and night the slain reeds sigh fruitless and rootless on the empty airthanatos who by the cold sad patience of his gaze spoke saying i am the only pity of the world and even ito every mortal thing i come too early or too late the end transcribers note
