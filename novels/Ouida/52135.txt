dazu mich trieb gott war so gut ach war so lieb goethe towards the close of a summer's day in russia a travelling carriage was compelled to pause before a little village whilst a smith rudely mended its broken wheel the hamlet was composed of a few very poor dwellings grouped around a large low horse shoe shaped building which was the manorial mansion of the absent proprietor it was gloomy and dropping to decay its many windows were barred and shuttered the grass grew in its courts and flowering weeds had time to seed and root themselves on its whitewashed walls around it the level ground was at this season covered with green wheat spreading for leagues on leagues and billowing and undulating under the wind that blew from the steppes like the green sea which it resembled farther on were woods of larch and clumps of willow and in the distance across the great plain to the westward rolled a vast shining river here golden with choking sand here dun coloured with turbid waves here broken with islets and swamps of reeds where the singing swan and the pelican made their nests it was in one of those far off provinces through which the volga rolls its sand laden and yellow waves the scene was bleak and mournful though for many leagues the green corn spread and caught the timid sunshine and the shadow of the clouds there were a few stunted willows near the house and a few gashed pines a dried up lake was glittering with crystals of salt the domes and minarets of a little city rose above the sky line far away to the south east and farther yet northward towered the peaks of the ural mountains the wall of stone that divides siberia from the living world all was desolate melancholy isolated even though the season was early summer but the vastness of the view the majesty of the river the suggestion of the faint blue summits where the urals rose against the sky gave solemnity and a melancholy charm to a landscape that was otherwise monotonous and tedious prince paul ivanovitch zabaroff was in russia because he was on the point of marriage with a great heiress of the southern provinces and was travelling across from orenburg to the krimea where his betrothed bride awaited him in the summer palace of her fathers russia with the exception of petersburg was an unknown and detested place to him his errand was distasteful his journey tedious his temper irritated and when a wheel of his telegue came off in this miserable village of the northern volga district he was in no mood to brook with patience such an accident he paced to and fro restlessly as he looked round on the few and miserable cabins of a district that had been continually harried and fired through many centuries by kossack and tartar 'whose house is that' he said to his servant pointing to the great white building the servant humbly answered 'little father it is thine' 'mine' echoed paul zabaroff he was astonished then he laughed as he remembered that he had large properties around the city of kazn the whole soil was his own as far as his eyes could reach till the great river formed its boundary he did not even know his steward here the villagers did not know him he had been here once only a single night in the late autumn time long long before he was a man in whose life incidents followed each other too rapidly for remembrance to have any abiding place or regret any home in his mind he had immense estates north south east west his agents forwarded him the revenues of each or as much of the revenues as they chose him to enjoy when they themselves were satisfied with their gains when he was not in paris he was in petersburg and he was an impassioned and very daring gamester these great silent houses in the heart of fir woods in the centre of grass plains or on the banks of lonely rivers were all absolutely unknown to and indifferent to him he was too admired and popular at his court ever to have had the sentence passed upon him to retire to his estates but had he been forced to do so he would have been as utterly an exile in any one of the houses of his fathers as if he had been consigned to tobolsk itself he looked around him now an absolute stranger in the place where he was as absolutely lord all these square leagues he learned were his all these miserable huts all these poor lives for it was in a day before the liberation of the serfs had been accomplished by that deliverer whom russia rewarded with death a vague remembrance came over him as he gazed around he had been here once before the villagers learning that it was their master who had arrived thus unexpectedly in their midst came timidly around and made their humble prostrations the steward who administered the lands was absent that day in the distant town he was entreated to go within his own deserted dwelling but he refused the wheel was nearly mended and he reflected that a house abandoned for so long was probably damp and in disorder cold and comfortless he was impatient to be gone and urged the smith to his best and quickest by the promise of many roubles the moujiks excited and frightened hastened to him with the customary offerings of bread and salt he touched the gifts carelessly spoke to them with good humoured indifferent carelessness and asked if they had any grievances to complain of without listening to the answer they had many but they did not dare to say so knowing that their lord would be gone in five minutes but that the heavy hand of his steward would lie for ever upon them soon the vehicle was repaired and paul zabaroff ceased his restless walk to and fro the sandy road and prepared to depart from this weary place of detention but from an isba that stood apart beneath one of the banks of sand that broke the green level of the corn the dark spare figure of an old woman came waving bony hands upon the air and crying with loud voice to the barine to wait 'it is only mad maritza' said the people yet they thought maritza had some errand with their lord for they fell back and permitted her to approach him as she cried aloud 'let me come let me come i would give him back the jewel he left here ten years ago' she held a young boy by the hand and dragged him with her as she spoke and moved she was a dark woman once very handsome with white hair and an olive skin and a certain rugged grandeur in her carriage she was strong and of strong purpose she made her way to paul zabaroff as he stood by the carriage and she fell at his feet and touched the dust with her forehead and forced the child beside her to make the same obeisance 'all hail to my lord and heaven be with him the poor maritza comes to give him back what he left' prince zabaroff smiled in a kindly manner being a man often careless but not cruel 'nay good mother keep it whatever it be you have earned the right is it a jewel you say' 'it is a jewel' 'then keep it i had forgotten even that i was ever here' 'ay the great lord had forgot' she rose up with the dust on her white hair and thrust forward a young boy and put her hands on the boy's shoulders and made him kneel 'there is the jewel paul ivanovitch it is time the gospodar kept it now' paul zabaroff did not understand he looked down at the little serf kneeling in the dust 'a handsome child may the land have many such to serve the tsar is he your grandson good mother' the boy was beautiful with long curling fair hair and a rosy mouth and eyes like the blue heavens in a night of frost his limbs were naked and his chest he had a shirt of sheepskin old maritza kept her hands on the shoulders of the kneeling child 'he is thy son o lord' 'my son' 'ay the lord has forgotten the lord tarried but one night but he bade my sacha serve drink to him in his chamber and on the morrow when he left sacha wept the lord has forgotten' paul zabaroff stood silent slowly remembering in the boy's face looking up at him half sullenly half timidly he saw the features of his own race mingled with something much more beautiful oriental and superb yes he had forgotten quite forgotten but he remembered now the people stood around remembering better than he but thinking it no wrong in him to have forgotten because he was their ruler and lord and did that which seemed right to him and when he had gone away in sacha's bosom there had been a thick roll of gold 'where is the mother' he said at length old maritza made answer 'my sacha died four summers ago always sacha hoped that the lord might some day return' prince zabaroff's cheek reddened a little with pain 'fool why did you not marry her' he said with impatience 'there were plenty of men i would have given more dowry' 'sacha would not wed what the lord had honoured she thought holy' 'poor soul' muttered paul zabaroff and he looked again at the boy who bore his own face and was as like him as an eaglet to an eagle 'do you understand what we say' the boy answered sullenly 'i understand' 'what is your name' 'i am vassia' 'and what do you do' 'i do nothing' 'are you happy' 'what is that i do not know' prince zabaroff was silent 'rise up since you are my son' he said at length the boy rose he was sullen shy tameless timid like a young animal from the pine woods the old woman took her hands off his shoulders 'i have delivered the jewel to the lord that owns it i have done sacha's will' then she turned herself round and covered her face and went towards her home the child stood half fierce half fearful like a dog which an old master drives away and which fears the new one 'these jewels are as many as the sands of the sea and as worthless' said paul zabaroff with a slight smile nevertheless he resolved since maritza spoke truth that the boy should be cared for and well taught and have all that gold could get for him and be sent away out from russia for in russia he was a serf the boy's hair hung over his eyes which were hungrily watching the dark lean figure of the woman as it went away through the tall corn to the white wood hut that stood alone in the fields he dimly understood that his life was being changed for him but how he knew not he wanted to go home with maritza to his nest of moss where his bear cubs slept with him by night and played with him at dawn 'farewell' said paul zabaroff and he touched his son's cheek with his hand 'you are magnificently handsome my poor child indeed who knows what you will be a jewel or only a toad's eye' he said dreamily then he sprang up behind his horses and was borne away through the fast falling shades of the evening leaving behind him the boy vassia and a little rough mound of nameless grass which he had never seen and which was sacha's grave the four fiery horses that bore the telegue dashed away with it in the sunlight scattering the sand in yellow clouds and the village on the volga plains beheld its lord never more in life the boy stood still and looked after it with a sombre anger on his beautiful fair circassian face 'you will go and be a prince far away vassia' said the men to him with envy the child could not have expressed the vague mute wrath and shame that stirred together in him but he turned from them without a word and ran fleet as a roe in the path which maritza had taken he loved his great grandmother with a strong affection that was almost passion though it was silent and almost unconscious of itself she never checked him beat him or cursed him as the other women often did their children she did her best by him though they dwelt in a miserable little isba that often in winter time was covered up with the snow like a bear's hole and in summer the fierce brief parching summer of north east russia was as hot as a scorched eye under a sun glass life was barren and wretched to her but not to him he was loved and he was free childhood wants nothing more maritza was a persian woman years and years before when she had been in her youth she had come from the caspian shore where the land and the sea are alike alive with the leaping naphtha of the ghebir worship she had been born within the iron gates of derbent of persian parentage and she had known war and capture and violence and had had many troubles many privations many miseries before she had found herself stranded in her old age with her grandchild in this little desolate village on the sand bank by the volga she was very poor she had an evil reputation nothing evil was ever really traced to her but she had oriental faiths and traditions and worshipped fire or so said her enemies the black clergy of the scattered villages and their ready believers never did maritza light a lamp at nightfall but her neighbours saw in the act a devil worship she was silent proud fierce calm exceedingly poor she was hated accordingly when her granddaughter sacha bore a child that was the offspring of prince paul zabaroff though she cursed him the neighbours envied her and begrudged her such an honour maritza had brought up the young vassia with little tenderness yet with a great yearning over the boy with his pure persian face and his beautiful fair body like a pearl the uttermost she wished for him was that he should grow up a raftsman or a fisherman on the volga water all that she dreaded was that the kossacks would take him and put a lance in his hand and have him slain in war as in the old stern days of her youth her lovers had been taken by the battle god that devoured them one by one and her sons after them she never gave a thought to the boy's parentage as of possible use to him but she always said to herself 'if paul zabaroff ever come back then shall he know his son' and meanwhile the boy was happy though he had not known the meaning of the word he would plunge in the tawny volga in the summer time and watch the slow crowd of rafts go down it and the iron pontoon pass by closed like a bier which took the condemned prisoners to siberia now and then a gang of such captives would go by on foot and chained miserable exceedingly wounded exhausted doomed to twelve months' foot sore travel ere they reached the endless darkness of the mines or the blindness of the perpetual frost he watched them but that was all he felt neither curiosity nor pity as he lay on the tall rough grass and they moved by him on the dusty flint strewn ill made road towards that chain of blue hills which marked their future home and their eternal grave for sport the boy had the bear the wolf the blue fox the wild hare in the long wintertime in the brief summer he helped chase the pelican and the swan along the sand banks of the volga or upon its lime choked waves he was keen of eye and swift of foot the men of his native village were always willing to have his company child though he was he was fond of all beasts and birds though fonder still of sport once he risked his own life to save a stork and her nest on a burning roof when asked why he did it he who choked the cygnet and snared the cub he could not say he was ashamed of his own tenderness he wanted no other life than this rude freedom but one day a month or more after paul zabaroff had passed through the country there came to the door of maritza's hut a stranger who displayed to her eyes which could not read a letter with the prince's seal and signature he said 'i am sent to take away the boy who is called vassia' the persian woman bowed her head as before a headsman's glaive 'it is the will of god' she said but the time came when vassia grown to man's estate thought that devils rather than gods had meddled with him then 'send him to a great school send him out of russia spare no cost make him a gentleman' paul zabaroff had said to his agents when he had seen the son of sacha and he had been obeyed the little fierce half naked boy who in frost was wrapped in wolf fur and looked like a little wild beast had been taken from the free headstrong barbaric life of the volga plains where he was under no law and knew no rule and passionately loved the river and the chase and the great silent snow wrapt world of his birth and was sent to a famous and severe college near paris to the drill and the class and the uniform and the classic learning and the tape bound hard artificial routine of mechanical education the pride of the oriental and the subtlety of the slav were all he brought with him as arms in the unequal combat with an unsympathetic crowd for a year's time he was insulted tormented ridiculed in another twelve months he was let alone in a third year he was admired and feared all the while his heart was bursting within him with the agony of home sickness and revolt but he gave no sign of either only at nights when the others of his chamber were all sleeping he would slip out of bed and stare up at the stars which did not look the same as he had known and think of maritza and of the bear cubs and of the volga's waters bearing the wild white swans upon their breast and then he would sob his very soul out in silence he had been entered upon the books of the college under the name of vassia kazn kazn having been the place at which he had been baptised the golden domed many towered half asiatic city which was seen afar off from the little square window in maritza's hut high influence and much gold had persuaded the principal of a great college the lyce clovis situated between paris and versailles not to inquire too closely into the parentage of this beautiful little savage from the far north russia still remains dim distant and mysterious to the western mind among his tutors and comrades it was taken for granted that he was some young barbarian noble and the child's own lips were shut as close as if the ice of his own land had frozen them eight years later on another day when wheat was ripe and willows waved in summer sunshine a youth lay asleep with his head on an open lucretius in the deserted playground of a french college the place of recreation was a dusty gravelled square there were high stone walls all round it and a few poplars stood in it white with dust it was august and all the other scholars were away he alone had been forgotten he was used to being forgotten he was not dull or sorrowful as other lads are when left in vacation time alone he had many arts and pastimes and he was a scholar by choice if a capricious one and he had a quick and facile tact which taught him how to have his own way always and on many a summer night when his teachers believed him safe sleeping he was out of college and away dancing and singing and laughing at students' halls and in the haunts of artists and at the little theatre beyond the barrier and he had never been found out and would have cared but little if he had been and he slept now with his fair forehead leaning on lucretius and a drowsy heavy heat around him filled with the hum of flies and gnats he did not dream of the heat and the insects he did not even dream of the saucy beauty at the barrier ball the night before who had kicked cherries out of his mouth with her blue shod feet and kissed him on his curls he dreamt of a little low dark hut of an old woman that knelt before a brazen image of slumbering bear cubs in a nest of hay of a winter landscape white and shining that stretched away in an unbroken level of snow to the sea that half the year was ice he dreamed of these and dreaming sighed and woke he thought he stood on the frozen sea and the ice broke and the waters swallowed him it was nothing only the voice of his tutor calling him he was summoned to the principal of the lyce a rare honour he rose a slender tall beautiful youth in the dark close fitting costume of the institute he shook the dust off his uniform and his curls shut his book and went within the large white prison like building which had been his home since he had left the lowly isba among the sandhills and the blowing corn by volga the principal was sitting in one of his private chambers a grim dark book lined chamber he held an open letter in his hand which he had read and re read he was a clever man and unscrupulous and purchasable but he was not without feeling and he was disquieted for he had a painful office to fulfil when the youth obeyed his summons he looked up and shaded his eyes with his hand he hesitated looking curiously at the young man's attitude which had an easy grace in it and some hauteur visible under a semblance of respect the principal took up the open letter 'i regret i grieve to tell you' he said slowly 'your patron and friend the prince zabaroff has died suddenly' the face of vassia kazn grew very pale but very cold he said nothing 'he died quite suddenly' continued the director of the college 'a blood vessel broke in the brain after great fatigue in hunting he was upon one of his estates in white russia' the son of paul zabaroff was still silent his master wished that he would show some emotion 'it was he who placed you here was at all costs for your education i suppose you are aware of that' he continued with some embarrassment vassia kazn bowed and still said nothing he might have been made of ice or of marble for any sign that he gave he might only have heard that an unknown man had died in the street 'you were placed here by him at least by his agents you were the son of a dead friend they said i did not inquire closer payments were always made in advance' he passed his hand a little confusedly over his eyes for he felt a little shame his college was of high repute and the agents of prince zabaroff had placed sums in his hands to induce him to deviate from his rules larger than he would have cared to confess the boy was silent 'if he would only speak' thought his master 'he must know he must know' but the son of the dead zabaroff did not speak 'i am sorry to say' resumed his master still with hesitation 'i am very sorry to say that the death of the prince being thus sudden and thus unforeseen his agents write me that there are no instructions no arrangement no testament in short you will understand what i mean you will understand that in point of fact there is nothing for you there is no one to pay anything any longer' he paused abruptly the fair face of the boy grew a shade paler that was all he bore the shock without giving any sign 'is he made of ice and steel' thought the old man who had been proud of him as his most brilliant pupil 'it pains me to give you such terrible intelligence' he muttered 'but it is my duty not to conceal it an hour you are quite penniless it is very sad' the boy smiled slightly it was not a smile for so young a face 'he has given me learning he need not have done that' he said carelessly the words sounded grateful but it was not gratitude that glanced from his eyes 'i believe i am a serf in russia' he added after a short silence 'i do not know at all' muttered the principal who felt ill at ease and ashamed of himself for having taken for eight years the gold of prince paul 'i cannot tell lawyers would tell you i am not sure at all indeed i know nothing of your history but you are young and friendless you are a brilliant scholar but you are not fit for work what will you do my poor lad' the boy did not respond to the kindness that was in the tone and he resented the pity there was in it 'that will be my affair alone' he said still carelessly and very haughtily 'all is paid up to the new year' said his master feeling restless and dissatisfied 'there is no haste i would not turn you from my roof you are a brilliant classic you might be a teacher here perhaps' the youth smiled then he said coldly 'you are very good i had better go away at once i should wish to be away before the others return' 'but where will you go' said the old man staring at him with a dull and troubled surprise the boy shrugged his shoulders 'the world is large at least it looks so when one has not been over it can you tell me who inherits from prince paul zabaroff' 'his eldest son by his marriage with a princess kourouassine if he had only left some will some sort of command or direction perhaps if i wrote to the princess and told her the facts she ' 'pray do not do that' said the boy coldly 'i thank you for all i have learned here and i will leave your house to night farewell to you sir' the boy's eyes were dry and calm the old man's were wet and dim he rose hurriedly and laid aside his stern habit of authority for a moment as he put his hand on the lad's shoulder 'vassia do not leave us like that i do not like to see you so cold so quiet so unnaturally indifferent you are left friendless and nameless and after all he was your father' the boy drew himself away gently and shrugged his shoulders once more with his slight gesture of contempt 'he never called me his son i wish he had left me by the volga with the bear cubs that is all adieu sir' 'but what do you mean to do' 'i will do what offers' 'but few things offer when one is friendless and you have many faults vassia though you have many talents i fear for your future' 'adieu sir' the boy bowed low with composure and grace and left the room the old man sat in the shadow by his desk and blamed himself and blamed the dead the young collegian went out from his presence with a firm step and a careless carriage and ascended the staircase of the college to his dormitory the large long room with its whitewashed walls its barred casements its rows of camp bedsteads looked like a barrack room deserted by the soldiers the aspen and poplar leaves were quivering outside the grated windows the rays of the bright august sun streamed through and shone on the floor the boy sat down on his bed it was at the top of the row of beds next one of the casements the sun rays touched his head he was all alone the clamour the disputes the mirth the wrong doing with which he and his comrades had consoled themselves for the stern discipline of the day were all things of the past and he would know them no more in a way he had been happy here being lord and king of the rebellious band that had filled this chamber and knowing so little of his own fate or of his own future that any greatness or glory might be possible to him three years before he had been summoned to a chteau on the north coast of france in the full summer season it had entered into the capricious fancy of prince zabaroff that he should like to see what the wild young wolf cub of the volga plains had become he had found in him a youth so handsome so graceful so accomplished that a certain fibre of paternal pride had been touched in him whilst the coldness the silence and the disdainfulness of the boy's temper had commanded his respect no word of their relationship had passed between them but by the guests assembled there it had been assumed that the young vassia kazn was near of kin to their host whose lawfully begotten sons and daughters were far away in one of his summer palaces of the krimea the boy was beautiful keen witted precocious in knowledge and tact the society assembled there which was dissolute enough dazzled and indulged him the days had gone by like a tale of magic there had been always in him the bitter mortified rebellious hatred of his own position but this he had not shown and no one had suspected it these three summer months of unbridled luxury and indulgence had made an indelible impression on him he had felt that life was not worth the living unless it could be passed in the same manner he had known that away there in russia there were young zabaroff princes his brethren who would not have owned him but the remembrance of them had not dwelt on him he had not known definitely what to expect of the future though he was still there only vassia kazn yet he had been treated as though he were a son of the house when the party had broken up he had been sent back to his college with many gifts and a thousand francs in gold when he reached paris he had given the presents to a dancing girl and the money to an old professor of classics who had lost his sight not a word had been said as to his future measuring both by the indulgences and liberalities that were conceded to him he had always dreamed of it vaguely but gorgeously as sure to bring recognition and reverence pomp and power to him from the world he had vaguely built up ambitious hopes he had been sensible of no ordinary intelligence of no common powers and it had seemed legitimate to suppose that so liberal and princely an education meant that some golden gates would open to him at manhood why should they rear him so if they intended to leave him in obscurity this day as he had sat in the large white courtyard shadowed by the parisian poplar trees he had remembered that he was within a few weeks of the completion of his eighteenth year and he had wondered what they meant to do with him he had heard nothing from prince zabaroff since those brilliant vivid tumultuous months which had left on him a confused sense of dazzling though vague expectation he had hoped every summer to hear something but each summer had passed in silence and now he was told that paul zabaroff was dead he had been happy being dowered with facile talents quick wit and the great art of being able to charm others without effort to himself he had been seldom obedient often guilty yet always successful the place had been no prison to him he had passed careless days and he had dreamed grand dreams there and now he sat on the little iron bed and knew that in a few nights to come he might have to make his bed with beggars under bridge arches and in the dens of thieves tears gathered in his eyes and fell slowly one by one a sort of convulsion passed over his face he gripped his throat with his hand to stifle a sob that rose there the intense stillness of the chamber was not broken even by the buzzing of a gnat he sat quite motionless and his thoughts went back to the summer day in the cornfields by the volga he saw the scene in all its little details the impatient good humour of the great lord the awe of the listening peasants the blowing wheat the wooden cross the stamping horses the cringing servants he heard the voice of his father saying 'will you be a jewel or a toad's eye' 'why could he not leave me there' he thought 'i should have known nothing i should have been a hunter i should have done no harm on the ice and the snow there with old maritza' he thought of his grandmother of the little hut of the nest of skins of the young bears at play of the glittering plains in winter of the low red sun of the black lonely woods of the grey icy river of the bright virgin snow thought with a great longing like that of thirst why had they not let him be why had they not left him ignorant and harmless in the clear keen solitary winter world instead of that they had flung him into hell and now left him in it alone there was a far off murmur on the sultry summer air and a far off gleam of metal beyond the leaves of the poplar trees it was the murmur of the streets and the glisten of the roofs of paris about his neck there hung a little silver image of st paul his mother had hung it there at birth and maritza had prayed him never to disturb it now he took it off he spat on it he trod on it he threw it out to fall into the dust he did this insult to the sacred thing coldly without passion his tears were no more on his cheeks nor the sobs in his throat he changed his clothes quickly put together a few necessaries leaving behind nearly all that he possessed because he hated everything that the dead man's money had bought and then without noise and without haste looking back once down the long empty chamber he went through the house by back ways that he knew and had used in hours of forbidden liberty and opening the gate of the courtyard went out into the long dreary highway white with dust that stretched before him and led to paris he had made friends for he was a beautiful bold boy gay of wit agile and strong and of many talents but these friends were artists little known in the world soldiers who liked pleasure young dramatists without theatres pretty frail women who had taught him to eat the sweet and bitter apple that is always held out in the hand of eve these and their like were all butterfly friends of a summer noon or night he knew that very well for he had a premature and unerring knowledge of the value of human words they would be of no use in such a strait as his and the colour flushed back for one instant into his pale cheeks as he thought that he would die in a hospital before he was twenty rather than ask their aid as the grey dust the hot wind the nauseous smell of streets in summer smote upon him leaving the poplar shadowed court of his old school he felt once more the same strange yearning of home sickness for the winter world of his birth for the steel grey waters the darkened skies the forests of fir the howl of the wolves on the wind the joys of the fresh fierce cold the feel of the ice in the air the smell of the pines and the river the bonds of birth are strong 'if maritza were not dead i would go back' he thought but maritza had been long dead laid away under the snow by her daughter's side the boy went to paris would it be any fault of his what he became he told himself no it would lie with the dead and with paris chapter i in the heart of the hohe tauern province of lakes and streams there lies one lake called the szalrassee known to the pilgrim to the fisher to the hunter but to the traveller little for it is shut away from the hum and stir of man by the amphitheatre of its own hills and forests to the south east of it lies the iselthal and to the north west the wilde gerlos due east is the great glckner group and due west the venediger farther away are the alps of zillerthal and on the opposite horizon the mountains of karinthia here where the foaming rivers thunder through their rocky channels and the ice bastions of a thousand glaciers glow in the sunrise and bar the sight of sunset here where a thousand torrents bathe in silver the hillsides and the deep moan of subterranean waters sounds for ever through the silence of the gorges dark with the serried pines here in the green and cloudy austrian land the merry trout have many a joyous home but none is fairer or more beloved by them than this lovely lake of hohenszalras so green that it might have been made of emeralds dissolved in sunbeams so deep that at its centre no soundings can be taken so lonely that of the few wanderers who pass from s johann im wald or from lienz to matrey even of those few scarce one in a summer will know that a lake lies there though they see from afar off its great castle standing many turreted and pinnacled with its frowning keep backed by the vast black forests clothing slopes whose summits hide themselves in cloud whilst through the cold clear air the golden vulture and the throated eagle wing their way the lake lies like a crystal bedded in rock lovely and lonely as the little gosausee when the skies are fair perilous and terrible as the great knigs see in storm when the north wind is racing in from the bhmervald and the polish steppes and the rain mists are dark and dense and the storks leave their home on the chapel roof because the winter draws nigh it is fed by snow and ice descending from a hundred hills and by underground streams and headlong descending avalanches and in its turn feeds many a mountain waterfall many a mountain tarn many a woodland brook and many a village fountain the great white summits tower above it and the dense still woods enshroud it there are a pier and harbour at either end but these are only used by the village people and once a year by pilgrims who come to the sacred island in its midst pilgrims who flock thither from north south east and west for the chapel of the szalrassee is as renowned and blessed as the silver shrine of holy mariazell itself on the right bank of its green glancing water looking towards the ice peaks of the glckner on the east and on the south towards the kitchbull mountains and the limestone alps a promontory juts out into the lake and soars many hundred feet above it it is of hard granite rock down one of its sides courses a torrent the other side is clothed with wood on the summit is the immense building that is called the hohenszalrasburg a mass of towers and spires and high metal roofs and frowning battlements with a huge square fortress at one end of them it is the old castle of the counts of szalras and the huge donjon keep of it has been there twelve centuries and in all these centuries no man has ever seen its flag furled or its portcullis drawn up for a conqueror's entry the greater part of the schloss now existing is the work of meister wenzel of klosterneuburg begun in but the date of the keep and of the foundations generally are much earlier and the prisons and clock tower are romanesque majestic magnificent and sombre though not gloomy by reason of its rude decoration and the brilliant colours of its variegated roofs it is scarcely changed since its lords dwelt there in the fourteenth century when their great banner black vultures on a ground of gold and red floated then high up amongst the clouds even as it now shakes its heavy folds out on the strong wind that blew so keenly from the prussian and the polish plains due north it is a fortress that has wedded a palace it is majestic powerful imposing splendid like the great race of which it so long has been the stronghold and the birthplace but it is as lonely in the quiet heart of the everlasting hills as any falcon's or heron's nest hung in the oak branches and this loneliness seemed its sweetest charm in the eyes of its chtelaine and mistress the countess wanda von szalras as she leaned one evening over the balustrade of her terrace watching for the after glow to warm the snows of the glckner she held in her hand an open letter from her kaiserin and the letter in its conclusion said 'you have sorrowed and tarried in seclusion long enough too long longer than he would have wished you to do come back to us and to the world' and wanda von szalras thought to herself 'what can the world give me what i love is hohenszalras on earth and bela in heaven' what could the world give her indeed the world cannot give back the dead she wanted nothing of the world she was rich in all that it can ever give in the time of ferdinand the second those who were then counts of szalras had stitched the cloth cross on their sleeves and gone with the emperor to the third crusade in gratitude for their escape father and son from the perils of palestine and the dangers of the high seas and of the treacherous danube water from moslem steel and fever of jaffa and chains of swarming barbary corsairs they returning at last in safety to their eyrie above the szalrassee had raised a chapel on the island in the lake and made it dedicate to the holy cross a szalras of the following generation belonging to the dominican community and being a man of such saintly fervour and purity that he was canonised by innocent had dwelt on the holy isle and given to it the benediction and the tradition of his sanctity and good works as centuries went on the holy fame of the shrine where the crusader had placed a branch from a thorn tree of nazareth grew and gained in legend and in miracle and became as adored an object of pilgrimage as the holy phial of heiligenblut all the hohe tauern and throngs even from karinthia on the one side and tirol on the other came thither on the day of ascension the old faith still lives very simple warm and earnest in the heart of austria and with that day dawn in midsummer thousands of peasant folks flock from mountain villages and forest chalets and little remote secluded towns to speed over the green lake with flaming crucifix and floating banner and haunted anthem echoed from hill to hill one of those days of pilgrimage had made her mistress of hohenszalras it was a martial and mighty race this which in the heart of the green tauern had made of fealty to god and the emperor a religion for itself and all its dependants the counts of szalras had always been proud stern and noble men though their records were often stained with fierce crimes there was never in them any single soil of baseness treachery or fear they had been fierce and reckless in the wild days when they were for ever at war with the counts of tirol and the warlike archbishops of salzburg then with the renaissance they had become no less powerful but more lettered more courtly and more splendid and had given alike friendship and service to the habsburg now of all these princely and most powerful people there was but one descendant but one representative and that one was a woman solferino had seen count gela fall charging at the head of his own regiment of horse magenta had seen count victor cut in two by a cannon shot as he rode with the dragoons of swartzenberg and but a few years later the youngest count bela had been drowned by his own bright lake their father had died of grief for his eldest son their mother had been lost to them in infancy bela and wanda had grown up together loving each other as only two lonely children can she had been his elder by a few years and he younger than his age by reason of his innocent simplicity of nature and his delicacy of body they had always thought to make a priest of him and when that peaceful future was denied him on his becoming the sole heir it was the cause of bitter though mute sorrow to the boy who was indeed so like a young saint in church legends that the people called him tenderly der heilige graf he had never quitted hohenszalras and he knew every peasant around every blossom that blew every mountain path every forest beast and bird and every tale of human sorrow in his principality when he became lord of all after his brother's death he was saddened and oppressed by the sense of his own overwhelming obligations 'i am but the steward of god' he would say with a tender smile to the poor who blessed him one ascension day the lake was as usual crowded with the boats of pilgrims the morning was fair and cloudless but after noontide wind arose the skies became overcast and one of the sudden storms of the country burst over the green waters the little lord of hohenszalras was the first to see the danger to the clumsy heavy boats crowded with country people and with his household rowed out to their aid the storm had come so suddenly and with such violence that it smote in the very middle of the lake some score of these boats laden with the pilgrims of the pinzgau and the innthal women chiefly their screams pierced through the noise of the roaring winds and their terror added fresh peril to the dangers of the lake which changed in a few moments to a seething whirlpool and flung them to and fro like coots' nests in a flood the young bela with his servants saved many crossing and recrossing the furious space of wind lashed leaping foaming water but on the fourth voyage back the young count's boat over burdened with trembling peasants whose fright made them blind and restive dipped heavily on one side filled and sank bela could swim well and did swim even to the very foot of his own castle rock where a hundred hands were outstretched to save him but hearing a drowning woman's moan he turned and tried to reach her a fresh surge of the hissing water a fresh gust of the bitter north wind tossed him back into a yawning gulf of blackness and drove him headlong and with no more resistance in him than if he had been a broken bough upon the granite wall of his own rocks he was caught and rescued almost on the instant by his own men but his head had struck upon the stone and he was senseless he breathed a few hours but he never spoke or opened his eyes or gave any sign of conscious life and before the night had far advanced his innocent body was tenantless and cold and his sweet spirit lived only in men's memories his sister who was absent at that time at the court of her empress became by his death the mistress of hohenszalras and the last of her line when the tidings of his heroic end reached her at the imperial hunting place of gdll all the world died for her that splendid pageant of a world whose fairest and richest favours had been always showered on the daughter of the mighty house of szalras she withdrew herself from her friends from her lovers from her mistress and mourned for him with a grief that time could do little to assuage nothing to efface she was then twenty years of age she was thinking of that death now four years later as she stood on the terrace which overhung the cruel rocks that had killed him his loss was to her a sorrow that could never wholly pass away her other brothers had been dear to her but only as brilliant young soldiers are to a little child who sees them seldom but bela had been her companion her playmate her friend her darling from bela she had been scarce ever parted every day and every night herself and all her thoughts and all her time were given to such administration of her kingdom as should best be meet in the sight of god and his angels 'i am but bela's almoner as he was god's steward' she said she leaned against the parapet and looked across the green and shining water the open letter hanging in her hand the countess wanda von szalras was a beautiful woman but she had that supreme distinction which eclipses beauty that subtle indescribable grace and dignity which are never seen apart from some great lineage with long traditions of culture courtesy and courage she was very tall and her movements had a great repose and harmony in them her figure richness and symmetry her eyes were of a deep brown hue like the velvety brown of a stag's throat they were large calm proud and meditative her mouth was very beautiful her hair was light and golden her skin exceedingly fair she was one of the most beautiful women of her country and one of the most courted and the most flattered and her imperial mistress said now to her 'come back to us and to the world' standing upon her terrace in a gown of pale grey velvet that had no ornament save an old gold girdle with an enamelled missal hung to it with two dogs at her side one the black hunting hound of st hubert the other the white sleuth hound of russia she looked like a chtelaine of the days of mary of burgundy or elizabeth of thuringia it seemed as if the dark cedar boughs behind her should lift and admit to her presence some lover with her glove against the plume of his hat and her ring set in his sword hilt who would bow down before her feet and not dare to touch her hand unbidden but no lover was there the countess wanda dismissed all lovers she was wedded to the memory of her brother and to her own liberty and power she leaned on the stone parapet of her castle and gazed on the scene that her eyes had rested on since they had first seen the light yet of which she never wearied the intense depth of colour that is the glory of austria was deepening with each moment that the sun went nearer to its setting in the dark blue of thunderclouds that brooded in the west over the venediger and the zillerthal alps soon the sun would pass that barrier of stone and ice and evening would fall here in the mountains of the iselthal whilst it would be still day for the plains of the ober pinzgau and salzkammergut but as yet the radiance was here and the dark oak woods and birch woods the purple pine forests the blue lake waters and the glaciers of the glckner range had all that grandeur which makes a sunset in these highlands at once so splendid and so peaceful there is an infinite sense of peace in those cool vast unworn mountain solitudes with the rain mists sweeping like spectral armies over the level lands below and the sun rays slanting heavenward like the spears of an angelic host there is such abundance of rushing water of deep grass of endless shade of forest trees of heather and pine of torrent and tarn and beyond these are the great peaks that loom through breaking clouds and the clear cold air in which the vulture wheels and the heron sails and the shadows are so deep and the stillness is so sweet and the earth seems so green and fresh and silent and strong nowhere else can one rest so well nowhere else is there so fit a refuge for all the faiths and fancies that can find a home no longer in the harsh and hurrying world there is room for them all in the austrian forests from the erl king to ariel and oberon the countess wanda leaned against the balustrade of the terrace and watched that banquet of colour on land and cloud and water watched till the sun sank out of sight behind the venediger snows and the domes of the glckner and all the lesser peaks opposite were changing from the warmth as of a summer rose to a pure transparent grey that seemed here and there to be pierced as with fire 'how often do we thank god for the mountains' she thought 'yet we ought every night that we pray' then she sighed as her eyes sank from the hill tops to the lake water dark as iron glittering as steel now that the radiance of the sun had passed off it she remembered bela how could she ever forget him with that murderous water shining for ever at her feet the world called her undiminished tenderness for her dead brother a morbid grief but then to the world at large any fidelity seems so strange and stupid a waste of years it does not understand that tout casse tout lasse tout passe was not written for strong natures 'how could i ever forget him so long as that water glides there' she thought as her eyes rested on the emerald and sparkling lake 'yet her majesty is so right so right and so wise' said a familiar voice at her side and there came up to her the loveliest little lady in all the empire an old lady but so delicate so charming so pretty so fragile that she seemed lovelier than all the young ones a very fairy godmother covered up in lace and fur and leaning on a gold headed cane and wearing red shoes with high gilt heels and smiling with serene blue eyes as though she had just stepped down out of a pictured copy of cinderella and could change common pumpkins into gilded chariots and mice into horses at a wish she was the princess ottilie of lilienhhe and had once been head of a religious house 'her majesty is so right' she said once more with emphasis the countess wanda turned and smiled rather with her eyes than with her lips 'it would not become my loyal affection to say she could be wrong but still i know myself and i know the world very well and i far prefer hohenszalras to it' 'hohenszalras is all very well in the summer and autumn' said princess ottilie with a glance of anything but love at the great fantastic solemn pile 'but for a woman of your age and your possessions to pass your days talking to farmers and fishermen poring over books perplexing yourself as to whether it is right for you to accept wealth that comes from such a source of danger to human life as your salt mines it is absurd it is ludicrous you are made for something more than a political economist you should be in the great world' 'i prefer my solitude and my liberty' 'liberty who or what could dictate to you in the world you reigned there once you would always reign there' 'social life is a bondage as an empress's is it denies one the greatest luxury of life solitude' 'certainly if you love solitude so much you have your heart's desire here it is an alvernia it is a mount athos it is a snow entombed paraclete a hermitage only tempered by horses' said the princess with a little angry laugh her grand niece smiled 'by many horses certainly dearest aunt what would you have austrians are all centaurs and amazons i am only like my kaiserin in that passion' the princess sighed she had never been able to comprehend the forest life the daring the intrepidity the open air pastimes and the delight in danger which characterised all the race of szalras daughter of a north german princeling and with some french blood in her veins also reared under the formal etiquette of her hereditary court and at an early age canoness of one of those great semi religious orders which are only open to the offspring of royal or of most noble lines her whole life had been one moulded to form and conventional habit and only her own sweetness and sprightliness of temper had saved her from the narrowness of judgment and the chilliness of formality which such a life begets the order of which until late years she had been superior was one for magnificence and wealth unsurpassed in europe but semi secular in its privileges it had left her much liberty and never wholly divorced her from the world which in an innocent way she had always loved and enjoyed after count victor's death she had resigned her office on plea of age and delicacy of health and had come to take up her residence at hohenszalras with her dead niece's children she had done so because she had believed it to be her duty and her attachment to wanda and bela had always been very great but she had never learned to love the solitude of the hohe tauern or ceased to regard hohenszalras as a place of martyrdom after the minute divisions of every hour and observances of every smallest ceremonial that she had been used to at her father's own little court of lilienslst and in her own religious house where every member of the order was a daughter of some one of the highest families of germany or of austria the life at hohenszalras with its outdoor pastimes its feudal habits its vast liberties for man and beast and its long frozen winters when not a soul could come near it from over the passes seemed very terrible to her she could never understand her niece's passionate attachment to it and she in real truth only breathed entirely at ease in those few weeks of the year which to please her niece she consented to pass away from the hohe tauern 'surely you will go to ischl or go to gdll this autumn since her majesty wishes it' she said now with an approving glance at the imperial letter 'her majesty is so kind as always to wish it' answered the countess wanda 'let us leave time to show what it holds for us this is scarcely summer yesterday was the fifteenth of may' 'it is horribly cold' said the princess drawing her silver grey fur about her 'it is always horribly cold here even in midsummer and when it does not snow it rains you cannot deny that' 'come come we have seen the sun all day to day i hope we shall see it many days for they have begun planting out you see the garden will soon be gorgeous' 'when the mist allows it to be seen it will be i dare say' said princess ottilie somewhat pettishly 'it is tolerable here in the summer though never agreeable but the empress is so right it is absurd to shut yourself longer up in this gloomy place you are bound to return to the world you owe it to your position to be seen in it once more' 'the world does not want me my dear aunt nor do i want the world' 'that is sheer perversity ' 'how am i perverse i know the world very well and i know that no one is necessary to it unless it be herr von bismarck' 'i do not see what herr von bismarck has to do with your going back to your natural manner of life' said the princess severely who abhorred any sort of levity in regard to the mighty minister who had destroyed the lilienhhe princes one fine morning as indifferently as a boy plucks down a cranberry bough 'in summer or even autumn hohenszalras is endurable but in winter it is hyperborean even you must grant that one might as well be jammed in a ship amidst icebergs in the midst of a frozen sea' 'and you were born on the elbe oh fie but indeed my dearest aunt i like the frozen sea the white months have no terrors for me what you call and what calls itself the great world is far more narrow than the iselthal here one's fancies at least can fly high as the eagles do in the world who can rise out of the hot house air of the salons and see beyond the doings of one's friends and foes' 'surely one's own friends and foes people like oneself in a word must be as interesting as hans and peter and katte and grethel with their crampons or their milkpails' said the princess with impatience 'besides surely in the world there are political movement influence interests' 'oh intrigue as useful as mme de laballe's or mme de longueville's no i do not believe there is even that in our time when even diplomacy itself is fast becoming a mere automatic factor in a world that is governed by newspapers and which has changed the tyranny of wits for the tyranny of crowds the time is gone by when a coterie of countesses could change ministries if they ever did do so outside the novels of disraeli drawing room cabals may still do some mischief perhaps but they can do no good sometimes indeed i think that what is called government everywhere is nothing but a gigantic mischief making and place seeking the state is everywhere too like a mother who sweeps her doorstep diligently and scolds the neighbours while her child scalds itself to death unseen within' 'in the world' interrupted the princess oppositely 'you might persuade them that the sweeping of doorsteps is not sufficient ' 'i prefer to keep my own house in order it is quite enough occupation' said the countess wanda with a smile 'dear aunt here amongst my own folks i can do some real good i have some tangible influence i can feel that my life is not altogether spent in vain why should i exchange these simple and solid satisfactions for the frivolities and the inanities of a life of pleasure which would not even please me' 'you are very hard to please i know' retorted the princess 'but say what you will it becomes ridiculous for a person of your age your great position and your personal beauty to immure yourself eternally in what is virtually no better than confinement to a fortress' 'a court is more of a prison to me' said wanda von szalras 'i know both lives and i prefer this life as for my being very hard to please i think i was very gay and mirthful before bela's death since then all the earth has grown grey for me' 'forgive me my beloved' said princess ottilie with quick contrition whilst moisture sprang into her limpid and still luminous blue eyes wanda von szalras took the old abbess's hand in her own and kissed it 'i understand all you wish for me dear aunt believe me i envy people when i hear them laughing light heartedly amongst each other i think i shall never laugh so again' 'if you would only marry ' said the princess with some hesitation 'you think marriage amusing' she said with a certain contempt 'if you do it is only because you escaped it' 'amusing' said the princess a little scandalised 'i could speak of no sacrament of our holy church as amusing you rarely display such levity of language i confess i do not comprehend you marriage would give you interests in life which you seem to lack sadly now it would restore you to the world it would be a natural step to take with such vast possessions as yours' 'it is not likely i shall ever take it' said wanda von szalras drawing the soft fine ear of donau through her fingers 'i know it is not likely i am very sorry that it is not likely yet what nobler creature does god's earth contain than your cousin egon 'egon no he is a good and brave and loyal gentleman none better but i shall no more marry him than donau here will wed a forest doe' 'yet he has loved you for ten years but if not he there are so many others men of high enough place to be above all suspicion of mercenary motive no woman has been more adored than you wanda look at hugo landrassy' 'oh pray spare me their enumeration it is like the catalogue of ships' said the countess wanda with some coldness and some impatience on her face at that moment an old man who was major domo of hohenszalras approached and begged with deference to know whether his ladies would be pleased to dine the princess signified her readiness with alacrity wanda von szalras signed assent with less willingness 'what a disagreeable obligation dining is' she said as she turned reluctantly from the evening scene with the lake sleeping in dusk and shadow while the snow summits still shone like silver and glowed with rose 'it is very wicked to think so' said her great aunt 'when a merciful creator has appointed our appetites for our consolation and support it is only an ingrate who is not thankful lawfully to indulge them' 'that view of them never occurred to me' said the chtelaine of hohenszalras 'i think you must have stolen it aunt from some abb galant or some chanoinesse as lovely as yourself in the last century alas if not to care to eat be ungrateful i am a sad ingrate donau and neva are more ready subscribers to your creed' donau and neva were already racing towards the castle and wanda von szalras with one backward lingering glance to the sunset which already was fading followed them with slow steps to the grand house of which she was mistress in the north alone the sky was overcast and of a tawny colour where the pinzgau lay with the green salzach water rushing through its wooded gorges and its tracks of sand and stone desolate as any desert that slender space of angry yellow to the north boded ill for the night bitter storms rolled in west from the bhmerwald or north from the salzkammergut many a time in the summer weather changing it to winter as they passed tugging at the roof ropes of the chlets driving the sheep into their sennerin's huts covering with mist and rain the mountain sides and echoing in thunder from the peaks of the untersburg to the snows of the ortler spitze it was such a sudden storm which had taken bela's life 'i think we shall have wild weather' said the princess drawing her furs around her as she walked down the broad length of the stone terrace 'i think so too' said wanda 'it is coming very soon and i fear i did a cruel thing this morning' 'what was that' 'i sent a stranger to find his way over our hills to matrey as best he might he will hardly have reached it by now and if a storm should come ' 'a stranger' said princess ottilie whose curiosity was always alive and had also lately no food for its hunger 'only a poacher but he was a gentleman which made his crime the worse' 'a gentleman and you sent him over the hills without a guide it seems unlike the hospitality of hohenszalras' 'why he would have shot a kuttengeier' 'a kuttengeier is a horrible beast' said the princess with a shudder 'and a stranger just for an hour or so would be welcome' 'even if his name were not in the hof kalender' asked her niece smiling 'if he had been a pedlar or a clockmaker you would have sent him in to rest for a gentlewoman wanda and so proud a one as you are you become curiously cruel to your own class' 'i am always cruel to poachers and to shoot a vulture in the month of may' chapter ii the dining hall was a vast chamber panelled and ceiled with oak in the centre of the panels were emblazoned shields bearing the arms of the szalras and of the families with which they had intermarried the long lancet windows had been painted by no less a hand than that of jacob of ulm the knights' stalls which ran round the hall were the elaborate carving of georges syrlin and old gorgeous banners dropped down above them heavy with broideries and bullion there were upper servants in black clothes with knee breeches and a dozen lacqueys in crimson and gold liveries ranged about the table in many ways there were a carelessness and ease in the household which always seemed lamentable to the princess ottilie but in matters of etiquette the great household was ruled like a small court and when sovereigns became guests there little in the order of the day needed change at hohenszalras the castle was half fortress half palace a noble and solemn place which had seen many centuries of warfare of splendour and of alternate war and joy strangers used to paris gilding to italian sunlight to english country houses found it too severe too august too dark and too stern in its majesty and were awed by it but she who had loved it and played in it in infancy changed nothing there but cherished it as it had come to her and it was in all much the same as it had been in the days of henry the lion from its gothic silber kapelle that was like an ivory and jewelled casket set in dusky silver to its immense rittersal with a hundred knights in full armour standing down it as the bronze figures stand round maximilian's empty tomb in tirol there are many such noble places hidden away in the deep forests and the mountain glens of maximilian's empire in this hall there were some fifteen persons standing they were the priest the doctor the high steward the almoner some dames de compagnie and some poor ladies widows or spinsters who subsisted on the charities of hohenszalras the two noble ladies bowed to them all and said a few kind words then passed on and seated themselves at their own table whilst these other persons took their seats noiselessly at a longer table behind a low screen of carved oak the lords of hohenszalras had always thus adhered to the old feudal habit of dining in public and in royal fashion thus the countess wanda and her aunt spoke little the one was thinking of many other things than of the food brought to her the other was enjoying to the uttermost each bouche each releve each morsel of quail each mouthful of wine stewed trout each succulent truffle and each rich drop of crown toka the repast was long and to one of them extremely tedious but these formal and prolonged ceremonials had been the habit of her house and wanda von szalras carefully observed all hereditary usage and custom when her aunt had eaten her last fruit and she herself had broken her last biscuit between the dogs they rose one glad that the most tiresome and the other regretful that the most pleasant hour of the uneventful day was over with a bow of farewell to the standing household they went by mutual consent their divers ways the princess to her favourite blue room and her after dinner doze wanda to her own study the chamber most essentially her own where all were hers the softness and radiance of the after glow had given place to night and rain the mists and the clouds had rolled up from the zillerthal alps and the water was pouring from the skies lamps wax candles flambeaux burning in sconces or upheld by statues or swinging from chains were illumining the darkness of the great castle but in her own study only one little light was shining for she a daughter of the mystical mountains and forests loved the shadows of the night she seated herself here by the unshuttered casement the full moon was rising above the glckner range and the rain clouds as yet did not obscure it though a film of falling water veiled all the westward shore of the lake and all the snows on the peaks and crests of the venediger she leaned her elbows on the cushioned seat and looked out into the night 'bela my bela are you content with me' she murmured to her bela was as living as though he were present by her side she lived in the constant belief of his companionship and his sight death was a cruel ah how cruel wall built up between him and her forbidding them the touch of each other's hands denying them the smile of each other's eyes but none the less to her was he there unseen but ever near hidden behind that inexorable invisible barrier which one day would fall and let her pass and join him she sat idle in the embrasure of the oriel window whilst the one lamp burned behind her this her favourite room had scarcely been changed since maria theresa on a visit there had made it her bower room the window panes had been painted by selier of landshut in the stove was one of hirschvgel's the wood carvings had been done by schuferstein there was silver repouss work of kellerthaler tapestries of marc de comans enamels of elbertus of kln of jean of limoges of leonard limousin of penicaudius embroidered stuffs of isabeau maire damascened armour once worn by henry the lion a painted spinet that had belonged to isabella of bavaria and an ivory book of hours once used by carolus magnus and all these things like the many other treasures of the castle had been there for centuries gifts from royal guests spoils of foreign conquest memorials of splendid embassies or offices of state held by the lords of szalras or marriage presents at magnificent nuptials in the old magnificent ages in this room she their sole living representative was never disturbed on any pretext in the adjacent library a great cedar lined room holding half a million volumes with many missals and early classics and many an editio princeps of the renaissance she held all her audiences heard all petitions or complaints audited her accounts conversed with her tenants or her stewards her lawyers or her peasants and laboured earnestly to use to the best of her intelligence the power bequeathed to her 'i am but god's and bela's steward as my steward is mine' she said always to herself and never avoided any duty or labour entailed on her never allowed weariness or self indulgence to enervate her qui facit per alium facit per se had been early taught to her and she never forgot it she never did anything vicariously which concerned those dependent upon her and she was an absolute sovereign in this her kingdom of glaciers and forests her frozen sea as she had called it she never avoided a duty merely because it was troublesome and she never gave her signature without knowing why and wherefore it is easy to be generous to be just is more difficult and burdensome generous by temper she strove earnestly to be always just as well and her life was not without those fatigues which a very great fortune brings with it to anyone who regards it as a sacred trust she had wide possessions and almost incalculable wealth she had salt mines in galicia she had vosluer vineyards in the salzkammergut she had vast plains of wheat and leagues on leagues of green lands where broods of horses bred and reared away in the steppes of hungary she had a palace in the herrengasse at vienna another in the residenzplatz of salzburg she had forests and farms in the innthal and the zillerthal she had a beautiful little schloss on the green ebensee which had been the dower house of the countesses of szalras and she had pine woods quarries vineyards and even a whole riverain town on the danube with a right to take toll on the ferry there which had been given to her forefathers as far back as the days of mathias carvin a right that she herself had let drop into desuetude 'i do not want the poor folks' copper kreutzer' she said to her lawyers when they remonstrated what did please her was the fact coupled with this right that even the kaiser could not have entered her little town without his marshal thrice knocking at the gates and receiving from the warder the permission to pass in the words 'the counts of idrac bid you come in peace' all these things and places made a vast source of revenue and the property whose title deeds and archives lay in many a chest and coffer in the old city of salzburg was one of the largest in europe it would have given large portions and dowries to a score of sons and daughters and been none the worse and it was all accumulating on the single head of one young and lonely woman she was the last of her race there were distant collateral branches but none of them near enough to have any title to hohenszalras she could bequeath it where she would and she had already willed it to her kaiserin in a document shut up in an iron chest in the city of salzburg she thought the crown would be a surer and juster guardian of her place and people than any one person whose caprices she could not foretell whose extravagance or whose injustice she could not foresee sometimes even to the spiritual mind of the princess ottilie the persistent refusal of her niece to think of any marriage seemed almost a crime against mankind what did the crown want with it the princess was a woman of absolutely loyal sentiment towards all ancient sovereignties she believed in divine right and was as strong a royalist as it is possible for anyone to be whose fathers have been devoured like an anchovy by m de bismarck and who has the sympathy of fellow feeling with frohsdorf and gmnden but even her devotion to the rights of monarchs failed to induce her to see why the habsburg should inherit hohenszalras the crown is a noble heir but it is one which leaves the heart cold who would ever care for her people and her forests and her animals as she had done even from her beloved kaiserin she could not hope for that 'if i had married' she thought the words of the princess ottilie coming back upon her memory perhaps for the sake of her people and her lands it might have been better but there are women to whom the thought of physical surrender of themselves is fraught with repugnance and disgust a sentiment so strong that only a great passion vanquishes it she was one of these women and passion she had never felt 'even for hohenszalras i could not' she thought as she leaned on the embrasure cushions and watched the moon gradually covered with the heavy blue black clouds the crown should be her heir and reign here after her when she should be laid by the side of bela in that beautiful dusky chapel beneath the shrines of ivory and silver where all the dead of the house of szalras slept but it was an heir which left her heart cold she rose abruptly left the embrasure and began to examine the letters of the day and put down heads of replies to them which her secretary could amplify on the morrow one letter her secretary could not answer for her it was a letter which gave her pain and which she read with an impatient sigh it urged her return to the world as the letter of her empress had done and it urged with timidity yet with passion a love that had been loyal to her from her childhood it was signed 'egon vsrhely' 'it is the old story' she thought 'poor egon if only one could have loved him how it would have simplified everything and i do love him as i once loved gela and victor' but that was not the love which egon vsrhely pleaded for with the tenderness of one who had been to her as a brother from her babyhood and the frankness of a man who knew his own rank so high and his own fortunes so great that no mercenary motive could be attributed to him even when he sought the mistress of hohenszalras it was the old story she had heard it many times from him and from others in those brilliant winters in vienna which had preceded bela's death and it had always failed to touch her women who have never loved are harsh to love from ignorance at that moment a louder crash of thunder reverberated from hill to hill and the glckner domes seemed to shout to the crests of the venediger 'i hope that stranger is housed and safe' she thought her mind reverting to the poacher of whom she had spoken on the terrace at sunset his face came before her memory a beautiful face oriental in feature northern in complexion fair and cold with blue eyes of singular brilliancy the forests of hohenszalras are in themselves a principality under enormous trees innumerable brooks and little torrents dash downwards to lose themselves in the green twilight of deep gorges broad dark still lakes lie like cups of jade in the bosom of the woods up above where the alpine firs and the pinus cembra shelter him the bear lives and the wolf too and higher yet where the glacier lies upon the mountain side the merry steinbock leaps from peak to peak and the white throat vulture and the golden eagle nest the oak the larch the beech the lime cover the lower hills higher grow the pines and firs the lovely drooping siberian pine foremost amidst them in the lower wood grassy roads cross and thread the leafy twilight a stranger had been traversing these woods that morning where he had no right or reason to be forest law was sincerely observed and meted out at hohenszalras but of that he was ignorant or careless before him in the clear air a large dark object rose and spread huge pinions to the wind and soared aloft the trespasser lifted his rifle to his shoulder and in another moment would have fired but an alpenstock struck the barrel up into the air and the shot went off harmless towards the clouds the great bird startled by the report flew rapidly to the westward the countess wanda said quietly to the poacher in her forest 'you cannot carry arms here' he looked at her angrily and in surprise 'you have lost me the only eagle i have seen for years' he said bitterly with a flush of discomfiture and powerless rage on his fair face she smiled a little 'that bird was not an eagle sir it was a white throated vulture a kuttengeier but had it been an eagle or a sparrow you could not have killed it on my lands' pale still with anger he uncovered his head 'i have not the honour to know in whose presence i stand' he muttered sullenly 'but i have imperial permission to shoot wherever i choose' 'his majesty has no more loyal subject than myself' she answered him 'but his dominion does not extend over my forests you are on the ground of hohenszalras and your offence ' 'i know nothing of hohenszalras' he interrupted with impatience she blew a whistle and her head forester with three jgers sprang up as if out of the earth some great wolf hounds grinning with their fangs waiting but a word to spring in one second the rangers had thrown themselves on the too audacious trespasser had pinioned him and had taken his rifle confounded disarmed humiliated and stunned by the suddenness of the attack he stood mute and very pale 'you know hohenszalras now' said the mistress of it with a smile as she watched his seizure seated on a moss grown boulder of granite black donau and white neva by her side he was pale with impotent fury conscious of an indefensible and absurd position the jger looked at their mistress they had slipped a cord over his wrists and tied them behind his back they looked to her for a sign of assent to break his rifle she stood silent amused with her victory and his chastisement a little derision shining in her lustrous eyes 'you know hohenszalras now' she said once more 'men have been shot dead for what you were doing if you be indeed a friend of my emperor's of course you are welcome here but ' 'what right have you to offer me this indignity' muttered the offender his fair features changing from white to red and red to white in his humiliation and discomfiture 'right' echoed the mistress of the forests 'i have the right to do anything i please with you you seem to me to understand but little of forest laws' 'madame were you not a woman you would have had bloodshed' 'oh very likely that sometimes happens although seldom as all the hohe tauern knows how strictly these forests are preserved my men are looking to me for permission to break your rifle that is the law sir' 'since 'forty eight' said the trespasser with what seemed to her marvellous insolence 'all the old forest laws are null and void it is scarcely allowable to talk of trespass' a look of deep anger passed over her face 'the follies of 'forty eight have nothing to do with hohenszalras' she said very coldly 'we hold under charters of our own by grants and rights which even rudolf of habsburg never dared meddle with i am not called on to explain this to you but you appear to labour under such strange delusions that it is as well to dispel them' he stood silent his eyes cast downward his humiliation seemed to him enormously disproportioned to his offending the hounds menaced him with deep growls and grinning fangs the jgers held his gun his wrists were tied behind him 'are you indeed a friend of the kaiser' she repeated to him 'i am no friend of his' he answered bitterly and sullenly 'i met him a while ago zad hunting on the thorstein his signature is in my pocket bid your jger take it out' 'i will not doubt your word' she said to him 'you look a gentleman if you will give me your promise to shoot no more on these lands i will let them set you free and render you up your rifle' 'you have the law with you' said the trespasser moodily 'since i can do no less i promise' 'you are ungracious sir' said wanda with a touch of severity and irritation 'that is neither wise nor grateful since you are nothing more or better than a poacher on my lands nevertheless i will trust you' then she gave a sign to the jgers and a touch to the hounds the latter rose and ceased their growling the former instantly though very sorrowfully untied the cord off the wrists of their prisoner and gave him back his unloaded rifle 'follow that path into the ravine cross that ascend the opposite hills and you will find the high road i advise you to take it sir good day to you' she pointed out the forest path which wound downward under the arolla pines he hesitated a moment then bowed very low with much grace turned his back on her and her foresters and her dogs and began slowly to descend the moss grown slope he hated her for the indignity she had brought upon him and the ridicule to which she forced him to submit yet the beauty of her had startled and dazzled him he had thought of the great queen of the nibelungen lied whose armour lies in the museum of vienna 'alas why have you let him go my countess' murmured otto the head forester 'the kaiser had made him sacred' she answered with a smile and then she called donau and neva who were roaming and went on her way through her forest 'what strange and cruel creatures we are' she thought 'the vulture would have dropped into the ravine he would never have found it the audacity too to fire on a kuttengeier if it had been any lesser bird one might have pardoned it' for the eagle the gypte the white throated pygargue the buzzard and all the family of falcons were held sacred at hohenszalras and lived in their mountain haunts rarely troubled it was an old law there that the great winged monarchs should never be chased except by the kaiser himself when he came there so that the crime of the stranger had been more than trespass and almost treason her heart was hard to him and she felt that she had been too lenient who could tell but that that rifle would bring down some free lord of the air she listened with the keen ear of one used to the solitude of the hills and woods she thought he would shoot something out of bravado but all was silent in that green defile beneath whose boughs the stranger was wending on his way she listened long but she heard no shots although in those still heights the slightest noise echoed from a hundred walls of rock and ice she walked onward through the deep shadow of the thick growing beeches she had her alpenstock in her right hand her little silver horn hung at her belt and beside it was a pair of small ivory pistols pretty as toys but deadly as revolvers could be she stooped here and there to gather some lilies of the valley which were common enough in these damp grassy glades 'where could that stranger have come from otto' she asked of her jger 'he must have come over the hndspitz my countess' said otto 'any other way he would have been stopped by our men and lightened of his rifle' 'the hndspitz' she echoed in wonder for the mountain so called was a wild inaccessible place divided by a parapet of ice all the year round from the range of the gross glckner 'that must he' said the huntsman'and for sure if an honest man had tried to come that way he would have been hurled headlong down the ice wall ' 'he is the kaiser's protg otto' said his mistress with a smile but the old jger muttered that they had only his own word for that it had pierced otto's soul to let the poacher's rifle go she thought of all this with some compunction now as she sat in her own warm safe chamber and heard the thunder the wind the raising of the storm which had now fairly broken in full fury she felt uneasy for the erring stranger the roads over the passes were still perilous from avalanches and half melted snow in the crevasses the time of year was more dangerous than midwinter 'i ought to have given him a guide' she thought and went out and joined the princess ottilie who had awakened from her after dinner repose under the loud roll of the thunder and the constantly recurring flashes of lightning 'i am troubled for that traveller whom i saw in the woods to day' she said to her aunt 'i trust he is safe housed' 'if he had been a pastry cook from the engadine or a seditious heretical colporteur from geneva you would have sent him into the kitchens to feast' said the princess contentiously 'i hope he is safe housed' repeated wanda 'it is several hours ago he may very well have reached the posthouse' 'you have the satisfaction of thinking the kuttengeier is safe sitting on some rock tearing a fish to pieces' said the princess who was irritable because she was awakened before her time 'will you have some coffee or some tea you look disturbed my dear after all you say the man was a poacher' 'yes but i ought to have seen him safe off my ground there are a hundred kinds of death on the hills for anyone who does not know them well let us look at the weather from the hall one can see better from there' from the rittersal whose windows looked straight down the seven miles of the lake water she watched the tempest all the mountains were sending back echoes of thunder which sounded like salvoes of artillery there was little to be seen for the dense rain mist the beacon of the holy isle glimmered redly through the darkness in the upper air snow was falling the great white peaks and pinnacles ever and again flashed strangely into view as the lightning illumined them the glckner wanda towered above all others a moment in the glare and seemed like ice and fire mingled 'they are like the great white thrones of the apocalypse' she thought beneath the lake boiled and seethed in blackness like a witches' cauldron a storm was always terrible to her from the memory of bela in the lull of a second in the tempest of sound it seemed to her as if she heard some other cry than that of the wind 'open one of these windows and listen' she said to hubert her major domo 'i fancy i hear a shout a scream i am not certain but listen well' 'there is some sound' said hubert after a moment of attention 'it comes from the lake but no boat could live long in that water my countess' 'no' she said with a quick sigh remembering how her brother had died 'but we must do what we can it may be one of the lake fishermen caught in the storm before he could make for home ring the alarm bell and go out all of you to the water stairs i will come too' in a few moments the deep bell that hung in the chime tower and which was never sounded except for death or danger added its sonorous brazen voice to the clang and clamour of the storm all the household paused and at the summons coming from north south east and west of the great pile of buildings grooms gardeners huntsmen pages scullions underlings all answered to the metal tongue which told them of some peril at hohenszalras with a hooded cloak thrown over her she went out into the driving rain down the terrace to the head of what were called the water stairs a flight of granite steps leading to the little quay upon the eastward shore of the szalrassee where were moored in fair weather the pleasure boats the fishing punts and the canoes which belonged to the castle craft all now safe in the boat house 'make no confusion' she said to them 'there is no danger in the castle there is some boat or some swimmer on the lake light the terrace beacon and we shall see' she was very pale there was no storm on those waters that did not bring back to her as poignant as the first fresh hours of its grief the death of bela the huge beacon of iron a cage set on high and filled with tow and tar and all inflammable things was set on fire and soon threw a scarlet glare over the scene the shouts had ceased 'they may be drowned' she said with her lips pressed tightly together 'i hear nothing now have you the rope and the lifeboat ready we must wait for more light' at that moment the whole of the tar caught and the beacon blazed at its fiercest in its iron cage as it had used to blaze in the ages gone by as a war signal when the prelates of salzburg and birchtesgaden were marching across the marshes of pinzgau in quarrel or feud with the lords of the strongest fortress in the hohe tauern in the struggling light which met the blue glance of the lightning they could see the angry waters of the lake as far as the holy isle and near to land only his head above the water was a man drowning as the pilgrims had drowned 'for the love of god the rope' she cried and almost before the words had escaped from her her men had thrown a lifebuoy to the exhausted swimmer and pushed one of the boats into the seething darkness of the lake but the swimmer had strength enough to catch hold of the buoy as it was hurled to him by the fischermeister's unerring hand and he clung to it and kept his grasp on it despite the raging of the wind and waters until the boat reached him he was fifty yards off the shore and he was pulled into the little vessel which was tossed to and fro upon the black waters like a shell the fohn was blowing fiercely all the time and flung the men headlong on the boat's bottom twice ere they could seize the swimmer who helped himself for though mute and almost breathless he was not insensible and had not lost all his strength if he had not been so near the land he and the boat's crew would all have sunk and dead bodies would once more have been washed on the shore of the szalrassee with the dawn of another day drenched choked with water and thrown from side to side as the wind played with them as a child with its ball the men ran their boat at last against the stairs and landed with their prize dripping from head to foot and drawing deep breaths of exhaustion the rescued man stood on the terrace steps bareheaded and in his shirt sleeves his brown velvet breeches pulled up to his knees his fair hair lifted by the wind and soaked with wet she recognised the trespasser of the forest 'madame behold me in your power again' he said with a little smile though he breathed with labour and his voice was breathless and low 'you are welcome sir any stranger or friend would be welcome in such a night' she said with the red glow of the beacon light shed upon her 'pray do not waste breath or time in courtesies come up the steps and hurry to the house you must be faint and bruised' 'no no' said the swimmer but as he spoke his eyes closed he staggered a little a deadly faintness and cold had seized him and cramp came on all his limbs the men caught him and carried him up the stairs he strove to struggle and protest but otto the forester stooped over him 'keep you still' he muttered 'you have the countess's orders trespass has cost you dear my master' 'i do not think he is greatly hurt' said the mistress of szaravola to her house physician 'but go you to him doctor and see that he is warmly housed and has hot drinks put him in the strangers' gallery and pray take care my aunt is not alarmed' the princess ottilie at that moment was alternately eating a nougat out of her sweetmeat box and telling the beads of her rosary the sound of the wind and the noise of the storm could not reach her in her favourite blue room all capitonne with turquoise silks as it was the only chamber in all szaravola that was entirely modern and french 'i do hope wanda is running no risk' she thought from time to time 'it would be quite like her to row down the lake' but she sat still in her lamp light and told her beads a few moments later her niece entered her waterproof mantle had kept her white gown from the rain and spray there was a little moisture on her hair that was all she did not look as if she had stirred further from her drawing room than the princess had done now that the stranger was safe and sound he had ceased to have any interest for her he was nothing more than any flotsam of the lake only one other to sleep beneath the roofs of hohenszalras where half a hundred slept already the castle in the wild winters that shut out the hohe tauern from the world was oftentimes a hospice for travellers though usually those travellers were only pedlars colporteurs mule drivers clock makers of the zillerthal or carpet weavers of the defreggerthal too late in the year to pursue their customary passage over the passes in safety to such the great beacon of the holy isle and the huge servants' hall of szaravola were well known she sat down to her embroidery frame without speaking she was working some mountain flowers in silks on velvet for a friend in paris' the flowers stood in a glass on a table 'it is unkind of you to go out in that mad way on such a night as this and return looking so unlike having had an adventure' said the princess a little pettishly 'there has been no adventure' said wanda von szalras with a smile 'but there is what may do as well a handsome stranger who' has been saved from drowning' even as she spoke her face changed her mouth quivered she crossed herself and murmured too low for the other to hear 'bela my beloved think not that i forget' the princess ottilie sat up erect in her chair and her blue eyes brightened like a girl of sixteen 'then there is an adventure tell it me quick my dear silence is very stately and very becoming to you but sometimes excuse me you do push it to annoying extremes' 'i was afraid of agitation for you' said the countess wanda and then she told the princess what had occurred that night 'and i never knew that a poor soul was in peril' cried the princess conscious stricken 'and is that the last you have seen of him have you never asked ' 'hubert says he is only bruised they have taken him to the strangers' gallery here is herr greswold he will tell us more' the person who entered was the physician of hohenszalras he was a little old man of great talent with a clever humorous mild countenance he had coupled with a love for rural life a passion for botany and natural history which made his immurement in the iselthal welcome to him and the many fancied ailments of the princess endurable he bowed very low alternately to both ladies and refused with a protest the chair to which the countess wanda motioned him he said that the stranger was not in the least seriously injured he had been seized with cramp and chills but he had administered a cordial and these were passing the gentleman seemed indisposed to speak shivered a good deal and was inclined to sleep 'he is a gentleman think you asked the princess the herr professor said that to him it appeared so 'and of what rank' the physician thought it was impossible to say 'it is always possible' said the princess a little impatiently 'is his linen fine is his skin smooth are his hands white and slender are his wrists and ankles small' herr greswold said that he was sorely grieved but he had not taken any notice as to any of these things he had been occupied with his diagnosis of the patient's state for he added he thought the swimmer had been long in the water and the szalrassee was of very dangerously low temperature at night being fed as it was from the glaciers and snows of the mountains 'it is very interesting' said the princess 'but pray observe what i have named now that you return to his chamber' greswold took the hint and bowed himself out of the drawing room frau ottilie returned to her nougats 'i wish that one could know who he was' she said regretfully to harbour an unknown person was not agreeable to her in these days of democracies and dynamite 'what does it matter' said her niece 'though he were a nihilist or a convict from the mines he would have to be sheltered to night' 'the herr professor is very inattentive' said the princess with an accent that from one of her sweetness was almost severe 'the herr professor is compiling the flora of the hohe tauern' said her niece 'and he will publish it in leipzig some time in the next twenty years how can a botanist care for so unlovely a creature as a man if it were a flower indeed' 'i never approved of that herbarium' said the princess still severely 'it is too insignificant an occupation beside those great questions of human ills which his services are retained to study he is inattentive and he grows even impertinent he almost told me yesterday that my neuralgia was all imagination' 'he took you for a flower mother mine because you are so lovely and so he thought you could have no mortal pain' said wanda tenderly then after a pause she added 'dear aunt come with me i have asked father ferdinand to have a mass to night for bela i fancy bela is glad that no other life has been taken by the lake' the princess rose quickly and kissed her in the strangers' gallery in a great chamber of panelled oak and flemish tapestries the poacher as he lay almost asleep on a grand old bed with yellow taffeta hangings and the crown of the szalras counts in gilded bronze above its head he heard as if in his dream the sound of chanting voices and the deep slow melodies of an organ he stirred and opened his drowsy eyes 'am i in heaven' he asked feebly yet he was a man who when he was awake and well believed not in heaven the physician sitting by his bedside laid his hand upon his wrist the pulse was beating strongly but quickly 'you are in the burg of hohenszalras' he answered him 'the music you hear comes from the chapel there is a midnight mass a mass of thanksgiving for you' the heavy lids fell over the eyes of the weary man and the dreamy sense of warmth and peace that was upon him lulled him into the indifference of slumber chapter iii with the morning though the storm had ceased and passed away the clouds were dark the mountains were obscured and the rain was pouring down upon lake and land it was still early in the day when the stranger was aroused to the full sense of awaking in a room unknown to him he had slept all through the night he was refreshed and without fever his left arm was strained and he had many bruises otherwise he was conscious of no hurt 'twice in that woman's power' he thought with anger as he looked round the great tapestried chamber that sheltered him and tried to disentangle his actual memories of the past night from the dreams that had haunted him of the nibelungen queen who all night long he had seen in her golden armour with her eyes which like those of the greek nymph dazzled those on whom they gazed to madness dream and fact had so interwoven themselves that it was with an effort he could sever the two awaking as he did now in an unfamiliar chamber and surrounded with those tapestries whose colossal figures seemed the phantoms of a spirit world he was a man in whom some vein of superstition had outlived the cold reason and the cynical mockeries of the worldly experiences and opinions in which he was steeped a shudder of cold ran through his blood as he opened his eyes upon that dim tranquil and vast apartment with the stories of the tannhuser legend embroidered on the walls 'i am he i am he' he thought incoherently watching the form of the doomed knight speeding through the gloom and snow 'how does the most high and honourable gentleman feel himself this morning' asked of him in german a tall white haired woman who might have stepped down from an old panel of metzu the simple commonplace question roused him from the mists of his fancies and fears and realised to him the bare fact that he was a guest unbidden in the walls of szaravola the physician also drew near his bed to question him and a boy brought on a tray rhine wine and tokayer ausbruck coffee and chocolate bread and eggs he broke his fast with a will for he had eaten nothing since the day before at noon and the professor greswold congratulated him on his good night's rest and on his happy escape from the szalrassee then he himself said with a little confusion 'i saw a lady last night' 'certainly you saw our lady' said greswold with a smile 'what do you call her' he asked eagerly the physician answered 'she is the countess wanda von szalras she is sole mistress here but for her my dear sir i fear me you would be now lying in those unfathomed depths that the bravest of us fear' the stranger shuddered a little 'i was a madman to try the lake with such an overcast sky but i had missed my road and i was told that it lay on the other side of the water some peasants tried to dissuade me from crossing but i am a good rower and swimmer too so i set forth to pull myself over your lake' 'with a sky black as ink i suppose you are used to more serene summers midsummer is not so different to midwinter here that you can trust to its tender mercies' the stranger was silent 'she took my gun from me in the morning' he said abruptly the memory of the indignity rankled in him and made bitter the bread and wine the physician laughed 'were you poaching oh that is almost a hanging matter in the hohenszalras woods had you met otto without our lady he would most likely have shot you without warning' 'are you savages in the tauern' 'oh no but we are very feudal still and our forest laws have escaped alteration in this especial part of the province' 'she has been very hospitable to me since my crime was so great' 'she is the soul of hospitality and the schloss is a hospice' said the physician 'when there is no town nearer than ten austrian miles and the nearest posting house is at windisch matrey it is very necessary to exercise the primitive virtues it is our compensation for our feudalism but take some tokayer my dear sir you are weaker than you know you have had a bath of ice you had best lie still and i will send you some journals and books' 'i would rather get up and go away' said the stranger 'these bruises are nothing i will thank your lady as you call her and then go on my way as quickly as i may' 'i see you do not understand feudal ways though you have suffered from them' said the doctor 'you shall get up if you wish but i am certain my lady will not let you leave here to day the rains are falling in torrents the roads are dangerous a bridge has broken down over the brgenbach which you must cross to get away in a word if you insist on departure they will harness their best horses for you for all the antique virtues have refuge here and amongst them is a grand hospitality but you will possibly kill the horses and perhaps the postillions and you will not even then get very far upon your way be persuaded by me wait at least until the morning dawns' 'i had better burden your lady with an unbidden guest than kill her horses certainly' said the stranger 'how is she sole mistress here is there a count von szalras is she a widow' 'she has never married' answered greswold and gave his patient a brief sketch of the tragic fates of the lords of hohenszalras amongst whom death had been so busy' 'a very happy woman to be so rich and so free' said the traveller with a little impatient envy and he added 'she is very handsome also indeed beautiful i now remember to have heard of her in paris her hand has been esteemed one of the great prizes of europe' 'i think she will never marry' said the old man 'oh my dear doctor who can make such at least she looks young what age may she be' 'she was twenty four years of age on easter day as for happiness when you know the countess wanda you will know that she would go out as poor as s elizabeth and self dethroned like her most willingly could she by such a sacrifice see her brothers living around her' the stranger gave a little cynical laugh of utter incredulity which dismayed and annoyed the old professor 'you do not know her' he said angrily 'i know humanity' said the other 'will you kindly take all my apologies and regrets to the countess and give her my name the marquis de sabran she can satisfy herself as to my identity at any embassy she may care to consult' when he said his name the professor gave a great cry and started from his seat 'sabran' he echoed 'you edited the mexico' he exclaimed and gazed over his spectacles in awe and sympathy commingled at the stranger who smiled and answered 'long ago yes have you heard of it' 'heard of it' echoed greswold 'do you take us for barbarians sir' it is here both in my small library which is the collection of a specialist and in the great library of the castle which contains a million of volumes' 'i am twice honoured' said the stranger with a smile of some irony the good professor was a little disconcerted and his enthusiasm was damped and cooled he felt as much embarrassment as though he had been the owner of a discredited work 'may i not be permitted to congratulate you sir' he said timidly 'to have produced that great work is to possess a title to the gratitude and esteem of all educated men' 'you are very good' said sabran somewhat indifferently 'but all that is great in that book is the marquis xavier's i am but the mere compiler' 'the compilation the editing of it required no less learning than the original writer displayed and that was immense' said the physician and with all the enthusiasm of a specialist he plunged into discussion of the many notable points of a mighty intellectual labour which had received the praise of all the cultured world sabran listened courteously but with visible weariness 'you are very good' he said at last 'but you will forgive me if i say that i have heard so much of the mexico that i am tempted to wish i had never produced it i did so as a duty it was all i could do in honour of one to whom i owed far more than mere life itself' greswold bowed and said no more 'give me my belt' said the stranger to the man who waited on him it was a leathern belt which had been about his loins it was made to hold gold and notes a small six chambered revolver and a watch these were all in it and with his money was the imperial permission to shoot which had been given him by franz josef the previous autumn on the thorstein 'your countess' will doubtless recognise her emperor's signature' he said as he gave the paper to the physician 'it will serve at least as a passport if not as a letter of presentation' rn marquis de sabran romaris was one of those persons who illustrate the old fairy tale of all the good gifts at birth being marred by the malison of one godmother he had great physical beauty personal charm and facile talent but his very facility was his bane he did all things so easily and well that he had never acquired the sterner quality of application he was a brilliant and even profound scholar an accomplished musician a consummate critic of art and was endowed moreover with great natural tact taste and correct intuition being as he was a poor man these gifts should have made him an eminent one or a wealthy one but the perverse fairy who had cursed when the other had blessed him had contrived to make all these graces and talents barren whether it be true or not that the world knows nothing of its greatest men it is quite true that its cleverest men very often do nothing of importance all their lives long he did nothing except acquire a distinct repute as a dilettante in paris and a renown in the clubs of being always serene and fortunate at play he had sworn to himself when he had been a youth to make his career worthy of his name but the years had slipped away and he had done nothing he was a very clever man and he had once set a high if a cold and selfish aim before him as his goal but he had done worse even than fail he had never even tried to reach it he was only a boulevardier popular and admired amongst men for his ready wit and his cool courage and by women often adored and often hated and sometimes by himself thoroughly despised never so much despised as when by simple luck at play or on the bourse he made the money which slid through his fingers with rapidity all he had in the world were the wind torn oaks and the sea washed rocks of a bleak and lonely breton village and a few hundred thousand francs' worth of pictures porcelains arms and bibelots which had accumulated in his rooms on the boulevard haussmann bought at the drouot in the forenoons after successful play at night only two things in him were unlike the men whose associate he was he was as temperate as an arab seldom even touching wine and he was a keen mountaineer and athlete once off the asphalte of the boulevards for the rest popular though he was in the society he frequented no living man could boast of any real intimacy with him he had a thousand acquaintances but he accepted no friend under the grace and suavity of a very courtly manner he wore the armour of a great reserve 'at heart you have the taciturnity and the sauvagerie of the armorican beneath all your polished suavity' said a woman of his world to him once and he did not contradict her men did not quarrel with him for it he was a fine swordsman and a dead shot and women were allured all the more surely to him because they felt that they never really entered his life or took any strong hold on it such as he was he lay now half awake on the great bed under its amber canopy and gazed dreamily at the colossal figures of the storied tapestry where the tuscan idlers of the decamerone wore the sombre hues and the stiff and stately garb of flemish fashion of the sixteenth century 'i wonder why i tried so hard to live last night i am not in love with life' he thought to himself as he slowly remembered all that had happened and recalled the face of the lady who had leaned down to him from over the stone parapet in the play of the torchlight and lightnings and yet life seemed good and worth having as he recalled that boiling dusky swirl of water which had so nearly swallowed him up in its anger he was young enough to enjoy he was blessed with a fine constitution and admirable health which even his own excesses had not impaired he had no close ties to the world but he had a frequent enjoyment of it which made it welcome to him the recovery of existence always enhances its savour and as he lay dreamily recalling the sharp peril he had run he was simply and honestly glad to be amongst living men he remained still when the physician had left and looked around him in the wide hearth a fire of oak logs was burning rain was beating against the painted panes of the oriel casements there was old oak old silver old ivory in the furniture of the chamber and the tapestries were sombre and gorgeous it was a room of the sixteenth century but the wine was in jugs of bacarat glass and a box of turkish cigarettes stood beside them with the paris and vienna newspapers everything had been thought of that could contribute to his comfort he wondered if the doctor had thought of all this or if it was due to the lady 'it is a magnificent hospice' he said to himself with a smile and then he angrily remembered his rifle his good english rifle that was now sunk for ever with his little boat in the waters of the szalrassee 'why did she offer me that outrage' he said to himself it went hard with him to lie under her roof to touch her wine and bread yet he was aching in every limb the bed was easy and spacious the warmth and the silence and the aromatic scent of the burning pine cones were alluring him to rest he dropped off to sleep again the same calm sleep of fatigue that had changed into repose and nothing woke him till the forenoon was passed 'good heavens how i am trespassing on this woman's hospitality' he thought as he did awake angry with himself for having been lulled into this oblivion and he began to rise at once though he felt his limbs stiff and his head for the moment light 'cannot i get a carriage for s johann my servant is waiting for me there' he said to the youth attending on him when his bath was over the lad smiled with amusement 'there are no carriages here but our lady's and she will not let you stir this afternoon my lord' he answered in german as he aided the stranger to put on his own linen and shooting breeches now dry and smoothed out by careful hands 'but i have no coat said the traveller in discomfiture remembering that his coat was gone with his rifle and his powder flask 'the herr professor thought you could perhaps manage with one of these they were all of count gela's who was a tall man and about your make' said an older man servant who had entered and now showed him several unworn or scarcely worn suits 'if you could wear one of these my lord for this evening we will send as soon as it is possible for your servant and your clothes to s johann but it is impossible to day because a bridge is down over the brgenbach' 'you are all of you too good' said sabran as he essayed a coat of black velvet pull of his new acquaintance and all his talents the good man greswold had hurried away to obey the summons of his ladies who had desired to see him he found them in the white room a grand salon hung with white satin silver fringed and stately with white marble friezes and columns whence it took its name it was a favourite room with the mistress of the schloss at either end of it immense windows emblazoned and deeply embayed looked out over the sublime landscape without of which at this moment every outline was shrouded in the grey veil of an incessantly falling rain with humble obeisances greswold presented the message and the credentials of her guest to wanda von szalras it was the first occasion that he had had of doing so she read the document signed by the kaiser with a smile 'this is the paper which this unhappy gentleman spoke of when i arrested him as a poacher' she said to her aunt 'the marquis de sabran the name is familiar to me i have heard it before' 'surely you do not forget the pontves bargme the ducs de sabran' said the princess with some severity s eleazar was a comte de sabran' 'i know but it is of something nearer to us than s eleazar that i am thinking there was surely some work or another which bore that name and was much read and quoted' 'he edited and annotated the great mexico' said herr greswold as though all were told in that 'a savant' murmured the princess in some contemptuous chagrin 'pray what is the mexico' 'the grandest archological and botanical work the work of the finest research and most varied learning that has been produced out of germany' commenced the professor with eagerness but the princess arrested him midway in his eloquence 'the french are all infidels we know that but one might have hoped that in one of the old nobility as his name would imply some lingering reverence for tradition remained' 'it is not a subversive not a philosophic work' said the professor eagerly but she silenced him 'it is a book why should a marquis de sabran write a book' said the princess with ineffable disdain there were all the fathers for anyone who wanted to read what need for any other use of printer's type so she was accustomed to think and to say when scandalised she saw the german french and english volumes of which whole cases were wont to arrive at hohenszalras for the use of wanda von szalras alone works of philosophy and of science amongst them which had been denounced in the 'index' 'dear mother' said the countess wanda 'i have read the mexico it is a grand monument raised to a dead man's memory out of his own labours by one of his own descendants his only descendant if i remember aright' 'indeed' said the princess unconvinced 'i know those scientific works by repute they always consider the voyage of a germ of moss carried on an aerolite through an indefinite space for a billion of ages a matter much easier of credence than the life of st jerome i believe they call it sporadic transmission they call typhus fever the same' 'there is nothing of that in the mexico it is a very fine work on the archology and history of the country and on its flora' 'i should have supposed a marquis de sabran a gentleman' said the princess whom no precedent from the many monarchs who have been guilty of inferior literature could convince that literature was other than a trade much like shoemaking at its best a sort of clerk's quill driving to be equally pitied and censured here greswold who valued his post and knew his place too well to defend either literature or sporadic germs timidly ventured to suggest that the marquis might be well known amongst the nobility of western france although not of that immense distinction which finds its chronicle in the hof kalender the princess smiled 'petite noblesse you mean petite noblesse my good greswold but even the petite noblesse need not write books' when however the further question arose of inviting the stranger to come to their dinner table it was the haughtier princess who advocated the invitation the mistress of the house demurred she thought that all requirements of courtesy and hospitality would be fulfilled by allowing him to dine in his own apartments 'we do not know him' she urged 'no doubt he may very well be what he says but it is not easy to refer to an embassy while the rains are making an island of the tauern nay dear mother i am not suspicious but i think as we are two women alone we can fulfil all obligations of hospitality towards this gentleman without making him personally acquainted with ourselves' 'that is really very absurd it is acting as if hohenszalras were a gasthof' said the princess with petulance 'it is not so often that we have any relief to the tedium with which you are pleased to surround yourself that we should be required to shut ourselves from any chance break in it of course if you send this person his dinner to his own rooms he will feel hurt mortified he will go away probably on foot rather than remain where he is insulted breton nobility is not very eminent but it is very proud it is provincial territorial but every one knows it is ancient and usually of the most loyal traditions alike to church and state i should be the last person to advocate making a friendship or even an acquaintance without the fullest inquiry but when it is a mere question of a politeness for twenty four hours which can entail no consequences then i must confess that i think prejudices should yield before the obligations of courtesy but of course my love decide as you will you are mistress' the countess wanda smiled and did not press her own opposition she perceived that the mind of her aunt was full of vivid and harmless curiosity in the end she suggested that the princess should represent her and receive the foreign visitor with all due form and ceremony but she herself was still indisposed to admit a person of whose antecedents she had no positive guarantee so suddenly and entirely into her intimacy 'you are extraordinarily suspicious' said the elder lady pettishly 'if he were a pedlar or a colporteur you would be willing to talk with him' 'pedlars and colporteurs cannot take any social advantage of one's conversation afterwards' replied her niece 'we are not usually invaded by men of rank here so the precedent may not be perilous have your own way mother mine' the princess demurred but finally accepted the compromise reflecting that if this stranger were to dine alone with her she would be able to ascertain much more about him than if wanda who had been created void of all natural curiosity and who would have been capable of living with people twelve months without asking them a single question would render it possible to do were she present meanwhile the physician hurried back to his new friend who had a great and peculiar interest for him as the editor of the mexico and offered him with the permission of the countess von szalras to wile away the chill and gloomy day by an inspection of the schloss joachim greswold was a very learned and shrewd man whom poverty and love of tranquil opportunities of study had induced to bury himself in the heart of the glckner mountains he had already led a long severe and blameless life of deep devotion and hard privation when the post of private physician at hohenszalras in general and to the princess ottilie in especial had been procured for him by the interest of prince lilienhhe he had had many sorrows trials and disappointments which made the simple routine and the entire solitude of his existence here welcome to him but he was none the less delighted to meet any companion of culture and intelligence to converse with and in his monotonous and lonely life it was a rare treat to be able to exchange ideas with one fresh from the intellectual movements of the outer world the professor found not to his surprise since he had read the mexico that his elegant grand seigneur knew very nearly as much as he did of botany and of comparative anatomy that he had travelled nearly all over the world and travelled to much purpose and knew many curious things of the flora of the rio grande whilst it appeared that he possessed in his cabinets in paris a certain variety of orchid that the doctor had always longed to obtain he was entirely won over when sabran to whom the dried flower was very indifferent promised to send it to him the french marquis had not greswold's absolute love of science he had studied every thing that had come to his hand because he had a high intelligence and an insatiable appetite for knowledge and he had no other kind of devotion to it when he had penetrated its mysteries it lost all interest for him at any rate he knew enough to make him an enchanting companion to a learned man who was all alone in his learning and received little sympathy in it from anyone near him 'what a grand house to be shut up in the heart of the mountains' said sabran with a sigh 'i do believe what romance there still is in the world does lie in these forests of austria which have all the twilight and the solitude that would suit merlin or the sleeping beauty better than anything we have in france except indeed here and there an old chteau like chenonceaux or maintenon' 'the world has not spoilt us as yet' said the doctor 'we see few strangers our people are full of old faiths old loyalties old traditions they are a sturdy and yet tender people they are as fearless as their own steinbock and they are as reverent as saints were in monastic days our mountains are as grand as the swiss ones but thank heaven they are unspoilt and little known i tremble when i think they have begun to climb the gross glckner all the mystery and glory of our glaciers will vanish when they become mere points of ascension the alpenstock of the tourist is to the everlasting hills what railway metals are to the plains thank god the few railroads we have are hundreds of miles asunder' 'you are a reactionist doctor' 'i am an old man and i have learned the value of repose' said greswold 'you know we are called a slow race it is only the unwise amongst us who have quicksilver in their brains and toes' 'you have gold in the former at least' said sabran kindly 'and i dare say quicksilver is in your feet too when there is a charity to be done' herr joachim who was simple in the knowledge of mankind though shrewd in mother wit coloured a little with pleasure how well this stranger understood him the day went away imperceptibly and agreeably to the physician and to the stranger in this pleasant rambling talk whilst the rain poured down in fury on the stone terraces and green lawns without and the szalrassee was hidden under a veil of fog 'am i not to see her at all' thought sabran he did not like to express his disquietude on that subject to the physician and he was not sure himself whether he most desired to ride away without meeting the serene eyes of his chtelaine or to be face to face with her once more he stood long before her portrait done by carolus duran she wore in it a close fitting gown of white velvet and held in her hand a great spanish hat with white plumes the two hounds were beside her the attitude had a certain grandeur and gravity in it which were very impressive 'this was painted last year' said greswold 'at the princess's request it is admirably like ' 'it is a noble picture' said sabran 'but what a very proud woman she looks' 'blood tells' said greswold 'far more than most people know or admit it is natural that my lady with the blood in her of so many mighty nobles who had the power of judgment and chastisement over whole provinces should be sometimes disposed to exercise too despotic a will to be sometimes contemptuous of the dictates of modern society which sends the princess and the peasant alike to a law court for sole redress of their wrongs she is at times irreconcilable with the world as it stands she is the representative and descendant in a direct line of arrogant and omnipotent princes that she combines with that natural arrogance and instinct of dominion a very beautiful pitifulness and even humility is a proof of the chastening influence of religious faith on the nature of women we are too apt to forget that in our haste to destroy the church men might get on perhaps very well without a religion of any kind but i tremble to think what their mothers and their mistresses would become' they passed the morning in animated discussion and as it drew to a close the good doctor did not perceive how adroitly his new acquaintance drew out from him all details of the past and present of hohenszalras and of the tastes and habits of its chtelaine until he knew all that there was to be known of that pure and austere life 'you may think her grief for her brother bela's death for all her brothers' deaths a morbid sentiment' said the doctor as he spoke of her 'but it is not so no it is perhaps overwrought but no life can be morbid that is so active in duty so untiring in charity so unsparing of itself her lands and riches and all the people dependent on her are to the countess wanda only as so much trust for which hereafter she will be responsible to bela and to god you and i may smile you and i who are philosophers and have settled past dispute that the human life has no more future than the snail gnawed cabbage but yet yet my dear sir one cannot deny that there is something exalted in such a conception of duty and of this i am convinced that on the character of a woman it has a very ennobling influence' 'no doubt but has she renounced all her youth does she mean never to go into the world or to marry' 'i am quite sure she has made no resolve of the sort' but i do not think she will ever alter she has refused many great alliances her temperament is serene almost cold and her ideal it would be difficult i imagine for any mortal man to realise' 'but when a woman loves ' 'oh of course' said herr joachim rather drily 'if the aloe flower love does not i think possess any part of the countess wanda's thoughts or desires she fancies it a mere weakness' 'a woman can scarcely be amiable without that weakness' 'no perhaps she is not precisely what we term amiable she is rather too far also from human emotions and human needs the women of the house of szalras have been mostly very proud silent brave and resolute great ladies rather than lovable wives luitgarde von szalras held this place with only a few archers and spearmen against heinrich jasomergott in the twelfth century and he raised the siege after five months she is not a woman nor human she is a kuttengeier he said as he retreated into his wiener wald all the great monk vultures and the gyps and the pygargues have been sacred all through the hohe tauern since that year' 'and i was about to shoot a kuttengeier now i see that my offence was beyond poaching it was high treason almost' 'i heard the story from otto he would have hanged you cheerfully but i hope' said the doctor with a pang of misgiving 'that i have not given you any false impression of my lady as cold and hard and unwomanly she is full of tenderness of a high order she is the noblest most truthful and most generous nature that i have ever known clothed in human form and if she be too proud well it is a stately sin pardonable in one who has behind her eleven hundred years of fearless and unblemished honour' 'i am a socialist' said sabran a little curtly then added with a little laugh 'though i believe not in rank i do believe in race' 'bon sang ne peut mentir' murmured the old physician the fair face of sabran changed slightly 'will you come and look over the house' said the professor who noticed nothing and only thought of propitiating the owner of the rare orchid 'there is almost as much to see as in the burg at vienna everything has accumulated here undisturbed for a thousand years hohenszalras has been besieged but never deserted or dismantled 'it is a grand place' said sabran with a look of impatience 'it seems intolerable that a woman should possess it all while i only own a few wind blown oaks in the wilds of finisterre' 'ah ah that is pure socialism' said the doctor with a little chuckle 'ote toi que je m'y mette that is genuine liberalism all the world over' 'you are no communist yourself doctor' 'no' said herr joachim simply 'all my studies lead me to the conviction that equality is impossible and were it possible it would be hideous variety infinite variety is the beneficent law of the world's life why in that most perfect of all societies the beehive flawless mathematics are found co existent with impassable social barriers and unalterable social grades' sabran laughed good humouredly 'i thought at least the bees enjoyed an undeniable republic' 'a republic with helots sir like sparta a republic will always have its helots but come and wander over the castle come first and see the parchments' 'where are the ladies' asked sabran wistfully 'the princess is at her devotions and taking tisane i visited her this morning she thinks she has a sore throat as for our lady no one ever disturbs her or knows what she is doing when she wants any of us ordinary folks we are summoned sometimes we tremble you know this alone is an immense estate and then there is a palace at the capital and one at salzburg not to speak of the large estates in hungary and the mines in galicia all these our lady sees after and manages herself you can imagine that her secretary has no easy task and that secretary is herself for she does not believe in doing anything well by others' 'a second maria theresa' said sabran 'not dissimilar perhaps' said the doctor nettled at the irony of the tone 'only where our great queen sent thousands out to their deaths the countess von szalras saves many lives there are no mines in the world i will make bold to say where there is so much comfort and so little peril as those mines of hers in stanislaw she visited them three years hence but i forget you are a stranger and as you do not share our cultus for the grafin cannot care to hear its canticles come to the muniment room you shall see some strange parchments' 'heavens how it rains' said sabran as they left his chambers 'is that common here' 'very common indeed' said the doctor with a laugh 'we pass two thirds of the year between snow and water but then we have compensation where will you see such grass such forests such gardens when the summer sun does shine' the marquis de sabran charmed him and as they wandered over the huge castle the physician delightedly displayed his own erudition and recognised that of his companion the hohenszalrasburg was itself like some black letter record of old south german history it was a chronicle written in stone and wood and iron the brave old house like a noble person contained in itself a liberal education and the stranger whom through an accident it sheltered was educated enough to comprehend and estimate it at its due value in his passage through it he won the suffrages of the household by his varied knowledge and correct appreciation in the stables his praises of the various breeds of horses there commended itself by its accuracy to ulrich the stallmeister not less than a few difficult shots in the shooting gallery proved his skill to his enemy of the previous day otto the jgermeister not less did he please hubert who was learned in such things with his cultured admiration of the wonderful old gold and silver plate the limoges dishes and bowls the vienna and kronenthal china nor less the custodian of the pictures a collection of flemish and german masters with here and there a modern capolavoro hung all by themselves in a little vaulted gallery which led into a much larger one consecrated to tapestries flemish french and florentine when twilight came and the greyness of the rain charged atmosphere deepened into the dark of night sabran had made all living things at the castle his firm friends down to the dogs of the house save and except the ladies who dwelt in it of them he had had no glimpse they kept their own apartments he began to feel some fresh embarrassment at remaining another night beneath a roof the mistress of which did not deign personally to recognise his presence a salon hung with tapestries opened out of the bedchamber allotted to him he wondered if he were to dine there like a prisoner of state he felt an extreme reluctance united to a strong curiosity to meet again the woman who had treated him with such cool authority and indifference as a common poacher in her woods his cheek tingled still whenever he thought of the manner in which at her signal his hands had been tied and his rifle taken from him she was the representative of all that feudal aristocratic despotic dominant spirit of a dead time which he with his modern cynical reckless parisian liberalism most hated or believed that he hated she was austria felix personified and he was a man who had always persuaded himself and others that he was a socialist a philippe egalit and this haughty patrician had mortified him and then had benefited and sheltered him he would willingly have gone from under her roof without seeing her and yet a warm and inquisitive desire impelled him to feel an unreasonable annoyance that the day was going by without his receiving any intimation that he would be allowed to enter her presence or be expected to make his obeisances to her when however the servants entered to light the many candles in his room hubert entered behind them and expressed the desire of his lady that the marquis would favour them with his presence they were about to dine sabran standing before the mirror saw himself colour like a boy he knew not whether he were most annoyed or pleased he would willingly have ridden away leaving his napoleons for the household and seeing no more the woman who had made him ridiculous in his own eyes yet the remembrance of her haunted him as something strange imperious magnetic grave serene stately vague memories of a thousand things he had heard said of her in embassies and at courts came to his mind she had been a mere unknown name to him then he had not listened he had not cared but now he remembered all he had heard curiosity and an embarrassment wholly foreign to him struggled together in him what could he say to a woman who had first insulted and then protected him it would tax all the ingenuity and the tact for which he was famed however he only said to the major domo 'i am much flattered express my profound gratitude to your ladies for the honour they are so good as to do me' then he made his attire look as well as it could and considering that punctuality is due from guests as well as from monarchs he said that he was ready to follow the servant waiting for him and did so through the many tapestried and panelled corridors by which the enormous house was traversed though light was not spared at the burg it was only such light as oil and wax could give the galleries and passages dim mysterious figures loomed from the rooms and shadows seemed to stretch away on every side to vast unknown chambers that might hold the secrets of a thousand centuries when he was ushered into the radiance of the great white room he felt dazzled and blinded he felt his bruise still and he walked with a slight lameness from a strain of his left foot but this did not detract from the grace and distinction of his bearing and the pallor of his handsome features became them and when he advanced through the opened doors and bent before the chair and kissed the hands of the princess ottilie she thought to herself 'what a perfectly beautiful person even wanda will have to admit that' whilst hubert going backward said to his regiment of under servants 'look you since count gela rode out to his death at the head of the white hussars so grand a man as this stranger has not set foot in this house' he expected to see the countess wanda von szalras instead he saw the loveliest little old lady he had ever seen in his life clad in a semi conventual costume leaning on a gold headed cane with clouds of fragrant old lace about her and a cross of emeralds hung at her girdle of onyx beads who saluted him with the ceremonious grace of that etiquette which is still the common rule of life amongst the great nobilities of the north he hastened to respond in the same spirit with an exquisite deference of manner she greeted him with affable and smiling words and he devoted himself to her with deference and gallantry expressing all his sense of gratitude for the succour and shelter he received with a few eloquent and elegant phrases which said enough and not too much with a grace that it is difficult to lend to gratitude which is generally somewhat halting and uncouth 'his name must be in the hof kalendar' she thought as she replied to his protestations with her prettiest smile which despite her sacred calling and her seventy years was the smile of a coquette 'm le marquis' she said in her tender and flute like voice 'i deserve none of your eloquent thanks age is sadly selfish i did nothing to rescue you unless indeed heaven heard my unworthy prayer and this house is not mine nor anything in it the owner of it and therefore your chtelaine of the moment is my grand niece the countess wanda von szalras' 'that i had your intercession with heaven however indirectly was far more than i deserved' said sabran still standing before her 'for the countess wanda i have been twice in her power and she has been very generous' 'she has done her duty nothing more' said the princess a little primly and petulantly if princesses and petulance can mingle 'we should have scarce been christians if we had not striven for your life as to leaving us this day it was out of the question the storm continues the passes are torrents i fear much that it will even be impossible for your servant to come from s johann we could not send to matrey even this morning for the post bag and they tell me the bridge is down over the brgenbach' 'i have wanted for nothing and my parisian rogue is quite as well yawning and smoking his days away at s johann' said sabran 'oh madame how can i ever express to you all my sense of the profound obligations you have laid me under stranger that i am' 'at least we were bound to atone for the incivility of the szalrassee' said the princess with her pretty smile 'it is a very horrible country to live in my niece indeed thinks it arcadia but an arcadia subject to the most violent floods and imprisoned in snow and frost for so many months does not commend itself to me no doubt it is very grand and romantic' the ideal of the princess was neither grand nor romantic it was life in the little prim yet gay north german town in the palace of which she and all her people had been born a little town with red roofs green alleys straight toylike streets clipped trees stiff soldiers set in the midst of a verdant plain flat and green and smooth as a card table the new comer interested her she was quickly won by personal beauty and he possessed this in a great degree it was a face unlike any she had ever seen it seemed to her to bear mystery with it and melancholy and she loved both those things perhaps because she had never met with either out of the pages of german poets and novelists of france those who are united to them in real life find them uneasy bedfellows 'perhaps he is some kronprinz in disguise' she thought with pleasure but then she sadly recollected that she knew every crown prince that there was in europe she would have liked to have asked him many questions but her high breeding was still stronger than her curiosity and a guest could never be interrogated dinner was announced as served 'my niece the countess wanda' said the princess with a little reluctance visible in her hesitation 'will dine in her own rooms she begs you to excuse her she is tired from the storm last night' 'she will not dine with me' thought sabran with the quick intuition natural to him 'you leave me nothing to regret princess' he said readily with a sweet smile as he offered his arm to this lovely little lady wrapped in laces fine as cobweb with her great cross of emeralds pendent from her rosary a woman is never too old to be averse to the thought that she can charm very innocent charming was that of the princess ottilie and she thought with a sigh if she had married if she had had such a son yet she was not insensible to the delicate compliment which he paid her in appearing indifferent to the absence of his chtelaine and quite content with her own presence throughout dinner in that great hall he sitting on her right hand amused her flattered her with that subtlest of all flattery interest and attention diverted her with gay stories of worlds unknown to her and charmed her with his willingness to listen to her lament over the degeneracy of mankind and of manners after a few words of courtesy as to his hostess's absence he seemed not even to remember that wanda von salzras was absent from the head of her table 'and i have said that she was tired she who is never more tired than the eagles are may heaven forgive me the untruth' thought the princess more than once during the meal which was long and magnificent and at which her guest ate sparingly and drank but little 'you have no appetite' she said regretfully 'pardon me i have a good one' he answered her 'but i have always been content to eat little and drink less it is the secret of health and my health is all my riches' she looked at him with interest 'i should think your riches in that respect are inexhaustible' he smiled 'oh yes i have never had a day's illness except once long ago in the mexican swamps a marsh fever and a snake bite' 'you have travelled much' 'i have seen most of the known world and a little of the unknown' he answered 'i am like ulysses only there will be not even a dog to welcome me when my wanderings are done' 'have you no relatives' 'none' he added with an effort everyone is dead dead long ago i have been long alone and i am very well used to it' 'but you must have troops of friends' 'oh friends who will win my last napoleon at play or remember me as long as they meet me every day on the boulevards yes i have many of that sort but they are not worth ulysses' dog' he spoke carelessly without any regard to the truth as far as it went but no study would have made him more apt to coin words to attract the sympathy of his listeners 'he is unfortunate' she thought 'how often beauty brings misfortune my niece must certainly see him i wish he belonged to the pontves bargmes' not to have a name that she knew one of those names that fill all europe as with the trump of an archangel was to be as one maimed or deformed in the eyes of the princess an object for charity not for intercourse 'your title is of brittany i think' she said a little wistfully and as he answered something abruptly in the affirmative she solaced herself once more with the remembrance that there was a good deal of petite noblesse honourable enough though not in the 'almanac de gotha' which was a great concession from her prejudices invented on the spur of the interest that he excited in her imagination 'i never saw any person so handsome' she thought as she glanced at his face while he in return thought that this silver haired soft cheeked lace enwrapped holy mother was jolie croquer in the language of those boulevards which had been his nursery and his palestrum she was so kind to him she was so gracious and graceful she chatted with him so frankly and pleasantly and she took so active an interest in his welfare that he was touched and grateful he had known many women many young ones and gay ones he had never known what the charm of a kindly and serene old age can be like in a woman who has lived with pure thoughts and will die in hope and in faith and this lovely old abbess with her pretty touch of worldliness was a study to him new with the novelty of innocence and of a kind of veneration and he was careful not to let her perceive his mortification that the countess von szalras would not deign to dine in his presence in truth he thought of little else but no trace of irritation or of absence of mind was to be seen in him as he amused the princess and discovered with her that they had in common some friends amongst the nobilities of saxony of wurtemberg and of bohemia 'come and take your coffee in my own room the blue room' she said to him and she rose and took his arm 'we will go through the library you saw it this morning i imagine it is supposed to contain the finest collection of black letter in the empire or so we think' and she led him through the great halls and up a few low stairs into a large oval room lined with oaken bookcases which held the manuscripts missals and volumes of all dates which had been originally gathered together by one of the race who had been also a bishop and a cardinal the library was oak panelled and had an embossed and emblazoned ceiling silver lamps of old italian trasvorato work hung by silver chains and shed a subdued clear light beneath the porphyry sculptures of the hearth a fire of logs was burning for the early summer evening here is chill and damp there were many open fireplaces in hohenszalras introduced there by a chilly provenal princess who had wedded a szalras in the seventeenth century and who had abolished the huge porcelain stoves in many apartments in favour of grand carved mantel pieces and gilded andirons and sweet smelling simple fires of aromatic woods such as made glad the sombre hotels and lonely chteaux of the prance of the bourbons before this hearth with the dogs stretched on the black bearskin rugs his hostess was seated she had dined in a small dining hall opening out of the library and was sitting reading with a shaded light behind her she rose with astonishment and as he fancied anger upon her face as she saw him enter and stood in her full height beneath the light of one of the silver hanging lamps she wore a gown of olive coloured velvet with some pale roses fastened amongst the old lace at her breast she had about her throat several rows of large pearls which she always wore night and day that they should not change their pure whiteness by disuse she looked very stately cold annoyed disdainful as she stood there without speaking 'it is my niece the countess von szalras' said the princess to her companion in some trepidation 'wanda my love i was not aware you were here i thought you were in your own octagon room allow me to make you acquainted with your guest whom you have already received twice with little ceremony i believe' the trifling falsehoods were trippingly but timidly said the princess's blue eyes sought consciously her niece's forgiveness with a pathetic appeal to which wanda who loved her tenderly could not be long obdurate had it been any other than mme ottilie who had thus brought by force into her presence a stranger whom she had marked her desire to avoid the serene temper of the mistress of the hohenszalrasburg would not have preserved its equanimity and she would have quitted her library on the instant sweeping a grand courtesy which should have been greeting and farewell at once to one too audacious but the shy entreating appeal of the princess's regard touched her heart and the veneration she had borne from childhood to one so holy and so sacred by years of grace checked in her any utterance or sign of annoyance sabran meanwhile standing by in some hesitation and embarrassment bowed low with consummate grace and a timidity not less graceful she advanced a step and held her hand out to him 'i fear i have been inhospitable sir' she said to him in his own tongue 'are you wholly unhurt you had a rough greeting from hohenszalras' he took the tip of her fingers on his own and bent over them as humbly as over an empress's well used to the world as he was to its ceremonies courts and etiquettes he was awed by her as if he were a youth he lost his ready aptness of language and his easy manner of adaptability 'i am but a vagrant madame' he murmured as he bowed over her hand 'i have no right even to your charity' for the moment it seemed to her as if he spoke in bitter and melancholy earnest and she looked at him in a passing surprise that changed into a smile 'you were a poacher certainly but that is forgiven my aunt has taken you under her protection and you had the kaiser's already with such a dual shelter you are safe are you quite recovered' she said bending her grave glance upon him 'i have to ask your pardon for my great negligence in not sending one of my men to guide you over the pass to matrey' 'nay if you had done so i should not have enjoyed the happiness of being your debtor' he replied meeting her close gaze with a certain sense of confusion most rare with him and added a few words of eloquent gratitude which she interrupted almost abruptly 'pray carry no such burden of imaginary debt and have no scruples in staying as long as you like we are a mountain refuge use it as you would a monastery in the winter we have many travellers we are so entirely in the heart of the hills that we are bound by all christian laws to give a refuge to all who need it but how came you on the lake last evening could you not read the skies' he explained his own folly and hardihood and added with a glance at her 'the offending rifle is in the szalrassee it was my haste to quit your dominions that made me venture on to the lake i had searched in vain for the high road that you had told me of and i thought if i crossed the lake i should be off your soil' 'no for many leagues you would not have been off it' she answered him 'our lands are very large and like the archbishopric of berchtesgarten are as high as they are broad our hills are very dangerous for strangers especially until the snows of the passes have all melted i repented me too late that i did not send a jger with you as a guide' 'all is well that ends well' said the princess 'monsieur is not the worse for his bath in the lake and we have the novelty of an incident and of a guest who we will hope in the future will become a friend' 'madame if i dared hope that i should have much to live for' said the stranger and the princess smiled sweetly upon him 'you must have very much to live for as it is were i a man and as young as you and as favoured by nature i am afraid i should be tempted to live for myself' 'and i am most glad when i can escape from so poor a companion' said he with a melancholy in the accent and a passing pain that was not assumed before this gentle and gracious old woman in this warm and elegant chamber he felt suddenly that he was a wanderer perhaps an outcast 'you need not use the french language with him wanda' interrupted the princess 'the marquis speaks admirable german it is impossible to speak better' 'we will speak our own tongue then' said wanda who always regarded her aunt as though she were a petted and rather wayward child 'are you quite rested m de sabran and quite unhurt' i did not dine with you it must have seemed churlish but i am very solitary in my habits and my aunt entertains strangers so much better than i do that i grow more hermit like every year' he smiled he thought there was but little of the hermit in this woman's supreme elegance and dignity as she stood beside her hearth with its ruddy fitful light playing on the great pearls at her throat and burnishing into gold the bronze shadows of her velvet gown 'the princess has told me that you are cruel to the world' he answered her 'but it is natural with such a kingdom that you seldom care to leave it' 'it is a kingdom of snow for seven months out of the year' said the princess peevishly 'and a water kingdom the other five you see what it is to day and this is the middle of may' 'i think one might well forget the rain and every other ill between these four walls' said the french marquis as he glanced around him and then slowly let his eyes rest on his chtelaine 'it is a grand library' she answered him 'but i must warn you that there is nothing more recent in it than diderot and descartes the cardinal hugo von szalras who collected it lived in the latter half of last century and since his day no szalras has been bookish save myself the cardinal however had all the mss and the black letters or nearly all ready to his hand what he added is a vast library of science and history and he also got together some of the most beautiful missals in the world are you curious in such things' she rose as she spoke and unlocked one of the doors of the oak bookcase and brought out an ivory missal carved by the marvellous prnner of klagenfurt with the arms of the szalras on one side of it and those of a princely german house on the other 'that was the nuptial missal of georg von szalras and ida windisgratz in ' she said 'and these are all the other marriage hours of our people if you care to study them' and in that case next to this there is a wonderful evangelistarium with miniatures of angelico's but i see they tell all their stories to you i see by the way you touch them that you are a connoisseur' 'i fear i have studied them chiefly at the sales of the rue drouot' said sabran with a smile but he had a great deal of sound knowledge on all arts and sciences and a true taste which never led him wrong with an illuminated chronicle in his hand or a book of hours on his knee he conversed easily discursively charmingly of the early scribes and the early masters of monkish painters and of church libraries of all the world has lost and of all aid that art had brought to faith he talked well with graceful and well chosen language with picturesque illustration with a memory that never was at fault for name or date or apt quotation he spoke fluent and eloquent german in which there was scarcely any trace of foreign accent and he disclosed without effort the resources of a cultured and even learned mind the antagonism she had felt against the poacher of her woods melted away as she listened and replied to him there was a melody in his voice and a charm in his manner that it was not easy to resist and with the pale lights from the italian lamp which swung near upon the fairness of his face she reluctantly owned that her aunt had been right he was singularly handsome with that uncommon and grand cast of beauty which in these days is rarer than it was in the times of vandyck and of velasquez for manners and moods leave their trace on the features and this age is not great the princess in her easy chair for once not sleeping after dinner listened to her and thought to herself 'she is angry with me but how much better it is to talk with a living being than to pass the evening over a philosophical treatise or the accounts of her schools or her stables' sabran having conquered the momentary reluctance and embarrassment which had overcome him in the presence of the woman to whom he owed both an outrage and a rescue endeavoured with all the skill he possessed to interest and beguile her attention he knew that she was a great lady a proud woman a recluse and a student and a person averse to homage and flattery of every kind he met her on the common ground of art and learning and could prove himself her equal at all times even occasionally her master when he fancied she had enough of such serious themes he spoke of music there was a new opera then out at paris of which the theme was as yet scarcely known he looked round the library and said to her 'were there an organ here or a piano i could give you some idea of the motive i can recall most of it' 'there are both in my own room it is near here' she said to him 'will you come' then she led the way across the gallery which alone separated the library from that octagon room which was so essentially her own where all were hers the princess accompanied her content as a child is who has put a light to a slow match that leads it knows not whither 'she must approve of him or she would not take him there' thought the wise princess 'go and play to us' said wanda von szalras as her guest entered the sacred room 'i am sure you are a great musician you speak of music as we only speak of what we love' 'what do you love' he wondered mutely as he sat down before the grand piano and struck a few chords he sat down and played without prelude one of the most tender and most grave of schubert's sonatas it was subtle delicate difficult to interpret but he gave it with consummate truth of touch and feeling he had always loved german music best he played on and on dreamily with a perfection of skill that was matched by his tenderness of interpretation 'you are a great artist' said his hostess as he paused he rose and approached her 'alas no i am only an amateur' he answered her 'to be an artist one must needs have immense faith in one's art and in oneself i have no faith in anything an artist steers straight to one goal i drift' 'you have drifted to wise purpose 'you must have studied much' 'in my youth not since an artist ah how i envy artists they believe they aspire even if they never attain they are happy happy in their very torment and through it like lovers' 'but your talent ' 'ah madame it is only talent it is nothing else the feu sacr is wanting' she looked at him with some curiosity 'perhaps the habit of the world has put out that fire it often does but if even it be only talent what a beautiful talent it is to carry all that store of melody safe in your memory it is like having sunlight and moonlight ever at command' lizst had more than once summoned the spirits of heaven to his call there in that same room in hohenszalras and since his touch no one had ever made the dumb notes speak as this stranger could do and the subdued power of his voice added to the melody he evoked the light of the lamps filled with silvery shadows the twilight of the chamber the hues of the tapestries of the ivories of the gold and silver work of the paintings of the embroideries made a rich chiaro oscuro of colour the pine cones and the dried thyme burning on the hearth shed an aromatic smell on the air there were large baskets and vases full of hothouse roses and white lilies from the gardens she sat by the hearth left in shadow except where the twilight caught the gleam of her pearls and the shine of her eyes she listened the jewels on her hand glancing like little stars as she slowly waved to and fro a feather screen in rhythm with what he sang or played so might mary stuart have looked listening to rizzio or ronsard 'she is a queen' he thought and he sang 'si j'tais roi' 'go on' she said as he paused he had thrown eloquence and passion into the song 'shall i not tire you' 'that is only a phrase save when liszt passes by here i never hear such music as yours' 'he obeyed her and played and sang many and very different things at last he rose a little abruptly two hours had gone by since they had entered the octagon chamber 'it would be commonplace to thank you' she murmured with a little hesitation 'you have a great gift one of all gifts the most generous to others' he made a gesture of repudiation and walked across to a spinet of the fifteenth century inlaid with curious devices by martin pacher of brauneck and having a painting of his in its lid 'what a beautiful old box' he said as he touched it 'has it any sound i wonder if one be disposed to be sad surely of all sad things an old spinet is the saddest to think of the hands that have touched of the children that have danced to it of the tender old ballads that have been sung to the notes that to us seem so hoarse and so faulty all the musicians dead dead so long ago and the old spinet still answering when anyone calls shall i sing you a madrigal to it' very tenderly very lightly he touched the ivory keys of the painted toy of the ladies so long dead and gone and he sang in a minor key the sweet sad quaint poem o sont les neiges d'antan that ballad of fair women echoed softly through the stillness of the chamber touched with the sobbing notes of the spinet even as it might have been in the days of its writer o sont les neiges d'antan the chords of the old music box seemed to sigh and tremble with remembrance where were they all the beautiful dead women all the fair imperious queens all the loved and all the lovers where were they the snow had fallen through so many white winters since that song was sung so many so many the last words thrilled sadly and sweetly through the silence he rose and bowed very low 'i have trespassed too long on your patience madame i have the honour to wish you goodnight' wanda von szalras was not a woman quickly touched to any emotion but her eyelids were heavy with a mist of unshed tears as she raised them and looked up from the fire letting drop on her lap the screen of plumes 'if there be a lorelei in our lake no wonder from envy she tried to drown you' she said with a smile that cost her a little effort good night sir should you wish to leave us in the morning hubert will see you reach s johann safely and as quickly as can be' 'your goodness overwhelms me' he murmured 'i can never hope to show my gratitude ' 'there is nothing to be grateful for' she said quickly 'and if there were you would have repaid it you have made a spinet silent for centuries speak and speak to our hearts good night sir may you have good rest and a fair journey' when he had bowed himself out and the tapestry of the door had closed behind him she rose and looked at a clock 'it is actually twelve' 'acknowledge at least that he has made the evening pass well' said the princess with a little petulance and much triumph 'he has made it pass admirably' said her niece 'at the same time dear aunt i think it would have been perhaps better if you had not made a friend of a stranger' 'why' said the princess with some asperity 'because i think we can fulfil all the duties of hospitality without doing so and we know nothing of this gentleman' 'he is certainly a gentleman' said the princess with not less asperity 'it seems to me my dear wanda that you are for once in your life if you will pardon me the expression ill natured' the countess wanda smiled a little 'i cannot imagine myself ill natured but i may be so one never knows oneself' 'and ungrateful' added the princess 'when i should like to know have you for years reached twelve o'clock at night without being conscious of it' 'oh he sang beautifully and he played superbly' said her niece still with the same smile balancing her ostrich feathers 'but let him go on his way to morrow you and i cannot entertain strange men even though they give us music like rubenstein's' 'if egon were here ' 'oh poor egon i think he would not like your friend at all they both want to shoot eagles ' 'perhaps he would not like him for another reason' said the princess with a look of mystery 'egon could never make the spinet speak' 'no but who knows perhaps he can take better care of his own soul because he cannot lend one to a spinet' 'you are perverse wanda' 'perverse inhospitable and ill natured i fear i shall carry a heavy burden of sins to father ferdinand in the morning' 'i wish you would not send horses to s johann in the morning we never have anything to amuse us in this solemn solitary place' 'dear aunt one would think you were very indiscreet' 'i wish you were more so' said the pretty old lady with impatience and then her hand made a sign over the cross of emeralds for she knew that she had uttered an unholy wish she kissed her niece with repentant tenderness and went to her own apartments wanda von szalras left alone in her chamber stood awhile thoughtfully beside the fire then she moved away and touched the yellow ivory of the spinet keys 'why could he make them speak' she said to herself 'when everyone else always failed' chapter iv sabran as he undressed himself and laid himself down under the great gold fringed canopy of the stately bed thought 'was i only a clever comedian to night or did my eyes really grow wet as i sang that old song and see her face through a mist as if she and i had met in the old centuries long ago' he stood and looked a moment at his own reflection in the great mirror with the wax candles burning in its sconces he was very pale o sont les neiges d'antan the burden of it ran through his mind almost it seemed to him long ago long ago she had been his lady and he her knight and she had stooped to him and he had died for her then he laughed a little harshly 'i grow that best of all actors' he thought 'an actor who believes in himself' then he turned from the mirror and stretched himself on the great bed with its carved warriors at its foot and its golden crown at its head and its heavy amber tissues shining in the shadows he was a sound sleeper at all times he had slept peacefully on a wreck in a hurricane in a lonely hut on the andes as after a night of play in paris in vienna in monaco he had a nerve of steel and that perfect natural constitution which even excess and dissipation cannot easily impair but this night under the roof of hohenszalras in the guest chamber of hohenszalras he could not summon sleep at his will and he lay long wide awake and restless watching the firelight play on the figures upon the tapestried walls where the lords and ladies of tuscan boccaccio and their sinful loves were portrayed in stately and sombre guise and german costumes of the days of maximilian o sont les neiges d'antan the line of the old romaunt ran through his brain and when towards dawn he did at length fall asleep it was not of hohenszalras that he dreamed but of wide white steppes of a great ice fed rolling river of monotonous pine woods with the gilded domes of a half eastern city rising beyond them in the pale blue air of a northern twilight with the early morning he awoke resolute to get away be the weather what it would as it chanced the skies were heavy still but no rain fell the sun was faintly struggling through the great black masses of cloud the roads might be dangerous but they were not impassable the bridge over the brgenbach might be broken but at least matrey could be reached if it were not possible to go on farther to taxenbach or s johann im wald high north where far away stretched the wild marshes and stony swamps of the pinzgau the pinzgau so beautiful where in its hilly district the grand salzach rolls on its impetuous way beneath deep shade of fir clad hills tracks desolate as a desert of sand or stone the sky was overcast and of an angry tawny colour that brooded ill for the fall of night but the skies were momentarily clear and he desired to rid of his presence the hospitable roof beneath which he was but an alien and unbidden he proposed to leave on foot but of this neither greswold nor the major domo would hear they declared that such an indignity would dishonour the hohenszalrasburg for evermore guests there were masters 'bidden guests perhaps' said sabran reluctantly yielding to be sped on his way by a pair of the strong hungarian horses that he had seen and admired in their stalls he did not venture to disturb the ladies of the castle by a request for a farewell audience at the early hour at which it was necessary he should depart if he wished to try to reach a railway the same evening but he left two notes for them couched in that graceful compliment of which his parisian culture made him an admirable master and took a warm adieu of the good physician with a promise not to forget the orchid of the spirit santo then he breakfasted hastily and left the tapestried chamber in which he had dreamed of the nibelungen queen at the door he drew a ring of great value from his finger and passed it to hubert but the old man thanking him protested he dared not take it 'old as i am in her service' he said 'the countess would dismiss me in an hour if i accepted any gifts from a guest' 'your lady is very severe' said sabran 'it is happy for her she has servitors who subscribe to feudalism if she were in paris ' 'we are bound to obey' said the old man simply 'the countess deals with us most generously and justly we are bound in return to render her obedience' 'all the antique virtues have indeed found refuge here' said sabran but he left the ring behind him lying on a table in the rittersal four instead of two vigorous and half broke horses from the magyar plains bore him away in a light travelling carriage towards the virgenthal the household with herr joachim at their head watching with regret the travelling carriage wind up amongst the woods and disappear on the farther side of the lake he himself looked back with a pang of envy and regret at the stately pile towering towards the clouds with its deep red banner streaming out on the wind that blew from the northern plains 'happy woman' he thought 'happy thrice happy to possess such dominion such riches and such ancestry if i had had them i would have had the world under my foot as well' it was with a sense of pain that he saw the great house disappear behind its screen of mantling woods as his horses climbed the hilly path beyond higher and higher at every step until all that he saw of hohenszalras was a strip of the green lake green as an arum leaf lying far down below bearing on its waters the grey willows of the holy isle 'when i am very old and weary i will come and die there' he thought with a touch of that melancholy which all his irony and cynicism could not dispel from his natural temper there were moments when he felt that he was but a lonely and homeless wanderer on the face of the earth and this was one of those moments as alone he went upon his way along the perilous path cut along the face of precipitous rocks passing over rough bridges that spanned deep defiles and darkening ravines clinging to the side of a mountain as a swallow's nest clings to the wall of a house and running high on swaying galleries above dizzy depths where nameless torrents plunged with noise and foam into impenetrable chasms the road had been made in the fifteenth century by the szalras lords themselves and the engineering of it was bold and vigorous though rude and kept in sound repair though not much changed he had left a small roll of paper lying beside the ring in the knight's hall hubert took them both to his mistress when a few hours later he was admitted to her presence opening the paper she saw a roll of a hundred napoleons and on the paper was written 'there can be no poor where the countess von szalras rules let these be spent in masses for the dead' 'what a delicate and graceful sentiment' said the princess ottilie with vivacity and emotion 'it is prettily expressed and gracefully thought of' her niece admitted 'charmingly admirably' said the princess with a much warmer accent 'there is delicate gratitude there as well as a proper feeling towards a merciful god' 'perhaps' said her niece with a little smile 'the money was won at play in giving someone else what they call a culotte what would you say then dear aunt would it be purified by entering the service of the church' 'i do not know why you are satirical' said the princess 'and i cannot tell either how you can bring yourself to use parisian bad words' 'i will send these to the bishop' said wanda rolling up the gold 'alas alas there are always poor as for the ring hubert give it to herr greswold and he will transmit it to this gentleman's address in paris as though it had been left behind by accident you were so right not to take it but my dear people are always faithful' these few words were dearer and more precious to the honest old man than all the jewels in the world could ever have become but the offer of it and the gift of the gold for the church's use had confirmed the high opinion in which he and the whole household of hohenszalras held the departed guest 'allow at least that this evening will be much duller than last' said the princess with much irritation 'your friend played admirably' said wanda von szalras as she sat at her embroidery frame 'you speak as if he were an itinerant pianist what is your dislike to your fellow creatures when they are of your own rank based upon if he had been a carpet dealer from the defreggerthal as i said before you would have bidden him stay a month' 'dearest aunt be reasonable how was it possible to keep here on a visit a french marquis of whom we know absolutely nothing except from himself' 'i never knew you were prudish' 'i never knew either that i was' said the countess wanda with her serene temper unruffled 'i quite admit your new friend has many attractive qualities on the surface at any rate but if it were possible for me to be angry with you i should be so for bringing him as you did into the library last night' 'you would never have known your spinet could speak if i had not you are very ungrateful and i should not be in the least surprised to find that he was a crown prince or a grand duke travelling incognito' 'we know them all i fear' 'it is strange he should not have his name in the hof kalender beside the sabran pontves' insisted the princess 'he looks prince du sang if ever anyone did so ' 'there is good blood outside your hof kalender dear mother mine' 'certainly' said the princess 'he must surely be a branch of that family though it would be more satisfactory if one found his record there one can never know too much or too certainly of a person whom one admits to friendship' 'friendship is a very strong word' said wanda von szalras with a smile 'this gentleman has only made a hostelry of hohenszalras for a day or two and even that was made against his will but as you are so interested in him meine liebe read this little record i have found' she gave the princess an old leather bound volume of memoirs written and published at lausanne by an obscure noble in his exile in the year she had opened the book at one of the pages that narrated the fates of many nobles of brittany relatives or comrades of the writer 'and foremost amongst these' said this little book 'do i ever and unceasingly regret the loss of my beloved cousin and friend yvon marquis de sabran romaris so beloved was he in his own province that even the convention was afraid to touch him and being poor despite his high descent as his father had ruined his fortunes in play and splendour at the court of louis xv he thought to escape the general proscription and dwell peaceably on his rock bound shores with his young children but the blood madness of the time so grew upon the nation that even the love of his peasantry and his own poverty could not defend him and one black bitter day an armed mob from vannes came over the heath burning all they saw of ricks or homesteads or chteaux or cots that they might warm themselves by those leaping fires and so they came on at last yelling and drunk and furious with torches flaming and pikes blood stained up through the gates of romaris sabran went out to meet them leading his eldest son by the hand a child of eight years old what seek ye he said to them i am as poor as the poorest of you and consciously have done no living creature wrong what do you come for here the calm courage of him and the glance of his eyes which were very beautiful and proud quelled the disordered mouthing blood drunk multitude in a manner and moved them to a sort of reverence so that the leader of them stepping forth said roughly 'citizen we come to slit your throat and burn your house but if you will curse god and the king and cry 'long live the sovereign people' we will leave you alone for you have been the friend of the poor come say it come shout it with both lungs it is not much to ask sabran put his little boy behind him with a tender gesture then kissed the hilt of his sword which he held unsheathed in his hand i sorrow for the people he said since they are misguided and mad but i believe in my god and i love my king and even so shall my children do after me and the words were scarce out of his mouth before a score of pikes ran him through the body and the torches were tossed into his house and he and his perished like so many gallant gentlemen of the time a prey to the blind fury of an ingrate mob' the princess ottilie's tender eyes moistened as she read and she closed the volume reverently as though it were a sacred thing 'i thank you for sending me such a history' she said 'it does one's soul good in these sad bitter days of spiritless selfishness and utter lack of all impersonal devotion this gentleman must then be a descendant of the child named in this narrative' 'the story says that he and his perished' replied her niece 'but i suppose that child or some other younger one escaped the fire and the massacre if ever we see him again we will ask him such a tradition is as good as a page in the almanac de gotha' 'it is' accented the princess 'where did you find it' 'i read those memoirs when i was a child with so many others of that time' answered the countess wanda 'when i heard the name of your new friend it seemed familiar to me and thinking over it i remembered these breton narratives' 'at least you need not have been afraid to dine with him' said the princess ottilie who could never resist having the last word though she felt that the retort was a little ungenerous and perhaps undeserved meantime sabran went on his way through the green valley under the shadow of the klein and the kristallwand with the ice of the great schaltten gletscher descending like a huge frozen torrent when he reached the last stage before matrey he dismissed his postillions with a gratuity as large as the money remaining in his belt would permit and insisted on taking his way on foot over the remaining miles baggage he had none and he had not even the weight of his knapsack and rifle the men remonstrated with him for they were afraid of their lady's anger if they returned when they were still half a german mile off their destination but he was determined and sent them backwards whilst they could yet reach home by daylight the path to matrey passed across pastures and tracts of stony ground he took a little goatherd with him as a guide being unwilling to run the risk of a second misadventure and pressed on his way without delay the sun had come forth from out a watery world of cloud and mist which shrouded from sight all the domes and peaks and walls of ice of the mountain region in which he was once more a wanderer but when the mists had lifted and the sun was shining it was beautiful exceedingly all the grasses were full of the countless wild flowers of the late austrian spring the swollen brooks were blue with mouse ear and the pastures with gentian clumps of daffodils blossomed in all the mossy nooks and hyacinths purpled the pine woods on the upper slopes the rain fog still hung heavily but the sun rays pierced it here and there and the white vaporous atmosphere was full of fantastic suggestions and weird half seen shapes as pine trees loomed out of the mist or a vast black mass of rock towered above the clouds a love of nature of out of door movement of healthful exercise and sports resisted in him the enervating influences of the paris life which he had led he had always left the gay world at intervals for the simple and rude pleasures of the mountaineer and the hunter there was an impulse towards that forest freedom which at times mastered him and made the routine of worldly dissipation and diversion wholly intolerable to him it was what his fair critic of paris had called his barbarism which broke up out of the artificial restraints and habits imposed by the world his wakeful night had made him fanciful and his departure from hohenszalras had made him regretful for he on his way back to paris and all his habits and associates and pleasures looking around him on the calm white mountain sides and penetrated by the pure austere mountain silence suddenly felt an intense desire to stay amidst that stillness and that solitude and rest here in the green heart of the tauern 'who knows but one might see her again' he thought as the sound of the fall of the gschlossbach came on his ear from the distance that stately figure seated by the great wood fire with the light on her velvet skirts and the pearls at her throat and the hounds lying couched beside her was always before his memory and his vision and he paid and dismissed his goatherd at the humble door of the zum rautter in windisch matrey and that evening began discussing with christ rangediner and egger the guides there the ascent of the kahralpe and the lasrling and the pass to krimml over the ice crests of the venediger group a mountaineer who had dwelt beneath the shadow of orizaba was not common in the heart of the tauern and the men made much of their new comrade not the less because the gold pieces rattled in his pouch and the hunting watch he earned had jewels at its back 'if anyone had told me that in the mois de marie i should bury myself under an austrian glacier' he thought with some wonder at his own decision for he was one of those foster sons of paris to whom parisine is an habitual and necessary intoxication but there comes a time when even parisine like chloral ceases to have power to charm in a vague way he had often felt the folly and the hollowness of the life that turned night into day made the green cloth of the gaming table the sole field of battle and offered as all form of love the purchased smile of the belle petite a sense of repose and of freshness like the breath of a cool morning blowing on tired eyes came to him as he sat in the grey twilight amidst the green landscape with the night coming down upon the eternal snows above whilst the honest simple souls around him talked of hill perils and mountaineers' adventures and all the exploits of a hardy life and in the stillness when their voices ceased there was no sound but the sound of water up above amidst the woods tumbling and rippling in a hundred unseen brooks and falls 'if they had let me alone' he thought 'i should have been a hunter all my days a guide perhaps like this christ and this egger here an honest man at least ' his heart was heavy and his conscience ill at ease the grand serene glance of wanda von szalras seemed to have reached his soul and called up in him unavailing regrets pangs of doubt long dormant vague remorse long put to sleep with the opiate of the world taught cynicism which had become his second nature the most impenetrable cynicism will yield and melt and seem but a poor armour when it is brought amidst the solemnity and solitude of the high hills chapter v a few days later there arrived by post the 'spirit santo' of mexico addressed to the professor joachim greswold if he had received the order of the saint esprit he would not have been more honoured more enchanted and he was deeply touched by the remembrance of him testified by the gift whose donor he supposed was back in the gay world of men not knowing the spell which the snow mountains of the tauern had cast on a worldly soul when he was admitted to the presence of the princess ottilie to consult with her on her various ailments she conversed with him of this passer by who had so fascinated her fancy and she even went so far as to permit him to bring her the great volumes of the mexico out of the library and point her out those chapters which he considered most likely to interest her 'it is the work of a true catholic and gentleman' she said with satisfaction and perused with special commendation the passages which treated of the noble conduct of the catholic priesthood in those regions their frequent martyrdom and their devoted self negation when she had thoroughly identified their late guest with the editor of these goodly and blameless volumes she was content to declare that better credentials no man could bear indeed she talked so continually of this single point of interest in her monotonous routine of life that her niece said to her with a jest that was more than half earnest 'dearest mother almost you make me regret that this gentleman did not break his neck over the engelhorn or sink with his rifle in the szalrassee' 'the spinet would never have spoken' said the princess 'and i am surprised that a christian woman can say such things even in joke' the weather cleared the sun shone the gardens began to grow gorgeous and great parterres of roses glowed between the emerald of the velvet lawns an austrian garden has not a long life but it has a very brilliant one all on a sudden as the rains ceased every alley group and terrace were filled with every variety of blossom and the flora of africa and india was planted out side by side with the gentians and the alpine roses natural to the soil all the northern conifer spread the deep green of their branches above the turf and the larch the birch the beech and the oak were massed in clusters or spread away in long avenues deep defiles of foliage through which the water of the lake far down below glistened like a jewel 'if your friend had been a fortnight later he would have seen hohenszalras in all its beauty' said its mistress once to the princess ottilie 'it has two seasons of perfection one its midsummer flowering and the other when all the world is frozen round it' the princess shivered in retrospect and in anticipation she hated winter 'i should never live through another winter' she said with a sigh 'then you shall not be tried by one we will go elsewhere' said wanda to whom the ice bound world the absolute silence the sense of the sleigh flying over the hard snow the perfect purity of the rarefied air of night and day made up the most welcome season of the year 'i suppose it is dull for you' she added indulgently 'i have so many occupations in the winter a pair of skates and a sleigh are to me of all forms of motion the most delightful but you shut up in your blue room do no doubt find our winter hard and long' 'i hybernate i do not live' said the princess pettishly 'it is not even as if the house were full' 'with ill assorted guests whose cumbersome weariness one would have to try all day long to dissipate oh my dear aunt of all wearisome corves the world holds there is nothing so bad as a house party even when egon is here to lead the cotillion and the hunting' 'you are very inhospitable' 'that is the third time lately you have made that charge against me i begin to fear that i must deserve it' 'you deserve it certainly oh you are hospitable to the poor you set pedlars or mule drivers or travelling clockmakers by the dozen round your hall fires and you would feed a pilgrimage all the winter long but to your own order to your own society you are inhospitable in your mother's time the schloss had two hundred guests for the autumn parties and then the winter season from carnival to easter was always spent in the capital' 'she liked that i suppose' 'of course she liked it everyone ought to like it at what was her age then and what is yours now' 'i like this' said the countess wanda to change the subject as the servants set a little japanese tea table and two arm chairs of gilt osier work under one of the siberian pines whose boughs spread tent like over the grass on which the dogs were already stretched in anticipation of sugar and cakes from this lawn there were seen only the old keep of the burg and the turrets and towers of the rest of the building ivy clambered over one half of the great stone pile that had been raised with hewn rock in the ninth century and some arolla pines grew about it a low terrace with low broad steps separated it from the gardens a balustrade of stone ivy mantled protected the gardens from the rocks while these plunged in a perpendicular descent of a hundred feet into the lake some black yews and oaks very large and old grew against the low stone pillars it was a favourite spot with the mistress of hohenszalras it looked westward and beyond the masses of the vast forests there shone the snow summit of the venediger and the fantastic peaks of the klein and kristallwand whilst on a still day there could be heard a low sound which she familiar with it knew came from the thunder of the subterranean torrents filling the szalrassee 'oh it is very nice' said the princess a little deprecatingly 'and of course i at my years want nothing better than a gilt chair in the sunshine but then there is so very little sunshine the chair must generally stand by the stove and i confess that i think it would be fitter for your years and your rank if these chairs were multiplied by ten or twenty and if there were some pretty people laughing and talking and playing games in those great gardens' 'it is glorious weather now' said her niece who would not assent and did not desire to dispute 'yes' interrupted the princess 'but it will rain to morrow you know we never have two fine days together' 'we will take it while we have it and be thankful' said wanda with a good humour that refused to be ruffled 'here is hubert coming out to us what can he want he looks very startled and alarmed' the old major domo's face was indeed gravely troubled as he bowed before his lady 'pardon me the intrusion my countess' he said hurriedly 'but i thought it right to inform you myself that a lad has come over from steiner's inn to say that the foreign gentleman who was here fifteen days ago has had an accident on the umbal glacier it seems he stayed on in matrey for sake of the climbing and the shooting i do not make out from the boy what the accident was but the umbal is very dangerous at this season the gentleman lies now at pregratten you know my ladies what a very wretched place that is' 'i suppose they have come for the herr professor' said wanda vaguely disturbed while the princess very sorrowfully was putting a score of irrelevant questions which hubert could not answer 'no doubt he has no doctor there and these people send for that reason' said wanda interrupting with an apology for the useless interrogations 'get horses ready directly and send for greswold at once wherever he may be but it is a long bad way to pregratten i do not see how he can return under twenty four hours' 'let him stay two nights if he be wanted' said the princess to whom she spoke she had always insisted that the physician should never be an hour out of hohenszalras whilst she was in it 'your friend has been trying to shoot a kuttengeier again i suppose' said her niece with a smile 'he is very adventurous' 'and you are very heartless' wanda did not deny the charge but she went into the house saw the doctor and requested him to take everything with him of linen wines food or cordials that might possibly be wanted 'and stay as long as you are required' she added 'and send mules over to us for anything you wish for do not think of us if my dear aunt should ail anything i can dispatch a messenger to you or call a physician from salzburg' herr joachim said a very few words thanked her gratefully and took his departure behind two sure footed mountain cobs that could climb almost like chamois 'i think one of the fathers should have gone too' said mme ottilie regretfully 'i hope he is not in extremis' said her niece 'and i fear if he were he would hardly care for spiritual assistance' 'you are so prejudiced against him wanda' 'i do not think i am ever prejudiced' said the countess von szalras 'that is so like a prejudiced person' said the princess triumphantly for twenty four hours they heard nothing from pregratten which is in itself a miserable little hamlet lying amidst some of the grandest scenes that the earth holds towards evening the next day a lad of the village came on a mule and brought a letter to his ladies from the herr professor who wrote that the accident had been due as usual to the gentleman's own carelessness and to the fact of the snow being melted by the midsummer sun until it was a thin crust over a deep crevasse he had found his patient suffering from severe contusions high fever lethargy and neuralgic pains but he did not as yet consider there were seriously dangerous symptoms he begged permission to remain and requested certain things to be sent to him from his medicine chests and the kitchens the boy slept at hohenszalras that night and in the morning returned over the hills to pregratten with all the doctor had asked for wanda selected the medicines herself and sent also some fruit and wine for which he did not ask the princess sent a bone of s ottilie in an ivory case and the assurance of her constant prayers she was sincerely anxious and troubled 'such a charming person and so handsome' she said again and again 'i suppose the priest of pregratten is with him' her niece did not remind her that her physician did not greatly love any priests whatever though on that subject he was always discreetly mute at hohenszalras for the next ten days greswold stayed at pregratten and the princess bore his absence since it was to serve a person who had had the good fortune to fascinate her and whom also she chose to uphold because her niece was as she considered unjust to him moreover life at the burg was very dull to the princess whatever it might be to its chtelaine who had so much interest in its farms its schools its mountains and its villages an interest which to her great aunt seemed quite out of place as all those questions she considered should belong to the priesthood and the stewards who ought not to be disturbed in their direction the one of spiritual and the other of agricultural matters this break in the monotony of her time was agreeable to her of the bulletins from pregratten of the dispatch of all that was wanted of the additional pleasure of complaining that she was deprived of her doctor's counsels and also of feeling at the same time that in enduring this deprivation she was doing a charitable and self denying action she further insisted on sending out to steiner's inn greatly to his own discomfort her own confessor 'nobles of brittany have always deep religious feeling' she said to her niece 'and father ferdinand has such skill and persuasion with the dying' 'but no one is dying' said wanda a little impatiently 'that is more than any human being can tell' said the princess piously 'at all events father ferdinand always uses every occasion judiciously and well' father ferdinand however was not very comfortable in pregratten and soon returned much jolted and worn by the transit on a hill pony he was reserved about his visitation and told his patroness sadly that he had been unable to effect much spiritual good but that the stranger was certainly recovering from his hurts and had the ivory case of s ottilie on his pillow he had seemed averse however to confession and therefore of course there had been no possibility for administration of the sacrament the princess was inclined to set this rebelliousness down to the fault of the physician and determined to talk seriously to greswold on spiritual belief as soon as he should return 'if he be not orthodox we cannot keep him' she said severely 'he is orthodox dear aunt' said wanda von szalras with a smile 'he adores the wonders of every tiny blossom that blows and every little moss that clothes the rocks' 'what a profane almost sacrilegious answer' said the princess 'i never should have imagined that you would have jested on sacred themes' 'i did not intend a jest i was never more serious a life like our old professor's is a perpetual prayer' 'your great aunt walburga belonged to the perpetual adoration' rejoined the princess who only heard the last word but one 'the order was very severe i always think it too great a strain on finite human powers she was betrothed to the margraf paul but he was killed at austerlitz and she took refuge in a life of devotion i always used to think that you would change hohenszalras into a sacred foundation but now i am afraid you are a deeply religious woman wanda at least i have always thought so but you read too much german and french philosophy and i fear it takes something from your fervour from your entirety of devotion you have a certain liberty of expression that alarms me at times' 'i think it is a poor faith that dares not examine its adversaries' charges' said her niece quietly 'you would have faith blindfolded they call me a bigot at the court however so you see it is hard to please all' 'bigot is not a word for a christian and catholic sovereign to employ' said the princess severely 'her majesty must know that there can never be too great an excess in faith and service' on the eleventh day greswold returned over the hills and was admitted to immediate audience with his ladies 'herr von sabran is well enough for me to leave him' he said after his first very humble salutations 'but if your excellencies permit it would be desirable for me to return there in a day or two yes my ladies he is lying at steiner's inn in pregratten a poor place enough but your goodness supplied much that was lacking in comfort he can be moved before long there was never any great danger but it was a very bad accident he is a good mountaineer it seems and he had been climbing a vast deal in the venediger group that morning he meant to cross the umbal glacier to the ahrenthal and he refused to take a guide so isaiah steiner tells me' 'but i thought he left here to go to paris' 'he did so my countess' answered the doctor 'but it seems he loves the mountains and their spell fell on him when he sent back your postillions he went on foot to matrey and there he remained he thought the weather advanced enough to make climbing safe but it is a dangerous pastime so early in summer though christ from matrey who came over to see him tells me he is of the first form as a mountaineer he reached the clarahutte safely and broke his fast there crossing the umbal the ice gave way and he fell into a deep crevasse he would be a dead man if a hunter on the welitz side had not seen him disappear and given the alarm at the hut with ropes and men enough they contrived to haul him up after some hours from a great depth these accidents are very common and he has to thank his own folly in going out on to the glacier unaccompanied of course he was insensible contused and in high fever when i reached there the surgeon they had called from lienz was an ignorant who would soon have sent him for ever to as great a deep as the crevasse he is very grateful to you both my ladies and would be more so were he not so angry with himself that it makes him sullen with the world men of his kind bear isolation and confinement ill steiner's is a dull place there is nothing to hear but the tolling of the church bell and the fret of the isel waters' 'that means my friend that you want him moved as soon as he can bear it' said wanda 'i think he cannot very well come here we know nothing of him but there is no reason why you should not bring him to the lake monastery there is a good guest chamber the archbishop stayed there once and he could have your constant care there and from here every comfort' 'why should he not be brought to this house' interrupted mme ottilie 'there are fifty men in it already ' 'servants and priests no strangers beside this gentleman will be much more at his ease on the holy isle where he can recompense the monks at his pleasure he would feel infinitely annoyed to be further burdened with a hospitality he never asked' 'of course it is as you please' said the princess a little irritably 'dear aunt when he is on the island you can send him all the luxuries and all the holy books you may think good for him go over to the monks if you will be so kind herr joachim and prepare them for a sick guest and as for transport and all the rest of the assistance you may need use the horses and the household as you see fit i give you carte blanche i know your wisdom and your prudence and your charity' the physician again returned to pregratten where he found his patient fretting with restless impatience at his enforced imprisonment he had a difficulty in persuading sabran to go back to that szalrassee which had cost him so dear but when he was assured that he could pay the monks what he chose for their hospitality he at last consented to be taken to the island 'i shall see her again' he thought with a little anger at himself the mountain spirits had their own way of granting wishes but they had granted his on the holy isle of the szalrassee there was a small dominican congregation never more than twelve of men chiefly peasant born and at this time all advanced in years the monastery was a low grey pile almost hidden beneath the great willows and larches of the isle but rich within from many centuries of gifts in art from the piety of the lords of szaravola it had two guest chambers for male visitors which were lofty and hung with tapestry and which looked down the lake towards the north and west to where beyond the length of water there rose the mighty forest hills washed by the salzach and the ache backed by the distant rhtian alps the island was almost in the centre of the lake and at a distance of three miles the rocks on which the castle stood faced it across the water that rippled around it and splashed its trees and banks it was a refuge chosen in wild and rough times when repose was precious and no spot on earth was ever calmer quieter more secluded than this where the fishermen never landed without asking a blessing of those who dwelt there and nothing divided the hours except the bells that called to prayer or frugal food the green willows and the green waters met and blended and covered up this house of peace as a warbler's nest is hidden in the reeds a stranger resting place had never befallen the world tossed restless imperious and dissatisfied spirit of the man who was brought there by careful hands lying on a litter on a raft one gorgeous evening of a summer's day one month after he had lifted his rifle to bring down the kuttengeier in the woods of wanda von szalras 'almost thou makest me believe' he murmured when he lay and looked upward at the cross that shone against the evening skies while the raft glided slowly over the water and from the walled retreat upon the isle there came the low sound of the monks chanting their evensong they laid him down on a low broad bed opposite a window of three bays which let him look from his couch along the shining length of the szalrassee towards the great burg where it frowned upon its wooded cliffs with the stone brows of many mountains towering behind it and behind them the glaciers of the glckner and its lesser comrades the sun had just then set there was a lingering glow upon the water a slender moon had risen above a distant chain of pine clothed hills the slow soft twilight of the german alps was bathing the grandeur of the scene with tenderest faintest colours and mists ethereal the ave maria was ringing from the chapel and presently the deep bells of the monastery chimed a laus deus 'do you believe in fate' said sabran abruptly to his companion greswold the old physician gave a little gesture of doubt 'sometimes there seems something stronger than ourselves and our will but maybe it is only our own weakness that has risen up and stands in another shape like a giant before us as our shadow will do on a glacier in certain seasons and states of the atmosphere' 'perhaps that is all' said sabran but he laid his head back on his pillow with a deep breath that had in it an equal share of contentment and regret and lay still looking eastward while the peaceful night came down upon land and water unbroken by any sound except that of a gentle wind stirring amidst the willows or the plunge of an otter in the lake that deep stillness was strange to him who had lived so long in all the gayest cities of the world but it was welcome it seemed like a silent blessing his life seemed to stand still while holy men prayed for him and the ramparts of the mountains shut out the mad and headlong world with these fancies he fell asleep and dreamed of pathless steppes which in the winter snows were so vast and vague stretching away away away to the frozen sea and the ice that no suns can melt and ceaseless silence where sleep is death in the monastic quiet of the isle he soon recovered sufficient strength to leave his bed and move about slowly though he was still stiff and sprained from the fall on the umbal he could take his dinner in the refectory could get out and sit under the great willows of the bank and could touch their organ as the monks never had heard it played it was a monotonous and perfectly simple life but either because his health was not yet strong or because he had been surfeited with excitement it was not disagreeable or irksome to him he bore it with a serenity and cheerfulness which the monks attributed to religious patience and herr joachim to philosophy it was not one nor the other it was partly from such willingness as an overtaxed racer feels to lie down in the repose of the stall for a while to recruit his courage and speed it was partly due to the certainty which he felt that now sooner or later he must see face to face once more the woman who had forbade him to shoot the vulture the face which had looked on him in the pale sunlight of the pine woods and made him think of the nibelungen queen had been always present to his thoughts even during the semi stupor of sedative lulled rest in his dull chamber by the lonely isel stream from this guest room where he passed his convalescence the wide casements all day long showed him the towers and turrets the metal roofs the pinnacles and spires of her mighty home backed by its solemn neighbours of the glacier and the alps and girdled with the sombre green of the great forests once or twice he thought as he looked at it and saw the noon sun make its countless oriels sparkle like diamonds or the starlight change its stones and marbles into dream like edifices meet for arthur's own avilion once or twice he thought to himself 'if i owned hohenszalras and she romaris i would write to her and say a moment is enough for love to be born' but romaris was his those aged oaks torn by sea winds and splashed with atlantic spray were all he had and she was mistress here when a young man made his first appearance in the society of paris who was called rn philippe xavier marquis de sabran romaris his personal appearance which was singularly attractive his manners which were of extreme distinction and his talents which were great made him at once successful in its highest society he had a romantic history the son of that marquis de sabran who had fallen under the pikes of the mob of carrier had been taken in secret out of the country by a faithful servant smuggled on board a chasse mare which had carried him to an outward bound sailing ship destined for the seaboard of america the chaplain was devoted the servant faithful the boy was brought up well at a jesuit college in mexico and placed in full possession when he reached manhood of his family papers and of such remnants of the family jewels as had been brought away with him his identity as his father's only living son and the sole representative of the sabrans of romaris was fully established and confirmed before the french consulate of the city instead of returning to his country as his jesuit tutors advised and desired the youth when he left college gave the reins to a spirit of adventure and a passion for archology and natural history he was possessed beyond all with the desire to penetrate the mystery of the buried cities and he had conceived a strong attachment to the flowery and romantic land of guatemozin and of montezuma he plunged therefore into the interior of that country and half as a jesuit lay missionary and half as an archeological explorer let all his best years slip away under the twilight shadows of the virgin forests and amidst the flowering wilderness of the banks of the great rivers making endless notes upon the ancient and natural history of these solitudes and gathering together an interminable store of tradition from the indians and the half breeds with whom he grew familiar he went further and further away from the cities and let longer and longer intervals elapse without his old friends and teachers hearing anything of him all that was known of him was that he had married a beautiful mexican woman who was said to have in her the blood of the old royal race and that he lived far from the steps of white men in the depths of the hills whence the pacific was in sight once he went to the capital for the purpose of registering and baptizing his son by his mexican wife after that he was lost sight of by those who cared for him and it was only known that he was compiling a history of those lost nations whose temples and tombs amidst the wilderness had so powerfully attracted his interest as a boy a quarter of a century passed his old friends died away one by one nobody remained in the country who remembered or asked for him the west is wide and wild and silent endless wars and revolutions changed the surface of the country and the thoughts of men the scholarly marquis de sabran who only cared for a hieroglyphic or an orchid or a piece of archaic sculpture passed away from the memories of the white men whose fellow student he had been the land was soaked in blood the treasures were given up to adventurers the chiefs that each reigned their little hour slew and robbed and burned and fell in their turn shot like vultures or stabbed like sheep and no one in that murderous tohu bohu had either time or patience to give to the thought of a student of perished altars and of swamp flora the college even where the jesuits had sheltered him had been sacked and set on fire and the old men and the young men butchered indiscriminately when six and twenty years later he returned to the capital to register the birth of his grandson there was no one who remembered his name another quarter of a century passed by and when his young representative left the western world for paris he received a tender and ardent welcome from men and women to whom his name was still a talisman and found a cordial recognition from that old nobility whose pride is so cautious and impregnable in its isolation and reserve everyone knew that the young marquis de sabran was the legitimate representative of the old race that had made its nest on the rocks with the sea birds through a dozen centuries that he had but little wealth was rather to his credit than against it when he gave to the world in his grandfather's name the result of all those long years of study and of solitude in the heart of the mexican forests he carried out the task as only a scientific scholar could have done it and the vast undigested mass of record tradition and observation which the elder man had collected together in his many years of observation and abstraction were edited and arranged with so much skill that their mere preparation placed their young compiler in the front frank of culture that he disclaimed all merit of his own affirming that he had simply put together into shape all the scattered memoranda of the elder scholar did not detract from the learning or from the value of his annotations the volumes became the first authority on the ancient history and the natural history of a strange country of which alike the past and the present were of rare interest and their production made his name known where neither rank nor grace would have taken it to those who congratulated him on the execution of so complicated and learned a work he only replied 'it is no merit of mine all the learning is his in giving it to the world i do but pay my debt to him and i am but a mere instrument of his as the printing press is that prints it' this modesty this affectionate loyalty in a young man whose attributes seemed rather to lie on the side of arrogance of disdainfulness and of coldness attracted to him the regard of many persons to whom the mere idler which he soon became would have been utterly indifferent he chose as such persons thought most unfortunately to let his intellectual powers lie in abeyance but he had shown that he possessed them no one without large stores of learning and a great variety of attainments could have edited and annotated as he had done the manuscripts bequeathed to him by the marquis xavier as his most precious legacy he might have occupied a prominent place in the world of science but he was too indolent or too sceptical even of natural facts or too swayed towards the pleasures of manhood to care for continued consecration of his life to studies of which he was early a master and it was the only serious work that he ever carried out or seemed likely ever to attempt gradually these severe studies were left further and further behind him but they had given him a certain place that no future carelessness could entirely forfeit he grew to prefer to hear a bluette d'amateur praised at the mirliton to be more flattered when his presence was prayed for at a premire of the franaise but it had carried his name wherever in remote corners of the earth two or three wise men were gathered together he had no possessions in france to entail any obligations upon him the single tower of the manoir which the flames had left untouched and an acre or two of barren shore were all which the documents of the sabrans enabled him to claim the people of the department were indeed ready to adore him for the sake of the name he bore but he had the true parisian's impatience of the province and the hamlet of romaris but rarely saw his face the sombre seaboard with its primitive people its wintry storms its monotonous country its sad hard pious ways of life had nothing to attract a man who loved the gaslights of the champs lyses women loved him for that union of coldness and of romance which always most allures them and men felt a certain charm of unused power in him which coupled with his great courage and his skill at all games fascinated them often against their judgment he was a much weaker man than they thought him but none of either sex ever discovered it perhaps he was also a better man than he himself believed as he dwelt in the calm of this religious community his sins seemed to him many and beyond the reach of pardon yet even with remorse and a sense of shame in the background this tranquil life did him good the simple fare the absence of excitement the silent lake dwelling where no sound came except that of the bells or the organ or the voices of fishermen on the waters the 'early to bed and early to rise' which were the daily laws of the monastic life these soothed refreshed and ennobled his life chapter vi the days drifted by the little boat crossed thrice a day from castle to monastery bringing the physician bringing books food fruit wine the rain came often sheets of white water sweeping over the lake and blotting the burg and the hills and the forests from sight the sunshine came more rarely but when it came it lit up the amphitheatre of the glckner group to a supreme splendour of solemn darkness of massed pines of snow peaks shrouded in the clouds so the month wore away he was in no haste to recover entirely he could pay the monks for his maintenance and so felt free to stay not being allowed to know that his food came from the castle as his books did the simple priests were conquered and captivated by him he played grand sistine masses for them and canticles which he had listened to in ntre dame herr joachim marvelled to see him so passive and easily satisfied for he perceived that his patient could not be by nature either very tranquil or quickly content but the doctor thought that perhaps the severe nervous shock of the descent on the umbal might have shakened and weakened him and knew that the pure alpine air the harmless pursuits and the early hours were the best tonics and restoratives in the pharmacy of nature therefore he could consistently encourage him to stay as his own wishes moved him to do for to the professor the companionship and discussion of a scholarly and cultivated man were rarities and he had conceived an affectionate interest in one whose life he had in some measure saved for without skilled care the crevasse of the iselthal might have been fatal to a mountaineer who had successfully climbed the highest peaks of the andes 'no doubt if i passed a year here' thought sabran 'i should rebel and grow sick with longing for the old unrest the old tumult the old intoxication no doubt but just now it is very welcome it makes me comprehend why de rancy created la trappe why so many soldiers and princes and riotous livers were glad to go out into a paraclete amongst the hills with s bruno or s bernard' he said something of the sort to herr joachim who nodded consent but added 'only they took a great belief with them and a great penitence the recluses of that time in ours men mistake satiety for sorrow and so when their tired vices have had time to grow again like nettles that have been gnawed to the root but can spring up with fresh power to sting then as their penitence was nothing but fatigue they get quickly impatient to go out and become beasts again all the difference between our times and s bruno's lies there they believed in sin we do not i say we i mean the voluptuaries and idlers of your world' 'perhaps not' answered sabran a little gloomily 'but we do believe in dishonour' 'do you' said the doctor with some irony 'oh i suppose you do you may seduce gretchen you must not forsake faustine you must not lie to a man you may lie to a woman you must not steal you may beggar your friend at baccara i confess i have never understood the confusion of your unwritten laws on ethics and etiquette' sabran laughed but he did not take up the argument and the doctor thought that he seemed becoming a little morose since his escape from the tedium of confinement at pregratten confinement intolerable to a man of strength and spirit he had always found his patient of great equability of temper and of a good humour and docility that had seemed as charming as they were invariable when he was recovered enough to make movement and change harmless to him there came to him a note in the fine and miniature writing of the princess ottilie bidding him come over to the castle at his pleasure and especially inviting him in her niece's name to the noon day breakfast at the castle on the following day if his strength allowed he sat a quarter of an hour or more with the note on his knee looking out at the light green willow foliage as it drooped above the deeper green of the lake 'our ladies are not used to refusals' said the doctor seeing his hesitation 'i should be a churl to refuse' said sabran with some little effort which the doctor attributed to a remembered mortification and so hastened to say 'you are resentful still that the countess wanda took your rifle away surely she has made amends' 'i was not thinking of that she was perfectly right she only treated me too well she placed her house and her household at my disposition with a hospitality quite spanish i owe her too much ever to be able to express my sense of it' 'then you will come and tell her so' 'i can do no less' princess ottilie and the mistress of hohenszalras had had a discussion before that note of invitation was sent a discussion which had ended as usual in the stronger reasoner giving way to the whim and will of the weaker 'why should we not be kind to him' the princess had urged 'he is a gentleman you know i took the precaution to write to kaulnitz kaulnitz's answer is clear enough and to frohsdorf from which it was equally satisfactory i wrote also to the comte de la bare his reply was everything which could be desired' 'no doubt' her niece had answered for the twentieth time 'but i think we have already done enough for christianity and hospitality we need not offer him our personal friendship as there is no master in this house he will not expect to be invited to it' we will wish him god speed when he is fully restored and is going away' 'you are really too prudish' said the princess very angrily 'i should be the last person to counsel an imprudence a failure in due caution in correct reserve and hesitation but for you to pretend that a countess von szalras cannot venture to invite a person to her own residence because that person is of the opposite sex ' 'that is not the question the root of the matter is that he is a chance acquaintance made quite informally we should have been cruel if we had done less than we have done but there can be no need that we should do more' 'i can ask more about him of kaulnitz' said madame ottilie kaulnitz was one of her innumerable cousins and was then minister in paris 'why should you' said her niece 'do you think either that it is quite honourable to make inquiries unknown to people it always savours to me too much of the third section' 'you are so exaggerated in all your scruples you prefer to be suspicious of a person in silence than to ask a few questions' said the princess 'but surely when two ambassadors and the kaiser guarantee his position you may be content' the answer she had received from kaulnitz had indeed only moderately satisfied her it said that there was nothing known to the detriment of the marquis de sabran that he had never been accused of anything unfitting his rank and name but that he was a viveur and was said to be very successful at play he was not known to have any debts but he was believed to be poor and of precarious fortunes on the whole the princess had decided to keep the answer to herself she had remembered with irritation that her niece had suggested baccara as the source of the hundred gold pieces 'i never intended to convey that ambassadors would disown him or the kaiser either whose signature is in his pocket book only' said wanda 'as you and i are all alone surely it will be as well to leave this gentleman to the monks and to greswold that is all i mean' 'it is a perfectly unnecessary scruple and not at all like one of your race the szalras have always been hospitable and headstrong' 'i hope i am the first i have done my best for m de sabran as for being headstrong surely that is not a sweet or wise quality that you should lament my loss of it' 'you need not quarrel with me'said the princess pettishly 'you have a terrible habit of contradiction wanda and you never give up your opinion' the mistress of hohenszalras smiled and sighed a little 'dear mother we will do anything that amuses you' so the note was sent the princess had been always eager for such glimpses of the moving world as had been allowed to her by any accidental change her temperament would have led her to find happiness in the frivolous froth and fume of a worldly existence she delighted in gossip in innocent gaiety in curiosity in wonder all her early years had been passed under repression and constraint and now in her old age she was as eager as a child for any plaything as inquisitive as a marmoset as animated as a squirrel her mother had been a daughter of a great french family of the south and much of the vivacity and sportive malice and quick temper of the gallic blood was in her still beneath the primness and the placidity that had become her habit from long years passed in a little german court and in a stately semi religious order this stranger whom chance had brought to them was to her idea a precious and providential source of excitement already a hundred romances had suggested themselves to her fertile mind already a hundred impossibilities had suggested themselves to her as probable she did not in the least believe that accident had brought him there she imagined that he had wandered there for the sake of seeing the mistress of hohenszalras who had for so long been unseen by the world but whose personal graces and great fortune had remained in the memories of many to the romantic fancy of the princess which had never been blunted by contact with harsh facts nothing seemed prettier or more probable than that the french marquis when arrested as a poacher had been upon a pilgrimage of poetic adventure it should not be her fault she resolved if the wounded knight had to go away in sorrow and silence without the castle gates being swung open once at least 'after all if she would only take an interest in anything human' she thought 'instead of always horses and mountains and philosophical treatises and councils and calculations with the stewards she ought not to live and die alone they made me vow to do so and perhaps it was for the best but i would never say to anyone do likewise' and then the princess felt the warm tears on her own cheeks thinking of herself as she had been at seventeen pacing up and down the stiff straight alley of clipped trees at lilienhhe with a bright young soldier who had fallen in a duel ere he was twenty it was all so long ago so long ago and she was a true submissive daughter of her princely house and of her holy church yet she knew that it was not meet for a woman to live and die without a man's heart to beat by her own without a child's hands to close her glazing eyes and wanda von szalras wished so to live and so to die only one magician could change her why should he not come so on the morrow the little boat that had brought the physician to him so often took him over the two miles of water to the landing stairs at the foot of the castle rock in a little while he stood in the presence of his chtelaine he was a man who never in his life had been confused unnerved or at a loss for words yet now he felt as a boy might have done as a rustic might he had a mist before his eyes his heart beat quickly he grew very pale she thought he was still suffering and looked at him with interest 'i am afraid that we did wrong to tempt you from the monastery' she said in her grave melodious voice and she stretched out her hand to him with a look of sympathy i am afraid you are still suffering and weak are you not' he bent low as he touched it 'how can i thank you' he murmured 'you have treated a vagrant like a king' 'you were a munificent vagrant to our chapel and our poor' she replied with a smile and what have we done for you nothing more than is our commonest duty far removed from cities or even villages as we are are you really recovered i may tell you now that there was a moment when herr greswold was alarmed for you' the princess ottilie entered at that moment and welcomed him with more effusion and congratulation they breakfasted in a chamber called the saxe room an oval room lined throughout with lacquered white wood in the louis seize style the panels were painted in watteau like designs it had been decorated by a french artist in the middle of the eighteenth century and with its hangings of flowered white satin and its collection of meissen china figures and its great window which looked over a small garden with velvet grass plots and huge yews was the place of all others to make an early morning meal most agreeable whether in summer when the casements were open to the old fashioned roses that climbed about them or in winter when on the open hearth great oak logs burned beneath the carved white wood mantelpiece gay with its plaques of saxe and its garlands of foliage the little oval table bore a service of old meissen with tiny watteau figures painted on a ground of palest rose watteau figures of the same royal china upheld great shells filled with the late violets of the woods of hohenszalras 'what an enchanting little room' said sabran glancing round it and appreciating with the eyes of a connoisseur the lancret designs the riesiner cabinets and the old china he was as well versed in the art and lore of the beau sicle as arsne houssaye or the goncourts he talked now of the epoch with skill and grace with that accuracy of knowledge and that fineness of criticism which had made his observations and his approval treasured and sought for by the artists and the art patrons of paris the day was grey and mild the casements were open the fresh pure fragrance of the forests came in through the aromatic warmth of the chamber the little gay shepherds and shepherdesses seemed to breathe and laugh 'this room was a caprice of an ancestress of mine who was of your country and was i am afraid very wretched here' said wanda von szalras 'she brought her taste from marly and versailles it is not the finest or the purest taste but it has a grace and elegance of its own that is very charming as a change' 'it is a madrigal in porcelain' he said looking around him 'i am glad that the alouette gauloise has sung here beside the dread and majestic austrian vulture' 'the alouette gauloise always sings in aunt ottilie's heart it is what keeps her so young always i assure you she is a great deal younger than i am' said his chtelaine resting a glance of tender affection on the pretty figure of the princess caressing her spitz dog bijou she herself with her great pearls about her throat and a gown of white serge looked a stately and almost severe figure beside the dainty picturesque prettiness of the elder lady and the fantastic gaiety and gilding of the porcelain and the paintings he felt a certain awe of her a certain hesitation before her which the habits of the world enabled him to conceal but which moved him with a sense of timidity novel and almost painful 'one ought to be dorat and marmontel to be worthy of such a repast' he said as he seated himself between his hostesses 'neither dorat nor marmontel would have enjoyed your very terrible adventure' said the princess reflecting with satisfaction that it was herself who had saved this charming and chivalrous life since at her own risk and loss she had sent her physicians alike of body and of soul to wrestle for him with death by his sick bed at pregratten 'wanda would never have sent anyone to him' thought the princess 'she is so unaccountably indifferent to any human life higher than her peasantry' 'adventures are to the adventurous' quoted sabran 'yes' said the princess 'but the pity is that the adventurous are too often the questionable ' 'perhaps that is saying too much' said wanda 'but it is certain that the more solid qualities do not often lead into a career of excitement it has been always conceded with a sigh that duty is dull' 'i think adventure is like calamity some people are born to it' he added'and such cannot escape from it loyola may cover his head with a cowl he cannot become obscure eugene may make himself an abb he cannot escape his horoscope cast in the house of mars' 'what a fatalist you are' 'do you think we ever escape our fate alexander slew all whom he suspected but he did not for that die in his bed of old age' 'that merely proves that crime is no buckler' sabran was silent 'my life has been very adventurous' he said lightly after a pause 'but i have only regarded that as another name for misfortune the picturesque is not the prosperous all beggars look well on canvas whilst carolus duran himself can make nothing of a portrait of dives roulant carrosse through his fifty millions' he had not his usual strength his loins had had a wrench in the crashing fall from the umbal which they had not wholly recovered despite the wise medicaments of greswold he moved with some difficulty and not to weary him she remained after breakfast in the watteau room making him recline at length in a long chair beside one of the windows she was touched by the weakness of a man evidently so strong and daring by nature and she regretted the rough and inhospitable handling which he had experienced from her beloved hills and waters she who spoke to no one all the year through except her stewards and her priests did not fail to be sensible of the pleasure she derived from the cultured and sympathetic companionship of a brilliant and talented mind 'ah if egon had only talent like that' she thought with a sigh of remembrance her cousin was a gallant nobleman and soldier but of literature he had no knowledge for art he had a consummate indifference and the only eloquence he could command was a brief address to his troopers which would be answered by an eljn ringing loud and long like steel smiting upon iron sabran could at all times talk well he had the gift of facile and eloquent words and he had also what most attracted the sympathies of his hostess a genuine and healthful love of the mountains and forests all his life in paris had not eradicated from his character a deep love for nature in her wildest and her stormiest moods they conversed long and with mutual pleasure of the country around them of which she knew every ravine and torrent and of whose bold and sombre beauty he was honestly enamoured the noon had deepened into afternoon and the chimes of the clock tower were sounding four when he rose to take his leave and go on his way across the green brilliancy of the tumbling water to his quiet home with the dominican brethren he had still the languor and fatigue about him of recent illness and he moved slowly and with considerable weakness she said to him in parting with unaffected kindness 'come across to us whenever you like we are concerned to think that one of our own glaciers should have treated you so cruelly i am often out riding far and wide but my aunt will always be pleased to receive you' 'i am the debtor of the umbal ice' he said in a low voice 'but for that happy fall i should have gone on my way to my old senseless life without ever having known true rest as i know it yonder will you be offended too if i say that i stayed at matrey with a vague faint unfounded hope that your mountains might be merciful and let me ' 'shoot a kuttengeier' she said quickly as though not desiring to hear his sentence finished 'you might shoot one easily sitting at a window in the monastery and watching till the vultures flew across the lake but you will remember you are on parole i am sure you will be faithful' long long afterwards she remembered that he shrank a little at the word and that a flush of colour went over his face 'i will' he said simply 'and it was not the kuttengeier for which i desired to be allowed to revisit hohenszalras' 'well if the monks starve you or weary you you can remember that we are here and you must not give their organ quite all the music that you bear so wonderfully in your mind and hands' 'i will play to you all day if you will only allow me' 'next time you come to morrow if you like' he went away lying listlessly in the little boat for he was still far from strong but life seemed to him very sweet and serene as the evening light spread over the broad bright water and the water birds rose and scattered before the plunge of the oars had the sovereign mistress of hohenszalras ever said before to any other living friend to morrow yet he was too clever a man to be vain and he did not misinterpret the calm kindness of her invitation he went thither again the next day though he left them early for he had a sensitive fear of wearying with his presence ladies to whom he owed so much but the princess urged his speedy return and the chtelaine of szaravola said once more with that grave smile which was rather in the eyes than on the lips 'we shall always be happy to see you when you are inclined to cross the lake' he was a great adept at painting and he made several broad bold sketches of the landscapes visible from the lake he was famous for many a drawing bross dans le vrai which hung at his favourite club the mirliton he could paint more finely and delicately also on ivory on satin on leather he sent for some fans and screens from vienna and did in gouache upon them exquisite birds foliage flowers legends of saints which were beautiful enough to be not unworthy a place in those rooms of the burg where the penicauds the fragonards the pettitts were represented by much of their most perfect work he passed his mornings in labour of this sort at noonday or in the afternoon he rowed across to hohenszalras and loitered for an hour or two in the gardens or the library little by little they became so accustomed to his coming that it would have seemed strange if more than a day had gone by without the little striped blue boat gliding from the holy isle to the castle stairs he never stayed very long not so long as the princess desired 'never in my life have i spent weeks so harmlessly' he said once with a smile to the doctor then he gave a quick sigh and turned away for he thought to himself in a sudden repentance that these innocent and blameless days were perhaps but the prelude to one of the greatest sins of a not sinless life he came to be looked for quite naturally at the noonday breakfast in the pretty saxe chamber he would spend hours playing on the chapel organ or on the piano in the octagon room which liszt had chosen the grand and dreamy music rolled out over the green lake towards the green hills and wanda would look often at the marble figure of her brother on his tomb lying like the statue of the young gaston de foix and think to herself 'if only bela were listening too' sometimes she was startled when she remembered into what continual intimacy she had admitted a man of whom she had no real knowledge the princess indeed had said to her 'i did ask kaulnitz kaulnitz knows him quite well' but that was hardly enough to satisfy a woman as reserved in her friendships and as habituated to the observance of a severe etiquette as was the chtelaine of hohenszalras every day almost she said to herself that she would not see him when he came or if she saw him would show him by greater chilliness of manner that it was time he quitted the island but when he did come if he did not see her he went to the chapel and played a mass a requiem an anthem a sonata and beethoven palestrina schumann wagner berlioz surely allured her from her solitude and she would come on to the terrace and listen to the waves of melody rolling out through the cool sunless air through the open door of the place where her beloved dead rested then as a matter of course he stayed and after the noonday meal sometimes he rode with her in the forests or drove the princess in her pony chair or received permission to bear his chtelaine company in her mountain walks they were seldom alone but they were much together 'it is much better for her than solitude' thought the princess 'it is not likely that she will ever care anything for him she is so cold but if she did there would be no great harm done he is of old blood and she has wealth enough to need no more of course any one of our great princes would be better but then as she will never take any one of them ' and the princess who was completely fascinated by the deferential homage to her of sabran and the pleasure he honestly found in her society would do all she could in her innocent and delicate way to give her favourite the opportunities he desired of intercourse with the mistress of hohenszalras she wanted to see again the life that she had seen in other days at the schloss grand parties for the hunting season and the summer season royal and noble people in the guest chambers great gatherings for the chase on the rond point in the woods covers for fifty laid at the table in the banqueting hall and besides besides thought the childless and loving old woman little children with long fair curls and gay voices wakening the echoes in the rittersal with their sports and pastimes it was noble and austere no doubt this life led by wanda von szalras amidst the mountains in the tauern but it was lonely and monotonous to the princess who still loved a certain movement gossip and diversion as she liked to nibble a nougat and sip her chocolate foaming under its thick cream it seemed to her that even to suffer a little would be better for her niece than this unvarying solitude this eternal calm that she should have mourned for her brother was most natural but this perpetual seclusion was an exaggeration of regret if the presence of sabran reconciled her with the world with life as it was and induced her to return to the court and to those pleasures natural to her rank and to her years it would be well done thought the princess and as for him if he carried away a broken heart it would be a great pity but persons who like to move others as puppets cannot concern themselves with the accidental injury of one of their toys and mme ottilie was too content with her success of the moment to look much beyond it 'the charm of being here is to me precisely what i daresay makes it tiresome to you' the mistress of hohenszalras said to him one day 'i mean its isolation one can entirely forget that beyond those mountains there is a world fussing fuming brewing its storms in saucers and inventing a quantity of increased unwholesomeness in noise and stench which it calls a higher civilisation no i would never have a telegraph wire brought here from matrey there is nothing i ever particularly care to know about if there were anyone i loved who was away from me it would be different but there is no one there are people i like of course 'but political events' he suggested 'they do not attract me they are ignoble they are for the most part contemptibly ill managed and to think that after so many thousands of years humanity has not really progressed beyond the wild beasts' method of settling disputes ' 'there is so much of the wild beast in it with such an opinion of political life why do you counsel me to seek it' 'you are a man there is nothing else for a man who has talent and who is who is as you are dsuvr intellectual work would be better but you do not care for it it seems since your mexico ' 'the mexico was no work of mine' 'oh yes pardon me i have read it all your notes all your addenda show how the learning of the editor was even superior to that of the original author' 'no all that i could do was to simplify his immense erudition and arrange it i never loved the work do not accredit me with so much industry but it was a debt that i paid and paid easily too for the materials lay all to my hand if in disorder' 'the marquis xavier must at least have infused his own love of archology and science into you' 'i can scarcely say even so much i have a facility at acquiring knowledge which is not a very high quality things come easily to me i fear if herr joachim examined me he would find my science shallow' 'you have so many talents that perhaps you are like one of your own mexican forests one luxuriance kills another' 'had i had fewer i might have been more useful in my generation' he said with a certain sincerity of regret 'you would have been much less interesting' she thought to herself as she said aloud 'there are the horses coming up to the steps will you ride with me and do not be ungrateful for your good gifts talent is a schlsselblume that opens to all hidden treasures' 'why are you not in the chamber' she had said a little before to him 'you are eloquent you have an ancestry that binds you to do your best for france' 'i have no convictions' he had said with a flush on his face 'it is a sad thing to confess' 'it is but if you have nothing better to substitute for them you might be content to abide by those of your fathers' he had been silent 'besides' she had added 'patriotism is not an opinion it is an instinct' 'with good men i am not one of them' 'go into public life' she had repeated 'convictions will come to you in an active career as the muscles develop in the gymnasium' 'i am indolent' he had demurred 'and i have desultory habits' 'you may break yourself of these there must be much in which you could interest yourself begin with the fishing interests of the coast that belongs to you' 'honestly i care for nothing except for myself you will say it is base' 'i am afraid it is natural' he but seldom spoke of his early life when he did so it was with reluctance as if it gave him pain his father he had never known of his grandfather the marquis xavier as he usually called him he spoke with extreme and reverent tenderness but with little reticence the grave old man in the stateliness and simplicity of his solitary life had been to his youthful imagination a solemn and sacred figure 'his was the noblest life i have ever known' he said once with an emotion in the accent of the words which she had never heard in his voice before and which gave her a passing impression of a regret in him that was almost remorse it might be she reflected the remorse of a man who in his careless youth had been less heedful of the value of an affection and the greatness of a character which as he grew older and wiser he learned to appreciate when it was too late he related willingly how the old man had trusted him to carry out into the light of the world the fruits of his life of research and with what pleasure he had seen the instant and universal recognition of the labours of the brain and the hand that were dust but of his own life in the west he said little he referred his skill in riding to the wild horses of the pampas and his botanical and scientific knowledge to the studies which the solitudes of the sierras had made him turn to as relaxation and occupation but of himself he said little nothing unless the conversation so turned upon his life there that it was impossible for him to avoid those reminiscences which were evidently little agreeable to him perhaps she thought some youthful passion some unwise love had made those flowering swamps and sombre plains painful in memory to him there might be other graves than that of the marquis xavier beneath the plumes of pampas grass perhaps also to a man of the world a man of mere pleasure as he had become that studious and lonesome youth of his already had drifted so far away that seen in distance it seemed dim and unreal as any dream 'how happy you are to have so many admirable gifts' said wanda to him one day when he had offered her a fan that he had painted on ivory he had a facile skill at most of the arts and had acquired accuracy and technique lounging through the painting rooms of paris the fan was an exquisite trifle and bore on one side her monogram and the arms of her house and on the other mountain flowers and birds rendered with the delicacy of a miniaturist 'what is the use of a mere amateur' he said with indifference 'when one has lived amongst artists one learns heartily to despise oneself for daring to flirt with those sacred sisters the muses' 'why and after all when one has such perfect talent as yours the definition of amateur and artist seems a very arbitrary and meaningless one if you needed to make your fame and fortune by painting faces you could do so you do not need does that make the fan the less precious the more i think since gold cannot buy it' 'you are too kind to me the world would not be as much so if i really wanted its suffrages' 'you cannot tell that i think you have that facility which is the first note of genius it is true all your wonderful talents seem the more wonderful to me because i have none myself i feel art but i have no power over it and as for what are called accomplishments i have none i could perhaps beat you in the shooting gallery and i will try some day if you like and i can ride well like my kaiserin but accomplishments i have none' 'surely you were yesterday reading plato in his own text' 'i learnt greek and latin with my brother you cannot call that an accomplishment the ladies of the old time often knew the learned tongues though they were greater at tapestry or distilling and at the ordering of their household in a solitary place like this it is needful to know so many useful things i can shoe my horse and harness a sleigh i can tell every useful herb and flower in the woods i know well what to do in frostbite or accidents if i were lost in the hills i could make my way by the stars i can milk a cow and can row any boat and i can climb with crampons i am a mountaineer do not be so surprised i do all that i have the children taught in my schools but in a salon i am useless and stupid the last new lady whose lord has been decorated because he sold something wholesale or cheated successfully at the bourse would i assure you eclipse me easily in the talents of the drawing room' sabran looked at her and laughed outright a compliment would have seemed ridiculous before this beautiful patrician with her serene dignity her instinctive grace her unconscious hauteur her entire possession of all those attributes which are the best heirlooms of a great nobility to protest against her words would have been like an insult to this daughter of knights and princes to whom half the sovereigns of modern europe would have seemed but parvenus the accidental mushroom growth of the decay in the contest of nations his laughter amused her though it was perhaps the most discreet and delicate of compliments she was not offended by it as she would have been with any spoken flattery 'after all do not think me modest in what i have said' she pursued 'talents de socit are but slight things at the best and in our day need not even have either wit or culture a good travesty at a costume ball a startling gown on a racecourse a series of adventures more or less true a trick of laughing often and laughing long any one of these is enough for renown in your paris in vienna we do more homage to tradition still our court life has still something of the grace of the minuet' 'yet even in vienna you refuse ' 'to spend my time why not the ceremonies of a court are wearisome to me my duties lie here and for the mirth and pomp of society i have had no heart since the grief that you know of fell upon me' it was the first time that she had ever spoken of her brother's loss to him he bowed very low in silent sympathy 'who would not envy his death since it has brought such remembrance' he said in a low tone after some moments 'ah if only we could be sure that unceasing regret consoles the dead' she said with an emotion that softened and dimmed all her beauty then as if ashamed or repentant of having shown her feeling for bela to a stranger she turned to him and said more distantly 'would it entertain you to see my little scholars i will take you to the schoolhouses if you like' he could only eagerly accept the offer he felt his heart beat and his eyes lighten as she spoke he knew that such a condescension in her was a mark of friendship a sign of familiar intimacy 'it is but a mile or so through the woods we will walk there' she said as she took her tall cane from its rack and called to neva and donau where they lay on the terrace without he fancied that the vague mistrust of him the vague prejudice against him of which he had been sensible in her were passing away from her mind but still he doubted doubted bitterly whether she would ever give him any other thought than that due to a passing and indifferent acquaintance that she admired his intelligence and that she pitied his loneliness he saw but there seemed to him that never never never would he break down in his own favour that impalpable but impassable barrier due half to her pride half to her reserve and absolutely to her indifference which separated wanda von szalras from the rest of mankind if she had any weakness or foible it was the children's schools on the estates in the high tauern and elsewhere they had been founded on a scheme of bela's and her own when they had been very young and the world to them a lovely day without end their too elaborate theories had been of necessity curtailed but the schools had been established on the basis of their early dreams and were unlike any others that existed she had read much and deeply and had thought out all she had read and as she enjoyed that happy power of realising and embodying her own theories which most theorists are denied she had founded the schools of the high tauern in absolute opposition to all that the school boards of her generation have decreed as desirable and in every one of her villages she had her schools on this principle and they throve and the children with them many of these could not read a printed page but all of them could read the shepherd's weather glass in sky and flower all of them knew the worm that was harmful to the crops the beetle that was harmless in the grass all knew a tree by a leaf a bird by a feather an insect by a grub modern teaching makes a multitude of gabblers she did not think it necessary for the little goatherds and dairymaids and foresters and charcoal burners and sennerinn and carpenters and cobblers to study the exact sciences or draw casts from the antique she was of opinion with pope that 'a little learning is a dangerous thing' and that a smattering of it will easily make a man morose and discontented whilst it takes a very deep and even lifelong devotion to it to teach a man content with his lot genius she thought is too rare a thing to make it necessary to construct village schools for it and whenever or wherever it comes upon earth it will surely be its own master she did not believe in culture for little peasants who have to work for their daily bread at the plough tail or with the reaping hook she knew that a mere glimpse of a canaan of art and learning is cruelty to those who never can enter into and never even can have leisure to merely gaze on it she thought that a vast amount of useful knowledge is consigned to oblivion whilst children are taught to waste their time in picking up the crumbs of a great indigestible loaf of artificial learning she had her scholars taught their 'abc' and that was all those who wished to write were taught but writing was not enforced what they were made to learn was the name and use of every plant in their own country the habits and ways of all animals how to cook plain food well and make good bread how to brew simples from the herbs of their fields and woods and how to discern the coming weather from the aspect of the skies the shutting up of certain blossoms and the time of day from those 'poor men's watches' the opening flowers in all countries there is a great deal of useful household and out of door lore that is fast being choked out of existence under books and globes and which unless it passes by word of mouth from generation to generation is quickly and irrevocably lost all this lore she had cherished by her schoolchildren her boys were taught in addition any useful trade they liked boot making crampon making horse shoeing wheel making or carpentry this trade was made a pastime to each the little maidens learned to sew to cook to spin to card to keep fowls and sheep and cattle in good health and to know all poisonous plants and berries by sight 'i think it is what is wanted' she said 'a little peasant child does not need to be able to talk of the corolla and the spathe but he does want to recognise at a glance the flower that will give him healing and the berries that will give him death his sister does not in the least require to know why a kettle boils but she does need to know when a warm bath will be good for a sick baby or when hurtful we want a new generation to be helpful to have eyes and to know the beauty of silence i do not mind much whether my children read or not the labourer that reads turns socialist because his brain cannot digest the hard mass of wonderful facts he encounters but i believe every one of my little peasants being wrecked like crusoe would prove as handy as he' she was fond of her scholars and proud of them and they were never afraid of her they knew well it was the great lady who filled all their sacks the night of santa claus even those of the naughty children because as she said childhood was so short that she thought it cruel to give it any disappointments the walk to the schoolhouse lay through the woods to the south of the castle woods of larch and beech and walnut and the graceful siberian pine with deep mosses and thick fern brakes beneath them and ever and again a watercourse tumbling through their greenery to fall into the szalrassee below 'i always fancy i can hear here the echo of the great krimler torrents' she said to him as they passed through the trees 'no doubt it is fancy and the sound is only from our own falls but the peasants' tradition is you may know that our lake is the water of the krimler come to us underground from the pinzgau do you know our sahara of the north it is monotonous and barren enough and yet with its vast solitudes of marsh and stones its flocks of wild fowl its reedy wastes its countless streams it is grand in its own way and then in the heart of it there are the thunder and the boiling fury of krimml you will smile because i am an enthusiast for my country you who have seen orinoco and chimborazo but even you will own that the old duchy of austria the old archbishopric of salzburg the old countship of tirol have some beauty and glory in them here is the schoolhouse now you shall see what i think needful for the peasant of the future perhaps you will condemn me as a true austrian that is as a reactionist' the schoolhouse was a chlet or rather a collection of chlets set one against another on a green pasture belted by pine woods above which the snows of the distant venediger were gleaming amidst the clouds there was a loud hum of childish voices rising through the open lattice and these did not cease as they entered the foremost house 'do not be surprised that they take no notice of our entrance' she said to him 'i have taught them not to do so unless i bid them if they left off their tasks i could never tell how they did them and is not the truest respect shown in obedience' 'they are as well disciplined as soldiers' he said with a smile as twenty curly heads bent over desks were lifted for a moment to instantly go down again 'surely discipline is next to health' added wanda 'if the child do not learn it early he must suffer fearfully when he reaches manhood since all men even princes have to obey some time or other and the majority of men are not princes but are soldiers clerks porters guides labourers tradesmen what not certainly something subject to law if not to a master how many lives have been lost because a man failed to understand the meaning of immediate and unquestioning obedience soldiers are shot for want of it yet children are not to be taught it' whilst she spoke not a child looked up or left off his lesson the teacher a white haired old man went on with his recitation 'your teachers are not priests' he said in some surprise 'no' she answered 'i am a faithful daughter of the church as you know but every priest is perforce a specialist if i may be forgiven the profanity and the teacher of children should be of perfectly open simple and unbiassed mind the priest's can never be that besides his teaching is apart the love and fear of god are themes too vast and too intimate to be mingled with the pains of the alphabet and the multiplication tables there alone i agree with your french radicals though from a very different reason to theirs now in this part of the schools you see the children are learning from books these children have wished to read and are taught to do so but i do not enforce though i recommend it you think that very barbarous oh reflect for a moment how much more glorious was the world was literature itself before printing was invented sometimes i think it was a book not a fruit that satan gave you smile incredulously well no doubt to a parisian it seems absurd how should you understand what is wanted in the heart of these hills come and see the other houses' in the next which they entered there was a group of small sturdy boys very sunburnt and rough and bright who were seated in a row listening with rapt attention to a teacher who was talking to them of birds and their uses and ways there were prints of birds and birds' nests and the teacher was making them understand why and how a bird flew 'that is the natural history school' she said 'one day it is birds another animals another insects that they are told about those are all little foresters born they will go about their woods with eyes that see and with tenderness for all creation' in the next school herr joachim himself who took no notice of their entrance was giving a simple little lecture on the useful herbs and the edible tubers the way to know them and to turn them to profit there were several girls listening here 'those girls will not poison their people at home with a false cryptogram' said wanda as they passed on to another place where a lesson on farriery and the treatment of cattle was going on and another where a teacher was instructing a mixed group of boys and little maidens in the lore of the forests of the grasses of the various causes that kill a tree in its prime of the insects that dwell in them and of the different soils that they needed in another chamber there was a spinning class and a sewing class under a kindly faced old dame and in yet another there were music classes some playing on the zither and others singing part songs and glees with baby voices 'now you have seen all i have to show you' said wanda 'in these two other chlets are the workshops where the boys learn any trade they choose and the girls are also taught to make a shoe or a jacket my children would not pass examinations in cities certainly but they are being fitted in the best way they can for their future life which will pass either in these mountains and forests as i hope or in the armies of the emperor and the humble work a day ways of poor folks everywhere if there be a grillparzer or a kaulbach amongst them the education is large and simple enough to let the originality he has been born with develop itself if as is far more likely they are all made of ordinary human stuff then the teaching they receive is such as to make them contented pious honest and useful working people at least that is what i strive for and this is certain that the children come some of them a german mile and more with joy and willingness to their schools and that this at least they take away with them into their future life the sense of duty as a supreme rein over all instincts and mercifulness towards every living thing that god has given us' she had spoken with unusual animation and with an earnestness that brought warmth over her cheek and moisture into her eyes sabran looked at her timidly then as timidly he touched the tips of her fingers and raised them to his lips 'you are a noble woman' he said very low a sense of his own utter unworthiness overwhelmed him and held him mute she glanced at him in some surprise vaguely tinged with displeasure 'there are schools on every estate' she said a little angrily and disconnectedly 'these are modelled on my own whim that is all the world would say i ought to teach these little peasants the science that dissects its own sources and the philosophies that resolve all creation into an egg but i follow ancient ways enough to think the country life the best the healthiest the sweetest it is for this that they are born and to this i train them if we had more naturalists we should have fewer communists' 'yes audubon would scarcely have been a regicide or humboldt a camorrist' he answered her regaining his self possession 'no doubt a love of nature is a triple armour against self love how can i say how right i think your system with these children you seem not to believe me there is only one thing in which i differ with you you think the 'eyes that see' bring content surely not surely not' 'it depends on what they see' she said meditatively 'when they are wide open in the woods and fields when they have been taught to see how the tree bee forms her cell and the mole his fortress how the warbler builds his nest for his love and the water spider makes his little raft how the leaf comes forth from the hard stem and the fungi from the rank mould then i think that sight is content content in the simple life of the woodland place and in such delighted wonder that the heart of its own accord goes up in peace and praise to the creator the printed page may teach envy desire covetousness hatred but the book of nature teaches resignation hope willingness to labour and live submission to die the world has gone further and further from peace since larger and larger have grown its cities and its shepherd kings are no more' he was silent her voice moved him like sweet remembered music yet in his own remembrance what were there only 'envy desire covetousness hatred' the unlovely shapes that were to her as emblems of the powers of evil his reason was with her and his emotions were with her also but memory was busy in him and in it he saw 'as in a glass darkly' all his passionate cold embittered youth all his warped irresolute useless and untrue manhood 'do not think' she added unconscious of the pain that she had caused him 'that i undervalue the blessing of great books but i do think that to recognise the beauty of literature as much culture and comprehension are needed as to understand leonardo's painting or the structure of wagner's music those who read well are as rare as those who love well the curse of our age is superficial knowledge it is a cryptogram of the rankest sort and i will not let my scholars touch it do you not think it is better for a country child to know what flowers are poisonous for her cattle and what herbs are useful in her neighbours' fever than to be able to spell through a jesuit's newspaper or suck evil from a communist's pamphlet you will not have your horse well shod if the smith be thinking of bakounine while he hammers the iron' 'i have held the views of bakounine myself' said sabran with hesitation 'i do not know what you will think of me i have even been tempted to be an anarchist a nihilist' 'you speak in the past tense you must have abandoned those views you are received at frohsdorf' 'they have perhaps abandoned me my life has been idle sinful often i have liked luxury and have not denied myself folly i recognised the absurdity of such a man as i was joining in any movement of seriousness and self negation so i threw away my political persuasions as one throws off a knapsack when tired of a journey on foot' 'that was not very conscientious surely' 'no madame it is perhaps however better than helping to adjust the contradictions of the world with dynamite and i cannot even claim that they were persuasions i fear they were mere personal impatience with narrow fortunes and useless ambitions' 'i cannot pardon anyone of an old nobility turning republican it is like a son insulting the tombs of his fathers' she said with emphasis then fearing she had reproved him too strongly she added with a smile 'and yet i also could almost join the anarchists when i see the enormous wealth of baseborn speculators and hebrew capitalists in such bitter contrast with the hunger of the poor who starve all over the world in winter like birds frozen on the snow oh do not suppose that though i am an austrian i cannot see that feudalism is doomed we are still feudal here but then in so much we are still as we were in crusading days the nobles have been almost everywhere except here ousted by capitalists and the capitalists will in turn be devoured by the democracy les loups se mangeront entre eux you see though i may be prejudiced i am not blind but you as a breton should think feudalism a loss as i do' 'in those days barbe bleue or gilles de retz were the nearest neighbours of romaris' he said with a smile 'yet if feudalism could be sure of such chtelaines as the countess von szalras i would wish it back to morrow' 'that is very prettily put for a socialist but you cannot be a socialist you are received at frohsdorf bretons are always royal they are born with the cultus of god and the king' he laughed a little not quite easily 'paris is a witch's caldron in which all cultes are melted down and evaporate in a steam of disillusion and mockery into the caldron we have long flung alas cross and crown actual and allegoric i am not a breton i am that idle creation of modern life a boulevardier' 'but do you never visit romaris' 'why should i there is nothing but a few sea tormented oaks endless sands endless marshes and a dark dirty village jammed among rocks and reeking with the smell of the oil and the fish' 'then i would go and make the village clean and the marshes healthy were i you there must be something of interest in any people who remain natural in their ways and dwell beside a sea is romaris not prosperous' 'prosperous god and man have forgotten it ever since the world began i should say it is on a bay so treacherous that it is called the pool of death the landes separate it by leagues from any town all it has to live on is the fishing it is dull as a grave harried by every storm unutterably horrible' 'well i would not forsake its horrors were i a son of romaris' she said softly then as she perceived that some association made the name and memory of the old armorican village painful to him she blew the whistle she always used and at the summons the eldest pupil of the school a handsome boy of fourteen came out and stood bareheaded before her 'hansl ask the teachers to grant you all an hour's frolic that you may amuse this gentleman' she said to him 'and hansl take care that you do your best all of you in dancing wrestling and singing and above all with the zither for the honour of the empire' the lad with a face of sunshine bowed low and ran into the school houses 'it is almost their hour for rest or i would not have disturbed them' she said to him 'they come here at sunrise bring their bread and meat and milk is given them they disperse according to season a little before sunset they have two hours' rest at different times but it is hardly wanted for their labours interest them and their classes are varied' soon the children all trooped out made their bow or curtsey reverently but without shyness and began with song and national airs played on the zither or the 'jumping wood' their singing and music were tender ardent and yet perfectly precise there was no false note or slurred passage then they danced the merry national dances that make gay the long nights in the snow covered chlets in many a mountain village which even the mountain letter carrier on his climbing irons cannot reach for months together when all the highlands are ice they ended their dances with the hungarian czardas into which they threw all the vigour of their healthful young limbs and happy hearts 'my cousin egon taught them the czardas have you ever seen the magyar nobles in the madness of that dance' 'your cousin egon do you mean prince vsrhely' 'yes do you know him' 'i have seen him' his face grew paler as he spoke he ceased to watch with interest the figures of the jumping children in their picturesque national dress as they whirled and shouted in the sunshine on the green turf with the woods and the rocks towering beyond them when the czardas was ended the girls sat down on the sward to rest and the boys began their leaping running and stone heaving with their favourite wrestling at the close 'they are as strong as chamois' she said to him 'there is no need here to have a gymnasium their mountains teach them climbing and every sunday on their village green their fathers make them wrestle and shoot at marks the favourite sport here is one i will not countenance the finger hooking if i gave the word any two of those little fellows would hook their middle fingers together and pull till a joint broke' the boys were duly commended for their skill and sabran would have thrown them a shower of florin notes had she allowed it then she bade them sing as a farewell the kaiser's hymn the grand melody rolled out on the fresh clear alpine air in voices as fresh and as clear that went upward and upward towards the zenith like the carol of the larks 'i would fain be the emperor to have that prayer sung so for me' said sabran with truth as the glad young voices dropped down into silence the intense silence of the earth where the glaciers reign 'he heard them last year and he was pleased' she said as the children raised a loud 'hoch' made their reverence once more at a sign of dismissal from her and vanished in a proud and happy crowd into the schoolhouses 'do you never praise them or reward them' he asked in surprise 'santa claus rewards them as for praise they know when i smile that all is well' 'but surely they have shown very unusual musical talent' 'they sing well because they are well taught but they are not any of them going to become singers those zithers and part songs will all serve to enliven the long nights of the farmhouse or the summer solitude of the cattle hut we do not cultivate music one half enough among the peasantry it lightens labour it purifies and strengthens the home life it sweetens black bread do you remember that happy picture of jordaens' where the old sing the young chirp where the old grandfather and grandmother and the baby in its mother's arms and the hale five year old boy and the rough servant are all joining in the same melody while the goat crops the vine leaves off the table i should like to see every cottage interior like that when the work was done i would hang up an etching from jordaens where you would hang up perhaps the programme of proudhon' then she walked back with him through the green sun gleaming woods 'i hope that i teach them content' she continued 'it is the lesson most neglected in our day niemand will ein schuster seyn jederman ein dichter it is true we are very happy in our surroundings a mountaineer's is such a beautiful life so simple healthful hardy and fine always face to face with nature i try to teach them what an inestimable joy that alone is i do not altogether believe in the prosaic views of rural life it is true that the peasant digging his trench sees the clod not the sky but then when he does lift his head the sky is there not the roof not the ceiling that is so much in itself and here the sky is an everlasting grandeur clouds and domes of snow are blent together when the stars are out above the glaciers how serene the night is how majestic even the humblest creature feels lifted up into that eternal greatness then you think of the home life in the long winters as dreary but it is not so over away there at lahn and other places on the hallstadtersee they do not see the sun for five months the wall of rock behind them shuts them from all light of day but they live together they dance they work the young men recite poems and the old men tell tales of the mountains and the french war and they sing the homely songs of the schnaderhupfeln then when winter passes when the sun comes again up over the wall of rocks when they go out into the light once more what happiness it is one old man said to me 'it is like being born again' and another said 'where it is always warm and light i doubt they forget to thank god for the sunshine' and quite a young child said all of his own accord 'the primroses live in the dusk all the winter like us and then when the sun comes up we and they run out together and the mother of christ has set the waters and the little birds laughing' i would rather have the winter of lahn than the winter of belleville' 'but they do go away from their mountains a good deal one meets them ' 'my own people never do but from the valleys around they go yes sometimes but then they always come back the defereggenthal men over yonder where you see those ice summits constantly go elsewhere on reaching manhood but as soon as they have made a little money they return to dwell at home for the remainder of their days i think living amidst the great mountains creates a restfulness a steadfastness in the character if paris were set amidst alps you would have had lamartine you would not have had rochefort' when she spoke thus of her own country of her own people all her coldness vanished her eyes grew full of light her reserve was broken up into animation they were what she truly loved what touched her affections and her sympathies when he heard her speak thus he thought if any man should succeed in arousing in her the love and the loyalty that she gave her austrian alps what treasures he would win into what a kingdom he would enter and then something that was perhaps higher than vanity and deeper than egotism stirring in him whispered 'if any why not you' herr joachim had at a message from her joined them he talked of the flowers around them and of the culture and flora of mexico sabran answered him with apparent interest and with that knowledge which he had always the presence of mind to recall at need but his heart was heavy and his mind absent she had spoken to him of romaris and he had once known egon vsrhely those two facts overshadowed the sweetness and sunshine of the day yet he knew very well that he should have been prepared for both the princess ottilie seated in her gilt wickerwork chair under the great yew on the south side of the house saw them approach with pleasure 'come and have a cup of tea' she said to them 'but my beloved wanda you should not let the doctor walk beside you oh i saw him in the distance of course he left you before you joined me he is a worthy man a most worthy man but so is hubert and you do not walk with hubert and converse with him about flowers' 'are you so inexorable as to social grades madame murmured sabran as he took his cup from her still pretty hand 'most certainly' said the princess with a little a very little asperity 'the world was much happier when distinctions and divisions were impassable there are no sumptuary laws now what is the consequence that your bourgeoise ruins her husband in wearing gowns fit only for a duchess and your prince imagines it makes him popular to look precisely like a cabman or a bailiff' 'and even in the matter of utility' said sabran who always agreed with her 'those sumptuary laws had much in their favour if one look through the chronicles and miniatures say of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries how much more sensible for the change of seasons and the ease of work seems the costume of the working people the cotte hardie was a thousand times more comfortable and more becoming than anything we have if we could dress once more as all did under louis treize gentle and simple would alike benefit' 'what a charmingly intelligent person he is' thought the princess as she remarked that in austria they were happier than the rest of the world there were peasant costumes still there wanda left them a little later to confer with one of her land stewards sabran remained seated by the princess in whom he felt that he possessed a friend 'what did you think of those schools said frau ottilie 'oh of course you admire and approve you must admire and approve when they are the hobby of a beautiful woman who is also your hostess' 'does that mean princess that you do not' 'no doubt the schools are excellent' replied the princess in a tone which condemned them as ridiculous 'but for my own part i prefer those things left to the church of which they constitute alike the privilege and the province i cannot see either why a peasant child requires to know how a tree grows that a merciful providence placed it there is all he can need to be told and that he should be able to cut it down without cutting off his own fingers is all the science that can possibly be necessary to him however wanda thinks otherwise and she is mistress here' 'but the schools surely are eminently practical ones' 'practical is it practical to weave a romance as long as pamela about the changes of a chrysalis i fail to see it that a grub is a destructive creature is all that any one needs to know there is nothing practical in making it the heroine of an interminable metempsychosis but all those ideas of 'wanda's have a taint of that modern poison which her mind though it is so strong iii many things has not been strong enough to resist she does not believe in the efficacy of our holy relics such as that which i sent you and which wrought your cure but she does believe in the fables that naturalists invent about weeds and beetles and she finds a kosmos in a puddle' 'you are very severe princess' 'i dislike inconsistency and my niece is inconsistent though she imagines that perfect consistency is the staple of her character' 'nay madame surely her character is the most evenly balanced the most harmonious and consequently the most perfect that is possible to humanity' the princess looked at him with a keen little glance 'you admire her very much are you sure you understand her' 'i should not dare to say that but i dare to hope it her nature seems to me serene and transparent as fine sunlight' 'so it is but she has faults i can assure you' said the princess with her curious union of shrewdness and simplicity 'my niece is a perfectly good woman so far as goodness is possible to finite nature she is the best woman i have ever known out of the cloister but then there is this to be said she has never been tempted true she might be tempted to be arrogant despotic tyrannical and she is not so but that is not precisely the temptation to try her she is mild and merciful out of her very pride but her character would be sure destruction of her pride were such a thing possible you think she is not proud because she is so gentle you might as well say that her majesty is not empress because she washes the feet of the twelve poor men wanda is the best woman that i know but she is also the proudest' 'the countess has never loved anyone' said sabran who grew paler as he heard 'terrestrial love no it has not touched her but it would not alter her believe me some women lose themselves in their affections she would not she would always remain the mistress of it and it would be a love like her character of that i am sure' sabran was silent he was discouraged 'i think the boldest man would always be held at a distance from her' he said after a pause 'i think none would ever acquire dominion over her life' 'that is exactly what i have said' replied the princess 'your phrase is differently worded but it comes to the same thing' 'it would depend very much ' 'on what' 'on how much she loved and perhaps a little on how much she was loved' 'not at all' said the princess decidedly 'you cannot get more out of a nature than there is in it and there is no sort of passion in the nature of my niece' he was silent again 'she was admirably educated' added the princess hastily conscious of a remark not strictly becoming in herself 'and her rare temperament is serene well balanced void of all excess heaven has mercifully eliminated from her almost all mortal errors' 'by pride angels have fallen ere thy time' suggested sabran 'angels perhaps' said the princess drily 'but for women it is an admirable preservative second only to piety' he went home sculling himself across the lake now perfectly calm beneath the rose and gold of a midsummer sunset his heart was heavy and a dull fear seemed to beat at his conscience like a child suddenly awaking who knocks at a long closed door still as a crime allures men who contemplate it by the fascination of its weird power so the sin he desired to commit held him with its unholy beguilement and almost it looked holy to him because it wore the guise of wanda von szalras he was not insensible to the charm of this interchange of thought he had had many passions in which his senses alone had been enlisted there was a more delicate attraction in the gradual and numberless steps by which only slowly and with patience could he win any way into her regard she had for him the puissance that the almost unattainable has for all humanity when he could feel that he had awakened any sympathy in her his pride was more flattered than it could have been by the most complete subjection of any other woman he had looked on all women with the chill amorous cynicism of the parisian psychology as l'ternel fminin at best as 'la forme perverse vaporeuse langoureuse souple comme les roseaux blanche comme les lis incapable de se mouvoir pendant les deux tiers du jour sans quilibre sans but sans quateur donnant son corps en pture sa tte he had had no other ideal no other conception this psychology like some other sciences brutalises as it equalises in the woman who had risen up before him in the night of storm upon the szalrassee he had recognised with his intelligence a woman who made his philosophy at fault who aroused something beyond his mere instincts who was not to be classified with the lias or the cesarines or the jane de simeroses who had been in his love as in his literature the various types of the ternel fminin the simplicity and the dignity of her life astonished and convinced him he began to understand that where he had imagined he had studied the universe in his knowledge of women he had in reality only seen two phases of it the hothouse and the ditch it is a common error to take the forced flower and the slime weed and think that there is nothing between or beyond the two he had the convictions of his school that all women were at heart coquettes or hypocrites consciously or unconsciously wanda von szalras routed all his theories before her candour her directness and gravity of thought her serene indifference to all forms of compliment all his doctrines and all his experiences were useless she inspired him with reverential and hopeless admiration which was mingled with an angry astonishment and something of the bitterness of envy sometimes as he sat and watched the green water of the lake tumble and roll beneath a north wind's wrath under a cloudy sky which hid the snows of the glckner range he remembered a horrible story that had once fascinated him of malatesta of rimini slaying the princess that would have none of his love striking his sword across her white throat in the dusky evening time and casting her body upon the silken curtains of her wicked litter almost he could have found it in him to do such a crime almost only he thought that at one look of her eyes his sword would have dropped upon the dust her personal beauty had inspired him with a sudden passion but her character checked it with the sense of fear which it imposed on him fear of those high and blameless instincts which were an integral part of her nature fear of that frank unswerving truth which was the paramount law of her life as he rode with her walked with her conversed with her in the long light summer hours he saw more and more of the purity and nobility of her temper but he saw or thought he saw also an inexorable pride and a sternness in judgment which made him believe that she would be utterly unforgiving to weakness or to sin she remained the nibelungen queen to him clothed in flawless armour and aloof from men he lingered on at the holy isle finding a fresh charm each day in this simple and peaceful existence filled with the dreams of a woman unlike every other he had known he knew that it could not last but he was unwilling to end it himself to rise to the sound of the monks' matins to pass his forenoons in art or open air exercise to be sure that some hour or another before sunset he would meet her either in her home or abroad in the woods to go early to bed seeing as he lay the pile of the great burg looming high above the water like the citadel of the sleeping beauty all this together making up an existence so monotonous harmless and calm that a few months before he would have deemed it impossible to endure it was soothing alluring and beguiling to him he had told no one where he was his letters might lie and accumulate by the hundred in his rooms in paris for aught that he cared he had no creditors for he had been always scrupulously careful to avoid all debt and he had no friend for whose existence he cared a straw there were those who cared for him indeed but these seldom trouble any man very greatly in the last week of august however a letter found its way to him it was written in a very bad hand on paper gorgeous with gold and silver it was signed 'cochonette' it contained a torrent of reproaches made in the broadest language that the slang of the hour furnished and every third word was misspelt how the writer had tracked him she did not say he tore the letter up and threw the pieces into the water flowing beneath his window had he ever passionately desired and triumphed in the possession of that woman it seemed wonderful to him now she was an idol of paris a creature with the voice of a lark and the laugh of a child with a lovely mutinous face and eyes that could speak without words as a pierrot as a mousquetaire as a little prince as a fairy king of operetta she had no rival in the eyes of paris she blazed with jewels when she played a peasant and she wore the costliest costume of felix's devising when she sung her triplets as a soubrette she had been constant to no one for three months and she had been constant to him for three years or at the least had made him believe so and she wrote to him now furiously reproachfully entreatingly fierce reproaches and entreaties all misspelt the letter which he threw into the lake brought all the memories of his old life before him it was like the flavour of absinthe after drinking spring water it was a life which had had its successes a life as the world called it of pleasure and it seemed utterly senseless to him now as he tore up the note of cochonette and looked down the water to where the towers and spires and battlements of hohenszalras soared upward in the mists he shook himself as though to shake off the memory of an unpleasant dream as he went out descended the landing steps drew his boat from under the willows and sculled himself across towards the water stairs of the schloss in a quarter of an hour he was playing the themes of the 'gotterdammerung' whilst his chtelaine sat at her spinning wheel a few yards from him 'good heavens can she and cochonette belong to the same human race' he thought as whilst he played his glance wandered to that patrician figure seated in the light from the oriel window with the white hound leaning against her velvet skirts and her jewelled fingers plying the distaff and disentangling the flax after the noonday breakfast the sun shone the mists lifted from the water the clouds drifted from the lower mountains only leaving the snow capped head of the glckner enveloped in them 'i am going to ride will you come' said wanda von szalras to him he assented with ardour and a hunter siegfried the mount which was always given to him was led round under the great terrace in company with her arab riding horse ali they rode far through the forests and out on the one level road there was which swept round the south side of the lake a road turf bordered overhung with huge trees closed in with a dewy veil of greenery across which ever and anon some flash of falling water or some shimmer of glacier or of snow crest shone through the dense leafage they rode too fast for conversation both the horses racing like greyhounds but as they returned towards the close of the afternoon they slackened their pace in pity to the steaming heaving flanks beneath their saddles and then they could hear each other's voices 'what a lovely life it is here' he said with a sigh 'the world will seem very vulgar and noisy to me after it' 'you would soon tire and wish for the world' she answered him 'no' he said quickly 'i have been two months on the holy isle and i have not known weariness for a moment' 'that is because it is still summer if you were here in the winter you would bemoan your imprisonment like my aunt ottilie even the post sometimes fails us' 'i should not lament the post' he replied thinking of the letter he had cast into the lake 'my old life seems to me insanity fever disease beside these past two months i have spent with the monks' 'you can take the vows' she suggested with a smile he smiled too 'nay i should not dare to so insult our mother church one must not empty ashes into a reliquary' 'your life is not ashes yet' he was silent he could not say to her what he would have said could he have laid his heart bare 'when you go away' she pursued 'remember my words choose some career make yourself some aim in life do not fold your talents in a napkin in a napkin that lies on the supper table at bignon's that idle aimless life is very attractive i dare say in its way but it must grow wearisome and unsatisfactory as years roll on the men of my house have never been content with it they have always been soldiers statesmen something or other beside mere nobles' 'but they have had a great position' 'men make their own position they cannot make a name at least not to my thinking you have that good fortune you have a great name you only need pardon me to make your manner of life worthy of it' he grew pale as she spoke 'cannot make a name' he said with forced gaiety 'surely in these days the beggar rides on horseback in all the ministries and half the nobilities' a great contempt passed over her face 'you mean that hans pierre or richard becomes a count an excellency or an earl what does that change it alters the handle it does not alter the saucepan no one can be ennobled blood is blood nobility can only be inherited it cannot be conferred by all the heralds in the world the very meaning and essence of nobility are descent inherited traditions instincts habits and memories all that is meant by noblesse oblige' 'would you allow' thought her companion 'would you allow the same nobility to falcon bridge as to plantagenet' but he dared not name the bar sinister to this daughter of princes siegfried started and reared his rider did not reply being absorbed in calming him 'what frightened him' she asked 'a hawk flew by' said sabran 'a hawk flying low enough for a horse to see it it must be wounded' he did not answer and they quickened their pace as the sun sunk behind the glaciers of the west when he returned to the monastery the evening had closed in the lantern was lit at his boat's prow dinner was prepared for him but he ate little later the moon rose golden and round as a bowl it was a beautiful spectacle as it gave its light to the amphitheatre of the mountains to the rippling surface of the lake to the stately irregular lines of the castle backed by the blackness of its woods he sat long by the open window lost in thought pondering on the great race which had ruled there l'honneur parle il suffit had been their law and she who represented them held a creed no less stern and pure than theirs her words spoken in their ride were like a weight of ice on his heart never to her never could he confess the errors of his past he was a man bold to temerity but he was not bold enough to risk the contempt of wanda von szalras he had never much heeded right or wrong or much believed in such ethical distinctions only adhering to the conventional honour and good breeding of the world but before her his moral sense awakened 'the marquis xavier would bid me go from here' he thought to himself as the night wore on and he heard the footfall of the monks passing down the passages to their midnight orisons 'after all these years in the pourriture of paris have i such a thing as conscience left' he asked his own thoughts bitterly the moon passed behind a cloud and darkness fell over the lake and hid the great pile of the hohenszalrasburg from his sight he closed the casement and turned away 'farewell' he said to the vanished castle 'will you think of me sometimes dear princess when i am far away' said sabran abruptly the next morning to his best friend who looked up startled 'away are you going away' 'yes' said sabran abruptly 'and you i think madame who have been so good to me can guess easily why' 'you love my niece' he inclined his head in silence 'it is very natural' said the princess faintly 'wanda is a beautiful woman many men have loved her they might as well have loved that glacier yonder' 'it is not that' said sabran hastily 'it is my own poverty ' the princess looked at him keenly 'do you think her not cold' 'she who can so love a brother would surely love her lover not less did she stoop to one' he replied evasively 'at least i think so i ought not to presume to judge' 'and you care for her' the glance her eyes gave him added as plainly as words could have done 'it is not only her wealth her position are you sure' he coloured very much as he answered quickly 'were she beggared to morrow you would see' 'it is a pity' murmured the princess he did not ask her what she regretted he knew her sympathy was with him they were both mute the princess pushed the end of her cane thoughtfully into the velvet turf she hesitated some moments then said in a low voice 'were i you i would stay' 'do not tempt me i have stayed too long as it is what can she think of me' 'she does not think about your reasons she is too proud a woman to be vain in a measure you have won her friendship perhaps i do not know i have no grounds to say so but perhaps in time you might win more' she looked at him as she concluded he grew exceedingly pale he stooped over her chair and spoke very low 'it is just because that appears possible that i go do not misunderstand me i am not a coxcomb je ne me pose pas en vainqueur but i have no place here since i have no equality with her from which to be able to say i love you absence alone can say it for me without offence as without hope' the princess was silent she was thinking of the maxim l'absence teint les petites passions et allume les grandes' which was his 'you have been so good to me' he murmured caressingly 'so benevolent so merciful i dare to ask of you a greater kindness yet will you explain for me to the countess von szalras that i am called away suddenly and make my excuses and my farewell it will save me much fruitless pain' 'and if it give her pain' 'i cannot suppose that and i should not dare to hope it' 'i have no reason to suppose it either but i think you are de guerre las before the battle is decided' 'there is no battle possible for me there is only a quite certain dishonour' his face was dark and weary he spoke low and with effort she glanced at him and felt the vague awe with which strong unintelligible emotion always filled her 'you must judge the question for yourself' she said with a little hesitation 'i will express what you wish to my niece if you really desire it' 'you are always so good to me' he murmured with some agitation and he bent down before her and reverently kissed her little white hands 'god be with you sir' she said with tears in her own tender eyes 'you have been so good to me' he murmured 'the purest hours of my worthless life have been spent at hohenszalras here only have i known what peace and holiness can mean give me your blessing ere i go' in another moment he had bowed himself from her presence and the princess sat mute and motionless in the sun when she looked up at the great feudal pile of the schloss which towered above her it was with reproach and aversion to that stone emblem of the great possessions of its chtelaine 'if she were a humbler woman' she thought 'how much happier she would be what a pity it all is what a pity of course he is right of course he can do nothing else if he did do anything else the world would condemn him and even she very likely would despise him but it is such a pity if only she could have a woman's natural life about her this life is not good it is very well while she is young but when she shall be no longer young' and the tender heart of the old gentlewoman ached for a sorrow not her own and could she have given him a duchy to make him able to declare his love she would have done so at all costs chapter vii the sun was setting when the countess wanda returned from her distant ride she dismounted at the foot of the terrace steps and ascended them slowly with donau and neva behind her both tired and breathless 'you are safe home my love' said the princess turning her head towards the steps 'yes dear mother mine you always i know think that death gets up on the saddle is anything amiss you looked troubled' 'i have a message for you' said the princess with a sigh and she gave sabran's wanda von szalras heard in silence she showed neither surprise nor regret the princess waited a little 'well' she said at length 'well you do not even ask me why he goes' 'you say he has been called away' her niece answered 'surely that is reason enough' 'you have no heart wanda' 'i do not understand you' said the countess von szalras very coldly 'do you mean to say you have not seen that he loved you' the face of wanda grew colder still 'did he instruct you to say this also' 'no no' said the princess hurriedly perceiving her error 'he only bade me say that he was called away and must leave at once and begged you to accept through me his adieus and the expression of his gratitude but it is very certain that he does love you and that because he is too poor and too proud to say so he goes' 'you must weave your little romance' said her niece with some impatience striking the gilt wicker table with her riding whip 'i prefer to think that m de sabran is very naturally gone back to the world to which he belongs my only wonder has been that he has borne so long with the solitudes of the szalrassee' 'if you were not the most sincere woman in the world i should believe you were endeavouring to deceive me as it is' said the princess with some temper 'i can only suppose that you deceive yourself' 'have you any tea there' said her niece laying aside her gauntlets and her whip and casting some cakes to the two hounds she had very plainly and resolutely closed the subject almost before it was fairly opened the princess a little intimidated and keenly disappointed did not venture to renew it when the next morning questioning hubert the princess found that indeed her favourite had left the island monastery at dawn the landscape of the hohe tauern seemed to her more monotonous and melancholy than it had ever done and the days more tedious and dull 'you will miss the music at least' she said with asperity to her niece 'i suppose you will give him as much regret as you have done at times to the abb liszt' 'i shall miss the music certainly' said the countess wanda calmly 'our poor kapellmeister is very indifferent if he were not so old that it would be cruel to displace him i would take another from the conservatorium' the princess was irritated and even incensed at the reply but she let it pass sabran's name was mentioned no more between them for many days no one knew whither he had gone and no tidings came of him to hohenszalras one day a foreign journal amongst the many news sheets that came by post there contained his name 'the marquis de sabran broke the bank at monte carlo yesterday' was all that it said in its news of the riviera 'a winner at a tripot what a hero for you mother mine' she said with some bitterness handing the paper to the princess she was surprised at the disgust and impatience which she felt herself what could it concern her that day as she rode slowly through the grass drives of her forests she thought with pain of her companion of a few weeks who so late had ridden over these very paths beside her the dogs racing before them the wild flowers scenting the air the pale sunshine falling down across the glossy necks of their horses 'he ought to do better things than break a bank at a gaming place' she thought with regret 'with such natural gifts of body and mind it is a sin a sin against himself and others to waste his years in those base and trivial follies when he was here he seemed to feel so keenly the charm of nature the beauty of repose the possibility of noble effort' she let the reins droop on her mare's throat and paced slowly over the moss and the grass though she was all alone for in her own forests she would not be accompanied even by a groom the colour came into her face as she remembered many things many words many looks which confirmed the assertion madame ottilie had made to her 'that may very well be' she thought 'but if it be i think my memory might have restrained him from becoming the hero of a gambling apotheosis' and she was astonished at herself to find how much regret mingled with her disgust and how much her disgust was intensified by a sentiment of personal offence when she reached home it was twilight and she was told that her cousin prince egon vsrhely had arrived she would have been perfectly glad to see him if she had been perfectly sure that he would have accepted quietly the reply she had sent to his letter received on the night of the great storm as it was she met him in the blue room before the princess ottilie and nothing could be said on that subject prince egon though still young had already a glorious past behind him he came of a race of warriors and the vsrhely hussars had been famous since the days of maria theresa the command of that brilliant regiment was hereditary and he had led them in repeated charges into the french lines and the prussian lines with such headlong and dauntless gallantry that he had been called the 'wild boar of tarc' throughout the army his hussars were the most splendid cavalry that ever shook their bridles in the sunlight on the wide magyar plains their uniform remained the same as in the days of aspern and he was prodigal of gold and embroidery and rich furs and trappings with that martial coquetry which has been characteristic of so many great soldiers from scylla to michael skobeleff with his regiment in the field and without it in many adventures in the wilder parts of the austrian empire and on the turkish border he had become a synonym for heroism throughout the imperial army whilst in his manner and mode of life no more magnificent noble ever came from the dim romantic solitudes of hungary to the court and the capital he had great personal beauty he had unrivalled traditions of valour and he had a character as generous as it was daring but he failed to awaken more than a sisterly attachment in the heart of his cousin she had been so used to see him with her brothers that he seemed as near to her as they had been she loved him tenderly but with no sort of passion she wondered that he should care for her in that sense and grew sometimes impatient of his reiterated prayers 'there are so many women who would listen to him and adore him' she said 'why must he come to me before bela's death and before she became her own mistress she had always urged that her own sisterly affection for egon made any thought of marriage with him out of the question 'i am fond of him as i was of gela and victor' she said often to those who pressed the alliance upon her 'but that is not love i will not marry a man whom i do not love' when she became absolutely her own mistress he was for some time silent fearing to importune her or to seem mercenary she had become by bela's death one of the greatest alliances in europe but at length confident that his own position exempted him from any possible appearance of covetousness he gently reminded her of her father's and her brother's wishes but to no effect she gave him the same answer 'you are sure of my affection but i will not do you so bad a service as to become your wife i have no love for you' from that he had no power to move or change her he had made her many appeals in his frequent visits to hohenszalras but none with any success in inducing her to depart from the frank and placid regard of close relationship she liked him well and held him in high esteem but this was not love nor had she consented to call it love would it ever have contented the impetuous ardent and passionate spirit of egon vsrhely they could not be lovers but they still remained friends partly through consanguinity partly because he could bear to see her thus so long as no other was nearer to her than he they greeted each other now cordially and simply and talked of the many cares and duties and interests that sprang up daily in the administration of such vast properties as theirs prince vsrhely though a brilliant soldier and magnificent noble was simple in his tastes and occupied himself largely with the welfare of his people the princess yawned discreetly behind her fan many times during this conversation to her utterly uninteresting upon villages vines harvests bridges swept away by floods stewards just and unjust and the tolls and general navigation of the danube quite tired of all these details and discussion of subjects which she considered ought to be abandoned to the men of business she said suddenly in a pause 'egon did you ever know a very charming person the marquis de sabran' vsrhely reflected a moment 'no' he answered slowly 'i have no recollection of such a name' 'i thought you might have met him in paris' 'i am so rarely in paris since my father's death i have scarcely passed a month there who is he' 'a stranger whose acquaintance we made through his being cast adrift here in a storm' said the countess wanda with some impatience 'my dear aunt is devoted to him because he has painted her a st ottilie on a screen with the skill of meissonnier since he left us he has become celebrated he has broken the bank at monte carlo' egon vsrhely looked at her quickly 'it seems to anger you did this stranger stay here any time' 'sometime yes he had a bad accident on the venediger herr greswold brought him to our island to pass his convalescence with the monks from the monks to monte carlo it is at least a leap requiring some elasticity in moral gymnastics' she spoke with some irritation which did not escape the ear of her cousin he said merely himself 'did you receive him knowing nothing about him' 'we certainly did it was an imprudence but if he paint like meissonnier he plays like liszt who was to resist such a combination of gifts' 'you say that very contemptuously wanda' said the prince 'i am not contemptuous of the talent i am of the possessor of it who comprehends his own powers so little that he breaks the bank at monaco' 'i envy him at least his power to anger you' said egon vsrhely 'i am angered to see anything wasted' she answered conscious of the impatience she had shown 'i was very angry with otto's little daughter yesterday she had gathered a huge bundle of cowslips and thrown it down in the sun it was ingratitude to god who made them this friend of my aunt's does worse he changes his cowslip into monkshood' 'is he indeed such a favourite of yours dear mother' said vsrhely the princess answered petulantly 'certainly a charming person and our cousin kaulnitz knows him well wanda for once talks foolishly gambling is it is true a great sin at all times but i do not know that it is worse at public tables than it is in your clubs i myself am of course ignorant of these matters but i have heard that privately at cards whole fortunes have been lost in a night scribbled away with a pencil on a scrap of paper' 'to lose a fortune is better than to win one' said her niece as she rose from the head of her table when the princess slept in her blue room egon vsrhely approached his cousin where she sat at her embroidery frame 'this stranger has the power to make you angry' he said sadly 'i have not even that' 'dear egon' she said tenderly 'you have done nothing in your life that i could despise why should you be discontented at that' 'would you care if i did' 'certainly i should be very sorry if my noble cousin did anything that could belie his chivalry but why should we suppose impossibilities' 'suppose we were not cousins would you love me then' 'how can i tell this is mere non sense ' 'no it is all my life you know wanda that i have loved you only you ever since i saw you as i came back from france a child but such a beautiful child with your hair braided with pearls and a dress all stiff with gold and your lap full of red roses' 'oh i remember' she said hastily 'there was a child's costume ball at the hof i called myself elizabeth of thuringia and bela my own bela was my little louis of hungary oh egon why will you speak of those times' 'because surely they make a kind of tie between us they ' 'they do make one that will last all our lives unless you strain it to bear a weight it is not made to bear dear egon you are very dear to me but not dear so as my cousin my gallant kind and loyal cousin you are very precious to me but egon if you could force me to be your wife i should not be indifferent to you i should hate you' he grew white under his olive skin he shrank a little as if he suffered some sharp physical pain 'hate me' he echoed in a stupor of surprise and suffering 'i believe i should i could hate it is a frightful thing to say dear egon look elsewhere find some other amongst the many lovely women that you see do not waste your brilliant life on me i shall never say otherwise than i say to night' and you will compel me to lose the most trusted friend i have' he was still very pale he breathed heavily there was a mist over his handsome dark eyes which were cast down 'until you love any other i shall never abandon hope' 'that is unwise i shall probably love no one all my life long i have told you so often' 'all say so until love finds them out i will not trouble you i will be your cousin your friend rather than be nothing to you but it is hard' 'why think of me so your career has so much brilliancy so many charms so many interests ' 'you do not know what it is to love i talk to you in an unknown tongue and you have no pity because you do not understand' she did not answer over her thoughts passed the memory of the spinet whose music she had said he could not touch and waken he remained a week at hohenszalras but he did not again speak to her of his own sufferings he was a proud man though humble to her with a sort of contrition she noticed for the first time that he wearied her that when he spoke of his departure she was glad he was a fine soldier a keen hunter rather than a man of talents the life he loved best was his life at home in his great castles amidst the immense plains and the primeval forests of hungary and the lonely fastnesses of the karpathians or scouring a field of battle with his splendid troopers behind him all of them his kith and kin or men of his own soil whom he ruled with a firm high hand in a generous despotism when he was with her she missed all the graceful tact the subtle meanings the varied suggestions and allusions that had made the companionship of sabran so welcome to her egon vsrhely was no scholar no thinker no satirist he was only brave and generous as lions are and vaguely a poet without words from the wild solitudes he loved and the romance that lies in the nature of the magyar 'he knows nothing' she thought impatiently recalling the stores of most various and recondite knowledge with which her late companion had played so carelessly and with such ease it seemed to her that never in her life had she weighed her cousin in scales so severe and found him so utterly wanting and yet how many others she knew would have found their ideal in that gallant gentleman with his prowess and his hardihood and his gallantry in war and his winsome temper so full of fire to men so full of chivalry for women when prince egon in his glittering dress all fur and gold and velvet passed up the ball room at the burg in vienna no other man in all that magnificent assembly was so watched so admired so sighed for and he was her cousin and he only wearied her as he was leaving he paused a moment after bidding her farewell and after some moments of silence said in a low voice 'dear i will not trouble you again until you summon me perhaps that will be many years but whether we meet or not time will make no change in me i am your servant ever' then he bowed over her hand once more once more saluted her and in a moment or two the quick trot of the horses that bore him away woke the echoes of the green hills she looked out of the huge arched entrance door down the green defile that led to the outer world and felt a pang of self reproach of self condemnation 'if one could force oneself to love by any pilgrimage or penance' she thought 'there are none i would not take upon me to be able to love egon' as she stood thoughtfully there on the doorway of her great castle the sweet linnet like voice of the princess ottilie came on her ear it said a little shrilly 'you are always looking for a four leaved shamrock in that sort of search life slips away unperceived one is very soon left alone with one's dead leaves' wanda von szalras turned and smiled 'i am not afraid of being left alone' she said 'i shall have my people and my forests always' then apprehensive lest she should have seemed thankless and cold of heart she turned caressingly to madame ottilie 'nay i could not bear to lose you my sweet fairy godmother think me neither forgetful nor ungrateful' 'you could never be one or the other to me but i shall not live like a fairy godmother for ever before i die i would fain see you content like others with the shamrocks as nature has made them' 'i think there are few people as content as i am' said the countess wanda and said the truth 'you are content with yourself not with others you will pardon me if i say there is a great difference between the two' replied the princess ottilie with a little smile that was almost sarcastic on her pretty small features 'you mean that i have a great deal of vanity and no sympathy' 'you have a great deal of pride' said the princess discreetly as she began to take her customary noontide walk up and down the terrace her tall cane tapping the stones and her little dog running before her whilst a hood of point lace and a sunshade of satin kept the wind from her pretty white hair and the sun from her eyes that were still blue as the acres of mouse ear that grew by the lake chapter viii the summer glided away and became autumn and the countess wanda refused obstinately to fill hohenszalras with house parties in vain her aunt spoke of the lynau the windischgrtz the hohenlhe and the other great families who were their relatives or their friends in vain she referred continually to the fact that every schloss in austria and all adjacent countries was filling with guests at this season and the woods around it resounding with the hunter's horn and the hound's bay in vain did she recapitulate the glories of hohenszalras in an earlier time and hint that the mistress of so vast a domain owed some duties to society wanda von szalras opposed to all these suggestions and declarations that indifference which would have seemed obstinacy had it been less mild as for the hunting parties she avowed with truth that although a daughter of mighty hunters she herself regarded all pastimes founded on cruelty with aversion and contempt the bears and the boars the wild deer and the mountain chamois might dwell undisturbed for the whole of their lives so far as she was concerned when a bear came down and ate off the heads of an acre or two of wheat she recompensed the peasant who had suffered the loss but she would not have her jgermeister track the poor beast the jgermeister sighed as madame ottilie did for the bygone times when a score of princes and nobles had ridden out on a wolf chase or hundreds of peasants had threshed the woods to drive the big game towards the kaiser's rifle but for poachers his place would have been a sinecure and his days a weariness his mistress was not to be persuaded she preferred her forests left to their unbroken peace their stillness filled with the sounds of rushing waters and the calls of birds the weeks glided on one after one with the even measured pace of monotonous and unruffled time her hours were never unoccupied for her duties were constant and numerous she would go and visit the sennerinn in their loftiest cattle huts and would descend an ice slope with the swiftness and security of a practised mountaineer in her childhood she and bela had gone almost everywhere the chamois went and she came of a race which joined to high courage had the hereditary habits of a great endurance in the throne room of vienna with her great pearls about her that had once been sent by a sultan to a szalras who fought with wenceslaus she was the stateliest and proudest lady of the greatest aristocracy of the world but on her own mountain sides she was as dauntless as an ibis as sure footed as a goat and would sit in the alpine cabins and drink a draught of milk and break a crust of rye bread as willingly as though she were a sennerinn herself so she would take the oars and row herself unaided down the lake so she would saddle her horse and ride it over the wildest country so she would drive her sledge over many a german mile of snow and even in the teeth of a north wind blowing straight from the russian plains and the arctic seas 'fear nothing' had been said again and again to her in her childhood and she had learned that her race transmitted to and imposed its courage no less on its daughters than on its sons cato would have admired this mountain brood even though its mountain lair was more luxurious than he would have deemed was wise she knew thoroughly what all her rights titles and possessions were she was never vague or uncertain as to any of her affairs and it would have been impossible to deceive or to cheat her no one tried to do so for her lawyers were men of old fashioned ways and high repute and for centuries the vast properties of the counts von szalras had been administered wisely and honestly in the same advocates' offices which were close underneath the calvarienburg in the good city of salzburg her trustees were her uncle cardinal vsrhely and her great uncle prince george of lilienhhe they were old men both devoted to her and both fully conscious that her intelligence was much abler and keener than their own all these vast possessions gave her an infinite variety of occupation and of interests and she neglected none of them still all the properties and duties in the world will not suffice to fill up the heart and mind of a woman of four and twenty years of age who enjoys the perfection of bodily health and of physical beauty the most spiritual and the most dutiful of characters cannot altogether resist the impulses of nature there were times when she now began to think that her life was somewhat empty and passionless but a certain sense of their monotony had begun for the first time to come upon her a certain vague dissatisfaction stirred in her now and then the discontent of sabran seemed to have left a shadow of itself upon her for the first time she seemed to be listening as it were to her life and to find a great silence in it there was no echo in it of voices she loved why had she never perceived it before why did she become conscious of it now she asked herself this impatiently as the slight but bitter flavour of dissatisfaction touched her and the days for once seemed now and then over long she loved her people and her forests and her mountains and she had always thought that they would be sufficient for her and she had honestly told the princess that of solitude she was not afraid and yet a certain sense that her life was cold and in a measure empty had of late crept upon her she wondered angrily why a vague and intangible melancholy stole on her at times which was different from the sorrow which still weighed on her for her brother's death now and then she looked at the old painted box of the spinet and thought of the player who had awakened its dumb strings but she did not suspect for a moment that it was in any sense his companionship which now that it was lost made the even familiar tenor of her time appear monotonous and without much interest in the long evenings whilst the princess slumbered and she herself sat alone watching the twilight give way to the night over the broad and solemn landscape she felt a lassitude which did not trouble her in the open air in the daylight or when she was busied indoors over the reports and requirements of her estates unacknowledged indeed unknown to her she missed the coming of the little boat from the holy isle and missed the prayer and praise of the great tone poets rolling to her ear from the organ within if anyone had told her that her late guest had possessed any such power to make her days look grey and pass tediously she would have denied it and been quite sincere in her denial but as he had called out the long mute music from the spinet so he had touched if only faintly certain chords in her nature that until then had been dumb 'i am not like you my dear olga' she wrote to her relative the countess brancka 'i am not easily amused that course effrne of the great world carries you honestly away with it all those incessant balls those endless visits those interminable conferences on your toilettes that continual circling of human butterflies round you those perpetual courtships of half a score of young men it all diverts you you are never tired of it you cannot understand any life outside its pale all your days whether they pass in paris or petersburg at trouville at biarritz or at vienna or scheveningen are modelled on the same lines you must have excitement as you have your cup of chocolate when you wake what i envy you is that the excitement excites you when i was amidst it i was not excited i was seldom even diverted see the misfortune that it is to be born with a grave nature i am as serious as marcus antoninus you will say that it comes of having learned latin and greek i do not think so i fear i was born unamusable i only truly care about horses and trees and they are both grave things though a horse can be playful enough sometimes when he is allowed to forget his servitude your friends the famous tailors send me admirably chosen costumes which please that sense in me which titians and vandycks do i do not mean to be profane but i only put them on as the monks do their frocks perhaps i am very unworthy of them at least i cannot talk toilette as you can with ardour a whole morning and every whole morning of your life you will think i am laughing at you indeed i am not i envy your faculty of sitting as i am sure you are sitting now in a straw chair on the shore with a group of boulevardiers around you and a crowd making a double hedge to look at you when it is your pleasure to pace the planks my language is involved i do not envy you the faculty of doing it of course i could do it myself to morrow i envy you the faculty of finding amusement in doing it and finding flattery in the double hedge' a few days afterwards the countess brancka wrote back in reply 'the world is like wine a se mousse et a monte there are heads it does not affect there are palates that do not like it yours amongst them but there is so much too in habit living alone amidst your mountains you have lost all taste for the brouhaha of society which grows noisier it must be said every year yes we are noisy we have lost our dignity you alone keep yours you are the chtelaine of the middle ages perceforest or parsifal should come riding to your gates of granite by the way i hear you have been entertaining one of our boulevardiers rn de sabran is charming and the handsomest man in paris but he is not parsifal or perceforest between ourselves he has an indifferent reputation but perhaps he has repented on your holy isle they say he is changed that he has quarrelled with cochonette and that he is about to be made deputy for his department whose representative has just died pardon me for naming cochonette it is part of our decadence that we laugh about all these naughty things and naughty people who are after all not so very much worse than we are ourselves but you do not laugh whether at these or at anything else you are too good my beautiful wanda it is your sole defect you have even inoculated this poor marquis who after a few weeks upon the szalrassee surrenders cochonette for the chamber my term of service comes round next month if you will have me i will take the tauern on my road to gdll i long to embrace you' 'olga will take pity on our solitude' said wanda von szalras to her aunt 'i have not seen her for four years but i imagine she is little changed' the princess read the letter frowning and pursing her lips together in pretty rebuke as she came to the name of cochonette 'they have indeed lost all dignity' she said with a sigh 'and something more than dignity also olga was always frivolous' 'all her monde is not she more than another' 'you were very unjust you see to m de sabran he pays you the compliment of following your counsels' wanda von szalras rose a little impatiently 'he had better have followed them before he broke the bank at monaco it is an odd sort of notoriety with which to attract the pious and taciturn bretons and when he was here he had no convictions i suppose he picked them up with the gold pieces at the tables' olga countess brancka ne countess seriatine of a noble russian family had been married at sixteen to the young gela von szalras who a few months after his bridal had been shot dead on the battlefield of solferino after scarce a year of mourning she had fascinated the brother of egon vsrhely a mere youth who bore the title of count brancka there had been long and bitter opposition made to the new alliance on the part of both families on account of the consanguinity between stefan brancka and her dead lord but opposition had only increased the ardour of the young man and the young widow they had borne down all resistance procured all dispensations had been wedded and in a year's time had both wished the deed undone both were extravagant capricious self indulgent and unreasonable their two egotisms were in a perpetual collision they met but seldom and never met without quarrelling violently the only issue of their union was two little fantastic artificial fairies who were called respectively mila and marie at the time of the marriage of the branckas wanda had been too young to share in opposition to it but the infidelity to her brother's memory had offended and wounded her deeply and in her inmost heart she had never pardoned it though the wife of stefan brancka had been a passing guest at hohenszalras where had count gela lived she would have reigned as sovereign mistress that his sister reigned there in her stead the countess olga resented keenly and persistently her own portion of the wealth of the szalras had been forfeited under her first marriage contract by her subsequent alliance but she never failed to persuade herself that her exclusion from every share in that magnificent fortune was a deep wrong done to herself and she looked upon wanda von szalras as the doer of that wrong in appearance however she was always cordial caressing affectionate and if wanda chose to mistrust her affection it was she reflected only because a life of unwise solitude had made a character naturally grave become severe and suspicious she did not fail to arrive there a week later she was a small slender lovely woman with fair skin auburn hair wondrous black eyes and a fragile frame that never knew fatigue she held a high office at the imperial court but when she was not on service she spent under the plea of health all her time at paris or les eaux she came with her numerous attendants her two tiny children and a great number of huge fourgons full of all the newest marvels of combination in costume she was seductive and caressing but she was capricious malicious and could be even violent in general she was gaily given up to amusement and intrigue but she had moments of rage that were uncontrollable she had had many indiscretions and some passions but the world liked her none the less for that she was a great lady and in a sense a happy woman for she had nerves of steel despite all her maladies and brought to the pleasures of life an unflagging and even ravenous zest when with her perfume of paris her restless animation her children like little figures from a fashion plate her rapid voice that was shrill yet sweet like a silver whistle and her eyes that sparkled alike with mirth and with malice she came on to the stately terraces of hohenszalras she seemed curiously discordant with it and its old world peace and gravity she was like a pen and ink sketch of cham thrust between the illuminated miniatures of a missal she felt it herself 'it is the roman de la rose in stone' she said as her eyes roved over the building which she had not visited for four years 'and you wanda you look like yseulte of the white hand or the marguerite des marguerites you must be sorry you did not live in those times' 'yes if only for one reason one could make the impress of one's own personality so much more strongly on the time' 'and now the times mould us we are all horribly alike there is only yourself who retain any individuality amidst all the women that i know 'la meule du pressoir de l'abrutissement might have been written of our world after all you are wise to keep out of it my straw chair at trouville looks trumpery beside that ivory chair in your rittersal i read the other day of some actresses dining off a truffled pheasant and a sack of bon bons that is the sort of dinner we make all the year round morally metaphorically how do you say it it makes us thirsty and perhaps i am not sure perhaps it leaves us half starved though we nibble the sweetmeats and don't know it 'your dinner must lack two things bread and water' 'yes we never see either it is all truffles and caramels and vins frapps' 'there is your bread' she glanced at the little children two pretty graceful little maids of six and seven years old 'ouf' said the countess zelenka 'they are only little bits of puff paste a couple of petits fours baked on the boulevards if they be chic and marry well i for one shall ask no more of them if ever you have children i suppose you will rear them on science and the antonines' 'perhaps on the open air and homer' said wanda with a smile the countess brancka was silent a moment then said abruptly 'you dismissed egon again' 'has he made you his ambassadress' 'no oh no he is too proud only we all are aware of his wishes wanda do you know that you have some cruelty in you some sternness' 'i think not the cruelty would be to grant the wishes with a loveless wife egon would be much more unhappy than he is now' 'oh after a few months he would not care you know they never do to unite your fortunes is the great thing you could lead your lives as you liked' 'our fortunes do very well apart' said the countess von szalras with a patience which cost her some effort 'yours is immense' said madame brancka with a sigh for her own and her husband's wealth had been seriously involved by extravagance and that high play in which they both indulged 'and it must accumulate in your hands you cannot spend much i do not see how you could spend much you never receive you never go to your palaces you never leave hohenszalras and you are so wise a woman that you never commit any follies' wanda was silent it did not appear to her that she was called on to discuss her expenditure dinner was announced their attendants took away the children the princess woke up from a little dose and said suddenly 'olga is m de sabran elected' 'aunt ottilie' said her niece hastily 'has lost her affections to that gentleman because he painted her saint on a screen and had all old haydn at his fingers' ends' 'the election does not take place until next month' said the countess 'he will certainly be returned because of the blind fidelity of the department to his name the odd thing is that he should wish to be so' 'wanda told him it was his duty' said princess ottilie with innocent malice the less innocent malice of the countess brancka's eyes fell for a passing moment with inquiry and curiosity on the face of her hostess which however told her nothing 'then he was parsifal or perceforest' she cried 'and he has ridden away to find the emerald cup of tradition what a pity that he paused on his way to break the bank at monte carlo the two do not accord i fear he is but lancelot' 'there is no reason why he should not pursue an honourable ambition' said the princess with some offence 'no reason at all even if it be not an honourable one' said madame brancka with a curious intonation 'he always wins at baccara he has done some inimitable caricatures which hang at the mirliton he is an amateur rubenstein and he has been the lover of cochonette these are his qualifications for the chamber and if they be not as valiant ones as those of les preux they are at least more amusing' 'my dear olga' said the princess with a certain dignity of reproof 'you are not on your straw chair at trouville there are subjects expressions suggestions which are not agreeable to my ears or on your lips' 'cochonette' murmured the offender with a graceful little curtsey of obedience and contrition 'oh madame if you knew a year ago we talked of nothing else' the countess brancka wished to talk still of nothing else and though she encountered a chillness and silence that would have daunted a less bold spirit she contrived to excite in the princess a worldly and almost unholy curiosity concerning that heroine of profane history who had begun life in a little bakehouse of the batignolles and had achieved the success of putting her name or her nickname upon the lips of all paris throughout dinner she spoke of little save of cochonette that goddess of bouffe and of parsifal as she persisted in baptising the one lover to whom alone the goddess had ever been faithful with ill concealed impatience her hostess bore awhile with the subject then dismissed it somewhat peremptorily 'we are provincials my dear olga' she said with a very cold inflection of contempt in her voice 'we are very antiquated in our ways and our views bear with our prejudices and do not scare our decorum we keep it by us as we keep kingfishers' skins amongst our furs in summer against moth a mere superstition i daresay but we are only rustic people' 'how you say that wanda' said her guest with a droll little laugh 'and you look like marie antoinette all the while why will you bury yourself you would only need to be seen in paris a week and all the world would turn after you and go back to tradition and ermine instead of chien and plush if you live another ten years as you live now you will turn hohenszalras into a religious house and even mme ottilie would regret that you will institute a carmelite order because white becomes you so poor egon he would sooner have you laugh about cochonette' the evening was chill but beautifully calm and free of mist wanda von szalras walked out on to the terrace whilst her cousin and guest missing the stimulus of her usual band of lovers and friends curled herself up on a deep chair and fell sound asleep like a dormouse there was no sound on the night except the ripple of the lake water below and the splash of torrents falling down the cliffs around a sense of irritation and of pleasure moved her both in the same moment what was a french courtesan a singer of lewd songs an interpreter of base passions to her nothing except a creature to be loathed and pitied as men in health feel a disgusted compassion for disease yet she felt a certain anger stir in her as she recalled all this frivolous trivial ill flavoured chatter of her cousin's and what was it to her if one of the many lovers of this woman had cast her spells from about him and left her for a manlier and a worthier arena yet she could not resist a sense of delicate distant homage to herself in the act in the mute obedience to her counsels such as a knight might render even lancelot with stained honour and darkened soul the silence of it touched her he had said nothing only by mere chance in the idle circling of giddy rumour she learned he had remembered her words and followed her suggestion there was a subtle and flattering reverence in it which pleased the taste of a woman who was always proud but never vain and to any noble temperament there is a singularly pure and honest joy in the consciousness of having been in any measure the means of raising higher instincts and loftier desires in any human soul that was not dead but dormant the shrill voice of olga brancka startled her as it broke in on her musings 'i have been asleep' she cried as she rose out of her deep chair and came forth into the moonlight 'pray forgive me wanda you will have all that drowsy water running and tumbling all over the place it makes one think of the voices in the sistine in passion week there are the gloom the hush the sigh the shriek the eternal appeal the eternal accusation that water would drive me into hysteria could you not drain it divert it send it underground silence it somehow' 'when you can keep the neva flowing at new year perhaps i shall be able but i would not if i could i have had all that water about me from babyhood when i am away from the sound of it i feel as if some hand had woolled up my ears' 'that is what i feel when i am away from the noise of the streets oh wanda to think that you can do utterly as you like and yet do not like to have the sea of light of the champs lyses or the graben before your eyes rather than that gliding dusky water' 'the water is a mirror i can see my own soul in it and nature's perhaps one hopes even sometimes to see god's' 'that is not living my dear it is dreaming' 'oh no my life is very real it is as real as light to darkness it is absolute prose' 'make it poetry then that is very easy' 'poetry is to the poetical i am by no means poetical my stud book my stewards' ledgers my bankers' accounts form the chief of my literature you know i am a practical farmer' 'i know you are one of the most beautiful and one of the richest women in europe and you live as if you were fifty years old ugly and dvote all this will grow on you in a few years' time you will be a hermit a prude an ascetic you will found a new order and be canonised after death' 'my aunt is afraid that i shall die a freethinker it is hard to please every one' replied the countess wanda with unruffled good humour 'it is poetical people who found religious orders enthusiasts visionaries i wish i were one of them but i am not the utmost i can do is to follow george herbert's precept and sweep my own little chambers so that this sweeping may be in some sort a duty done' 'you are a good woman wanda and i dare say a grand one but you are too grave for me' 'you mean that i am dull people always grow dull who live much alone' 'but you could have the whole world at your feet if you only raised a finger' 'that would not amuse me at all' her guest gave an impatient movement of her shoulders after a little she said 'did rn de sabran amuse you' wanda von szalras hesitated a moment 'in a measure he interested me' she answered being a perfectly truthful woman 'he is a man who has the capacity of great things but he seems to me to be his own worst enemy if he had fewer gifts he might probably have more achievement a waste of power is always a melancholy sight' 'he is only a boulevardier you know' 'no doubt your paris asphalte is the modern embodiment of circe' 'but he is leaving circe' 'so much the better for him if he be but i do not know why you speak of him so much he is a stranger to me and will never most likely cross my path again' 'oh parsifal will come back' said madame brancka with a little smile 'hohenszalras is his holy grail' 'he can scarcely come uninvited and who will invite him here' said the mistress of hohenszalras with cold literalness 'destiny will the great master of the ceremonies who disposes of us all' said her cousin 'destiny' said wanda with some contempt 'ah you are superstitious irreligious people always are you believe in mesmerism and disbelieve in god' 'oh most holy mother cannot you make wanda a little like other people' said the countess brancka when her hostess had left her alone with princess ottilie 'she is as much a fourteenth century figure as any one of those knights in the rittersal' 'wanda is a gentlewoman' said the princess drily 'you great ladies are not always that my dear olga you are all very piquantes and provocantes no doubt but you have forgotten what dignity is like and perhaps you have forgotten too what self respect is like it is but another old fashioned word' chapter ix the late summer passed on into full autumn and he never returned to the little isle under the birches and willows the monks spoke of him often with the wondering admiration of rustic recluses for one who had seemed to them the very incarnation of that world which to them was only a vague name his talents were remembered his return was longed for a silver reliquary and an antique book of plain song which he had sent them were all that remained to them of his sojourn there as they angled for trout under the drooping boughs or sat and dosed in the cloister as the rain fell they talked together of that marvellous visitant with regret sometimes they said to one another that they had fancied once upon a time he would have become lord there where the spires and pinnacles and shining sloping roofs of the great schloss rose amidst the woods across the szalrassee when their grand prior heard them say so he rebuked them 'our lady is a true daughter of the holy church' he said 'all the lands and all the wealth she has will come to the church you will see should we outlive her which the saints send we may not do that the burg will be bequeathed by her to form a convent of ursulines it is the order she most loves' she overheard him say so once when she sat in her boat beneath the willows drifting by under the island and she sighed impatiently 'no i shall not do that' she thought 'the religious foundations did a great work in their time but that time is over they can no more resist the pressure of the change of thought and habit than i can set sail like s ursula with eleven thousand virgins hohenszalras shall go to the crown they will do what seems best with it but i may live fifty years and more' a certain sadness came over her as she thought so a long life a lonely life appalled her even though it was cradled in all luxury and strengthened with all power 'if only my bela were living' she said half aloud and the water grew dim to her sight as it flowed away green and sparkling into the deep long shadows of its pine clothed shores shadows stretching darkly across its western side whilst the eastern extremity was still warm in the afternoon light the great pile of hohenszalras seemed to tower up into the very clouds the evening sun not yet sunk behind the venediger range shone ruddily on all its towers and its gothic spires and the grim sculptures and the glistening metal with which it was so lavishly ornamented were illumined till it looked like some colossal and enchanted citadel where soon the magic ivory horn of childe boland might sound and wake the spell bound warders if only bela lord of all had lived but her regret was not only for her brother in the october of that year her solitude was broken her sovereign signified her desire to see hohenszalras again they were about to visit salzburg and expressed their desire to pass three days in the iselthal there was nothing to be done but to express gratitude for the honour and make the necessary preparations the von szalras had been always loyal allies rather than subjects and their devotion to the habsburg house had been proved in many ways and with constancy she felt that she would rather have to collect and equip a regiment of horse as her fathers had done than fill her home with the tapage inevitable to an imperial reception but she was not insensible to the friendship that dictated this mark of honour 'fate conspires to make me break my resolutions' she said to the princess who answered with scant sympathy 'there are some resolutions much more wisely broken than persevered in your vows of solitude are amongst them' 'three days will not long affect my solitude' 'who knows at all events hohenszalras for those three days will be worthy of its traditions if only it will not rain' 'we will hope that it may not let us prepare the list of invitations' when she had addressed all the invitations to some fifty of the greatest families of the empire for the house party she took one of the cards engraved 'to meet their imperial majesties' and hesitated some moments then wrote across it the name of sabran 'you will like to see your friend' she said as she passed it to her aunt 'certainly i should like to do so but i am quite sure he will not come' 'not come' 'i think he will not you will never understand my dear wanda that men may love you' 'i certainly saw nothing of love in the conversation of m de sabran' she answered with some irritation 'in his conversation very likely not he is a proud man and poor' 'since he has ceased to visit monte carlo' 'you are ungenerous wanda' 'i' the accusation fell on her with a shock of surprise under which some sense of error stirred was it possible she could be ungenerous she whose character had always even in its faults been cast on lines so broad she let his invitation go away with the rest in the post bag to matrey in a week his answer came with others he was very sensible very grateful but the political aspect of the time forbade him to leave france his election had entailed on him many obligations the chamber would meet next month etc etc he laid his homage and regrets at the feet of the ladies of hohenszalras 'i was sure he would say so' the princess observed it did not lie within her christian obligations to spare the 'je vous l'avais bien dit' 'it is very natural that he should not jeopardise his public prospects' answered wanda herself angrily conscious of a disappointment with which there was mingled also a sense of greater respect for him than she had ever felt 'he cares nothing at all about those' said the princess sharply 'if he had the position of egon he would come his political prospects do you pretend to be ignorant that he only went to the chamber as he went to romaris because you recommended ambition and activity' 'if that be the case he is most wise not to come' answered with some coldness the chtelaine of hohenszalras and she went to visit the stables which would be more important in the eyes of her imperial mistress than any other part of the castle 'she will like cadiga' she thought as she stroked the graceful throat of an arab mare which she had had over from africa three months before a pure bred daughter of the desert 'shod with lightning' she conversed long with her stallmeister ulrich and gave him various directions 'we are all grown very rustic and old fashioned here' she said with a smile 'but the horses at least will not disgrace us' ulrich asked his most high countess if the margraf von sabran would be of the house party and when she answered 'no' said with regret that no one had ever looked so well on siegfried as he had done 'he did ride very well' she said and turned to the stall where the sorrel siegfried stood she sighed unconsciously as she drew the tufted hair hanging over the horse's forehead through her fingers with tenderness what if she were to make siegfried and all else his if it were true that he loved her she thrust the thought away almost before it took any real shape 'i do not even believe it' she said half aloud and yet in her innermost heart she did believe it the imperial visit was made and became a thing of the past the state apartments were opened the servants wore their state liveries the lake had its banners and flags its decorated landing stairs and velvet cushioned boats the stately and silent place was full for three days and nights of animated and brilliant life and great hunting parties rejoiced the soul of old otto and made the forests ring with sound of horn and rifle the culverins on the keep fired their salutes the chimes of the island monastery echoed the bells of the clock tower of the schloss the schools sang with clear fresh voices the kaiser's hymn the sun shone the jger were in full glory the castle was filled with guests and their servants' the long unused theatre had a troop of viennese to play comedies on its bijou stage the ball room lined with its venetian mirrors and its reseiner gilding was lit up once more after many years of gloom the nobles of the provinces came from far and wide at the summons of the lady of hohenszalras and the greater nobles who formed the house party were well amused and well content whilst the imperial guests were frankly charmed with all things and honestly reluctant to depart when she accompanied them to the foot of the terrace stairs and there took leave of them she could feel that their visit had been one of unfeigned enjoyment and her farewell gift to her kaiserin was cadiga they had left early on the morning of the fourth day and the remainder of the day was filled till sunset by the departure of the other guests it was fatiguing and crowded when the last visitor had gone she dropped down on a great chair in the rittersal and gave a long drawn sigh of relief 'what a long strain on one's powers of courtesy' she murmured 'it is more exhausting than to climb gross glckner' 'it has been perfectly successful' said the princess whose cheeks were warm and whose eyes were bright with triumph 'it has been only a matter of money' said the countess von szalras with some contempt 'nothing makes one feel so bourgeoise as a thing like this any merchant or banker could do the same it is impossible to put any originality into it it is like diamonds any one only heard of yesterday could do as much if they had only the money to do it with you do not seem to see what i mean' 'i see that as usual you are discontented when any other woman would be in paradise' answered the princess a little tartly 'pray could the bourgeoise have a residence ten centuries old' 'i am afraid she could buy one easily' 'would that be the same thing' 'certainly not but it would enable her to do all i have done for the last three days if she had only money enough she could even give away cadiga' 'she could not get cadiga accepted' said mme ottilie drily 'you are tired my love and so do not appreciate your own triumphs it has been a very great success' 'they were very kind they are always so kind but all the time i could not help thinking were they not horribly fatigued it wearied me so myself i could not believe that they were otherwise than weary too' 'it has been a great success' repeated the princess 'but you are always discontented' wanda did not reply she leaned back against the cordovan leather back of the chair crushing her chestnut hair against the emblazoned scutcheon of her house she was very fatigued and her face was pale for three whole days and evenings to preserve an incessant vigilance of courtesy a continual assumption of interest an unremitting appearance of enjoyment a perpetual smile of welcome is very tedious work those in love with social successes are sustained by the consciousness of them but she was not an imperial visit more or less could add not one hair's breadth to the greatness of the house of szalras and there was a dull half conscious pain at the bottom of her heart she was thinking of egon vsrhely who had said he could not leave his regiment of rn de sabran who had said he could not leave his country even to those who care nothing for society and dislike the stir and noise of the world about them there is still always a vague sense of depression in the dispersion of a great party the house seems so strangely silent the rooms seem so strangely empty servants flitting noiselessly here and there a dropped flower a fallen jewel an oppressive scent from multitudes of fading blossoms a broken vase perhaps or perhaps a snapped fan these are all that are left of the teeming life crowded here one little moment ago though one may be glad they are all gone yet there is a certain sadness in it 'le lendemain de la fte' keeps its pathos even though the fte itself has possessed no poetry and no power to amuse the princess who was very fatigued too though she would not confess that social duties could ever exhaust anyone went softly away to her own room and wanda sat alone in the great rittersal with the afternoon light pouring through the painted casements on to the damascened armour and the flemish tapestries and the great dais at the end of the hall with its two headed eagle that dante cursed its draperies of gold coloured velvet its escutcheons in beaten and enamelled metal discontented the princess had left that truthful word behind her like a little asp creeping upon a marble floor it stung her conscience with a certain reproach her pride with a certain impatience discontented she who had always been so equable of temper so enamoured of solitude so honestly loyal to her people and her duties so entirely grateful to the placid days that came and went as calmly as the breathing of her breast was it possible she was discontented how all the great world that had just left her would have laughed at her and asked what doubled rose leaf made her misery no one hardly on earth could be more entirely free than she was more covered with all good gifts of fortune and of circumstances and she had always been so grateful to her life until now would she never cease to miss the coming of the little boat across from the holy isle she was angry that this memory should have so much power to pursue her thought and spoil the present hours had he but been there she knew very well that the pageantry of the past three days would not have been the mere empty formalities the mere gilded tedium that they had appeared to be to her on natures thoughtful and profound silence has sometimes a much greater power than speech now and then she surprised herself in the act of thinking how artificial human life had become when the mere accident of a greater or lesser fortune determined whether a man who respected himself could declare his feeling for a woman he loved it seemed lamentably conventional and unreal and yet had he not been fettered by silence he would have been no gentleman life resumed its placid even tenor at hohenszalras after this momentary disturbance autumn comes early in the glckner and venediger groups madame ottilie with a shiver heard the north winds sweep through the yellowing forests and watched the white mantle descend lower and lower down the mountain sides another winter was approaching a winter in which she would see no one hear nothing sit all day by her wood fire half asleep for sheer want of interest to keep her awake the very postboy was sometimes detained by the snowfall for whole days together in his passage to and from matrey 'it is all very well for you' she said pettishly to her niece 'you have youth you have strength you like to have four mad horses put in your sleigh and drive them like demoniacs through howling deserts of frozen pine forests and come home when the great stars are all out with your eyes shining like the planets and the beasts all white with foam and icicles you like that you can do it you prefer it before anything but i what have i to do one cannot eat nougats for ever nor yet read one's missal even you will allow that the evenings are horribly long your horses cannot help you there you embroider very artistically but they would do that all for you at any convent and to be sure you write your letters and audit your accounts but you might just as well leave it all to your lawyers olga brancka is quite right though i do not approve of her mode of expression but she is quite right you should be in the world' but she failed to move wanda by a hair's breadth and soon the hush of winter settled down on hohenszalras and when the first frost had hardened the ground the four black horses were brought out in the sleigh and their mistress wrapped in furs to the eyes began those headlong gallops through the silent forests which stirred her to a greater exhilaration than any pleasures of the world could have raised in her to guide those high mettled half broken high bred creatures fresh from freedom on the plains of the danube was like holding the reins of the winds one day at dusk as she returned from one of these drives and went to see the princess ottilie before changing her dress the princess received her with a little smile and a demure air of triumph of smiling triumph in her hand was an open letter which she held out to her niece 'read' she said with much self satisfaction 'see what miracles you and the holy isle can work' wanda took the letter which she saw at a glance was in the writing of sabran after some graceful phrases of homage to the princess he proceeded in it to say that he had taken his seat in the french chamber as deputy for his department 'i do not deceive myself' he continued 'the trust is placed in me for the sake of the memories of the dead sabran not because i am anything in the sight of these people but i will endeavour to be worthy of it i am a sorry idler and of little purpose and strength in life but i will endeavour to make my future more serious and more deserving of the goodness which was showered on me at hohenszalras it grieved me to be unable to profit by the permission so graciously extended to me at the time of their imperial majesties' sojourn with you but it was impossible for me to come my thoughts were with you as they are indeed every hour offer my homage to the countess von szalras with the renewal of my thanks' then with some more phrases of reverence and compliment blent in one to the venerable lady whom he addressed he ended an epistle which brought as much pleasure to the recipient as though she had been seventeen instead of seventy she watched the face of wanda during the perusal of these lines but she did not learn anything from its expression 'he writes admirably' she said when she had read it through 'and i think he is well fitted for a political career they say that it is always best in politics not to be burdened with convictions and he will be singularly free from such impediments for he has none' 'you are very harsh and unjust' said the princess angrily 'no person can pay you a more delicate compliment than lies in following your counsels and yet you have nothing better to say about it than to insinuate an unscrupulous immorality' 'politics are always immoral' 'why did you recommend them to him then' said the princess sharply 'they are better than some other things than rouge et noir for instance but i did not perhaps do right in advising a mere man of pleasure to use the nation as his larger gaming table' 'you are beyond my comprehension your wire drawing is too fine for my dull eyesight one thing is certainly quite clear to me dull as i am you live alone until you grow dissatisfied with everything there is no possibility of pleasing a woman who disapproves of the whole living world' 'the world sees few unmixed motives' said wanda to which the princess replied by an impatient movement 'the post has brought fifty letters for you i have been looking over the journals' she answered 'there is something you may also perhaps deign to read' she held out a french newspaper and pointed to a column in it wanda took it and read it standing it was a report of a debate in the french chamber she read in silence and attentively leaning against the great carved chimney piece 'i was not aware he was so good an orator' she said simply when she had finished reading 'you grant that it is a very fine speech a very noble speech' said madame otillie eagerly and with impatience 'you perceive the sensation it caused it is evidently the first time he has spoken you will see in another portion of the print how they praise him' 'he has acquired his convictions with rapidity he was a socialist when here' 'the idea a man of his descent has always the instincts of his order he may pretend to resist them but they are always stronger than he you might at least commend him wanda since your words turned him towards public life' 'he is no doubt eloquent' she answered with 'some reluctance 'that we could see here if he be equally sincere he will be a great gain to the nobility of france' 'why should you doubt his sincerity' 'is mere ambition ever sincere' 'i really cannot understand you you censured his waste of ability and accession you seem equally disposed to cavil at his exertions and use of his talent your prejudices are most cruelly tenacious' 'how can i applaud your friend's action until i am sure of his motive' 'his motive is to please you' thought the princess but she was too wary to say so she merely replied 'no motive is ever altogether unmixed as you cruelly observed but i should say that his must be on the whole sufficiently pure he wishes to relieve the inaction and triviality of a useless life' 'to embrace a hopeless cause is always in a manner noble' assented her niece 'and i grant you that he has spoken very well' then she went to her own room to dress for dinner in the evening she read the reported speech again with closer attention it was eloquent ironical stately closely reasoned and rose in its peroration to a caustic and withering eloquence of retort and invective it was the speech of a born orator but it was also the speech of a strongly conservative partisan 'how much of what he says does he believe' she thought with a doubt that saddened her and made her wonder why it came to her and whether he believed or not whether he were true or false in his political warfare whether he were selfish or unselfish in his ambitions what did it matter to her he had stayed there a few weeks and he had played so well that the echoes of his music still seemed to linger after him and that was all it was not likely they would ever meet again chapter x with the new year madame ottilie received another letter from him it was brief grateful and touching it concluded with a message of ceremonious homage to the chtelaine of hohenszalras of his entrance into political life it said nothing with the letter came a screen of gilded leather which he had painted himself with passages from the history of s julian hospitador 'it will seem worthless' he said 'where every chamber is a museum of art but accept it as a sign of my grateful and imperishable remembrance' the princess was deeply touched and sensibly flattered 'you will admit at least' she said with innocent triumph 'that he knows how to make gratitude graceful' 'it is an ex voto and you are his patron saint dear mother' said the countess wanda with a smile but the smile was one of approval she thought his silence on his own successes and on her name was in good taste and the screen was so admirably painted that the venetian masters might have signed it without discredit 'may i give him no message from you' said the princess as she was about to write her reply her niece hesitated 'say we have read his first speech and are glad of his success' she said after a few moments' reflection 'nothing more' 'what else should i say' replied wanda with some irritation the princess was too honourable a woman to depart from the text of the congratulation but she contrived to throw a little more warmth into the spirit of it and she did not show her letter to the mistress of hohenszalras she set the screen near her favourite chair in the blue room 'if only there were any one to appreciate it' she said with a sigh 'like everything else in this house it might as well be packed up in a chest for aught people see of it this place is not a museum the world goes to a museum it is a crypt' 'would it be improved by a crowd of sightseers at ten kreutzers a head' 'no but it would be very much brightened by a house party at easter and now and then at midsummer and autumn in your mother's time the october parties for the bear hunts the wolf hunts the boar hunts were magnificent no i do not think the chase contrary to god's will man has power over the beasts of the field and the forest the archdukes never missed an autumn here they found the sport finer than in styria' her niece kissed her hand and went out to where her four black horses were fretting and champing before the great doors and the winter sun was lighting up the gilded scrollwork and the purple velvet and the brown sables of her sleigh that had been built in russia and been a gift to her from egon vsrhely she felt a little impatience of the princess ottilie well as she loved her the complacent narrowness of mind the unconscious cruelty the innocent egotism the conventional religion which clipped and fitted the ways of deity to suit its own habits and wishes these fretted her chafed her oppressed her with a sense of their utter vanity the princess would not herself have harmed a sparrow or a mouse yet it seemed to her that providence had created all the animal world only to furnish pastime for princes and their jgers she saw no contradiction in this view of the matter the small conventional mind of her had been cast in that mould and would never expand it was perfectly pure and truthful but it was contracted and filled with formula wanda von szalras who loved her tenderly could not help a certain impatience of this the sole companionship she had a deep affection may exist side by side with a mental disparity that creates an unwilling but irresistible sense of tedium and discordance a clear and broad intelligence is infinitely patient of inferiority but its very patience has its reaction in its own fatigue and silent irritation this lassitude came on her most in the long evenings whilst the princess slumbered and she herself sat alone she was not haunted by it when she was in the open air or in the library occupied with the reports or the requirements on her estates but the evenings were lonely and tedious they had not seemed so when the little boat had come away from the monastery and the prayer and praise of handel and haydn and the new born glory of the nibelungen tone poems had filled the quiet twilight hours it was in no way probable that the musician and she would ever meet again she understood that his own delicacy and pride must perforce keep him out of austria and she however much the princess desired it could never invite him there alone and would not probably gather such a house party at hohenszalras as might again warrant her doing so nothing was more unlikely she supposed than that she would ever hear again the touch that had awakened the dumb chords of the old painted spinet but circumstance that master of the ceremonies as madame brancka termed it who directs the menuet de la cour of life and who often diverts himself by letting it degenerate into a dance of death willed it otherwise there was a dear friend of hers who was a dethroned and exiled queen their friendship was strong tender and born in childish days on the part of wanda it had been deepened by the august adversity which impresses and attaches all noble natures herself born of a great race and with the instincts of a ruling class hereditary in her there was something sacred and awful in the fall of majesty her friend stripped of all appanages of her rank and deserted by nearly all who 'had so late sworn her allegiance became more than ever dear she became holy to her and she would sooner have denied the request of a reigning sovereign than of one powerless to command or to rebuke 'when this friend who had been so hardly smitten by fate sent her word that she was ill and would fain see her she therefore never even hesitated as to obedience before the summons it troubled and annoyed her it came to her ill timed and unexpected and it was above all disagreeable to her because it would take her to paris but it never occurred to her to send an excuse to this friend who had no longer any power to say 'i will' but could only say like common humanity 'i hope' within two hours of her reception of the summons she was on her way to windisch matrey the princess did not accompany her she intended to make as rapid a journey as possible without pausing on the way and her great aunt was too old and too delicate in health for such exertion 'though i would fain go and see that great parisian aurist' she said plaintively 'my hearing is not what it used to be' 'the great aurist shall come to you dear mother' said wanda 'i will bring him back with me' she travelled with a certain state since she did not think that the moment of a visit to a dethroned sovereign was a fit time to lay ceremony aside she took several of her servants and some of her horses with her and journeyed by way of munich and strasburg madame ottilie was too glad she should go anywhere to offer opposition and in her heart of hearts she thought of her favourite he was in paris who knew what might happen it was midwinter and the snow was deep on all the country whether of mountain or of plain which stretched between the tauern and the french capital but there was no great delay of the express and in some forty hours the countess von szalras with her attendants and her horses with theirs arrived at the htel bristol the noise the movement the brilliancy of the streets seemed a strange spectacle after four years spent without leaving the woodland quiet and mountain solitudes of hohenszalras she was angry with herself that as she stood at the windows of her apartment she almost unconsciously watched the faces of the crowd passing below and felt a vague expectancy of seeing amongst them the face of sabran she went that evening to the modest hired house where the young and beautiful sovereign she came to visit had found a sorry refuge it was a meeting full of pain to both when they had last parted at the hofburg of vienna the young queen had been in all the triumph and hope of brilliant nuptials and at hohenszalras the people's heilige bela had been living a happy boy in all his fair promise meanwhile the news sheets informed all their leaders that the countess von szalras was in paris ambassadors and ambassadresses princes and princesses and a vast number of very great people hastened to write their names at the htel bristol amongst the cards left was that of sabran but he sent it he did not go in person she refused all invitations and declined almost all visits she had come there only to see her friend the queen of natalia paris which loves anything new talked a great deal about her and its street crowds which admires what is beautiful began to gather before the doors at the hours when her black horses driven russian fashion came fretting and flashing like meteors over the asphalte 'why did you bring your horses for so short a time' said madame kaulnitz to her 'you could of course have had any of ours' 'i always like to have some of my horses with me' she answered 'i would have brought them all only it would have looked so ostentatious you know they are my children' 'i do not see why you should not have other children' said madame kaulnitz 'it is quite inhuman that you will not marry' 'i have never said that i will not but i do not think it likely' two days after her arrival as she was driving down the avenue de l'impratrice she saw sabran on foot she was driving slowly she would have stopped her carriage if he had paused in his walk but he did not he only bowed low and passed on it was almost rude after the hospitality of hohenszalras but the rudeness pleased her it spoke both of pride and of sensitiveness it seemed scarcely natural after their long hours of intercourse that they should pass each other thus as strangers yet it seemed impossible they should any more be friends she did not ask herself why it seemed so but she felt it rather by instinct than by reasoning she was annoyed to feel that the sight of him had caused a momentary emotion in her of mingled trouble and pleasure no one mentioned his name to her and she asked no one concerning him she spent almost all her time with the queen of natalia and there were other eminent foreign personages in paris at that period whose amiabilities she could not altogether reject and she had only allowed herself fifteen days as the length of her sojourn as madame ottilie was alone amidst the snow covered mountains of the tauern on the fifth day after her meeting with sabran he sent another card of his to the hotel and sent with it an immense basket of gilded osier filled with white lilac she remembered having once said to him at hohenszalras that lilac was her flower of preference her rooms were crowded with bouquets sent her by all sorts of great people and made of all kinds of rare blossoms but the white lilac coming in the january snows touched her more than all those she knew that his poverty was no fiction and that great clusters of white lilac in midwinter in paris meant much money she wrote a line or two in german which thanked him for his recollection of her taste and sent it to the chamber she did not know where he lived that evening she mentioned his name to her godfather the duc de noira and asked him if he knew it the duc a legitimist a recluse and a man of strong prejudices answered at once 'of course i know it he is one of us and he has made a political position for himself within the last year' 'do you know him personally' 'no i do not i see no one as you are aware i live in greater retirement than ever but he bears an honourable name and though i believe that until lately he was but a flneur he has taken a decided part this session and he is a very great acquisition to the true cause' 'it is surely very sudden his change of front' 'what change he took no part in politics that ever i heard of it is taken for granted that a marquis de sabran is loyal to his sole legitimate sovereign i believe he never thought of public life but they tell me that he returned from some long absence last autumn an altered and much graver man then one of the deputies for his department died and he was elected for the vacancy with no opposition' the duc de noira proceeded to speak of the political aspects of the time and said no more involuntarily as she drove through the avenues of the bois de boulogne she thought of the intuitive comprehension the half uttered sympathy the interchange of ideas demi mots which had made the companionship of sabran so welcome to her in the previous summer they had not always agreed she often had not even approved him but they had always understood one another they had never needed to explain she was startled to realise how much and how vividly she regretted him 'if one could only be sure of his sincerity' she thought 'there would be few men living who would equal him' she did not know why she doubted his sincerity some natures have keen instincts like dogs she regretted to doubt it but the change in him seemed to her too rapid to be one of conviction yet the homage in it to herself was delicate and subtle she would not have been a woman had it not touched her and she was too honest with herself not to frankly admit in her own thoughts that she might very well have inspired a sentiment which would go far to change a nature which it entered and subdued many men had loved her why not he she drew the whip over the flanks of her horses as she felt that mingled impatience and sadness with which sovereigns remember that they can never be certain they are loved for themselves and not for all which environs them and lifts them up out of the multitude she was angry with herself when she felt that what interested her most during her parisian sojourn was the report of the debates of the french chamber in the french journals one night the baron kaulnitz spoke of sabran in her hearing 'he is the most eloquent of the legitimist party' he said to some one in her hearing 'no one supposed that he had it in him he was a mere idler a mere man of pleasure and it was at times said of something worse but he has of late manifested great talent it is displayed for a lost cause but it is none the less admirable as talent goes' she heard what he said with pleasure advantage was taken of her momentary return to the world to press on her the choice of a great alliance names as mighty as her own were suggested to her and more than one great prince of a rank even higher than hers humbly solicited the honour of the hand which gave no caress except to a horse's neck a dog's head a child's curls but she did not even pause to allow these proposals any consideration she refused them all curtly and with a sense of irritation 'have you sworn never to marry' said the duc de noira with much chagrin receiving her answer for a candidate of his own to whom he was much attached 'i never swear anything' she answered 'oaths are necessary for people who do not know their own minds i do know my own' 'you know that you will never marry' 'i hardly say that but i shall never contract a mere alliance it is horrible that union eternal of two bodies and souls without sympathy without fitness without esteem merely for sake of additional position or additional wealth' 'it is not eternal said the duc with a smile 'and i can assure you that my friend adores you for yourself you will never understand wanda that you are a woman to inspire great love that you would be sought for your face for your form for your mind if you had nothing else' 'i do not believe it' 'can you doubt at least that your cousin egon ' 'oh pray spare me the name of egon' she said with unwonted irritation 'i may surely be allowed to have left that behind me at home' it was a time of irritation and turbulence in paris the muttering of the brooding storm was visible to fine ears through the false stillness of an apparently serene atmosphere she who knew keen and brilliant politicians who were not french saw the danger that was at hand for france which france did not see 'they will throw down the glove to prussia and they will repent of it as long as the earth lasts' she thought and she was oppressed by her prescience for war had cost her race dear and she said to herself 'when that liquid fire is set flowing who shall say where it will pause' she felt an extreme desire to converse with sabran as she had done at home to warn him to persuade him to hear his views and express to him her own but she did not summon him and he did not come she did justice to the motive which kept him away but she was not as yet prepared to go as far as to invite him to lay his scruples aside and visit her with the old frank intimacy which had brightened both their lives at the hohenszalrasburg it had been so different there he had been a wanderer glad of rest and she had had about her the defence of the princess's presence and the excuse of the obligations of hospitality she reproached herself at times for hardness for unkindness she had not said a syllable to commend him for that abandonment of a frivolous life which was in itself so delicate and lofty a compliment to herself he had obeyed her quite as loyally as knight ever did his lady and she did not even say to him 'it is well done' wanda von szalras a daughter of brave men and herself the bravest of women was conscious that she was for once a coward she was afraid of looking into her own heart she said to her cousin when he paid his respects to her 'i should like to hear a debate at the chamber arrange it for me' he replied 'at your service in that as in all things' the next day as she was about to drive out about four o'clock he met her at the entrance of her hotel 'if you could come with me' he said 'you might hear something of interest to day there will be a strong discussion will you accept my carriage or shall i enter yours' what she heard when she reached the chamber did not interest her greatly there was a great deal of noise of declamation of personal vituperation of verbose rancour it did not seem to her to be eloquence she had heard much more stately oratory in both the upper and lower reichsrath and much more fiery and noble eloquence at buda pesth this seemed to her poor shrill mouthing which led to very little and the disorder of the assembly filled her with contempt 'i thought it was the country of s louis' she said with a disdainful sigh to kaulnitz who answered 'cromwell is perhaps more wanted here than s louis' 'their cromwell will always be a lawyer without clients or a journalist sans le sou' retorted the chtelaine of hohenszalras when she had been there an hour or more she saw sabran enter the hall and take his place his height his carriage and his distinction of appearance made him conspicuous in a multitude while the extreme fairness and beauty of his face were uncommon and striking 'here is s louis' said the ambassador with a little smile 'or a son of s louis's crusaders at any rate he is sure to speak i think he speaks very well one would suppose he had done nothing else all his life' after a time when some speakers virulent over eager and hot in argument had had their say and a tumult had risen and been quelled and the little bell had rung violently for many minutes sabran entered the tribune he had seen the austrian minister and his companion his voice at all times melodious had a compass which could fill with ease the large hall in which he was he appeared to use no more effort than if he were conversing in ordinary tones yet no one there present lost a syllable that he said his gesture was slight calm and graceful his language admirably chosen and full of dignity his mission of the moment was to attack the ministry upon their foreign policy and he did so with exceeding skill wit irony and precision his eloquence was true eloquence and was not indebted in any way to trickery artifice or over ornament he spoke with fire force and courage but his tranquillity never gave way for a moment his speech was brilliant and serene in utter contrast to the turbulent and florid declamation which had preceded him there was great and prolonged applause when he had closed with a peroration stately and persuasive and when emile ollivier rose to reply that optimistic statesman was plainly disturbed and at a loss sabran resumed his seat without raising his eyes to where the countess von szalras sat she remained there during the speech of the minister which was a lame and laboured one for he had been pierced between the joints of his armour then she rose and went away with her escort 'what do you think of s louis' said he jestingly 'i think he is very eloquent and very convincing but i do not think he is at all like a frenchman' 'well he is a breton bretonnant' rejoined the ambassador 'they are always more in earnest and more patrician' 'if he be sincere if he be only sincere' she thought that doubt pursued her she had a vague sense that it was all only a magnificent comedy after all could apathy and irony change all so suddenly to conviction and devotion could the scoffer become so immediately the devotee could he care really care for those faiths of throne and altar which he defended with so much eloquence so much earnestness and yet why not these faiths were inherited things with him their altars must have been always an instinct with him for their sake his fathers had lived and died what great wonder then that they should have been awakened in him after a torpor which had been but the outcome of those drugs with which the world is always so ready to lay asleep the soul they had now got out into the corridors and as they turned the corner of one they came straight upon sabran 'i congratulate you' said wanda as she stretched her hand out to him with a smile as he took it and bowed over it he grew very pale 'i have obeyed you' he murmured 'with less success than i could desire' 'do not be too modest you are a great orator you know how to remain calm whilst you exalt excite and influence others' he listened in silence then inquired for the health of his kind friend the princess ottilie 'she is well' answered wanda 'and loses nothing of her interest in you she reads all your speeches with approval and pleasure not the less approval and pleasure because her political creed has become yours' he coloured slightly 'what did you tell me' he said 'that if i had no convictions i could do no better than abide by the traditions of the sabrans if their cause were the safe and reigning one i would not support it for mere expediency but as it is ' 'your motives cannot be selfish ones' she answered a little coldly 'selfishness would have led you to profess bakouinism it is the popular profession and a socialistic aristocrat is always attracted and flattering to the plebs' 'you are severe' he said with a flush on his cheek 'i have no intention of playing philip egalit now or in any after time' she did hot reply she was conscious of unkindness and want of encouragement in her own words she hesitated a little and then said 'perhaps you will have time to come and see me i shall remain here a few days more' the ambassador joined them at that moment and was too well bred to display any sign of the supreme astonishment he felt at finding the countess von szalras and the new deputy already known to each other 'he is a favourite of aunt ottilie's' she explained to him as leaving sabran they passed down the corridor 'did i not tell you he had an accident on the umbal glacier last summer and in his convalescence we saw him often' 'i recollect that your aunt asked me about him excuse me i had quite forgotten' said the ambassador understanding now why she had wanted to go to the chamber the next day sabran called upon her there were with her three or four great ladies he did not stay long and was never alone with her she felt an impatience of her friends' presence which irritated her as it awoke in her he sent her a second basket of white lilac in the following forenoon she saw no more of him she found herself wondering about the manner of his life she did not even know in what street he lived she passed almost all her time with the queen of natalia who did not know him and was still so unwell that she received no one she was irritated with herself because it compromised her consistency to desire to stay on in paris and she did so desire and she was one of those to whom a consciousness of their own consistency is absolutely necessary as a qualification for self respect there are natures that fly contentedly from caprice to caprice as humming birds from blossom to bud but if she had once become changeable she would have become contemptible to herself she would hardly have been herself any longer with some anger at her own inclinations she resisted them and when her self allotted fifteen days were over she did not prolong them by so much as a dozen hours there was an impatience in her which was wholly strange to her serene and even temper she felt a vague dissatisfaction with herself she had been scarcely generous scarcely cordial to him she failed to approve her own conduct and yet she scarcely saw where she had been at fault the kaulnitz and many other high persons were at the station in the chill snowy misty day to say their last farewells she was wrapped in silver fox fur from head to foot she was somewhat pale she felt an absurd reluctance to go away from a city which was nothing to her but her exiled friend was recovering health and madame ottilie was all alone and though she was utterly her own mistress far more so than most women there were some things she could not do to stay on in paris seemed to her to be one of them the little knot of high personages said their last words the train began slowly to move upon its way a hand passed through the window of the carriage and laid a bouquet of lilies of the valley on her knee 'adieu' said sabran very gently as his eyes met hers once more then the express train rolled faster on its road and passed out by the north east and in a few moments had left paris far behind it end
