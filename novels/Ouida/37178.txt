she moved a century and a half ago down the stately staircase and through the gilded and tapestried halls of lilliesford the town had run mad after her and her face levelled politics and was cited as admiringly by the whigs at st jamess as by the tories at the cocoatree by the beaux and mohocks at garraways as by the alumni at the grecian by the wits at wills as by the fops at ozindas wherever she went whether to the haymarket or the opera to the change for a fan or the palace for a state ball to drury lane to see pastoral philipss dreary dilution of racine or to some fair chief of her faction for basset and ombre she was surrounded by the best men of her time and hated by whig beauties with virulent wrath for she was a tory to the backbone indeed a jacobite at heart worshipped bolingbroke detested marlborough and eugene believed in all the horrors of the programme said to have been plotted by the whigs for the anniversary show of and was thought to have prompted the satire on those fair politicians who are disguised as rosalinda and nigranilla in the st paper of the spectator cecil castlemaine was the greatest beauty of her day lovelier still at fourandtwenty than she had been at seventeen unwedded though the highest coronets in the land had been offered to her far above the coquetteries and minauderies of her friends far above imitation of the affectations of lady betty modleys skuttle or need of practising the fan exercise haughty peerless radiant unwonnay moreuntouched for the finest gentleman on the town could not flatter himself that he had ever stirred the slightest trace of interest in her nor boast as he stood in the inner circle at the chocolatehouse unless indeed he lied more impudently than tom wharton himself that he had ever been honored by a glance of encouragement from the earls daughter she was too proud to cheapen herself with coquetry too fastidious to care for her conquests over those who whispered to her through nicolinis song vied to have the privilege of carrying her fan drove past her windows in soho square crowded about her in st jamess park paid court even to her little spaniel indamara and to catch but a glimpse of her brocaded train as it swept a ballroom floor would leave even their play at the groom porters mrs oldfield in the greenroom a night hunt with mohun and their brother mohocks a circle of wits gathered within the steam of the coffeepot at wills a dinner at halifaxs a supper at bolingbrokeswhatever according to their several tastes made their best entertainment and was hardest to quit the highest suitors of the day sought her smile and sued for her hand men left the court and the mall to join the flanders army before the lines at bouchain less for loyal love of england than hopeless love of cecil castlemaine her father vainly urged her not to fling away offers that all the women at st jamess envied her she was untouched and unwon and when her friends the court beauties the fine ladies the coquettes of quality rallied her on her coldness envying her her conquests she would smile her slight proud smile and bow her stately head perhaps she was cold she might be they were personnable men oh yes she had nothing to say against them his grace of belamoura pretty wit without doubt lord millamontdiverting but a coxcomb he had beautiful hands it was a pity he was always thinking of them sir gage riversas obsequious a lover as the man in the way of the world but she had heard he was very boastful and facetious at women over his chocolate at ozindas the earl of argenta gallant soldier surely but whatever he might protest no mistress would ever rival with him the dice at the groom porters lord philip bellairsa proper gentleman no fault in him a bel esprit and an elegant courtier pleased many no doubt but he did not please her overmuch perhaps her taste was too finical or her character too cold as they said she preferred it should be so when you were content it were folly to seek a change for her part she failed to comprehend how women could stoop to flutter their fans and choose their ribbons and rack their tirewomens brains for new pulvillios and lappets and devices and practise their curtsy and recovery before their pierglass for no better aim or stake than to draw the glance and win the praise of men for whom they cared nothing a woman who had the eloquence of beauty and a true pride should be above heed for such affectations pleasure in such applause so she would put them all aside and turn the tables on her friends and go on her own way proud peerless cecil castlemaine conquering and unconquered and steele must have had her name in his thoughts and honored it heartily and sincerely when he wrote one tuesday on the st of october under the domino of his church coquette i say i do honor to those who can be coquettes and are not such but i despise all who would be so and in despair of arriving at it themselves hate and vilify all those who can a definition justly drawn by his keen quick graver though doubtless it only excited the ire of and was entirely lost upon those who read the paper over their dish of bohea or over their toilette while they shifted a patch for an hour before they could determine it or regretted the loss of ten guineas at crimp cecil castlemaine was the beauty of the town when she sat at drury lane on the tory side of the house the devoutest admirer of oldfield or mrs porter scarcely heard a word of the heroic daughter or the amorous widow and the beau fullest of his own dear self forgot his silverfringed gloves his medallion snuffbox his knotted cravat his clouded cane the slaughter that he planned to do from gazing at her where she sat as though she were reigning sovereign at st jamess the castlemaine diamonds flashing crescentlike above her brow at church and court at park and assembly there were none who could eclipse that haughty gentlewoman therefore her fond women friends who had caressed her so warmly and so gracefully and pulled her to pieces behind her back if they could so eagerly over their dainty cups of tea in an afternoon visit were glad one and all when on barnabybright anglice the d then the th of june the great castlemaine chariot with its three herons blazoned on its coroneted panels its laced liveries and gilded harness rolled over the heavy illmade roads down into the country in almost princely pomp the peasants pouring out from the wayside cottages to stare at my lords coach it was said in the town that a portly divine who wore his scarf as one of the chaplains to the earl of castlemaine had prattled somewhat indiscreetly at childs of his patrons politics that certain cipher letters had passed the channel enclosed in chocolatecakes as soon as french goods were again imported after the peace of utrecht that gentlemen in high places were strongly suspected of mischievous designs against the tranquillity of the country and government that the earl had among others received a friendly hint from a relative in power to absent himself for a while from the court where he was not best trusted and the town where an incautious word might be picked up and lead to tower hill and amuse himself at his goodly castle of lilliesford where the red deer would not spy upon him and the dark beechwoods would tell no tales and the ladies of quality her dear friends and sisters were glad when they heard it as they punted at basset and fluttered their fans complacently they would have the field for themselves for a season while cecil castlemaine was immured in her manor of lilliesford would be free of her beauty to eclipse them at the next birthday be quit of their most dreaded rival their most omnipotent leader of fashion and they rejoiced at the whisper of the cipher letter the damaging gossipry of the whig coffeehouses the bad repute into which my lord earl had grown at st jamess at the misfortune of their friend in a word as human nature masculine or feminine will ever doto its shame be it spokenunless the fomes peccati be more completely wrung out of it than it ever has been since the angel gabriel performed that work of purification on the infant mahomet it was the june of the year and the coming disaffection was seething and boiling secretly among the tories the impeachment of ormond and bolingbroke had strengthened the distaste to the newcome hanoverian pack their attainder had been the blast of air needed to excite the smouldering wood to flame the gentlemen of that party in the south began to grow impatient of the intrusion of the distant german branch to think lovingly of the old legitimate line and to feel something of the chafing irritation of the gentlemen of the north who were fretting like staghounds held in leash envoys passed to and fro between st germain and jacobite nobles priests of the church that had fallen out of favor and was typified as the scarlet woman by a rival who though successful was still bitter plotted with ecclesiastical relish in the task letters were conveyed in rolls of innocent lace plans were forwarded in frosted confections messages were passed in invisible cipher that defied investigation the times were dangerous full of plot and counterplot of risk and danger of fomenting projects and hidden disaffectiontimes in which men living habitually over mines learned to like the uncertainty and to think life flavorless without the chance of losing it any hour and things being in this state the earl of castlemaine deemed it prudent to take the counsel of his friend in power and retire from london for a while perhaps for the safety of his own person perhaps for the advancement of his cause either of which were easier insured at his seat in the western counties than amidst the whigs of the capital the castle of lilliesford was bowered in the thick woods of the western counties a giant pile built by norman masons troops of deer herded under the goldgreen beechen boughs the sunlight glistened through the aisles of the trees and quivered down on to the thick moss and ferns and tangled grass that grew under the park woodlands the waterlilies clustered on the river and the swans floated double swan and shadow under the leaves that swept into the water then when cecil castlemaine came down to share her fathers retirement as now when her name and titles on the gold plate of a coffin that lies with others of her race in the mausoleum across the park where winter snows and sumer sunrays are alike to those who sleep within is all that tells at lilliesford of the loveliest woman of her time who once reigned there as mistress the country was in its glad green midsummer beauty and the muskrosebuds bloomed in profuse luxuriance over the chill marble of the terraces and scattered their delicate odorous petals in fragrant showers on the sward of the lawns when cecil castlemaine came down to what she termed her exile the morning was fair and cloudless its sunbeams piercing through the darkest glades in the woodlands the thickest shroud of the ivy the deepesthued pane of the mullioned windows as she passed down the great staircase where lords and gentlewomen of her race gazed on her from the canvas of lely and jamesone bourdain and vandyke crossed the hall with her dainty step so stately yet so light and standing by the window of her own bowerroom was lured out on to the terrace overlooking the west side of the park she made such a picture as vandyke would have liked to paint with her golden glow upon her and the muskroses clustering about her round the pilasters of marblethe white chill marble to which belamour and many other of her lovers of the court and town had often likened her vandyke would have lingered lovingly on the hand that rested on her staghounds head would have caught her air of courtlike grace and dignity would have painted with delighted fidelity her deep azure eyes her proud brow her delicate lips arched haughtily like a cupids bow would have picked out every fold of her sweeping train every play of light on her silken skirts every dainty tracery of her pointlace yet even painted by sir anthony that perfect master of art and of elegance though more finished it could have hardly been more faithful more instinct with grace and life and dignity than a sketch drawn of her shortly after that time by one who loved her well which is still hanging in the gallery at lilliesford lighted up by the afternoon sun when it streams in through the western windows cecil castlemaine stood on the terrace looking over the lawns and gardens through the opening vistas of meeting boughs and interlaced leaves to the woods and hills beyond fused in a soft mist of green and purple with her hand lying carelessly on her hounds broad head she was a zealous tory a skilled politician and her thoughts were busy with the hopes and fears the chances for and against of a cause that lay near her heart but whose plans were yet immature whose first blow was yet unstruck and whose wellwishers were sanguine of a success they had not yet hazarded though they hardly ventured to whisper to each other their previous designs and desires her thoughts were far away and she hardly heeded the beauty round her musing on schemes and projects dear to her party that would imperil the castlemaine coronet but would serve the only royal house the castlemaine line had ever in their hearts acknowledged she had regretted leaving the town moreover a leader of the mode a wit a woman of the world she missed her accustomed sphere she was no pastoral phyllis no countryborn mistress fiddy to pass her time in provincial pleasures in making cordial waters in tending her beaupots in preserving her fallen roseleaves in inspecting the confections in the stillroom as little was she able like many fine ladies when in similar exile to while it away by scolding her tirewomen and sorting a suit of ribbons in ordering a set of gilded leather hangings from chelsea for the state chambers and yawning over chocolate in her bed till midday she regretted leaving the town not for belamour nor argent nor any of those who vainly hoped as they glanced at the little mirror in the lids of their snuffboxes that they might have graven themselves were it ever so faintly in her thoughts but for the wits the pleasures the choice clique the accustomed circle to which she was so used the courtly brilliant townlife where she was wont to reign so she stood on the terrace the first morning of her exile her thoughts far away with the loyal gentlemen of the north and the banished court at st germain the lids drooping proudly over her haughty eyes and her lips half parted with a faint smile of triumph in the visions limned by ambition and imagination while the wind softly stirred the rich lace of her bodice and her fingers lay lightly yet firmly on the head of her staghound she looked up at last as she heard the ring of a horses hoofs and saw a sorrel covered with dust and foam spurred up the avenue which rounding past the terrace swept on to the front entrance the sorrel looked wellnigh spent and his rider somewhat worn and languid as a man might do with justice who had been in boot and saddle twentyfour hours at the stretch scarce stopping for a stoup of wine but he lifted his hat and bowed down to his saddlebow as he passed her was it the longlookedfor messenger with definite news from st germain wondered lady cecil as her hound gave out a deeptongued bay of anger at the stranger she went back into her bowerroom and toyed absently with her flowered handkerchief broidering a stalk to a violetleaf and wondering what additional hope the horseman might have brought to strengthen the good cause till her servants brought word that his lordship prayed the pleasure of her presence in the octagonroom whereat she rose and swept through the long corridors entered the octagonroom the sunbeams gathering about her rich dress as they passed through the stainedglass oriels and saluted the newcomer when her father presented him to her as their trusty and welcome friend and envoy sir fulke ravensworth with her careless dignity and queenly grace that nameless air which was too highly bred to be condescension but markedly and proudly repelled familiarity and signed a pale of distance beyond which none must intrude the newcomer was a tall and handsome man of noble presence bronzed by foreign suns pale and jaded just now with hard riding while his dark silverlaced suit was splashed and covered with dust but as he bowed low to her critical cecil castlemaine saw that not belamour himself could have better grace not my lord millamont courtlier mien nor whiter hands and listened with gracious air to what her father unfolded to her of his mission from st germain whither he had come at great personal risk in many disguises and at breathless speed to place in their hands a precious letter in cipher from james stuart to his wellbeloved and loyal subject herbert george earl of castlemaine a letter spoken of with closed doors and in low whispers loyal as was the household supreme as the earl ruled over his domains of lilliesford for these were times when men mistrusted those of their own blood and when the very figure on the tapestry seemed instinct with life to spy and betraywhen they almost feared the silk that tied a missive should babble of its contents and the hound that slept beside them should read and tell their thoughts to leave lilliesford would be danger to the envoy and danger to the cause to stay as guest was to disarm suspicion the messenger who had brought such priceless news must rest within the shelter of his roof too much were risked by returning to the french coast yet awhile or even by joining mar or derwentwater so the earl enforced his will upon the envoy and the envoy thanked him and accepted perchance the beauty whose eyes he had seen lighten and proud brow flush as she read the royal greeting and injunction made a sojourn near her presence not distasteful perchance he cared little where he stayed till the dawning time of action and of rising should arrive when he should take the field and fight till life or death for the white rose and the long heads of hair he was a soldier of fortune a poor gentleman with no patrimony but his name no chance of distinction save by his sword sworn to a cause whose star was set forever for many years his life had been of changing adventure and shifting chances now fighting with berwick at almanza now risking his life in some delicate and dangerous errand for james stuart that could not have been trusted so well to any other officer about st germain gallant to rashness yet with much of the acumen of the diplomatist he was invaluable to his court and cause but stuartlike menlike they hastened to employ but ever forgot to reward lady cecil missed her townlife and did not overfavor her exile in the western counties to note down on her mathers tablets the drowsy homilies droned out by the chaplain on a sabbath noon to play at crambo to talk with her tirewomen of new washes for the skin to pass her hours away in knottingshe whom steele might have writ of when he drew his character of eudoxia could wile her exile with none of these inanities neither could she consort with gentry who seemed to her little better than the boors of a country wake who had never heard of mr spectator and knew nothing of mr cowley countrywomen whose ambition was in their cowslip wines foxhunters more ignorant and uncouth than the dumb brutes they followed who was there for miles around with whom she could stoop to associate with whom she cared to exchange a word madam from the vicarage in her grogram learned in syrups salves and possets country lady bountifuls with gossip of the village and the poultryyard provincial peeresses who had never been to london since queen annes coronation a squirearchy who knew of no music save the concert of their stophounds no court save the court of the county assize no literature unless by miracle t were tarletons jests none such as these could cross the inlaid oak parquet of lilliesford and be ushered into the presence of cecil castlemaine so the presence of the chevaliers messenger was not altogether unwelcome and distasteful to her she saw him but little merely conversing at table with him with that distant and dignified courtesy which marked her out from the light free inconsequent manners in vogue with other women of quality of her time the air which had chilled half the softest things even on belamours lips and kept the vainest coxcomb hesitating and abashed but by degrees she observed that the envoy was a man who had lived in many countries and in many courts was well versed in the tongues of france and italy and spainin their belleslettres too moreoverand had served his apprenticeship to good company in the salons of versailles in the audienceroom of the vatican at the receptions of the duchess du maine and with the banished family at st germain he spoke with a high and sanguine spirit of the troublous times approaching and the beloved cause whose crisis was at hand which chimed in with her humor better than the flippancies of belamour the airy nothings of millamont he was but a soldier of fortune a poor gentleman who named to her in the town would have had never a word and would have been unnoted amidst the crowding beaux who clustered round to hold her fan and hear how she had been pleasured with the drolleries of grief a la mode but down in the western counties she deigned to listen to the princes officer to smilea smile beautiful when it came on her proud lips as the play of light on the opals of her jewelled stomachernay even to be amused when he spoke of the women of foreign courts to be interested when he told which was but reluctantly of his own perils escapes and adventures to discourse with him riding home under the beech avenues from hawking or standing on the western terrace at curfew to watch the sunset of many things on which the nobles of the mall and the gentlemen about st jamess had never been allowed to share her opinions for lady cecil was deeply read unusually deeply for her day since fine ladies of her rank and fashion mostly contented themselves with skimming a romance of scuderis or an act of aurungzebe but she rarely spoke of those things save perchance now and then to mr addison fulke ravensworth never flattered her moreover and flattery was a honeyed confection of which she had long been cloyed he even praised boldly before her other women of beauty and grace whom he had seen at versailles at sceaux and at st germain neither did he defer to her perpetually but where he differed would combat her sentiments courteously but firmly though a soldier and a man of action he had an admirable skill at the limners art could read to her the divina commedia or the comedies of lope da vega and transfer crabbed latin and abstruse greek into elegant english for her pleasures and though a beggared gentleman of most precarious fortunes he would speak of life and its chances of the cause and its perils with a daring which she found preferable to the lisped languor of the men of the town who had no better campaigns than laying siege to a prude cared for no other weapons than their toilettes and snuffboxes and sought no other excitement than a coup declat with the liontumblers on the whole through these long midsummer days lady cecil found the envoy from st germain a companion that did not suit her ill sought less the solitude of her bowerroom and listened graciously to him in the long twilight hours while the evening dews gathered in the cups of the muskroses and the starrays began to quiver on the waterlilies floating on the river below that murmured along with endless song under the beechenboughs a certain softness stole over her relaxing the cold hauteur of which belamour had so often complained giving a nameless charm supplying a nameless something lacking before in the beauty of the castlemaine she would stroke half sadly the smooth feathers of her tartaret falcon gabrielle when fulke ravensworth brought her the bird from the ostregers wrist with its azure velvet hood and silver bells and jesses she would wonder as she glanced through corneille or congreve philips or petrarca what it was this passion of love of which they all treated on which they all turned no matter how different their strain and now and then would come over her cheek and brow a faint fitful wavering flush delicate and changing as the flush from the rosehued reflexions of western clouds on a statue of pharos marble and then she would start and rouse herself and wonder what she ailed and grow once more haughty calm stately dazzling but chill as the castlemaine diamonds that she wore so the summertime passed and the autumn came the cornlands brown with harvest the hazelcopses strewn with fallen nuts the beechleaves turning into reddened gold as the wheat ripened but to meet the sickle as the nuts grew but to fall as the leaves turned to gold but to wither so the sanguine hopes the fond ambitions of men strengthened and matured only to fade into disappointment and destruction four months had sped by since the princes messenger had come to lilliesfordmonths that had gone swiftly with him as some sweet delicious dream and the time had come when he had orders to ride north secretly and swiftly speak with mr forster and other gentlemen concerned in the meditated rising and convey despatches and instructions to the earl of mar for prince james was projecting soon to join his loyal adherents in scotland and the critical moment was close at hand the moment when to fulke ravensworths high and sanguine courage victory seemed certain failure if no treachery marred no dissension weakened impossible the moment to which he looked for honor success distinction that should give him claim and title to aspirewhere strong man cool soldier though he was he shrank from drawing his fancied future out from the golden haze of immature hope lest he should see it wither upon closer sight he was but a landless adventurer with nothing but his sword and his honor and kings he knew were slow to pay back benefits or recollect the hands that hewed them free passage to their thrones cecil castlemaine stood within the window of her bowerroom the red light of the october sun glittering on her goldbroidered skirt and her corsage sewn with opals and emeralds her hand was pressed lightly on her bosom as though some pain were throbbing there it was new this unrest this weariness this vague weight that hung upon her it was the perils of their cause she told herself the risks her father ran it was weak childish unworthy a castlemaine still the pain throbbed there her hound asleep beside her raised his head with a low growl as a step intruded on the sanctity of the bowerroom then composed himself again to slumber satisfied it was no foe his mistress turned slowly she knew the horses waited she had shunned this ceremony of farewell and never thought any would be bold enough to venture here without permission sought and gained lady cecil i could not go upon my way without one word of parting pardon me if i have been too rash to seek it here why was it that his brief frank words ever pleased her better than belamours most honeyed phrases millamonts suavest periods she scarcely could have told save that there were in them an earnestness and truth new and rare to her ear and to her heart she pressed her hand closer on the opalsthe jewels of calamityand smiled assuredly i wish you god speed sir fulke and safe issue from all perils he bowed low then raised himself to his fullest height and stood beside her watching the light play upon the opals that is all you vouchsafe me all it is as much as you would claim sir is it not it is more than i would say to many your pardonit is more than i should claim if prudence were ever by if reason always ruled i have no right to ask for seek for even wish for more such petitions may only be addressed by men of wealth and of high title a landless soldier should have no pride to sting no heart to wound they are the prerogative of a happier fortune her lips turned white but she answered haughtily the crimson light flashing in her jewels heirlooms priceless and hereditary like her beauty and her pride this is strange language sir i fail to apprehend you you have never thought that i ran a danger deadlier than that which i have ever risked on any field you have never guessed that i have had the madness the presumption the crimeit may be in your eyesto love you the color flushed to her face crimsoning even her brow and then fled back her first instinct was insulted pridea beggared gentleman a landless soldier spoke to her of loveof lovewhich belamour had barely had courage to whisper of which none had dared to sue of her in return he had ventured to feel this for her he had ventured to speak of this to her the envoy saw the rising resentment the pride spoken in every line of her delicate face and stopped her as she would have spoken wait i know all you would reply you think it infinite daring presumption that merits highest reproof since you divined so justly it were pity you subjected yourself and me to this most useless most unexpected interview why why because perchance in this life you will see my face no more and you will think gently mercifully of my offence if offence it be to love you more than life and only less than honor when you know that i have fallen for the cause with your name in my heart held only the dearer because never on my lips sincere love can be no insult to whomsoever proffered elizabeth stuart saw no shame to her in the devotion of william craven cecil castlemaine stood in the crimson glory of the autumn sunset her head erect her pride unshaken but her heart stirred strangely and unwontedly it smote the one with bitter pain to think a penniless exile should thus dare to speak of what princes and dukes had almost feared to whisper what had she donewhat had she said to give him license for such liberty it stirred the other with a tremulous warmth a vague sweet pleasure that were never visitants there before but that she scouted instantly as weakness folly debasement in the last of the castlemaines he saw well enough what passed within her what made her eyes so troubled yet her brow and lips so proudly set and he bent nearer towards her the great love that was in him trembling in his voice lady cecil hear me if in the coming struggle i win distinction honor rankif victory come to us and the king we serve remember me in his prosperity as he does now in his adversityif i can meet you hereafter with tidings of triumph and success my name made one which england breathes with praise and pride honors gained such as even you will deem worthy of your linethenthenwill you let me speak of what you refuse to hearken to nowthen may i come to you and seek a gentler answer she looked for a moment upon his face as it bent towards her in the radiance of the sunset light the hope that hopes all things glistening in his eyes the highsouled daring of a gallant and sanguine spirit flushing his forehead the loud throbs of his heart audible in the stillness around and her proud eyes grew softer her lips quivered for an instant then she turned towards him with queenly grace yes it was spoken with stately dignity though scarce above her breath but the hue that wavered in her cheek was but the lovelier for the pride that would not let her eyes droop nor her tears rise would not let her utter one softer word that one word cost her much that single utterance was much from cecil castlemaine her handkerchief lay at her feet a delicate costly toy of lace embroidered with her shield and chiffre he stooped and raised it and thrust it in his breast to treasure it there if i fail i send this back in token that i renounce all hope if i can come to you with honor and with fame this shall be my gage that i may speak that you will listen she bowed her noble head ever held haughtily as though every crown of europe had a right to circle it his hot lips lingered for a moment on her hand then cecil castlemaine stood alone in the window of her bowerroom her hand pressed again upon the opals under which her heart was beating with a dull weary pain looking out over the landscape where the golden leaves were falling fast and the river tossing sadly dead branches on its waves was bemoaning in plaintive language the summer days gone by two months came and went the beechboughs black and sear creaked in the bleak december winds that sighed through frozen ferns and over the couches of shivering deer the snow drifted up on the marble terrace and icedrops clung where the warm rosy petals of the muskrosebuds had nestled across the country came terrible whispers that struck the hearts of men of loyal faith to the white rose with a bolt of icecold terror and despair messengers riding in hot haste openmouthed peasants gossiping by the village forge horsemen who tarried for a breathless rest at alehousedoors whig divines who returned thanks for gods most gracious mercy in vouchsafing victory to the strong all told the tale all spread the news of the drawn battle of sheriffmuir of the surrender under preston walls of the flight of prince james the tidings came one by one to lilliesford where my lord earl was holding himself in readiness to cooperate with the gentlemen of the north to set up the royal standard broidered by his daughters hands in the western counties and proclaim james iii sovereign lord and king of the realms of great britain and ireland the tidings came to lilliesford and cecil castlemaine clenched her white jewelled hands in passionate anguish that a stuart should have fled before the traitor of argyll instead of dying with his face towards the rebel crew that men had lived who could choose surrender instead of heroic death that she had not been there at preston to shame them with a womans reading of courage and of loyalty and show them how to fall with a doomed city rather than yield captive to a foe perhaps amidst her grief for her prince and for his cause mingledas the deadliest thought of alla memory of a bright proud face that had bent towards her with tender love and touching grace a month before and that might now be lying pale and cold turned upwards to the winter stars on the field of sheriffmuir a year rolled by twelve months had fled since the gilded carriage of the castlemaines with the lordly blazonment upon its panels its princely retinue and stately pomp had come down into the western counties the bones were crumbling white in the coffins in the tower and the skulls over templebar had bleached white in winter snows and springtide suns kenmuir had gone to a sleep that knew no wakening and derwentwater had laid his fair young head down for a thankless cause the heather bloomed over the mounds of dead on the plains of sheriffmuir and the yellow gorse blossomed under the city walls of preston another summer had dawned bright and laughing over england none the less fair for human lives laid down for human hopes crushed out daisies powdering the turf sodden with human blood birds carolling their song over graves of heapedup dead the muskroses tossed their delicate heads again amidst the marble pilasters and the hawthornboughs shook their fragrant buds into the river at lilliesford the purple hills lay wrapped in sunny mist and hyacinthbells mingled with the tangled grass and fern under the woodland shades where the red deer nestled happily herons plumed their silvery wings down by the waterside swallows circled in sultry air above the great belltower and woodpigeons cooed with soft lovenotes among the leafy branches yet the countess of castlemaine last of her race sole owner of the lands that spread around her stood on the roseterrace finding no joy in the sunlight about her no melody in the song of the birds she was the last of her name her father brokenhearted at the news from dumblain and preston had died the very day after his lodgment in the tower there was no heir male of his line and the title had passed to his daughter there had been thoughts of confiscation and attainder but others unknown to her solicited what she scorned to ask for herself and the greed of the hungry hanoverian pack spared the lands and the revenues of lilliesford in haughty pride in lonely mourning the fairest beauty of the court and town withdrew again to the solitude of her western counties and tarried there dwelling amidst her women and her almost regal household in the sacred solitude of grief wherein none might intrude proud cecil castlemaine was yet prouder than of yore alone sorrowing for her ruined cause and exiled king she would hold converse with none of those who had had a hand in drawing down the disastrous fate she mourned and only her staghound could have seen the weariness upon her face when she bent down to him or gabrielle the falcon felt her hand tremble when it stroked her folded wings she stood on the terrace looking over her spreading lands not the waterlilies on the river below whiter than her lips pressed painfully together perhaps she repented of certain words spoken to one whom now she would never again beholdperhaps she thought of that delicate toy that was to have been brought back in victory and hope that now might lie stained and stiffened with blood next a lifeless heart for never a word in the twelve months gone by had there come to lilliesford as tidings of fulke ravensworth her pride was dear to her dearer than aught else she had spoken as was her right to speak she had done what became a castlemaine it would have been weakness to have acted otherwise what was hea landless soldierthat he should have dared as he had dared yet the sables she wore were not solely for the dead earl not solely for the lost stuarts the hot mist that would blind the eyes of cecil castlemaine as hours swelled to days and days to months and shethe flattered beauty of the court and townstayed in selfchosen solitude in her halls of lilliesford still unwedded and unwon the noonhours chimed from the belltower and the sunny beauty of the morning but weighed with heavier sadness on her heart the song of the birds the busy hum of the gnats the joyous ring of the silver bell round her pet fawns neck as it darted from her side under the drooping boughsnone touched an answering chord of gladness in her she stood looking over her stretching woodlands in deep thought so deep that she heard no step over the lawn beneath nor saw the frightened rush of the deer as a boy crouching among the tangled ferns sprang up from his hidingplace under the beechen branches and stood on the terrace before her craving her pardon in childish yet fearless tones she turned bending on him that glance which had made the overbold glance of princes fall abashed the boy was but a little tatterdemalion to have ventured thus abruptly into the presence of the countess of castlemaine still it was with some touch of a pages grace that he bowed before her lady i crave your pardon but my master bade me watch for you though i watched till midnight your master a flush warm as that on the leaves of the muskroses rose to her face for an instant then faded as suddenly the boy did not notice her words but went on in an eager whisper glancing anxiously round as a hare would glance fearing the hunters and told me when i saw you not to speak his name but only to give you this as his gage that though all else is lost he has not forgot his honor nor your will cecil castlemaine spoke no word but she stretched out her hand and took ither own costly toy of cambric and lace with her broidered shield and coronet your master thenhe lives lady he bade me say no more you have his message i must tell no further she laid her hand upon his shoulder a light snowwhite hand yet one that held him now in a clasp of steel child answer me at your peril tell me of him whom you call your master tell me allquickquick you are his friend his friend my heaven speak on he bade me tell no more on peril of his heaviest anger but if you are his friend i sure may speak what you should know without me it is a poor friend lady who has need to ask whether another be dead or living the scarlet blood flamed in the countesss blanched face she signed him on with impetuous command she was unused to disobedience and the childs words cut her to the quick sir fulke sails for the french coast tomorrow night the boy went on in tremulous haste he was left for deadour men ran one way and argylls men the otheron the field of sheriffmuir and sure if he had not been strong indeed he would have died that awful night untended on the bleak moor with the winds roaring round him and his life ebbing away he was not one of those who fled you know that of him if you know aught we got him away before dawn donald and i and hid him in a shieling he was in the fever then and knew nothing that was done to him only he kept that bit of lace in his hand for weeks and weeks and would not let us stir it from his grasp what magic there was in it we wondered often but twas a magic mayhap that got him well at last it was an even chance but that hed died god bless him though we did what best we could weve been wandering in the highlands all the year hiding here and tarrying there sir fulke sets no count upon his life sure i think he thanks us little for getting him through the fever of the wounds but he could not have borne to be pinioned you know lady like a thief and hung up by the brutes of whigs as a butcher hangs sheep in the shambles the worst of the dangers overtheyve had their fill of the slaughter but we sail tomorrow night for the french coastenglands no place for my master cecil castlemaine let go her hold upon the boy and her hand closed convulsively upon the dainty handkerchiefher gage sent so faithfully back to her the child looked upon her face perchance in his masters delirium he had caught some knowledge of the story that hung to that broidered toy if you are his friend madame doubtless you have some last word to send him cecil castlemaine whom nothing moved whom nothing softened bowed her head at the simple question her heart wrestling sorely her lips set together in unswerving pride a mist before her haughty eyes the broidered shield upon her handkerchiefthe shield of her stately and unyielding racepressed close against her breast you have no word for him lady her lips parted she signed him away was this child to see her yielding to such weakness had she countess of castlemaine no better pride no better strength no better power of resolve than this the boy lingered i will tell sir fulke then lady that the ruined have no friends whiter and prouder still grew the delicate beauty of her face she raised her stately head haughtily as she had used to glance over a glittering court where each voice murmured praise of her loveliness and reproach of her coldness and placed the fragile toy of lace back in the boys hands go seek your master and give him this in gage that their calamity makes friends more dear to us than their success go he will know its meaning in place of the noon chimes the curfew was ringing from the belltower the swallows were gone to roost amidst the ivy and the herons slept with their heads under their silvery wings among the rushes by the riverside the ferns and wild hyacinths were damp with evening dew and the summer starlight glistened amidst the quivering woodland leaves there was the silence of coming night over the vast forest glades and no sound broke the stillness save the song of the grasshopper stirring the tangled grasses or the sweet low sigh of the west wind fanning the bells of the flowers cecil castlemaine stood once more on the roseterrace shrouded in the dense twilight shade flung from above by the beechboughs waiting listening catching every rustle of the leaves every tremor of the heads of the roses yet hearing nothing in the stillness around but the quick uncertain throbs of her heart beating like the wing of a caged bird under its costly lace pride was forgotten at length and she only rememberedfear and love in the silence and the solitude came a step that she knew came a presence that she felt she bowed her head upon her hands it was new to her this weakness this terror this anguish of joy she sought to calm herself to steel herself to summon back her pride her strength she scorned herself for it all his hand touched her his voice fell on her ear once more eager breathless broken cecil cecil is this true is my ruin thrice blessed or am i mad and dream of heaven she lifted her head and looked at him with her old proud glance her lips trembling with words that all her pride could not summon into speech then her eyes filled with warm blinding tears and softened to new beautyscarce louder than the sigh of the wind among the flowerbells came her words to fulke ravensworths ear as her royal head bowed on his breast stay stay or if you fly your exile shall be my exile your danger my danger the kerchief is a treasured heirloom to her descendants now and fair women of her race who inherit from her her azure eyes and her queenly grace will recall how the proudest countess of their line loved a ruined gentleman so well that she was wedded to him at even in her private chapel at the hour of his greatest peril his lowest fortune and went with him across the seas till friendly intercession in high places gained them royal permission to dwell again at lilliesford unmolested and how it was ever noticeable to those who murmured at her coldness and her pride that cecil castlemaine cold and negligent as of yore to all the world beside would seek her husbands smile and love to meet his eyes and cherish her beauty for his sake and be restless in his absence even for the short span of a day with a softer and more clinging tenderness than was found in many weaker many humbler women they are gone now the men and women of that generation and their voices come only to us through the faint echo of their written words in summer nights the old beechtrees toss their leaves in the silvery light of the stars and the river flows on unchanged with the ceaseless mournful burden of its mystic song the same now as in the midsummer of a century and a half ago the cobweb handkerchief lies before me with its broidered shield the same now as long years since when it was treasured close in a soldiers breast and held by him dearer than all save his honor and his word so things pulseless and passionless endure and human life passes away as swiftly as a song dies off from the airas quickly succeeded and as quickly forgot ronsards refrain is the refrain of our lives le temps sen va le temps sen va ma dame las le temps non mais nous nous en allons little grand and the marchioness or our maltese peerage all first things are voted the best first kisses first toga virilis first hair of the first whisker first speeches are often so superior that members subside after making them fearful of eclipsing themselves first money won at play must always be best as always the dearest bought and first wives are always so superexcellent that if a man lose one he is generally as fearful of hazarding a second as a trout of biting twice but of all first things commend me to ones first uniform no matter that we get sick of harness and get into mufti as soon as we can now there is no more exquisite pleasure than the first sight of ones self in shako and sabretasche how we survey ourselves in the glass and ring for hot water that the handsome housemaid may see us in all our glory and lounge accidentally into our sisters schoolroom that the governess who is nice looking and rather flirty may go down on the spot before us and our scarlet and gold chains and buttons ones first uniform oh the exquisite sensation locked up for us in that first box from sagnarelli or bond street i remember my first uniform i was eighteenas raw a young cub as you could want to see i had not been licked into shape by a public school whose tongue may be rough but cleans off grievances and nonsense better than anything else i had been in that hotbed of effeminacy church principles and weak tea a private tutors where mammas darlings are wrapped up and stuffed with a little terence and horace to show grand at home and upon my life i do believe my sister julia aged thirteen was more wide awake and up to life than i was when the governor an old rector who always put me in mind of the vicar of wakefield got me gazetted to as crack a corps as any in the line the th familiarly known in the service as the dare devils from old peninsular deeds were just then at malta and with among other trifles a chest protector from my father and a recipe for milkarrowroot from my aunt matilda who lived in a constant state of catarrh and of cure for the same tumbled across the bay of biscay and found myself in byrons confounded little military hothouse where most military men some time or other have roasted themselves to death climbing its hilly streets flirting with its valetta belles drinking bass in its hot verandas yawning with ennui in its palace cursing its sirocco and being done by its jew sharpers from a private tutors to a crack mess at maltafrom a convent to a casino could hardly be a greater change just at first i was as much astray as a young pup taken into a stubblefield and wondering what the deuce he is to do there but as it is a pups nature to sniff at birds and start them so is it a boys nature to snatch at the champagne of life as soon as he catches sight of it though you may have brought him up on water from his cradle i took to it at least like a retriever to waterducks though i was green enough to be a firstrate butt for many a day and the practical jokes i had passed on me would have furnished the times with food for crushers on the shocking state of the army for a twelvemonth my chief friend and ally tormentor and initiator was a little fellow cosmo grandison in ours he was little grand to everybody from the colonel to the baggagewomen he was seventeen and had joined about a year what a pretty boy he was too all the fair ones in valetta from his excellencys wife to our washerwomen admired that boy and spoilt him and petted him and i do not believe there was a man of ours who would have had heart to sit in courtmartial on little grand if he had broken every one of the queens regulations and set every general order at defiance i think i see him nowhe was new to malta as i having just landed with the dare devils en route from india to portsmouthas he sat one day on the table in the messroom as cool as a cucumber in spite of the broiling sun smoking and swinging his legs and settling his foragecap on one side of his head as prettylooking plucky impudent a young monkey as ever piqued himself on being an old hand and a knowing bird not to be caught by any chaff however ingeniously prepared simon began little grand my st john first barbarized by mr pope for the convenience of his dactyles and hexameters into sinjin being further barbarized by this little imp into simonsimon do you want to see the finest woman in this confounded little pepperbox youre no judge of a woman though you mufftaste been warped perhaps by constant contemplation of that virgin aunt minervamatilda is it all the same hang your chaff said i youd make one out a fool precisely my dear simon just what you are responded little grand pleasantly bless your heart ive been engaged to half a dozen women since i joined a man can hardly help it you see theyve such a way of drawing you on you dont like to disappoint them poor little dears and so you compromise yourself out of sheer benevolence theres such a run on a handsome manits a great bore sometimes i think i shall shave my head or do something to disfigure myself as spurina did poor fellow i feel for him well simon you dont seem curious to know who my beauty is one of those mitchell girls of the twentyfirst you waltzed with em all night but theyre too tall for you grand the mitchell girls ejaculated he with supreme scorn great maypoles they go about with the fusiliers like a pair of colors on every ballroom battlefield ones safe to see them flaunting away and as everybody has a shot at em their hearts must be pretty well riddled into holes by this time no mines rather higher game than that my mothers brotherinlaws aunts sisters cousins cousin once removed was viscount twaddle and i dont go anything lower than the peerage what is it somebody youve met at his excellencys wrong again beloved simon its nobody ive met at old stars and garters though his ladywife could no more do without me than without her sal volatile and flirtations no she dont go there shes too high for that sort of thingsick of it after all the european courts malta must be rather small and slow i was introduced to her yesterday and continued little grand more solemnly than was his wont i do assure you shes superb divine and im not very easy to please whats her name i asked rather impressed with this view of a lady too high for old stars and garters as we irreverently termed her majestys representative in her island of malta little grand took his pipe out of his lips to correct me with more dignity her title my dear simon is the marchioness st julian is that an english peerage grand hum what oh yes of course what else should it be you owl not being in a condition to decide this point i was silent and he went on growing more impressive at each phrase she is splendid really and im a very difficile fellow you know but such hair such eyes one doesnt see every day in those sundried mitchells or those little pink bovilliers well yesterday after that confounded luncheon how i hate all those complimentary affairsone cant enjoy the truffles for talking to the ladies nor enjoy the ladies for discussing the truffles i went for a ride with conran out to villa neponte i left him there and went down to see the overland steamers come in while i was waiting i got into talk somehow or other with a very agreeable gentlemanlike fellow who asked me if id only just come to malta and all that sort of thingyou know the introductory style of actiontill we got quite good friends and he told me he was living outside this wretched little hole at the casa di fiori and saidwasnt it civil of himsaid he should be very happy to see me if id call any time he gave me his cardlord adolphus fitzherveyand a man with him called him dolph as good luck had it my weed went out just while we were talking and fitzhervey was monstrously pleasant searched all over him for a fusee couldnt find one and asked me to go up with him to the casa di fiori and get a light of course i did and he and i and guatamara had some sherbet and a smoke together and then he introduced me to the marchioness st julian his sisterby jove such a magnificent woman simon you never saw one like her ill wager she was uncommonly agreeable too and such a smile my boy she seemed to like me wonderfullynot rare that though youll sayand asked me to go and take coffee there tonight after mess and bring one of my chums with me and as i like to show you life young one and your taste wants improving after aunt minerva you may come if you like hallo theres conran i say dont tell him i dont want any poaching on my manor conran came in at that minute he was then a brevetmajor and captain in ours and one of the older men who spoilt little grand in one way as much as the women did in another he was a fine powerful fellow with eyes like an eagles and pluck like a lions he had a grave look and had been of late more silent and selfreticent than the other roistering debonnair lighthearted dare devils but though perhaps tired of the wild escapades which reputation had once attributed to him was always the most lenient to the boys monkey tricks and always the one to whom he went if his larks had cost him too dear or if he was in a scrape from which he saw no exit conran had recently come in for a good deal of money and there were few bright eyes in malta that would not have smiled kindly on him but he did not care much for any of them there was some talk of a loveaffair before he went to india that was the cause of his hardheartedness though i must say he did not look much like a victim to the grande passion in my ideas which were drawn from valentines and odes in the woman thou fond and fair deceiver style in love that turned its collars down and let its hair go uncut and refused to eat and recovered with a rapidity proportionate to its ostentation and i did not know that if a man has lost his treasure he may mourn it so deeply that he may refuse to run about like harpagon crying for his cassette to an audience that only laughs at his miseries well young ones said conran as he came in and threw down his cap and whip here you are spending your hours in pipes and bad wine what a blessing it is to have a palate that isnt blase and that will swallow all wine just because it is wine that south african goes down with better relish little grand than youll find in chateau margaux ten years hence as soon as one begins to want touching up with olives ones real gusto is gone hang olives sir theyre beastly said little grand and i dont care who pretends theyre not olives are like sermons and wives everybody makes a wry face and would rather be excused em major but its the custom to call em good things and so men bolt em in complaisance and while they hate the saltwater flavor descant on the delicious rose taste quite true little grand but one takes olives to enhance the wine and so perhaps other mens sermons make one enjoy ones racier novel and other mens wives make one appreciate ones liberty still better dont abuse olives youll want them figuratively and literally before youve done either drinking or living oh confound it major cried little grand i do hope and trust a spent ball may have the kindness to double me up and finish me off before then youre not philosophic my boy thank heaven no ejaculated little grand piously ive an uncle a very great philosopher beats all the sages hollow from bion to buckle and writes in the metaphysical quarterly but ill be shot if he dont spend so much time in trying to puzzle out what life is that all his has slipped away without his having lived one bit when i was staying with him one christmas he began boring me with a frightful theory on the nonexistence of matter i couldnt stand that so i cut him short and set him down to the luncheontable and while he was full swing with a strasbourg pate and comet hock i stopped him and asked him if with them in his mouth he believed in matter or not he was shut up of course bless your soul those theorists always are if youre down upon em with a little fact such as a strasbourg patethat is an unanswerable argument with most men i believe said conran who liked to hear the boy chatter what are you going to do with yourself tonight grand i am going toarhumto a friend of mine said little grand less glibly than usual very well i only asked because i would have taken you to mrs fortescues with me theyre having some acting proverbs horrible exertion in this oven of a place with the thermometer at a hundred and twenty degrees but if youve better sport its no matter take care what friends you make though grand youll find some maltese acquaintances very costly thank you i should say i can take care of myself replied little grand with immeasurable scorn and dignity conran laughed struck him across the shoulders with his whip stroked his own moustaches and went out again whistling one of verdis airs i dont want him bothering you know explained little grand shes such a deuced magnificent woman she was a magnificent woman this eudoxia adelaida marchioness st julian and proud enough little grand and i felt when we had that soft jewelled hand held out to us and that bewitching smile beamed upon us and that joyous presence dazzling in our eyes as we sat in the drawingroom of that casa di fiori she was about thirtyfive i should say boys always worship those who might have been schoolfellows of their mothers tall and stately and imposing with the most beautiful pink and white skin with a fine set of teeth raven hair and eyes tinted most exquisitely oh she was magnificent our marchioness st julian into what unutterable insignificance what miserable washedout shadows sank stars and garters lady and the mitchell girls and all the belles of la valetta whom we hadnt thought so very badlooking before there was a young creature sitting a little out of the radiance of light reading but we had no eyes for anybody except the marchioness st julian we were in such high society too there was her brother lord adolphus and his bosom pylades the baron guatamara and there was a big fellow with hooked nose and very curly hair who was introduced to us as the prince of orangia magnolia and a little wiry fellow with bits of red and blue ribbon and a star or two in his buttonhole who was m le due de saintjeu we were quite dazzled with the coruscations of so much aristocracy especially when they talked across to each otherso familiarly tooof johnnie that we lord russell and pam and old buck my godfather buckingham lord adolphus explained to us and montpensier and old joinville and chatted of when they dined at the tuileries and stayed at compiegne and hunted at belvoir and spent christmas at holcombe or longleat we were in such high society how contemptible appeared mrs maberlys and the fortescue soirees how infinitesimally small grew charlie ruthven and harry villiers and grey and albany and all the other young fellows who thought it such great guns to be au mieux with little graziella or invited to sir george dashaways we were a cut above those things nowrather that splendid marchioness there was a head for a coronet if you like and how benign she was grand sat on the couch beside her and i on an ottoman on her left and she leaned back in her magnificent toilette flirting her fan like a castilian and flashing upon us her superb eyes from behind it not speaking very much but showing her white teeth in scores of heavenly smiles till little grand the blase man of seventeen and i the raw moses of private tutelage both felt that we had never come across anything like this never in fact seen a woman worth a glance before she listened to usor rather to him i was too awestruck to advance much beyond monosyllablesand laughed at him and smiled encouragingly on my gaucherie and when a boy is gauche how ready he is to worship such a helping hand and beamed upon us both with an effulgence compared with which the radiance of helen galatea oenone messalina lais and all the legendary beauties one reads about must have been what the railway nightlamps that never burn are to the prismatic luminaries of cremorne they were all uncommonly pleasant all except the girl who was reading whom they introduced as the signorina da guari a tuscan and daughter to orangia magnolia with one of those marvellously beautiful faces that one sees in the most splendid painters models of the campagna who never lifted her head scarcely though guatamara and saintjeu did their best to make her but all the others were wonderfully agreeable and quite feted little grand and me at which they being more than double our age and seemingly at home alike with belgravia and newmarket the faubourg and the pytchley we felt to grow at least a foot each in the aroma of this casa di fiori this is rather stupid doxie began lord adolphus addressing his sister not much entertainment for our guests what do you say to a game of vingtetun eh mr grandison little grand fixed his blue eyes on the marchioness and said he should be very happy but as for entertainmenthe wanted no other no compliments petit ami laughed the marchioness with a dainty blow of her fan yes dolph have vingtetun or music or anything you like sing us something lucrezia the italian girl thus addressed looked up with a passionate haughty flush and answered with wonderfully little courtesy i considered i shall not sing tonight are you unwell fairest friend asked the duc de saintjeu bending his little wiry figure over her she shrank away from him and drew back a hot color in her cheeks signore i did not address you the marchioness looked angry if those divine eyes could look anything so mortal however she shrugged her shoulders well my dear lucrezia we cant make you sing of course if you wont i for my part always do any little thing i can to amuse anybody if i fail i fail i have done my best and my friends will appreciate the effort if not the result no my dear prince do not tease her said the marchioness to orangia magnolia who was arguing i thought somewhat imperatively for such a wellbred and courtly man with lucrezia we will have vingtetun and lucrezia will give us the delight of her voice some other evening i dare say we had vingtetun the marchioness would not play but she sat in her rose velvet armchair just behind little grand putting in pretty little speeches and questions and bagatelles and calling attention to the gambols of her darling greyhound cupidon and tapping little grand with her fan till i believe he neither knew how the game went nor what money he lost and i gazing at her and cursing him for his facile tongue never noticed my naturels couldnt have said what the maximum was if you had paid me for it and might for anything i knew to the contrary have been seeing my life slip away with each card as balzacs hero with the peau de chagrin then we had sherbet and wine and cognac for those who preferred it and the marchioness gave us permission to smoke and took a dainty hookah with an amber mouthpiece for her own use divine she did look too with that hookah between her ruby lips and the smoke and the cognac and the smiles unloosed our tongues and we spake like very great donkeys i dare say but im sure with not a tenth part the wisdom that balaams ass developed in his brief and pithy conversation however great the bosh we talked though we found very lenient auditors fitzhervey and guatamara laughed at all our witticisms the prince of orangia magnolia joined in with a per baccho and a bravo and little saintjeu wheezed and gave a faint echo of mon dieu and tres bien tres bien vraiment and the marchioness st julian laughed too and joined in our nonsense and what was much more bent a willing ear to our compliments no matter how florid and saintjeu told us a story or two more amusing than comme il faut at which the marchioness tried to look grave and did look shocked but laughed for all that behind her fan and lucrezia da guari sat in shadow as still and as silent as the parian euphrosyne on the console though her passionate eyes and expressive face looked the very antipodes of silence and statuetteism as she flashed halfshy halfscornful looks upon us if the first part of the evening had been delightful this was something like paradise it was such high society and with just dash enough of mabille and coulisses laisseraller to give it piquancy how different was the pleasantry and freedom of these real aristos after the humdrum dinners and horrid bores of dances that those snobs of maberlys and fortescues and mitchells made believe to call society what with the wine and the smoke and the smiles i wasnt quite clear as to whether i saw twenty horses heads or one when i was fairly into saddle and riding back to the town just as the first dawn was rising aphroditelike from the far blue waves of the mediterranean little grand was better seasoned but even he was dizzy with the parting words of the marchioness which had softly breathed the delicious passport come tomorrow by jupiter swore little grand obliged to give relief to his feelingsby jupiter simon did you ever see such a glorious enchanting divine delicious adorable creature faugh who could look at those mitchell girls after her such eyes such a smile such a figure talk of a coronet no imperial crown would be half good enough for her and how pleasant those fellows are i like that little chaffy chap the duke what a slapup story that was about the bal de lopera and fitzhervey too theres something uncommonly thoroughbred about him aint there and guatamaras an immensely jolly fellow ah myboy thats something like society all the ease and freedom of real rank no nonsense about them as there is about snobs i say what wouldnt the other fellows give to be in our luck i think even conran would warm up about her but simon shes deucedly taken with meshe is upon my word and she knows how to show it you too by george one could die for a woman like thateh die i echoed while my horse stumbled along up the hilly road and i swayed forward pretty nearly over his head while poetry rushed to my lips and electric sparks danced before my eyes to die for those we love oh there is power in the true heart and pride and joy for this it is to live without the vanished light that strength is needed but ill be shot if it shall be vanished light returned little grand it dont look much like it yet the lights only just lit tisnt likely its going out again directly but she is a stunner and a stunner i shouted shes much more than thatshes an angel and ill be much obliged to you to call her by her right name sir shes a beautiful noble loving woman the most perfect of all natures masterworks she is divine sir and you and i are not worthy merely to kiss the hem of her garment aint we though i dont care much about kissing her dress its silk and i dont know that i should derive much pleasure from pressing my lips on its texture but her cheek her cheek is like the catherine pear the side thats next the sun i shouted as my horse went down in a rut shes like venus rising from the seashell shes like aurora when she came down on the first ray of the dawn to tithonus shes like briseis bother classics shes like herself and beats em all hollow shes the finest creature ever seen on earth and i should like to see the man whod dare to say she wasnt andi say simonhow much did you lose tonight from sublimest heights i tumbled straight to bathos the cold water of grands query quenched my poetry extinguished my electric lights and sobered me like a douche bath i dont know i answered with a sense of awe and horror stealing over me but i had a pony in my waistcoatpocket that the governor had just sent me guatamara changed it for me andive only sixpence left old boy said little grand to me the next morning after early parade come in my room and lets make up some despatches to the governors you see he continued five minutes afteryou see were both of us pretty well cleared out ive only got half a pony and you havent a couple of fivers left now you know they evidently play rather high at the casa di fiori do everything en prince like nobs whove barclays at their back and one mustnt hang fire horrid shabby that would look besides fancy seeming mean before her so ive been thinking that though governors are a screwy lot generally if we put it to em clearly the sort of set weve got into and show em that we cant help now that we are at rome doing as the romans do i should say they could hardly help bleeding a littleeh now listen how ive put it my old boy has a weakness for titles he married my mother on the relationship to viscount twaddles who doesnt know of her existence but who does to talk about as our cousin and hed eat up miles of dirt for a chance of coming to a strawberryleaf so i think this will touch him up beautifully listen aint i sublimely respectful im sure my dear father you wilt be delighted to learn that by wonderful luck or rather i ought to say providence i have fallen on my feet in malta and got introduced to the very highest wait let me stick a dash under verythe very highest society here they are quite tiptop to show you what style i need only mention lord a fitzhervey the baron guatamara and the marchioness st julian as among my kindest friends they have been yachting in the levant and are now staying in malta they are all most kind to me and i know you will appreciate the intellectual advantages that such contact must afford me at the same time you will understand that i can hardly enter such circles as a snob and you will wish your son to comport himself as a gentleman but gentlemanizing comes uncommon dear i can tell you with all the care in the world and if you could let me have another couple of hundred i should vote youa what simonan outandout brick is the sensible style but i suppose the best and kindest of parents is the filial dodge eh there with fond love to mamma and florie ever your affectionate son cosmo grandison bravo thats prime thatll bring the yellows down i take it here old fellow copy it to your governor you couldnt have a more stunning effusionshort and to the purpose as cabinet councils ought to be and aint fire away my juvenile i did fire away only i of a more impressionable and poetic nature than little grand gave a certain vent to my feelings in expatiating on the beauty grace condescension c c of the marchioness to my mother i did not mention the grivois stories the brandy and the hookah i was quite sure they were the sign of that delirious ease and disregard of snobbish etiquette and convenances peculiar to the upper ten but i thought the poor people at home in vicarage seclusion would be too out of the world to fully appreciate such revelations of our creme de la creme besides my governor had jamess own detestation of the divine weed and considered that men who made chimneys of their mouths might just as well have the mark of the beast at once little grand and i were hardup for cash and en attendant the governors replies and remittances we had recourse to the tender mercies and leather bags of napoleons ducats florins and doubloons of a certain spanish jew one balthazar miraflores a shrivelledskinned weezing old cove who was most happy to lent anytink to his tear young shentlesmen but by got he was as poor as job he was indeed whether job ever lent money out on interest or not i cant say perhaps he did as in the finish he ended with having quadrupled his cattle and lands and all his goodsa knack usurers preserve in full force to this day but all i can say is that if he was not poorer than mr miraflores he was not much to be pitied for he miserly old shark lived in his dark dirty hole like a crocodile embedded in nile mud and crushed the bones of all unwary adventurers who came within range of his great bristling jaws money however little grand and i got out of him in plenty only for a little bit of paper in exchange and at that time we didnt know that though the paper tax would be repealed at last there would remain as long as youths are green and old birds cunning a heavy and a bitter tax on certain bits of paper to which ones hand is put which mr gladstone though he achieve the herculean task of making draymen take kindly to vin ordinaire and the popping of champagne corks a familiar sound by cottagehearths will never be able to include in his budgets to come among the taxes that are repealed well we had our money from old balthazar that morning and we played with it again that night up at the casa di fiori loo this time by way of change saintjeu said he always thought it well to change your game as you change your loves constancy whether to cards or women was most fatiguing we liked saintjeu very much we thought him such a funny fellow they said they did not care to play muchof course they didnt when guatamara had had ecarte with the grandduke of chaffsandlarkstein at half a million a side and lord dolph had broken the bank at homburg just for funno fun to old blanc who farms it though you know but the marchioness who was doubly gracious that night told them they must play because it amused her chers petits amis besides she said in her pretty imperious way she liked to see itit amused her after that of course there was no more hesitation down we sat and young heavystone with us the evening before we had happened to mention him said he was a fellow of no end of tin though as stupid an owl as ever spelt his own name wrong when he passed a military examination and the marchioness recalling the name said she remembered his father and asked us to bring him to see her which we did fearing no rival in old heavy so down we three sat and had the evening before over again with the cards and the smiles and wiles of our divinity and saintjeus stories and fitzherveys cognac and cigars with this difference that we found loo more exciting than vingtetun they played it so fast too it was like a breathless heat for the goodwood cup and the marchioness watched it leaning alternately over grands and heavys and my chair and saying with such naive delight oh do take miss cosmo i would risk it if i were you mr heavystone pray dont let my naughty brother win everything that id have defied the stiffest of the stagyrites or the chilliest of calvinists to have kept their head cool with that syren voice in their ear and la lucrezia sat as she had sat the night before by the open window still and silent the cape jasmines and southern creepers framing her in a soft moonlight picture contrast enough to the brilliantly lighted room echoing with laughter at saintjeus stories perfumed with cubas and narghiles and shrining the magnificent fullblown jewelled beauty of our marchioness st julian with which we were as rapidly as madly as unreasoningly and as sentimentally in love as any boys of seventeen or eighteen ever could be what greater latitude you will exclaim recalling certain buriedaway episodes of your hobbedehoyism when you addressed latin distichs to that hazeleyed hebe who presided over oyster patties and water ices at the pastrycooks in eton or ruined your governors young plantations cutting the name of adeliza mary your cousin at this day a portly person in velvet and point whom you can now call with a thanksgiving in the stead of the olden tremor mrs hector mcutchin yes we were in love in a couple of evenings little grand vehemently and unpoetically i shyly and sentimentally according to our temperament and as the fair emily stirred feud between the two noble kinsmen so the marchioness st julian began to sow seeds of jealousy and detestation between us sworn allies as we were but le veritable amant ne connait point damis and as soon as we began to grow jealous of each other little grand could have kicked me to the devil and i could have kicked him with the greatest pleasure in life but i was shy little grand was blessed with all the audacity imaginable the consequence was that when our horses came round and the maltese who acted as cherub was going to close the gates of paradise upon us he managed to slip into the marchionesss boudoir to get a teteatete farewell while i strode up and down the veranda not heeding saintjeu who was telling me a tale to which in any other saner moments i should have listened greedily but longing to execute on little grand some fierce and terrible vengeance to which the vendetta should be babys play saintjeu left me to put his arm over heavys shoulder and tell him if ever he came to paris he should be transported to receive him at the hotel de millefleurs and present him at the tuileries and i stood swearing to myself and breaking off sprays of the veranda creepers when i heard somebody say very softly and low signore come here a moment it was that sweetly pretty mute whom we had barely noticed absorbed as we were in the worship of our maturer idol leaning out of the window her cheeks flushed her lips parted her eyes sad and anxious of course i went to her surprised at her waking up so suddenly to any interest in me she put her hand on my coatsleeve and drew me down towards her listen to me a moment i hardly know how to warn you and yet i must i cannot sit quietly by and see you and your young friends being deceived as so many have been before you do not come here againdo not figlia mia are you not afraid of the nightair said the prince of orangia magnolia just behind us his words were kind but there was a nasty glitter in his eyes lucrezia answered him in passionate italianof which i had no knowledgewith such fire in her eyes such haughty gesticulation and such a torrent of words that i really began to think pretty soft little dear as she looked that she must positively be a trifle out of her mind her silence before and her queer speech to me seemed such odd behavior for a young lady in such high society she was turning to me again when little grand came out into the veranda looking flushed proud and selfcomplaisant as such a winner and slayer of women would do my hand clenched on the jasmine i thirsted to spring on him as he stood there with his provoking selfcontented smile and his confounded coxcombical air and his cursed fair curlsmy hair was dustcolored and as rebellious as porcupinequillsand wash out in his blood or minea touch of a soft hand thrilled through my every nerve and fibre the marchioness was there and signed me to her lucrezia little grand and all the rest of the universe vanished from my mind at the lightning of that angel smile and the rustle of that moireantique dress she beckoned me to her into the empty drawingroom augustus i never thought my name could sound so sweet before tell me what was my niece lucrezia saying to you just now now i had a sad habit of telling the truth it was an outoftheworld custom taught me among other oldfashioned things at home though i soon found how inconvenient a betise modern society considers it and i blurted the truth out here not distinctly or gracefully though as little grand would have done for i was in that state of exaltation ordinarily expressed as not knowing whether one is standing in ones wellingtons or not the marchioness sighed ah did she say that poor dear girl she dislikes me so much it is quite an hallucination and yet o augustus i have been to her like an elder sister like a mother imagine how it grieves me and the marchioness shed some tearspearls of price thought i worthy to drop from angel eyesit is a bitter sorrow to me but poor darling she is not responsible she touched her veiny temple significantly as she spoke and i understood and felt tremendously shocked at it that the young fair italian girl was a fierce and cruel maniac who had the heart oh most extraordinary madness did it seem to me if i had lost my senses i could never have harmed her to hate absolutely hate the noblest tenderest most beautiful of women i never alluded to it to any one continued the marchioness guatamara and saintjeu though such intimate friends are ignorant of it i would rather have any one think ever so badly of me than reveal to them the cruel misfortune of my sweet lucrezia how noble she looked as she spoke but you augustus you and she smiled upon me till i grew as dizzy as after my first taste of milkpunch i have not the courage to let you go off with any bad impression of me i have known you a very little while it is truebut a few hours indeedyet there are affinities of heart and soul which overstep the bounds of time and laughing at the chill ties of ordinary custom make strangers dearer than old friends the room revolved round me the lights danced up and down my heart beat like thors hammer and my pulse went as fast as a favorite saving the distance she speaking so to me my senses whirled round and round like fifty thousand witches on a walpurgis night and down i went on my knees before my magnificent idol raving away i couldnt tell you what nowthe essence of everything id ever read from ovid to alexander smith it must have been something frightful to hear though heaven knows i meant it earnestly enough suddenly i was pulled up with a jerk as one throws an unbroken colt back on his haunches in the middle of his first start i thought i heard a laugh she started up too hush another time we may be overheard and drawing her dress from my hands which grasped it as agonisingly as a cockney grasps his saddlebow holding on for dear life over the burton or tedworth country she stooped kindly over me and floated away before i was recovered from the exquisite delirium of my ecstatic trance she loved me this superb creature loved me there was not a doubt of it and how i got back to the barracks that night in my heavenly state of mind i could never have told all i know is that grand and i never spoke a word by tacit consent all the way back that i felt a fiendish delight when i saw his proud triumphant air and thought how little he guessed poor fellowand that dream of one fair woman was as superior in rapture to the dream of fair women as tokay to the fine fruity port that results from damsons and a decoction of sloes the next day there was a grand affair in malta to receive some foreign prince whose name i do not remember now who called on us en route to england of course all the troops turned out and there was an inspection of us and a grand luncheon and dinner and ball and all that sort of thing which a month before i should have considered prime fun but which now as it kept me out of my paradise i thought the most miserable bore that could possibly have chanced i say said heavy to me as i was getting into harnessi say dont you wonder fitzhervey and the marchioness aint coming to the palace today one would have thought old stars and garters would have been sure to ask them ask them i should say so i returned with immeasurable disdain of course he asked them but she told me she shouldnt come last night she is so tired of such things she came yachting with fitzhervey solely to try and have a little quiet she says people never give her a moments rest when she is in paris or london she was sorry to disappoint stars and garters but i dont think she likes his wife much she dont consider her good ton on which information heavy lapsed into a state of profoundest awe and wonderment it having been one of his articles of faith for the month that we had been in malta that the palace people were exalted demigods whom it was only permissible to worship from a distance and a very respectful distance too heavy had lost some twenty odd pounds the night beforeof course we lost young hands as we were unaccustomed to the society of that entertaining gentleman pamand had grumbled not a little at the loss of his gold bobs but now i could see that such a contemptibly pecuniary matter was clean gone from his memory and that he would have thought the world well lost for the honor of playing cards with people who could afford to disappoint old stars and garters the inspection was over at last and if any other than conran had been my senior officer i should have come off badly in all probability for the abominable manner in which i went through my evolutions the day came to an end somehow or other though i began to think it never would the luncheon was ended the bigwigs were taking their sieste or otherwise occupied and i trusting to my absence not being noticed tore off as hard as man can who has cupid for his pegasus with a bouquet as large as a drumhead clasped round with a bracelet about which i had many doubts as to the propriety of offering to the possessor of such jewelry as the marchioness must have yet on which i thought i might venture after the scene of last night i was soon on the veranda of the casa di fiori and my natural shyness being stimulated into a distant resemblance of little grands enviable brass seeing the windows of the drawingroom open i pushed aside the green venetians and entered noiselessly the room did not look a quarter so inviting as the night before though it was left in precisely a similar state i do not know how it was but those cards lying about on the floor those sconces with the wax run down and dripping over them those emptied caraffes that had diffused an odor not yet dissipated those tables and velvet couches all a tort et a travers did not look so very inviting after all and even to my unsophisticated senses scarcely seemed fit for a peeress there was nobody in the room and i walked through it towards the boudoir from the open door i saw fitzhervey guatamara and my marchionessbut oh what horror unutterable doingque pensezvous drinking bottled porterand drinking bottled porter in a peignoir not of the cleanliest and with raven tresses not of the neatest only fancy she that divine spirituelle creature who had talked but a few hours before of the affinity of souls to have come down like any ordinary woman to guinnesss stout and a checked dressinggown and unbrushed locks to find your prophet without his silver veil or your leila dead drowned in a sack or your guinevere flown over with sir lancelot to boulogne or your longesteemed griselda gone off with your cockaded jeames is nothing to the torture the unutterable anguish of seeing your angel your divinity your bright particular star your hallowed arabian rose come down tobottled porter do not talk to me of dore sir or mr martins pictures their horrors dwindle into insignificance compared with the horror of finding an intimate liaison between ones first love and bottled porter in my first dim unutterable anguish i should have turned and fled but my syrens voice had not lost all its power despite the stout and dirty dressinggown for she was a very handsome woman and could stand such things as well as anybody she came towards me with her softest smile glancing at the bracelet on the bouquet apologizing slightly for her negligei am so indolent i only dress for those i care to pleaseand i never hoped to see you today in short magnetizing me over again and smoothing down my outraged sensibilities till i ended by becoming almost blind quite i could not manage to the checked robe de chambre and the unbrushed bandeaux by offering her my braceleted bouquet which was very graciously accepted and even by sharing the atrocious london porter that horrid stuff she called it how i hate it but it is the only thing sir benjamin brodie allows me i am so very delicate you know my sensibilities so frightfully acute i had not twenty minutes to stay having to be back at the barracks or risk a reprimand which happily the checked peignoir had cooled me sufficiently to enable me to recollect so i took my farewellone not unlike medoras and conrads fitzhervey and guatamara having kindly withdrawn as soon as the bottled porter was finishedand i went out of the house in a very blissful state despite guinness and the unwelcome demitoilette which did not accord with eugene sues and the parlor librarys description of the general gettingup and stunning appearance of heroines and peeresses reclining in robes of cloudlike tissue and folds of the richest lace on a cabriole couch of amber velvet while the air was filled with the voluptuous perfume of the flowerchildren of the south and music from unseen choristers lulled the senses with its divinest harmony c c c bottled porter and a checked dressinggown say what you like sirs it takes a very strong passion to overcome those i have heard men ascribe the waning of their affections after the honeymoon to the constant sight of their wiveswhom before they had only seen making papas coffee with an angelic air and a toilette tiree a quatre epingleseverlastingly coming down too late for breakfast in a dressinggown and upon my soul if ever i marry which heaven in pitiful mercy forfend and my wife make her appearance in one of those confounded peignoirs i will give that muchrunafter and deeplytobepitied public character the divorce judge some more work to doi will upon my honor however the peignoir had not iced me enough that time to prevent my tumbling out of the house in as delicious an ecstasy as if i had been eating some of monte cristos hatchis as i went out not looking before me i came bang against the chest of somebody else who not admiring the rencontre hit my cap over my eyes and exclaimed in not the most courtly manner you will acknowledge you cursed owl take that then what are you doing here i should like to know confound your impudence i retorted as soon as my ocular powers were restored and i saw the blue eyes fair curls and smart figure of my ancient iolaues now my bitterest foeconfound your impertinence what are you doing here you mean take care and dont ask questions about what doesnt concern you returned little grand with a laugha most irritating laugh there are times when such cachinnations sting ones ears more than a volley of oaths go home and mind your own business my chicken you are a green bird and nobody minds you but still youll find it as well not to come poaching on other mens manors other mens manors mine if you please i shouted so mad with him i could have floored him where he stood phew laughed little grand screwing up his lips into a contemptuous whistle youve been drinking too much bass my daisy tis nt good for young headscant stand it go home innocent the insult the disdainful tone froze my blood my heart swelled with a sense of outraged dignity and injured manhood with a conviction of my immeasurable superiority of position as the beloved of that divine creature i emancipated myself from the certain sort of slavery i was generally in to little grand and spoke as i conceived it to be the habit of gentlemen whose honor had been wounded to speak mr grandison you will pay for this insult i shall expect satisfaction little grand laughed againabsolutely grinned the audacious young impand he twelve months younger than i too certainly sir if you wish to be made a target of i shall be delighted to oblige you i cant keep ladies waiting it is always place aux dames with me so for the present good morning and off went the young coxcomb into the casa di fiori and i only consoled by the reflection of the different reception he would receive to what mine had been he had a braceleted bouquet too the young pretentious puppy started off again assuaging my lacerated feelings with the delicious word of satisfaction i felt myself immeasurably raised above the heads of every other man in maltaa perfect hero of romance in fact fit to figure in my beloved alexandres most highlywrought yellowpapered roman with a duel on my hands and the love of a magnificent creature like my eudoxia adelaida she had become eudoxia adelaida to me now and i had forgiven if not forgotten the dirty dressinggown the bottled porter lay of course at brodies door if he would condemn spiritual forms of life and light to the common realistic aliments of horrible barmaids and draymen she could not help it nor i either if angels come down to earth and are separated from their natural nourishment of manna and nectar they must take what they can get even though it be so coarse and sublunary a thing as guinnesss xxx must they not sir yes i felt very exalte with my affair of honor and my affair of the heart little grand for my foe and my marchioness for a love i never stopped to remember that i might be smashing with frightful recklessness the sixth and the seventh commandments if little grand got shot he must thank himself he should not have insulted me and if there was a marquis st julian whyi pitied him poor fellow that was all full of these sublime sensationsgrown at least three feet in my varnished bootsi lounged into the ballroom feeling supreme pity for ensigns who were chattering round the door admiring those poor pale garrison girls they had not a duel and a marchioness they did not know what beauty meantwhat life was i did not dancei was above that sort of thing nowthere was not a woman worth the trouble in the room and about the second waltz i saw my wouldbe rival talking to ruthven a fellow in ours little grand did not look glum or dispirited as he ought to have done after the interview he must have had but probably that was the boys brass he would never look beaten if you had hit him till he was black and blue presently ruthven came up to me he was not overused to his business for he began the opening chapter in rather schoolboy fashion hallo gus so you and little grand have been falling out why dont you settle it with a little mill a vast deal better than pistols duels always seem to me no fun two men stand up like fools and mr ruthven said i very haughtily if your principal desires to apologize apologize bless your soul no but then said i cutting him uncommonly short indeed you can have no necessity to address yourself to me and i beg to refer you to my friend and second mr heavystone wherewith i bowed turned on my heel and left him i did not sleep that night though i tried hard because i thought it the correct thing for heroes to sleep sweetly till the clock strikes the hour of their duel execution c or whatever it may hap egmont slept argyle slept philippe egalite scores of them but i could not not that i funked it thank heaveni never had a touch of thatbut because i was in such a delicious state of excitement selfadmiration and heroism which had not cooled when i found myself walking down to the appointed place by the beach with poor old heavy who was intensely impressed by being charged with about five quires of the best creamlaid to be given to the marchioness in case i fell little grand and ruthven came on the ground at almost the same moment little grand eminently jaunty and most confoundedly handsome we took off our caps with distant ceremony the castilian hidalgos were never more stately but then what knights of the round table ever splintered spears for such a woman the paces were measured the pistols taken out of their case we were just placed and ruthven with a handkerchief in his hand had just enumerated in awful accents one twothe three yet hovered on his lips when we heard a laughthe third laugh that had chilled my blood in twentyfour hours somebodys hand was laid on little grands shoulder and conrans voice interrupted the whole thing hallo young ones what farce is this farce sir retorted little grand hotlyfarce it is no farce it is an affair of honor and dont make me laugh my dear boy smiled conran it is so much too warm for such an exertion pray why are you and your once sworn friend making popinjays of each other mr grandison has grossly insulted me i began and i demand satisfaction i will not stir from the ground without it and you shant shouted little grand do you dare to pretend i want to funk you little contemptible though it was too warm conran went off into a fit of laughter i dare say our sublimity had a comic touch in it of which we never dreamt my dear boys pray dont it is too fatiguing come grand what is it all about i deny your right to question me major retorted little grand in a fury what have you to do with it i mean to punish that young owl yonderwho didnt know how to drink anything but milkandwater didnt know how to say bo to a goose till i taught himfor very abominable impertinence and ill my impertinence i like that i shouted it is your unwarrantable overbearing selfconceit that makes you the laughingstock of all the mess which silence said conrans still stern voice which subdued us into involuntary respect no more of this nonsense put up those pistols ruthven you are two hotheaded silly boys who dont know for what you are quarrelling live a few years longer and you wont be so eager to get into hot water and put cartridges into your best friends no i shall not hear any more about it if you do not instantly give me your words of honor not to attempt to repeat this folly as your senior officer i shall put you under arrest for six weeks o alexandra dumaso monte cristoo heroes of yellow paper and pluck invincible i ask pardon of your shades i must record the fact lowering and melancholy as it is that before our senior officer our heroism melted like vanille ice in the sun our glories tumbled to the ground like twelfthcake ornaments under childrens fingers and before the threat of arrest the lions lay down like lambs conran sent us back humbled sulky and crestfallen and resumed his solitary patrol upon the beach where before the sun was fairly up he was having a shot at curlews but if he was a little stern he was no less kindhearted and in the afternoon of that day while he lay after his siesta smoking on his little bed i unburdened myself to him he did not laugh at me though i saw a quizzical smile under his black moustaches what is your divinitys name he asked when i had finished eudoxia adelaida marchioness st julian the marchioness st julian oh do you know her i inquired somewhat perplexed by his tone he smiled straight out this time i dont know her but there are a good many peeresses in malta and gibraltar and along the line of the pacific as my brother ned in the belisarius will tell you i could count two score such of my acquaintance off at this minute i wondered what he meant i dare say he knew all the peerage but that had nothing to do with me and i thought it strange that all the duchesses and countesses and baronesses should quit their countryseats and townhouses to locate themselves along the line of the pacific shes a fine woman st john he went on fine i reiterated bursting into a panegyric with which i wont bore you as i bored him well youre going there tonight you say take me with you and well see what i think of your marchioness i looked at his fine figure and features recalled certain tales of his conquests remembered that he knew french italian german and spanish but not being very able to refuse acquiesced with a reluctance i could not entirely conceal conran however did not perceive it and after mess took his cap and went with me to the casa di fiori the rooms were all right again my marchioness was en grande tenue amber silk black lace diamonds and all that sort of style fitzhervey and the other men were in evening dress drinking coffee there was not a trace of bottled porter anywhere and it was all very brilliant and presentable the marchioness st julian rose with the warmest effusion her dazzling white teeth showing in the sunniest of smiles and both hands outstretched augustus bien aime you are rather late i suppose she was going to say but she stopped dead short her teeth remained parted in a stereotyped smile a blankness of dismay came over her luminous eyes she caught sight of conran and i imagined i heard a very lowbreathed curse the fellow from courteous lord dolph conran came forward however as if he did not notice it there was only that queer smile lurking under his moustaches i introduced him to them and the marchioness smiled again and fitzhervey almost resumed his wonted extreme urbanity but they were somehow or other wonderfully ill at easewonderfully for people in such high society and i was ill at ease too from being only able to attribute eudoxia adelaidas evident consternation at the sight of conran to his having been some time or other an old love of hers ah thought i grinding my teeth that comes of loving a woman older than ones self the major however seemed the only one who enjoyed himself the marchioness was beaming on him graciously though her ruffled feathers were not quite smoothed down and he was sitting by her with an intense amusement in his eyes alternately talking to her about stars and garters whom by her answers she did not seem to know so very intimately after all and chatting with fitzhervey about hunting who for a man that had hunted over every country according to his own account seemed to confuse tom edge with tom smith the burton with the tedworth a bullfinch with an oxrail in queer style under conrans crossquestioning we had been in the room about ten minutes when a voice rich low sweet rang out from some inner room singing the glorious inflammatus how strange it sounded in the casa di fiori conran started the dark blood rose over the clear bronze of his cheek he turned sharply on to the marchioness good heaven whose voice is that my nieces she answered staring at him and touching a handbell i will ask her to come and sing to us nearer she has really a lovely voice conran grew pale again and sat watching the door with the most extraordinary anxiety some minutes went by then lucrezia entered with the same haughty reserve which her soft young face always wore when with her aunt it changed though when her glance fell on conran into the wildest rapture i ever saw on any countenance he fixed his eyes on her with the look little grand says hes seen him wear in battlea contemptuous smile quivering on his face sing us something lucrezia dear began the marchioness you shouldnt be like the nightingales and give your music only to night and solitude lucrezia seemed not to hear her she had never taken her eyes off conran and she went as dreamily as that dear little amina in the sonnambula to her seat under the jasmines in the window for a few minutes conran who didnt seem to care two straws what the society in general thought of him took his leave to the relief apparently of fitzhervey and guatamara as he went across the verandathat memorable verandai sitting in dudgeon near the other window while fitzhervey was proposing ecarte to heavy whom we had found there on our entrance and the marchioness had vanished into her boudoir for a moment i saw the roman girl spring out after him and catch hold of his arm victor victor for pitys sakei never thought we should meet like this nor did i hush hush you will kill me in mercy say some kinder words i can say nothing that it would be courteous to you to say i couldnt have been as inflexible whatever her sins might have been with her hands clasped on me and her face raised so close to mine lucrezias voice changed to a piteous wail you love me no longer then love said conran fiercelylove how dare you speak to me of love i held you to be fond innocent true as heaven as such you were dearer to me than lifeas dear as honor i loved you with as deep a passion as ever a man knewheaven help me i love you now how am i rewarded by finding you the companion of blackguards the associate of swindlers one of the archintrigantes who lead on youths to ruin with base smiles and devilish arts then you dare talk to me of love with those passionate words he threw her off him she fell at his feet with a low moan he either did not hear or did not heed it and i bewildered by what i heard mechanically went and lifted her from the ground lucrezia had not fainted but she looked so wild that i believed the marchioness and set her down as mad but then conran must be mad as well which seemed too incredible a thing for me to swallowour cool major mad where does he live asked lucrezia of me in a breathless whisper he who victoryour officersignor conran why he lives in valetta of course can i find him there i dare say if you want him want him oh santa maria is not his absence death can i find him oh yes i dare say anybody will show you conrans rooms thank you with that this mysterious young lady left me and i turned in through the window again heavy and the men were playing at lansquenet that most perilous rapid and bewitching of all the resistless card circes there was no marchioness and having done it once with impunity i thought i might do it again and lifted the amber curtain that divided the boudoir from the drawingroom what did i behold oh torture unexampled oh fiendish agony there was little grandselfconceited insulting impertinent abominable unendurable little grandon the amber satin couch with the marchioness leaning her head on his shoulder and looking up in his thriceconfounded face with her most adorable smile my smile that had beamed and as i thought beamed only upon me if mephistopheles had been by to tempt me i would have sold my soul to have wreaked vengeance on them both neither saw me thank heaven and i had selfpossession enough not to give them the cruel triumph of witnessing my anguish i withdrew in silence dropped the curtain and rushed to bury my wrongs and sorrows in the friendly bosom of the gentle night it was my first love and i had made a fool of myself the two are synonymous how i reached the barracks i never knew all the night long i sat watching the stars out raving to them of eudoxia adelaida and cursing in plentiful anathemas my late orestes how should i bear his impudent grin every mortal night of my life across the messtable i tore up into shreds about a ream of paper inscribed with tender sonnets to my faithless idol i trampled into fifty thousand shreds a rosette off her dress for which foollike i had begged the day before i smashed the lookingglass which could only show me the image of a pitiful donkey i called on heaven to redress my wrongs oh curse it never was a fellow at once so utterly done for and so utterly done brown and in the vicarage as i learnt afterwards when my letter was received at home there was great glorification and pleasure my mother and the girls were enraptured at the high society darling gussy was moving in but then you know mamma dear gussys manners are so gentle so gentlemanlike they are sure to please wherever he goes wherewith my mother cried and dried her eyes and cried again over that abominable letter copied from little grands and smelling of vilest tobacco then entered a rectoress of a neighboring parish to whom my mother and the girls related with innocent exultation of my grand friends at malta how lord a fitzhervey was my sworn ally and the marchioness st julian had quite taken me under her wing and the rectoress having a son of her own who was not doing anything so grand at cambridge but principally sotting beer at a cherryhinton public smiled and was wrathful and said to her lord at dinner my dear did you ever hear of a marchioness st julian no my love i believe notnever is there one in the peerage cant say my dear look in burke so the rectoress got burke and closed it after deliberate inspection with malignant satisfaction i thought not how ridiculous those st johns are about that ugly boy augustus as if tom were not worth a hundred of him i was too occupied with my own miseries then to think about conran and lucrezia though some time after i heard all about it it seems that a year before conran was on leave in rome and at rome loitering about the campagna one day he made a chance acquaintance with an italian girl by getting some flowers for her she had tried to reach and could not she was young enthusiastic intensely interesting and had only an old roman nurse deaf as a post and purblind with her the girl was lucrezia da guari and lucrezia was lovely as one of her own myrtle or orange flowers somehow or other conran went there the next day and the next and the next and so on for a good many days and always found lucrezia now conran had at bottom a touch of unstirred romance and moreover his own idea of what sort of woman he could love something in this untrained yet winning campagna flower answered to both he was old to trust his own discernment and after a month or twos walks and talks conran one of the proudest men going offered himself and his name to a roman girl of whom he knew nothing except that she seemed to care for him as he had had a fancy to be cared for all his life it was a deucedly romantic thinghowever he did it lucrezia had told him her father was a military officer but somehow or other this father never came to light and when he called at their houseor rather roomsconran always found him out which he thought queer but on the whole rather providential and he set the accident down to a foreigners roaming habits the day conran had really gone the length of offering to make an unknown italian his wife he went for the first time in the evening to da guaris house the servant showed him in unannounced to a brightlylighted chamber reeking with wine and smoke where a dozen men were playing trente et quarante at an amateur bank and two or three others were gathered round what he had believed his own fair and pure campagna flower he understood it all he turned away with a curse upon him he wanted love and innocence adventuresses he could have by the score and he was sick to death of them from that hour he never saw her again till he met her at the casa di fiori the next day i went to conran while he was breakfasting and unburdened my mind to him he looked ill and haggard but he listened to me very kindly though he spoke of the people at the casa di fiori in a hard brief curious manner plenty have been taken in like you gus he said i was years ago in my youth when i joined the army there are scores of such women as i told you down the line of the pacific and about here anywhere in fact where the army and navy give them fresh pigeons to be gulled they take titles that sound grand in boys ears and fascinate them till theyve won all their money and thensend them to the dogs your marchioness st julians real name is sarah briggs i gave an involuntary shriek sarah briggs finished me it was the deathstroke that could never be got over she was a balletgirl in london continued conran then when she was sixteen married that fitzhervey alias briggs alias smith alias what you please and set up in her present more lucrative employment with her three or four confederates saintjeu was expelled from paris for keeping a hell in the chaussee dantin fitzhervey was a leg at newmarket orangia magnolia a lawyers clerk who was had up for forgery guatamara isby another namea scoundrel of rome there is the history of your maltese peerage gussy well youll be wider awake next time wait there is somebody at my door stay here a moment ill come back to you accordingly i stayed in his bedroom where i had found him writing and he went into his sittingroom of which from the diminutiveness of his domicile i commanded a full view sit where i would what was my astonishment to see lucrezia i went to his bedroom door it was locked from the outside so i perforce remained where i was to nolens volens witness the finish of last nights interview stern to the last extent and deadly pale conran stood too surprised to speak and most probably at a loss for words lucrezia came up to him nevertheless with the abandonment of youth and southern blood victor victor let me speak to you you shall listen you shall not judge me unheard signorina i have judged you by only too ample evidence he had recovered himself now and was as cool as needs be i deny it but you love me still love you more shame on me a laugh a compliment a caress a cashmere is as much as such women as you are worth love becomes ridiculous named in the same breath with you she caught hold of his hand and crushed it in both her own kill me you will death would have no sting from your hand but never speak such words to me his voice trembled how can i choose but speak them you know that i believed you in italy and how on that belief i offered you my namea name never yet stained never yet held unworthy i lost you to find you in society which stamped you for ever a lovely fiend holding raw boys enchained that your associates might rifle their purses with marked cards and cogged dice i hoped to have found a diamond without spot or flaw i discovered my error too late it was only glass which all men were free to pick up and trample on at their pleasure he tried to wrench his hand away but she would not let it go hush hush listen to me first if you once thought me worthy of your love you may surely now accord me pity i shall not trouble you long after this you need see me no more i am going back to my old convent you and the world will soon forget me but i shall remember you and pray for you as dearer than my own soul conrans head was bent down now and his voice was thick as he answered briefly go on this scene half consoled me for eudoxia adelaidai mean o heavens sarah briggsit was so exquisitely romantic and conran and lucrezia wouldnt have done at all badly for monte cristo and that dear little haidee i was fearfully poetic in those days when i met you in rome lucrezia went on in obedience to his injunction two years ago you remember i had only left my convent and lived with my father but a month or two i told you he was an officer i only said what i had been told and i knew no more than you that he was the keeper of a gambling house she shuddered as she paused and leaned her forehead on conrans hand he did not repulse her and she continued in her broken simple english the evening you promised me what i should have needed to have been an angel to be worthy ofyour love and your namethat very evening when i reached home my father bade me dress for a soiree he was going to give i obeyed him of course i knew nothing but what he told me and i went down to find a dozen young nobles and a few englishmen drinking and playing on a table covered with green cloth some few of them came up to me but i felt frightened their looks their tones their florid compliments were so different to yours but my father kept his eye on me and would not let me leave while they were leaning over my chair and whispering in my ear you came to the door of the salon and i went towards you and you looked cold and harsh as i had never seen you before and put me aside and turned away without a word oh victor why did you not kill me then death would have been kindness your othello was kinder to desdemona he slew herhe did not leave her from that hour i never saw you and from that hour my father persecuted me because i would never join in his schemes nor enter his vile gamingrooms yet i have lived with him because i could not get away i have been too carefully watched we italians are not free like your happy english girls a few weeks ago we were compelled to leave rome the young contino di firenze had been stilettoed leaving my fathers rooms and he could stay in italy no longer we came here and joined that hateful woman who calls herself marchioness st julian and because she could not bend me to her will gives out that i am her niece and mad i wonder i am not mad victor i wish hearts would break as the romancers make them but how long one suffers and lives on oh my love my soul my life only say that you believe me and look kindly at me once again then i will never trouble you again i will only pray for you but believe me victor the mother superior of my convent will tell you it is the truth that i speak oh for the love of heaven believe me believe me or i shall die it was not in the nature of man to resist her there was truth in the girls voice and face if ever truth walked abroad on earth and conran did believe her and told her so in a few unconnected words lifting her up in his arms and vowing with most unrighteous oaths that her father should never have power to persecute her again as long as he himself lived to shelter and take care of her i was so interested in my monte cristo and haidee it was so like a chapter out of a book that i entirely forgot my durance vile and my novel and excessively disgraceful though enforced occupation of spy and there i stayed alternating between my interest in them and my agonies at the revelations concerning my eudoxia adelaidaoh hang it i mean sarah briggstill after a most confounded long time conran saw fit to take lucrezia off to get asylum for her with the colonels wife for a day or two that those fools might not misconstrue her by which comprehensive epithet he i suppose politely designated ours then i went my ways to my own room and there i found a scented mauvehued creamy billetdoux in uncommon bad handwriting though from my miserable eudoxia adelaida to the friend and lover of her soul confound the womanhow i swore at that daintilyperfumed and most vilelyscrawled letter to think that where that beautiful signature stretched from one side to the othereudoxia adelaida st julianthere ought to have been that short vile lowbred hideous billingsgate cognomen of sarah briggs in the note she reproached methe wretched hypocritefor my departure the previous night without one farewell to your eudoxia o cruel augustus and asked me to give her a rendezvous at some vineyards lying a little way off the casa di fiori on the road to melita now being a foolish boy and regarding myself as having been loved and wronged whereas i had only been playing the very common role of pigeon i could not resist the temptation of going just to take one last look of that fair cruel face and upbraid her with being the first to sow the fatal seeds of lifelong mistrust and misery in my only too fond and faithful c c c so at the appointed hour just when the sun was setting over the faraway spanish shore and the hush of night was sinking over the little rocky peppery militarythick mediterranean isle i found myself en route to the vineyards which till i came to malta had been one of my delusions idea picturing them in wreaths and avenues reality proving them hopsticks and parched earth i drew near it was quite dark now the sun had gone to sleep under the blue waves and the moon was not yet up though i knew she was sarah briggs and an adventuress who had made game of me two facts that one would fancy might chill the passion out of anybody so mad was i about that woman that if i had met her then and there i should have let her wheedle me over and gone back to the casa di fiori with her and been fleeced again i am sure i should sir and so would you if at eighteen new to life you had fallen in with eudoxpshawwith sarah briggs my marchioness st julian i drew near the vineyards my heart beat thick i could not see but i was certain i heard the rustle of her dress caught the perfume of her hair all her sins vanished how could i upbraid her though she were three times over sarah briggs yes she was coming i felt her near an electric thrill rushed through me as soul met soul i heard a murmured dearest sweetest i felt the warm clasp of two arms buta cold row of undress waistcoatbuttons came against my face and a voice i knew too well cried out as i rebounded from him impelled thereto by a not gentle kick the devil get out who the deuce are you we both stopped for breath at that minute up rose the silver moon and in its telltale rays we glared on one another i and little grand that silence was sublime the pause between beethovens andante allegrothe second before the spanish bull rushes upon the torreador you little miserable wretch burst out grand slowly and terribly you little mean sneaking spying contemptible milksop i should like to know what you mean by bringing out your ugly phiz at this hour when you used to be afraid of stirring out for fear of nurses bogies and to dare to come lurking after me after you mr grandison i repeated with grandiloquence really you put too much importance on your own movements i came by appointment to meet the marchioness st julian whom i presume as you are well acquainted with her you know in her real name of sarah briggs and to sarah briggsyou come by appointment stammered little grand yes sir if you disbelieve my word of honor i will condescend to show you my invitation you little ape swore grand coming back to his previous wrath it is a lie a most abominable unwarrantable lie i came by appointment sir you did no such thing look there and he flaunted before my eyes in the moonlight the facsimile of my letter verbatim copy save that in his cosmo was put in the stead of augustus look there said i giving him mine little grand snatched it read it over once twice thrice then drooped his head with a burning color in his face and was silent the knowing hand was done we were both of us uncommonly quiet for ten minutes neither of us liked to be the first to give in at last little grand looked up and held out his hand no more nonsense about him now simon you and i have been two great fools we cant chaff one another shes a cursed actress andlets make it up old boy we made it up accordinglywhen little grand was not conceited he was a very jolly fellowand then i gave him my whole key to the mysteries intricacies and charms of our casa di fiori we could not chaff one another but poor little grand was pitiably sore then and for long afterwards he the old bird the cool hand the sharp one of ours to have been done brown to be the joke of the mess the laugh of all the men down to the weest drummerboy poor little grand he was too done up to swagger too thoroughly angry with himself to swear at anybody else he only whispered to me why the dickens could she want you and me to meet our selves to give us a finishing hoax i suppose i suggested little grand drew his cap over his eyes and hung his head down in abject humiliation i suppose so what fools we have been simon and i say ive borrowed three hundred of old miraflores and its all gone up at that devilish casa and how i shall get it from the governor heaven knows for i dont im in the same pickle grand i groaned ive given that old rascal notes of hand for two hundred pounds and if it dont drop from the clouds i shall never pay it oh i say grand love comes deucedly expensive ah said he with a sympathetic shiver think what a pair of hunters we might have had for the money with which dismal and remorseful remembrance the old bird who had been trapped like a young pigeon swore mightily and withdrew into humbled and disgusted silence next morning we heard to our comfortwhat lots of people there always are to tell us how to lock our stabledoor when our solitary mare has been stolenthat with a gentle hint from the police the marchioness st julian with her confreres had taken wing to the ionian isles where at corfu or cephalonia they will reerect the casa di fiori and glide gently on again from vingtetun to loo and from loo to lansquenet under eyes as young and blinded as our own they went without lucrezia conran took her into his own hands any other man in the regiment would have been pretty well ridiculed at taking a bride out of the casa di fiori but the statements made by the highborn abbess of her roman convert were so clear and so to the girls honor and he had such a way of holding his own of keeping off liberties from himself and anything belonging to him and was moreover known to be of such fastidious honor that his young wife was received as if she had been a princess in her own right with her respected parent conran had a brief interview previous to his flight from malta in which with a few gentle hints he showed that worthy it would be wiser to leave his daughter unmolested for the future and i doubt if mr orangia magnolia alias pepe guari would know his own child in the joyous graceful daintilydressed mistress of conrans handsome parisian establishment little grand and i suffered cruelly we were the butts of the mess for many a long month afterwards when every idiots tongue asked us on every side after the health of the marchioness st julian when we were going to teach them lansquenet how often we heard from the aristocratic members of the maltese peerage with like delightful pleasantries which the questioners deemed high wit we paid for it too to that arch old screw balthazar but i doubt very much if the money were not well lost and the experience well gained it cured me of my rawness and little grand of his selfconceit the only thing that had before spoilt that goodhearted quicktempered and cleverbrained little fellow oh pater and materfamilias disturb not yourselves so unnecessarily about the crop of wild oats which your young ones are sowing broadcast those wild oats often spring from a good field of high spirit hot courage and thoughtless generosity that are the sign and basis of nobler virtues to come and from them very often rise two goodly plantsexperience and discernment lady marabouts troubles or the worries of a chaperone in three seasons season the firstthe eligible one of the kindestnatured persons that i ever knew on this earth where kind people are as rare as black eagles or red deer is helena countess of marabout nee de boncoeur she has foibles she has weaknesseswho amongst us has notshe will wear her dresses decolletees though shes sixty if burke tells us truth she will rouge and practise a thousand other little toilette tricks but they are surely innocent since they deceive nobody and if you wait for a woman who is no artifices i am afraid you shall have to forswear the sex in toto my friends and come growling back to your diogenes tub in the albany with your lantern still lit every day of your lives lady marabout is a very charming person as for her weaknesses she is all the nicer for them to my taste i like people with weaknesses myself those without them do look so dreadfully scornfully and unsympathizingly upon one from the altitude of their superiority de toute la hauteur de sa betise as a witty frenchman says humanity was born with weaknesses if i were a beggar i might hope for a coin from a man with some a man without any i know would shut up his portemonnaie with an intensified click to make me feel trebly envious and consign me to d and his truncheon on the score of vagrancy lady marabout is a very charming person despite her little foibles and she gives very pleasant little dinners both at her house in lowndes square and in her jointure villa at twickenham where the bad odors of thames are drowned in the fragrance of the geraniums piled in great heaps of red white and variegated blossom in the flowerbeds on the lawn she has been married twice but has only one son by her first unioncarruthers of the guardsa very good fellow whom his mother thinks perfection though if she did know certain scenes in her adored philips life the good lady might hesitate before she endowed her son with all the cardinal virtues as she does at the present moment she has no daughters therefore you will wonder to hear that the prime misery burden discomfort and worry of her life is chaperonage but so it is lady marabout is the essence of good nature she cant say no that unpleasant negative monosyllable was never heard to issue from her full smiling kindlooking lips she is in a high position she has an extensive circle thanks to her own family and those of the baronet and peer she successively espoused and some sister or cousin or friend is incessantly hunting her up to bring out their girls and sell them well off out of hand young ladies being goods extremely likely to hang on hand nowadays of all troubles the troubles of a chaperone are the greatest said lady marabout to me at the wedding dejeuner of one of her protegees in the first place one looks on at others campaigns instead of conducting them ones self secondly it brings back ones own bright days to see the young things smiles and blushes like that girls just now i do hope shell be happy and thirdly one has all the responsibility and gets all the blame if anything goes wrong ill never chaperone anybody again now i have got rid of leila so does lady marabout say twenty times yet has she invariably some young lady under her wing whose relatives are defunct or invalided or in india or out of society somehow and we all of us call her house the yard and her among ourselves not lady marabout but lady tattersall the worries she has in her chaperones office would fill a folio specially as her heart inclines to the encouragement of romance but her reason to the banishment thereof and while her tenderness suffers if she thwarts her protegees leanings her conscience gives her neuralgic twinges if she abets them to unwise matches while under her dragonnage whats the matter mother asked carruthers one morning hes very fond of his mother and will never let any one laugh at her in his hearing matter everything replied lady marabout concisely and comprehensively as she sat on the sofa in her boudoir with her white ringed hands and her bien conserve look and her kindly pleasant eyes and her rich dress one could see what a pretty woman she has been and that carruthers may thank her for his good looks to begin with felicie has been so stupid as to marry married the greengrocer whom she will ruin in a week and has left me to the mercies of a stupid woman who puts pink with cerise mauve with magenta and skyblue with azureline and has no recommendation except that she is as ugly as the medusa and so will not tempt you to make love to her as i did to marie laughed carruthers marie was a pretty little dear it was very severe in you to send her away lady marabout tried hard to look severe and condemnatory but failed signally nature had formed the smooth brow and the kindly eyes in far too soft a mould dont jest about it philip you know it was a great pain annoyance and scandal to me well felicie is gone and oakes was seen pawning some of my mechlin the other day so i have been obliged to discharge her and they both of them suited me so well then bijou is ill poor little pet with repletion of chicken panada no bijou isnt such a gourmet you judge him by yourself i suppose men always do then lady hautton told me last night that you were the wildest man on town and at forty you think i ought to ranger so i will my dear mother some day but at present i amso very comfortable it would be a pity to alter what pains ones friends are always at to tell unpalatable things if they would but be only half so eager to tell us the pleasant ones i shall expect you to cut lady hautton if she speak badly of me i cant afford to lose your worship mother my worship how conceited you are philip as for lady hautton i believe she does dislike you because you did not engage yourself to adelina and were selected aidedecamp to her majesty instead of hautton still i am afraid she spoke too nearly the truth perhaps marie has entered her service and told tales but lady marabout wouldnt laugh she always looks very grave about marie my worst trouble she began hastily is that your aunt honiton is too ill to come to town no chance of her being well enough to come at all this season and of course the charge of valencia has devolved on me you know how i hate chaperoning and i did so hope i should be free this year besides valencia is a great responsibility very great a girl of so much beauty always is there will be sure to be so many men about her at once and your aunt will expect me to marry her so very well it is excessively annoying my poor dear mother cried carruthers i grant you are an object of pity you are everlastingly having young fillies sent you to break in and they want such a tight hand on the ribbons and a tight hand as you call it i never had and never shall have sighed lady marabout valencia will be no trouble to me on that score however she has been admirably educated knows all that is due to her position and will never give me a moments anxiety by any imprudence or inadvertence but she is excessively handsome and a beauty is a great responsibility when she first comes out val was always a handsome child if i remember i dare say she is a beauty now when is she coming up because ill tell the men to mark the house and keep clear of it laughed carruthers youre a dreadfully dangerous person mother you have always the bestlooking girl in town with you fulke nugent says if he should ever want such a thing as a wife when he comes into the title he shall take a look at the marabout yearlings sale abominably rude of you and your friends to talk me over in your turf slang i wish you would come and bid at the sale philip i should like to see you marriedwell married of course my beloved mother cried carruthers leave me in peace if you please and catch the others if you can theres goodey now every chaperone and debutante in london has set traps for him for the last i dont know how many years wouldnt he do for valencia goodwood of course he would he would do for any one the dukedoms the oldest in the peerage goodwood is highly eligible thank you for reminding me philip since valencia is coming i must do my best for her which phrase meant with lady marabout that she must be very lynxeyed as to settlements and a perfect dragon to all detrimental connections must frown with medusa severity on all horrors of younger sons and advocate with all the weight of personal experience the advantage and agremens of a good position in all of which practicalities she generally broke down with humiliation unspeakable immediately her heart was enlisted and her sympathies appealed to on the enemys side she sighed played with her bracelets thoughtfully and then heroically resigning herself to her impending fate brightened up a little and asked her son to go and choose a new pair of carriagehorses for her to look at lady marabout as she sat in her amber satin couch that morning pleasant smiling welldressed welllooking with the grace of good birth and the sunniness of good nature plainly written on her smooth brow and her kindly eyes and wealthdelicious little godstamping itself all about her from the diamond rings on her soft white fingers to the broidered shoe on the feet of whose smallness she was still proud one might have ignorantly imagined her to be the most happy enviable wellconditioned easygoing dowager in the united kingdom but appearances are deceptive and if we believe what she constantly asserted lady marabout was very nearly worn into her grave by a thousand troubles her almshouses whose roofs would eternally blow off with each high wind her dogs whom she would overfeed her ladies maids who were only hired to steal tease or scandalize her the begging letterwriters who distilled tears from her eyes and sovereigns from her purse let carruthers disclose their hypocrisies as he might the bolder beggingletters written by hon secs and headed by names with long handles belonging to pillars of the state and lights of the church which compelled her to make a miserable choice between a straitened income or a remorseful consciencetormented in fine with worries small and large from her ferns on which she spent a large fortune and who drooped maliciously in their glass cases with an illnatured obstinacy characteristic of desperatelycourted individuals whether of the floral or the human world to those marriageable young ladies whom she took under her wing to usher into the great world and who were certain to run counter to her wishes and overthrow her plans to marry ill or not marry at all or do something or other to throw discredit on her chaperoning abilities she was she assured us petrie with worries small and large specially as she was so eminently sunny affable and radiant a looking person that all the world took their troubles to her selected her as their confidante and made her the repository of their annoyances but her climax of misery was to be compelled to chaperone and as a petition for some debutante to be intrusted to her care was invariably made each season and no was a monosyllable into which her lips utterly refused to form themselves each season did her life become a burden to her there was never any rest for the soul of helena countess of marabout till her house in lowndes square was shut up and her charges off her hand and she could return in peace to her jointurevilla at twickenham or to carruthers old hall of deepdene and among her flowers her birds and her hobbies throw off for a while the weary burden of her worries as a chaperone valencia will give me little trouble i hope so admirably broughtup a girl and so handsome as she is will be sure to marry soon and marry well thought lady marabout selfcongratulatorily as she dressed for dinner the day of her nieces arrival in town running over mentally the qualifications and attractions of valencia valletort while felicies successor mademoiselle despreaux whose crime was then to put pink with cerise mauve with magenta and skyblue with azureline gave the finishing touches to her toilettevalencia will give me no trouble she has all the de boncoeur beauty with the valletort dignity who would do for her let me see eligible men are not abundant and those that are eligible are shy of being marked as philip would sayperhaps from being hunted so much poor things there is fulke nugent heir to a barony and his father is ninetyvery rich toohe would do and philips friend caradoc poor i know but their earldoms the oldest peerage patent there is eyre lee too i dont much like the man supercilious and emptyheaded still hes an unobjectionable alliance and there is goodwood every one has tried for goodwood and failed i should like valencia to win him he is decidedly the most eligible man in town i will invite him to dinner if he is not attracted by valencias beauty nothing can attract himdespreaux comme vous etes bete otez ces panaches de grace valencia will give me no trouble she will marry at once thought lady marabout again looking across the dinnertable at her niece if any young patrician might be likely to marry at once it was the hon valencia valletort she was to the most critical a beauty her figure was perfect her features were perfect and if you complained that her large glorious eyes were a trifle too changeless in expression that her cheek exquisitely independent of marechale powder blanc de perle and liquid rouge though it was rarely varied with her thoughts and feelings why you were very exacting my good fellow and should remember that nothing is quite perfect on the face of the earthnot even a racer or a womanand that whether you bid at the marabout yearling sales or the rawcliffe if you wish to be pleased youd better leave a hypercritical spirit behind you and not expect to get all points to your liking the best filly will have something faulty in temper or breeding symmetry or pace for your friend jack martingale to have the fun of pointing out to you when your money is paid and the filly in your stall and your wife will have the same only martingale will point her flaws out behind your back and only hint them to you with an allexpressive not allowed to smoke in the diningroom now a little bit of a flirt madamenestce pas charlie reins kept rather tight eh old fellow or something equally ambiguous significant and unpleasant i must consider philip i have brought out the beauty of the season said lady marabout to carruthers eying her niece as she danced at her first ball at the dowagerduchess of amandines and beginning to brighten up a little under the weight of her responsibilities i think you have mother vals indisputably handsome you must tell her to make play with goodwood or nugent lady marabout unfurled her fan and indignantly interrupted him my dear philip do you suppose i would teach valencia or any girl under my charge to lay herself out for any man whoever or whatever it might be i trust your cousin would not stoop to use such manoeuvres did i even stoop to counsel them depend upon it philip it is precisely those women who try to make play as you call it with your sex that fail most to charm them it is abominable the way in which you men talk as if we all hunted you down and would drive you to st georges nolens volens so you would mother laughed carruthers we eligible men have a harder life of it than rabbits in a warren with a dozen beagles after them from the minute were of age were beset with traps for the unwary and the springguns are so dexterously covered with an inviting innocentlooking turf of courtesies and hospitalities that its next to a mural impossibility to escape them let one retire into ones self keep to monosyllables through all the courses of all the dinners and all the turns of all the valses and avoid everything compromising as one may ive suffered and can tell you i suffer still though i believe and hope they are beginning to look on me as an incurable given over to the clubs the coulisses and the coverside theres a fellow thats known still more of the peines fortes et dures than i goodwoods coming to ask for an introduction to val i would bet he was coming for that purpose and though lady marabout had so scornfully and sincerely repudiated her sons counsel relative to making play with goodwood blandly ignorant of her own weaknesses like a good many other people lady marabout was not above a glow of chaperone gratification when she saw the glance of admiration which the pet eligible of the season bestowed on valencia valletort goodwood was a goodlooking fellowa clever fellowthough possibly he shone best alone at a mess luncheon in a chat driving to hornsey wood round the fire in a smokingroom on a yacht deck or anywhere where ladies of the titled world were not encountered he having become afraid of them by dint of much persecution as any october partridge of a setters nose he was passably goodlooking ordinarily clever a very good fellow as i say andhe was elder son of his grace of doncaster which fact would have made him the desired of every unit of the beau sexe had he been hideous as the veiled prophet or brutal gilles de rayes the beauty often loves the beast in our day as in the days of fairy lore we see that beloved story of our petticoat days not seldom acted out and when there is no possibility of personal transmogrification and amelioration for the beast moreover onlythe beauty has always had whispered in her little ear the title she will win and the revenues she will gain and the cloth of gold she will wear if she caresses bruin the enamoured swears his ugly head is godlike and vows fidelity unswerving goodwood was no uncouth bruin and he had strawberryleaves in his gift none of your lacquered or ormolu or silvergilt coronets such as are cast about nowadays with a liberality that reminds one of flinging a handful of halfpence from a balcony where the nimblest beggar is first to get the prize but of the purest and best gold and goodwood had been tried for accordingly by every woman he came across for the last dozen years women of every style and every order had primed all their rifles and had their shot at him and done their best to make a centre and score themselves as winner belles and bas bleus bewitching widows and budding debutantes fast young ladies who tried to capture him in the huntingfield by clearing a bullfinch saintly young ladies who illuminated missals and hinted they would like to take his conversion in hand brilliant women who talked at him all through a long rainy day when perthshire was flooded and the blackfowl unattainable showy women who posed for him whole evenings in their operaboxes whole mornings in their boudoirall styles and orders had set at him till he had sometimes sworn in his haste that all women were mantraps and that he wished to heaven he were a younger son in the foreign office or a poor devil in the line or anything rather than what he was the pet eligible of his day goodwood is certainly struck with her thought lady marabout as despreaux disrobed her that night running over with a retrogressive glance valencia valletorts successes at her first ball very much struck indeed i should say i will issue cards for another at home as for making play with him as philip terms it of course that is only a mans nonsense valencia will need none of those trickeries i trust still it is any ones duty to make the best alliance possible for such a girl anddear adeliza would be very pleased with which amiable remembrance of her sister whom conceiving it her duty to love lady marabout persuaded herself that she did love from a common feminine opticism that theres an eleventh commandment which makes it compulsory to be attached to relatives nimporte of whatever degree of disagreeability though lady honiton was about the most odious hypochondriac going in a perpetual state of unremitting battle with the whole outer world in general and allopathists homoeopathists and hydropathists in especial the most amiable lady in all christendom bade despreaux bring up her cup of coffee an hour earlier in the morning she had so much to do asked if bijou had had some panada set down by his basket in case he wanted something to take in the night wished her maid good night and laid her head on her pillow as the dawn streamed through the shutters already settling what bridal presents she should give her niece valencia when she became present marchioness of goodwood and prospective duchess of doncaster before the altar rails of st georges thats a decidedly handsome girl that cousin of yours phil said goodwood on the pavement before her grace of amandines in grosvenor place at the same hour that night i think she is counted like me said carruthers of course shes handsome hasnt she de boncoeur blood in her my good fellow were all of us goodlooking always have been thank god if youre inclined to sacrifice goodwood nows your time and my motherll be delighted shes brought out about half a million of debutantes i should say in her time and all of em have gone wrong somehow wouldnt go off at all like damp gunpowder or would go off too quick in the wrong direction like a volunteers rifle charge married ignominiously or married obstinately or never excited pity in the breast of any man but had to retire to singleblessedness in the country console themselves with piety and an harmonium and spread nets for young clerical victims give her a triumph at last and let her have glory for once as a chaperone in catching you goodwood gave a little shiver and tried to light a manilla which utterly refused to take light for the twelfth time in half a minute hold your tongue if the templars order were extant wouldnt i take the vows and bless them what an unspeakable comfort and protection that white cross would be to us phil if we could stick it on our coats and know it would say to every woman that looked at us no go my pretty little dearsnot to be caught marriage i cant remember any time that that word wasnt my bugbear when i was but a little chicken some four years old i distinctly remember when i was playing with little ida keane on the terrace hearing her mother simper to mine perhaps darling goodwood may marry my little ida some day who knows i never would play with ida afterwards instinct preserved me shes six or sevenand thirty now and weighs ten stone im positive why wont they let us alone the way journalists and dowagers the fellows who want to write a taking article and the women who want to get rid of a taking daughter all badger us in public and private about marriage just now is abominable on my life the affairs ours i should say not theirs and to marry isnt the ultimatum of a mans existence nor anything like it i hope not its more like the extinguisher good night old fellow and carruthers drove away in his hansom while goodwood got into his nightbrougham thinking that for the sake of the title the evil nuptial day must come sooner or later but dashed off to forget the disagreeable obligation over the suppertable of the most sparkling empress of the demimonde lady marabout had her wish she brought out the belle of the season and when a little time had slipped by when the hon val had been presented at the first drawingroom and shone there despite the worry muddle and squeeze incidental to that royal and fashionable ceremony and she had gathered secondhand from her son what was said in the clubs relative to this new specimen of the valletort beauty she began to be happier under her duties than she had ever been before and wrote letters to dearest adeliza brimful of superlative adjectives and genuine warmth valencia will do me credit i shall see her engaged before the end of june she will have only to choose lady marabout would say to herself some twenty times in the pauses of the morning concerts the morning parties the bazaar committees the toilette consultations the audiences to religious beggars whose name was legion and rapacity unmeasured the mass of unanswered correspondence whose debt lay as heavily on lady marabout as his chains on a convict and were about as little likely to be knocked off and all the other things innumerable that made her life in the season one teetotum whirl of small worries and sunshiny cares from the moment she began her day with her earliest cup of mocha softened with cream from that pet dairy of hers at fernditton where according to lady marabout the cows were constantly in articulo mortis but the milk invariably richer than anywhere else an agricultural anomaly which presented no difficulties to her reason like all women she loved paradoxes defied logic recklessly and would clear at a bound a chasm of solecisms that would have kept plato in difficulties about crossing it and in doubt about the strength of his jumpingpole all his life long she will do me great credit the semiconsoled chaperone would say to herself with selfcongratulatory relief and if lady marabout thought now and then i wish she were a triflea trifle moredemonstrative she instantly checked such an ungrateful and hypercritical wish and remembered that a heart is a highly treacherous and unadvisable possession for any young lady and a most happy omission in her anatomy though lady marabout had she would confess to herself on occasions with great selfreproach an unworthy and lingering weakness for that contraband article for which she scorned and scolded herself with the very worst success lady marabout had a heart herself to it she had had to date the greatest worries troubles imprudences and vexations of her life she had had to thank it for nothing and to dislike it for much it had made her grieve most absurdly for other peoples griefs it had given her a hundred unphilosophical pangs at philosophic ingratitude from people who wanted her no longer it had teased worried and plagued her all her life long had often interfered in the most meddling and inconvenient manner between her and her reason her comfort and her prudence and yet she had a weakness for the same detrimental organ in other peoplea weakness of which she could no more have cured herself than of her belief in the detectiondefying powers of liquid rouge the potentiality of a liliputian nightbolt against an army of burglars the miraculous properties of sal volatile the efficacy of sermons and suchlike articles of faith common to feminine orthodoxy a weakness of which she never felt more ignominiously convicted and more secretly ashamed than in the presence of miss valletort that young lady having a lofty and magnificent disdain for all such follies quite unattainable to ordinary mortals which oppressed lady marabout with a humiliating sense of inferiority to her niece of eighteen summers so admirably educated so admirably brought up she would say to herself over and over again and if heretic suggestions that the stiffest trained flowers are not always the best that the upright and spotless arumlily isnt so fragrant as the careless brilliant tangled clematis that roseboughs tossing free in sunshine and liberty beat hollow the most carefullypruned standard that ever won a medal at regents park with suchlike allegories arising from contemplation of her conservatory or her balcony flowers would present themselves lady marabout repressed them dutifully and gratefully thought how many pounds weight lighter became the weary burden of a chaperones responsibilities when the onerous charge had been educated on the best system goodwoods attentions are serious philip say what you like said the countess to her son as determinedly as a theologian states his pet points with wool in his ears that he may not hear any sataninspired rational and mathematical disproval of them with which you may rashly seek to soil his tympana and smash his argumentsgoodwoods attentions are serious philip say what you like said her ladyship at a morning party at kew eating her neapolitan ice complacently glancing at the most eligible alliance of the season who was throwing the balls at lawnbilliards and talking between whiles to the hon val with praiseworthy and promising animation serious indeed mother if they tend matrimonywards smiled carruthers its a very serious time indeed for unwary sparrows when they lend an ear to the callbird and think about hopping on to the limetwigs i should think its from a sense of compunction for the net youve led us into that you all particularize our attentions whenever they point near st georges by that very suggestive little adjective serious yes i am half afraid poor goodey is a little touched he threw over our derby sweepstakes up at hornsey wood yesterday to go and stifle himself in williss rooms at your bazaar and buy a guinea cup of souchong from valencia and considering hes one of the best shots in england i dont think you could have a more conclusive if you could have a more poetic proof of devoted renunciation id fifty times rather get a spear in my side a la ivanhoe for a woman than give up a pigeonmatch a cupday or a fieldnight youll never do either laughed lady marabout who made it one of her chief troubles that her son would not marry chiefly probably because if he had married she would have been miserable and thought no woman good enough for him would have been jealous of his wifes share of his heart and supremely wretched i have no doubt at his throwing himself away as she would have thought it had his handkerchief lighted on a princess born lovely as galatea and blessed with venuss cestus never plaise a dieu responded her son piously over his ice but if goodwoods serious whats cardonnel hes lost his head if you like after the valletort beauty major cardonnel said lady marabout hastily oh no i dont think so i hope noti trust not why so hes one of the finest fellows in the service i dare say but you see my dear philip hes notnotdesirable carruthers stroked his moustaches and laughed fie fie mother if all other belgraviennes are mammonworshippers i thought you kept clear of the paganism i thought your freedom from it was the only touch by which you werent purely feminine as the lady novelists say of their pet bits of chill propriety worship mammon heaven forbid ejaculated lady marabout but there are duties you see my dear your friend is a very delightful man to be sure i like him excessively and if valencia felt any great preference for him youd feel it your duty to counsel her to throw him over for goodwood i never said so philip interrupted lady marabout with as near an approach to asperity as she could achieve which approach was less like vinegar than most peoples best honey but you implied it what are duties else and why is poor cardonnel not desirable lady marabout played a little tattoo with her spoon in perplexity my dear philip you know as well as i do what i mean one might think you were a boy of twenty to hear you my dear mother like all disputants when beaten in argument and driven into a corner you resort to vituperation of your opponent laughed carruthers as he left her and lounged away to pick up the stick with which pretty flora elmers had just knocked the pipe out of aunt sallys head on to the velvet lawn of lady george frangipanes dowerhouse leaving his mother by no means tranquillized by his suggestions dear me thought lady marabout uneasily as she conversed with the dowagercountess of patchouli on the respective beauties of two new pelargonium seedlings the leucadia and the beatrice for which her gardener had won prizes the day before at the regents park showdear me why is there invariably this sort of crosspurposes in everything it will be so grievous to lose goodwood and he is decidedly struck with her when he bought that rosebud yesterday of her at the bazaar and put it in the breast of his waistcoat i heard what he said and it was no nonsense no mere flirting complaisance eitherit would be so grievous to lose him and yet if valencia really care for cardonneland sometimes i almost fancy she doesi shouldnt know which way to advise i thought it would be odd if a season could pass quietly without my having some worry of this sort with fifty men always about valencia as they are how can i be responsible for any mischief that may happen though to hear philip talk one would really imagine it was my fault that they lost their heads as he calls it as if a fortyhorse steampower could stop a man when hes once off down the incline into love the more you try to pull him back the more impetus you give him to go headlong down i wish goodwood would propose and we could settle the affair definitively it is singular but she has had no offers hardly with all her beauty it is very singular in my first season i had almost as many as i had names on my tablets at almacks but men dont marry now they say perhaps tisnt to be wondered at though i wouldnt allow it to philip poor things they lose a very great many pleasant things by it and get nothing im sure nine times out of ten except increased expenses and unwelcome worries i dont think i would have married if id been a man though id never admit it of course to one of them there are plenty of women who know too much of their own sex ever to wonder that a man doesnt marry though of course we dont say so twouldnt be to our interest sculptors might as well preach iconoclasm or winemerchants teetotalism as women misoganism however little in our hearts we may marvel at it oh my dear lady patchouli you praise the leucadia too kindlyyou do indeedbut if you really think so much of it let me send you some slips i shall be most happy and fenton will be only too proud it is his favorite seedling carruthers was quite right one fellow at least had lost his head after the beauty of the season and he was cardonnel of thelancers as fine a fellow as philip said as any in the queens but a dreadful detrimental in the eyes of all chaperones because he was but the fourth son of one of the poorest peers in the united kingdom a fact which gave him an aegis from all assaults matrimonial and a freedom from all smiles and wiles traps and gins which goodwood was accustomed to tell him he bitterly envied him and on which cardonnel had fervently congratulated himself till he came under the fire of the hon vals large luminous eyes one night when he was levelling his glass from his stall at lady marabouts box to take a look at the new belle as advised to do by that most fastidious female critic vane steinberg valencia valletorts luminous eyes had gleamed that night under their lashes and pierced through the lenses of his lorgnon he saw her and saw nothing but her afterwards as men looking on the sun keep it on their retina to the damage and exclusion of all other objects physical beauty even when it is a little bit soulless is an admirable weapon for instantaneous slaughter and the trained and pruned standard roses show a very effective mass of bloom though as lady marabouts floral tastes and experiences told her they dont give one the lasting pleasure that a careless bough of wild rose will do with its untutored grace and its natural fragrance with the standard you see we keep in the artificial air of the horticultural tent and are never touched out of it for a second its perfume seems akin to a bouquet and its destiny is we are sure to a parterre the wildrose fragrance breathes of the hillside and the woodlands and brings back to us soft touches of memory of youth of a fairer life and a purer air than that in which we are living now the hon val did not have as many offers as her aunt and chaperone had on the first flush of her pride in her anticipated young ladies educated on the best systems are apt to be a trifle wearisome and dont somehow or other take so well as the sedulous efforts of their pruners and trainersthe rarefied moral atmosphere of the conservatories in which they are carefully screened from ordinary air and the anxiety evinced lest the flower should ever forget itself and sway naturally in the winddeserve but cardonnel had gone mad after her that perfect face of hers had done for him and whatever goodwood might be he was serioushe positively haunted the young beauty like her own shadowhe was leaning on the rails every morning of his life that she took her early ridehe sent her bouquets as lavishly as if hed been a nursery gardener by some species of private surveillance or lovers clairvoyance he knew beforehand where she would go and was at the concert fete morning party bazaar or whatever it happened to be as surely as was lady marabout herself poor cardonnel was serious and fiercely fearful of his allpowerful and entirely eligible rival though greater friends than he and goodwood had been before this girls face appeared on the world of belgravia never lounged arminarm into pratts or strolled down the sweet shady side of pallmall goodwoods attentions were very marked too even to eyes less willing to construe them so than lady marabouts goodwood himself if chaffed on the subject vouchsafed nothing laughed stroked his moustaches or puffed his cigar if he happened to have that blessed resource in all difficulties and comforter under all embarrassments between his lips at the moment but decidedly he sought valencia valletort more or to speak more correctly he shunned her less than hed ever done any other young lady and one or two sunday morningsmirabile dictuhe was positively seen at st pauls knightsbridge in the seat behind lady marabouts sittings a fact which combining as it did a brace of miracles at once of early rising and unusual piety set every belgravienne in that fashionable sanctuary watching over the top of her illuminated prayerbook to the utter destruction of her hopes and interruption of her orisons dowagers began to tremble behind their fans young ladies to quake over their bouquets the topic was eagerly discussed by every woman from clarges street to lowndes square their graces of doncaster smiled well pleased on valenciashe was unquestionable blood and they so wished dear goodwood to settle there was whispered an awful whisper to the whole female world whispered over matutinal chocolate and luncheon strasbourg pates ballsupper moets and demimondesupper silleri over vane steinbergs cigar and eulalie rosieres cigarette over the morning post in the clubs and le follet in the boudoir thatthe pet eligible wouldmarry that the pet prophecy of universal smash was going to be fulfilled could hardly have occasioned greater consternation the soul of lady marabout had been disquieted ever since her sons suggestions at lady george frangipanes morning party and she began to worry for herself for valencia for goodwood for cardonnel for her responsibilities in general and for her dearest adelizas alternate opinions of her duenna qualifications in particular lady marabout had an intense wish an innocent wish enough as innocent and very similar in its way to that of an eton boy to make a centre at a riflecontest viz to win the marquis of goodwood innocent surely for though neither the rifle prize nor the pet eligible could be won without mortification unspeakable to a host of unsuccessful aspirants if we decree that sort of thing sinful and selfish as everything natural seems to me to get decreed nowadays we may as well shut up at once if we may not try for the top of the pole why erect poles at all monsieur if we must not do our best to pass our friend and brother we must give up climbing forever and go on all fours placably with don and pontos everybody has his ambition one sighs for the woolsack another for the hunt cup somebody longs to be first minister somebody else pines to be first dancer one man plumes himself on a new fishsauce another on a fresh reform bill a thirsts to get a single brief b for the time when he shall be worried with no briefs at all c sets his hopes on being the acrobat at cremorne d on being the acrobat of the tuileries fat bacon is hodge the hedgers summum bonum and johannisberg pur is mine empedocles thinks notoriety everything and diogenes thinks quiet everythingeach has his own reading of ambition and lady marabout had hers the duchess of doncaster thirsted for the garter for her husband lady elmerss pride was to possess the smallest terrier that ever took daisy tea and was carried in a monkeymuff her grace of amandine slaved night and day to bring her party in and throw the ministry out lady marabout sighed but for one thingto win the pet eligible of the season and give eclat for once to one phase of her chaperones existence things were nicely in train goodwood was beginning to bite at that very handsome fly the hon val and promised to be hooked and landed without much difficulty before long and placed hopelessly for him triumphantly for her in the limebasket of matrimony things were beautifully in train and lady marabout was for once flattering herself she should float pleasantly through an unruffled and successful season when carruthers poured the one drop of amari aliquid into her champagnecup by his suggestion of cardonnels doom and then lady marabout begun to worry she who could not endure to see a fly hurt or a flower pulled needlessly had nothing for it but to worry for cardonnels destiny and puzzle over the divided duties which carruthers had hinted to her to reject the one man because he was not well off did seem to her conscience uncomfortably awakened by phils innuendoes something more mercenary than she quite liked to look at yet to throw over the other future duke of doncaster the eligible the darling the yearnedfor of all may fair and belgravia seemed nothing short of madness to inculcate to valencia a positive treason to that poor absent trusting dearest adeliza who after the visions epistolarily spread out before her would utterly refuse to be comforted if goodwood any way failed to become her soninlaw and moreover the heaviest blow to lady marabout herself that the merciless axe of that brutal headsman contretemps could deal her i do not know really what to do or what to advise would lady marabout say to herself over and over again so disturbed by her onerous burden of responsibilities that she would let despreaux arrange the most outrageous coiffures and never noticing them go out to dinner with emeralds on blue velvet or something as shocking to feminine nerves in her temporary aberration forgetting one very great point which remembered would have saved her all trouble that nobody asked her to do anything and not a soul requested her advice but goodwood is decidedly won and goodwood must not be lost in our position we owe something to society she would invariably conclude these mental debates which last phase being of a vagueness and obscure application that might have matched it with any queens speech or electional address upon record was a mysterious balm to lady marabouts soul and spoke volumes to her if a trifle hazy to you and to me but lady marabout if she was a little bit of a sophist had not worn her eyeglass all these years without being keensighted on some subjects and though perfectly satisfied with her nieces conduct with goodwood saw certain symptoms which made her tremble lest the detrimental lancer should have won greater odds than the eligible marquis arthur cardonnel is excessively handsome such very good style isnt it a pity theyre all so poor his father played away everythingliterally everything the sons have no more to marry upon any one of them than if they were three crossingsweepers said her ladyship carelessly driving home from st pauls one sunday morning and watching the effect of her stray arrow she had beheld an actual flush on the beautys fair impassive cheek and had positively heard a smothered sigh from an admirably broughtup heart no more given ordinarily to such weaknesses than the diamondstudded heart pendent from her bracelet the belles heart and the bracelets heart being both formed alike to fetch their price and bid to do no morepower of volition would have been as inconvenient in and interfered as greatly with the sale of one as of the other she does like him sighed lady marabout over that sabbaths luncheon wines its always my fatealways and goodwood never won before will be thrownactually thrownaway as if he were the younger son of a nobody which horrible waste was so terrible to her imagination that lady marabout could positively have shed tears at the bare prospect and might have shed them too if the hon val the butler two footmen and a page had not inconveniently happened to be in the room at the time so that she was driven to restrain her feelings and drink some amontillado instead lady marabout is not the first person by a good many who has had to smile over sherry with a breaking heart ah lips have quivered as they laughed over chambertin and trembled as they touched the bowl of a champagneglass wine has assisted at many a joyous festa enough but some that has been drunk in gayety has caught gleams in the eyes of the drinkers of salt water brighter than its brightest sparkles water that no other eyes can see because we may drink badminton laughingly when the gaze of society the nonsympathetic is on us do you think we must never have tasted any more bitter dregs vaten becasse where have you lived nero does not always fiddle while rome is burning from utter heartlessness believe me but rathersometimes perhapsbecause his heart is aching goodwood will propose tonight i fancy he is so very attentive thought lady marabout sitting with her sister chaperones on the cosy causeuses of a mansion in carlton terrace at one of the last balls of the departing season i never saw dear valencia look better and certainly her waltzing isah good evening major cardonnel very warm tonight is it not i shall be so glad when i am down again at fernditton town in the first week of july is really not habitable and she furled her fan and smiled on him with her pleasant eyes and couldnt help wishing he hadnt been on the marchioness rondeletias visiting list he was such a detrimental and he was ten times handsomer than goodwood will miss valletort leave you soon asked cardonnel sitting down by her ah monsieur vous etes la thought lady marabout as she answered like a guarded diplomatist as she was that it was not all settled at present what her nieces postseason destiny would be whether devon or fernditton or the spas with her mother lady honiton and then unfurled her fan again and chatted about baden and her own indecision as to whether she should go there this september may i ask you a question and will you pardon me for its plainness asked cardonnel when shed exhausted badens desirable and nondesirable points lady marabout shuddered as she bent her head and thought the creature is never going to confide in me he will win me over if he do he looks so like his mother and what shall i say to adeliza is your niece engaged to goodwood or not if ever a little fib was tempting to any lady from eve downward it was tempting to lady marabout now a falsehood would settle everything send cardonnel off the field and clear all possibility of losing the best match of the season besides if not engaged to goodwood actually tonight val would be if she liked tomorrow or the next day or before the week was over at the furthestwould it be such a falsehood after all she colored she fidgeted her fan she longed for the little fibhow terribly tempting it looked but lady marabout is a bad hand at prevarication and she hates a lie and she answered bravely with a regretful twinge engaged no not not yet thank god lady marabout stared at him and at the words muttered under his moustaches really major cardonnel i do not see why you should thank heaven for it yet i doit is a reprieve lady marabout you and my mother were close friends will you listen to me for a second while we are not overheard that i have loved your niecehad the madness to love her if you willyou cannot but have seen that she has given me some reasonable encouragement it is no coxcombry to say though i have known from the first what a powerful rival i had against me but that valencia loves me and does not love him i believenay i know i have said nothing decided to her when all hangs on a single die we shrink from hazarding the throw but i must know my fate tonight if she come to youas girls will i believe sometimesfor countenance and counsel will you stand my friendwill you for the sake of my friendship with your son your friendship with my mother support my cause and uphold what i believe valencias heart will say in my favor lady marabout was silent no andalusian ever worried her fan more ceaselessly in coquetry than she did in perplexity her heart was appealed to and when that was enlisted lady marabout was lost butbutmy dear major cardonnel you are aware she began and stopped i should suppose it may be a little awkward to tell a man to his face he is not desirable i am aware that i cannot match with goodwood i am but i know also that goodwoods love cannot match with mine and that your nieces affection is not his that he may win her i know women too well not to fear therefore i ask you to be my friend if she refuse me will you plead for meif she ask for counsel will you give such as your own heart dictates i ask no otherand will you remember that on valencias answer will rest the fate of a mans lifetime he rose and left her but the sound of his voice rang in lady marabouts ears and the tears welled into her eyes dear dear how like he looked to his poor dear mother but what a position to place me in am i never to have any peace not at this ball at any rate of all the worried chaperones and distracted duennas who hid their anxieties under pleasant smiles or affable lethargy none were a quarter so miserable as helena lady marabout her heart and her head were enlisted on opposite sides her wishes pulled one way her sympathies another her sense of justice to cardonnel urged her to one side her sense of duty to dearest adeliza urged her to the other her pride longed for one alliance her heart yearned for the other cardonnel had confided in her and appealed to her sequitur lady marabouts honor would not allow her to go against him yet it was nothing short of grossest treachery to poor adeliza down there in devon expecting every day to congratulate her daughter on a prospective duchy won to counsel valencia to take one of these beggared cardonnels and besidesto lose all her own laurels to lose the capture of goodwood no guelphs and ghibelins no royalists and imperialists ever fought so hard as lady marabouts divided duties valencia major cardonnel spoke to me tonight began that besthearted and most badgered of ladies as she sat before her dressingroom fire that night alone with her niece valencia smiled slightly and a faint idea crossed lady marabouts mind that valencias smile was hardly a pleasant one a trifle too much like the play of moonbeams on ice he spoke to me about you indeed perhaps you can guess my dear what he said i am no clairvoyante aunt and miss val yawned a little and held out one of her long slender feet to admire it every woman my love becomes half a clairvoyante when she is in love said lady marabout a little bit impatiently she hadnt been brought up on the best systems herself and though she admired the refrigeration on principle it irritated her just a little now and then did hedid he say anything to you tonight oh yes and what did you answer him my love what would you advise me lady marabout sighed coughed played nervously with the tassels of her peignoir crumpled bijous ears with a reckless disregard to that priceless pets feelings and wished herself at the bottom of the serpentine cardonnel had trusted her she couldnt desert him poor dear adeliza had trusted her she couldnt betray her what was right to one would be wrong to the other and to reconcile her divided duties was a danaids labor for months she had worried her life out lest her advice should be asked and now the climax was come and asked it was what a horrible position thought lady marabout she waited and hesitated till the pendule had ticked off sixty seconds then she summoned her courage and spoke my dear advice in such matters is often very harmful and always very useless plenty of people have asked my counsel but i never knew any of them take it unless it chanced to chime in with their fancy a womans best adviser is her own heart specially on such a subject as this but before i give my opinion may i ask if you have accepted him lady marabouts heart throbbed quick and fast as she put the momentous question with an agitation for which she would have blushed before her admirably nonchalante niece but the tug of war was coming and if goodwood should be lost you have accepted him she asked again no irefused him the delicate rose went out of the hon vals cheeks for once and she breathed quickly and shortly goodwood was not lost then was she sorrywas she glad lady marabout hardly knew like wellington she felt the next saddest thing after a defeat is a victory but you love him valencia she asked half ashamed of suggesting such weakness to this glorious beauty the hon val unclasped her necklet as if it were a chain choking her and her face grew white and set the coldest will feel on occasion and all have some tender place that can wince at the touch perhaps but such folly is best put aside at once certainly i prefer him to others but to accept him would have been madness absurdity i told him so you told him so if you had the heart to do so valencia he has not lost much in losing you burst in lady marabout her indignation getting the better of her judgment and her heart as usual giving the coup de grace to her reason i am shocked at you every tenderhearted woman feels regret for affection she is obliged to repulse even when she does not return it and you who love this man would you have had me accept him aunt yes cried lady marabout firmly forgetting every vestige of duty and every possibility of dear adelizas vengeance if you love him i would decidedly when i married my dear philips father he was what cardonnel is a cavalry man as far off his family title then as cardonnel is off his now the more reason i should not imitate your imprudence my dear aunt death might not carry off the intermediate heirs quite so courteously in this case no i refused major cardonnel and i did rightly i should have repented it by now had i accepted him there is nothing more silly than to be led away by romance you de boncoeurs are romantic you know we valletorts are happily free from the weakness i am very tired aunt so good night the hon val went the waxlight she carried shedding a paler shade on her handsome face whiter and more set than usual but held more proudly as if it already wore the doncaster coronet and lady marabout sighed as she rang for her maid of course she acted wisely and i ought to be very pleased but that poor dear fellowhis eyes are so like his mothers i congratulate you mother on a clear field youve sent poor arthur off very nicely said carruthers the next morning paying his general visit in her boudoir before the day began which is much the same time in town as in greenland and commences whatever almanacs may say about two or halfpast pm cardonnel left this morning for heaven knows where and is going to exchange shelleto tells me into the th which is ordered to bengal so he wont trouble you much more when shall i be allowed to congratulate my cousin as the future duchess of doncaster pray dont tease me philip ive been vexed enough about your friend when he came to me this morning and asked me if there was no hope and i was obliged to tell him there was none i felt wretched said lady marabout as nearly pettishly as she ever said anything but i am really not responsible not in the least besides even you must admit that goodwood is a much more desirable alliance and if valencia had accepted cardonnel pray what would all belgravia have said why that disappointed of goodwood she took the other out of pure pique we owe something to society philip and something to ourselves carruthers laughed ah my dear mother you women will never be worth all you ought to be till you leave off kowtowing to what will be said and learn to defy that terrible oligarchy of the quen diraton when will goodwood propose wondered lady marabout fifty times a day and valencia valletort wondered too whitebait was being eaten and yachts being fitted manned and victualled outstanding ascot debts were being settled and outstanding bills were being passed hurriedly through st stephens all the clockwork of the season was being wound up for the last time previous to a long standstill and going at a deuce of a pace as if longing to run down and give its million wheels and levers peace while everybody whod anything to settle whether monetary or matrimonial personal or political was making up his mind about it and getting it off his hands and some men were being pulled up by wideawake jews to see what they were made of while others were pulled up by adroit dowagers to know what they had meant before the accounts of the season were scored out and settled had goodwood proposed asked all belgravia why hadnt goodwood proposed asked lady marabout and valencia twenty most favorable opportunities for the performance of that ceremony had lady marabout made for him accidentally on purpose the last fortnight each of those times she had fancied the precious fish hooked and landed and each time she had seen him free from the hook floating on the surface of society he must speak definitely tomorrow thought lady marabout but the larvae of tomorrow burst into the butterfly of today and today passed into the chrysalis of yesterday and goodwood was always very nearly caught and never quite come upstairs philip i want to show you a little paul potter i bought the other day said lady marabout one morning returning from a shopping expedition to regent street meeting her son at her own door just descending from his tilbury lord goodwood calling did you say soames oh very well and lady marabout floated up the staircase but signed to her footman to open the door not of the drawingroom but of her own boudoir the potter is in my own room philip you must come in here if you wish to see it said that adroit lady for the benefit of soames but when the door was shut lady marabout lowered her voice confidentially the potter isnt here dear i had it hung in the little cabinet through the drawingrooms but i dont wish to go up there for a few momentsyou understand carruthers threw himself in a chair and laughed till the dogs bijou bonbon and pandore all barked in a furious concert i understand so goodys positively coming to the point up there is he no doubt he is said lady marabout reprovingly why else should he come in when i was not at home there is nothing extraordinary in it the only thing i have wondered at is his having delayed so long if a man had to hang himself would you wonder he put off pulling the bolt i dont see any point in your jests at all returned lady marabout there is nothing ridiculous in winning such a girl as valencia no but the question here is not of winning her but of buying her the price is a little higha ducal coronet and splendid settlements a weddingring and bondage for life but he will buy her nevertheless cardonnel couldnt pay the first half of the price and so he was swept out of the auctionroom you are shocked mother ah truth is shocking sometimes and always maladroit one oughtnt to bring it into ladies boudoirs hold your tongue philip i will not have you so satirical where do you take it from not from me i am sure hark there is goodwood going that is his step on the stairs i think dear me philip i wish you sympathized with me a little more for i do feel happy and i cant help it dear adeliza will be so gratified my dear mother ill do my best to be sympathetic ill go and congratulate goodwood as he gets in his cab if you fancy i ought but you see if i were in dahomey beholding the head of my best friend coming off i couldnt quite get up the amount of sympathy in their pleasure at the refreshing sight the dahomites might expect from me and so but lady marabout missed the comparison of herself to a dahomite for she had opened the door and was crossing to the drawingrooms her eyes bright her step elastic her heart exultant at the triumph of her manoeuvres the hon val was playing with some ferns in an etagere at the bottom of the farthest room and responded to the kiss her aunt bestowed on her about as much as if she had been one of the statuettes on the consoles well love what did he say asked lady marabout breathlessly with eager delight and confident anticipation like drops of ice on warm roseleaves fell each word of the intensely chill and slightly sulky response on lady marabouts heart he said that he goes to cowes tomorrow for the royal yacht squadron dinner and then on in the anadyomene to the spitzbergen coast for walruses he left a p p c card for you walruses shrieked lady marabout walruses responded the hon val and said no more than that no more than that the pet eligible had flown off uncaught after all lady marabout needed no further explanationtout fut dit they were both silent and paralyzed do you suppose pompey and cornelia had much need of words when they met at lesbos after the horrible deroute of pharsalia im in your mothers blackest books for ever phil said goodwood to carruthers in the express to southampton for the ryc squadron regatta of that year but i cant help it its no good to badger us into marriage it only makes us double and run to earth i was near compromising myself with your cousin i grant but the thing that chilled me was shes too studied its all got up beforehand and goes upon clockwork and it dont interest one accordingly the mechanisms perfect but we know when it will raise its hand and move its eyes and bow its head and when weve looked at its beauty once we get tired of it thats the fault in valencia and in scores of them and as long as they wont be natural why they cant have much chance with us which piece of advice carruthers when he next saw his mother repeated to her for the edification of all future debutantes adding a small sermon of his own my dear mother i ask you is it to be expected that we can marry just to oblige women and please the newspapers would you have me marched off to hanover square because it would be a kindness to take one of lady elmers marriageable daughters or because a leading journal fills up an empty column with farcical lamentation on our dislike to the bondage of course you wouldnt yet for no better reasons youd have chained poor goodwood if you could have caught him whether a man likes to marry or not is certainly his own private business though just now its made a popular public discussion do you wonder that we shirk the institution if we have not fortune marriage cramps our energies our resources our ambitions loads us with petty cares and trebles our anxieties to one who rises with such a burden on his shoulders how many sink down in obscurity who but for the leaden weight of pecuniary difficulties with which marriage has laden their feet might have climbed the highest round in the social ladder on the other side if we have fortune if we have the unhappy happiness to be eligible is it wonderful that we are not flattered by the worship of young ladies who love us for what we shall give them that we dont feel exactly honored by being courted for what we are worth and that were not overwilling to give up our liberty to oblige those who look on us only as good speculations what think you eh lady marabout looked up and shook her head mournfully my dear philip you are right i see iti dont dispute it but when a thing becomes personal you know philosophy becomes difficult i have such letters from poor dear adelizasuch letters of course she thinks it is all my fault and i believe she will break entirely with me it is so very shocking you see all belgravia coupled their names and the very day that he went off to cowes in that heartless abominable manner if an announcement of the alliance as arranged did not positively appear in the court circular it did indeed i am sure anne hautton was at the bottom of it it would be just like her perhaps poor valencia cannot be pitied after her treatment of cardonnel but it is very hard on me lady marabout is right when a thing becomes personal philosophy becomes difficult when your gun misses fire and a fine cock bird whirrs up from the covert and takes wing unharmed never to swell the number of your triumphs and the size of your gamebag could you by any chance find it in your soul to sympathize with the birds gratification at your mortification and its own good luck i fancy not lady marabouts troubles or the worries of a chaperone in three seasons season the secondthe ogre if there be one class i dislike more than another it is that class and if there be one person in town i utterly detest it is that man said our friend lady marabout with much unction one morning to an audience consisting of bijou bonbon and pandore a cockatoo an angora cat and a young lady sitting in a rockingchair reading the magazines of the month the dogs barked the cockatoo screamed the cat purred a vehement affirmative the human auditor looked up and laughed what is the class lady marabout may i ask those clever detestable idle goodfornothing fashionable worthless men about town who have not a penny to their fortune and spend a thousand a year on gloves and scented tobaccowho are seen at everybodys house and never at their ownwho drive horses fit for a dukes stud and havent money enough to keep a donkey on thistleswho have handsome faces and brazen conscienceswho are positively leaders of ton and yet are glad to write feuilletons before the world is up to pay their stall at the operawho give a guinea for a bouquet and cant pay a shilling of their just debtsi detest the class my dear so it seems lady marabout i never heard you so vehement and who is the particular scapegoat of this type of sinners chandos cheveley chandos cheveley isnt he that magnificent man sir philip introduced to me at the amandines breakfast yesterday why lady marabout his figure alone might outbalance a multitude of sins he is handsome enough did philip introduce him to you my dear i wonder it was very careless of him but men are so thoughtless they will know anybody themselves and they think we may do the same the men called here while we were driving this morning i am glad we were out he very seldom comes to my house but why is he so dreadful the amandines are tremendously exclusive i thought oh he goes everywhere no party is complete without chandos cheveley and i have heard that at september or christmas he has more invitations than he could possibly accept but he is a most objectionable man all the samea man every one dreads to see come near her daughters he has extreme fascination of manner but he has not a farthing how he lives dresses drives the horses he does is one of those miracles of london mens lives which we can never hope to puzzle out philip says he likes him but philip never speaks ill of anybody except a woman now and then who teases him but the man is my detestationhas been for years i was annoyed to see his card it is the first time he has called this season he knows i cant endure his class or him with which lady marabout wound up a very unusually lengthy and uncharitable disquisition length and uncharitableness being both out of her line and lady cecil ormsby rolled her handkerchief into a ball threw it across the room for bonbon the spaniel puppy and laughed till the cockatoo screamed with delight dear lady marabout do forgive me but it is such fun to hear you positively for once malicious who is your horror genealogically speaking this terriblewhats his namechandos cheveley the younger son of a younger son of one of the marquises of danvers i believe my dear an idle man about town you know with not a sou to be idle upon who sets the fashion but never pays his tailor i am never malicious i hope but i do consider men of that stamp very objectionable but what is sir philip but a man about town my son of course he is a man about town my dear what else should he be but if philip likes to lounge all his days away in a clubwindow he has a perfect right he has fortune chandos cheveley is not worth a farthing and yet yawns away his day in whites as if he were a millionnaire the one can support his far niente the other cannot there are gradations in everything my love but in nothing more than among the men of the same set and the same style whom one sees in pallmall there are chestnut horses and horsechestnuts chevaliers and chevaliers dindustrie rois and rois dyvetot carrutherses and chandos cheveleys laughed lady cecil i understand lady marabout il y a femmes et femmesmen about town and men about town i shall learn all the classes and distinctions soon but how is one to know the sheep that may be let into the fold from the wolves in sheeps clothing that must be kept out of it your ogre is really very distinguishedlooking distinguished oh yes my love but the most distinguished men are the most objectionable sometimes i assure you my dear cecil i have seen an elder son whom sometimes i could hardly have told from his own valet and a younger of the same family with the style of a dorsay why did i not this very winter when i went to stay at rochdale take fitzbreguet himself whom i had not chanced to see since he was a child for one of the men out of livery and bid him bring bijous basket out of the carriage i did indeedi who hate such mistakes more than any one and lionel his second brother has the beauty of an apollo and the air noble to perfection one often sees it its through the doctrine of compensation i suppose but its very perplexing and causes endless embrouillements when the mammas fall in love with lord fitzs coronet and the daughters with lord lionels face i suppose interpolated lady cecil exactly so dear as for knowing the sheep from the wolves as you call them went on lady marabout sorting her embroidery silks you may very soon know more of chandos cheveleys classthis magenta braid is good for nothing its a beautiful color but it fades immediatelyyou meet them in the country at all fast houses as they call them nowadays like the amandines they are constantly invited because they are so amusing or so dead a shot or so good a whip and live on their invitations because they have no locale of their own you see all the women worth nothing admire and all the women worth anything shun them they have a dozen accomplishments and not a single reliable quality a hundred houses open to them and not a shootingbox of their own property or rental you will meet this chandos cheveley everywhere for instance as though he were somebody desirable you will see him in his clubwindow as though he were born only to read the papers in the ride mounted on a much better animal than fitzbreguet though the one pays treble the price he ought and the other i dare say no price at all at ascot on amandines or goodwoods drag made as much of among them all as if he were an heirapparent to the throne and yet my love that man hasnt a penny lives heaven knows where and how he gets money to keep his cab and buy his gloves is as i say one of those mysteries of settling days whisttables periodical writing baden coups de bonheur and suchlike fountains of such mens fortunes which we can never hope to penetrateand very little we should benefit if we could my dearest cecil if it is not ten minutes to five we must go and drive at once lady ormsby was a great pet of lady marabouts she had been so from a child so much so that when the year after valencia valletorts discomfiture a discomfiture so heavy and so public that that young beauty was seized with a fit of filial devotion attended her mamma to nice and figured not in belgravia the ensuing season and even lady marabouts temper had been slightly soured by it as you perceive another terrible charge was shifted on her shoulders by an appeal from the guardians of the late earl of rosediamonds daughter for her to be brought out under the marabout wing she had consented and surrendered herself to be again a martyr to responsibility for the sake of cecil and cecils lost mother the young lady was a beauty she was worse she was an heiress she was worse still she was saucy wayward and notable for a strong will of her owna more dangerous young thoroughbred was never brought to a gentler rarey and yet she was the first charge of this nature that lady marabout had ever accepted in the whole course of her life with no misgivings and with absolute pleasure first she was very fond of cecil ormsby secondly she longed to efface her miserable failure with valencia by a brilliant success which should light up all the gloom of her past of chaperonage thirdly she had a sweet and longcherished diplomacy nestling in her heart to throw her son and lord rosediamonds daughter together for the eventual ensnaring and fettering of carruthers which policy nothing could favor so well as having the weapon for that deadly purpose in her own house through april may and june cecil ormsby was a beauty and an heiressspirited sarcastic brilliant wilful very proud altogether a more spirited young filly never needed a tight hand on the ribbons a light but a firm seat and a temperate though judicious use of the curb to make her endure being ridden at all even over the most level grass countries of life and yet for the reasons just mentioned lady marabout who never had a tight hand upon anything who is to be thrown in a moment by any wilful kick or determined plunge who is utterly at the mercy of any filly that chooses to take the bit between her own teeth and bolt off and is entirely incapable of using the curb even to the most illnatured and illtrained shetland that ever deserved to have its mouth sawedlady marabout undertook the jockeyship without fear i dare say you wonder after my grief with valencia that i have consented to bring another girl out but when i heard it was poor rosediamonds wishhis dying wish one may almost saythat cecil should make her debut with me what was i to do my dear she explained half apologetically to carruthers when the question was first agitated perhaps too lady marabout had in her heart been slightly sickened of perfectly trained young ladies brought up on the best systems and admitted to herself that the pets of the foreign houses may not be the most attractive flowers after all so lady cecil ormsby was installed in lowndes square and though she was the inheritor of her mothers wealth which was considerable and possessor of her own wit and beauty which were not inconsiderable either and therefore a prize to fortunehunters and a lure to misogamists as lady marabout knew very well how to keep the first off and had her pet project of numbering her refractory son among the converted second she rather congratulated herself than otherwise in having the pleasure and eclat of introducing her and men voted the marabout yearlings sale of that season since it comprised rosediamonds handsome daughter as dangerous as a horsedealers auction to a young greenhorn or a drapers sale without reserve at enormous sacrifice to a lady with a soul on bargains bent how very odd just as we have been talking of him there is that man again i must bow to him i suppose though if there be a person i dislike said lady marabout giving a frigid little bend of her head as her barouche with its dashing roans rolled from her door and a tilbury passed them driving slowly through the square cecil ormsby bowed to its occupant with less severity and laughed under the sheltering shadow of her white parasolfringe the ogre has a very pretty trap though lady marabout and the most delicious gray horse in it such good action if its action is good my love i dare say it is more than could be said of its masters actions he is going to call on that mrs marechale very probably he was always there last season and lady marabout shook her head and looked grave which combined with the everdamnatory demonstrative conjunction blackened mrs marechales moral character as much as lady marabout could blacken any ones she loving as little to soil her own fingers and her neighbors reputations with the indelible italian chalk of scandal as any lady i know being given on the contrary when compelled to draw any little social croquis of a backbiting nature to sketch them in as lightly as she could take out as many lights as possible and rub in the shadows with a very chary and pitying hand except indeed when she took the portrait of such an ogre as chandos cheveley when i cant say she was quite so merciful specially when policy and prejudice combined to suggest that it would be best and not unjust to use the blackest conte crayons obtainable the subject of it would not have denied the correctness of the silhouette lady marabout had snipped out for the edification of lady cecil had he caught a glimpse of it he had no habitation nor was ever likely to have any save a bachelors suite in a back street he had been an idle man for the last twenty years with not a sou to be idle upon the springs of his very precarious fortunes his pursuits habits reputation ways and means were all much what she had described them yet he set the fashion much oftener than goodwood and dukes and millionnaires would follow the style of his tie or the shape of his hat he moved in the most brilliant circles as court circulars have it and all the best houses were open to him at his grace of amandines staying there for the shooting he would alter the stud find fault with the claret arrange a drive for deer in the forest and flirt with her grace herself as though as lady marabout averred he had been heirapparent or prince regent who honored the castle by his mere presence amandine all the while swearing by every word he spoke thinking nothing well done without cheveley and submitting to be set aside in his own castle with the greatest gratification at the extinction but that chandos cheveley was not worth a farthing that he was but a bohemian on a brilliant scale that any day he might disappear from that society where he now glittered never to reappear everybody knew how he floated there as he did kept his cab and his man paid for his stall at the opera his club fees and all the other trifles that wont wait was an eternal puzzle to every one ignorant of how expensively one may live upon nothing if one just gets the knack and of how far a fashionable reputation like a cake of chocolate will go to support life when nothing more substantial is obtainable lady marabout had sketched him correctly enough allowing for a little politic bitterness thrown in to counteract carrutherss thoughtlessness in having introduced him to rosediamonds daughter that priceless treasure for whom lady marabout would fain have had a guard of janissaries if they would not have been likely to look singular and come expensive and ladies of the marabout class did look upon him as an ogre guarded their daughters from his approach at a ball as carefully if not as demonstratively as any duck its ducklings from the approach of a waterrat did not ask him to their dinners and bowed to him chillily in the ring others regarded him as harmless from his perfect pennilessness what danger was there in the fascinations of a man whom all belgravia knew hadnt money enough to buy dogskin gloves though he always wore the best paris lavender kid while others the pretty married women chiefly from her grace of amandine downwards to mrs marechale of lowndes square flirted with him fearfully and considered chandos cheveley what nobody ever succeeded in disproving him the most agreeable man on town with the finest figure the best style and the most perfect bow to be seen in the park any day between march and july but then as lady marabout remarked on a subsequent occasion a figure a style and a bow are admirable and enviable things but theyre not among the cardinal virtues and dont do to live upon and though theyre very good buoys to float one on the smooth sparkling sea of society if there come a storm one may go down despite them and become helpless prey to the sharks waiting below philip certainly admires her very much he said the other day there was something in her and that means a great deal from him thought lady marabout complacently as she and cecil ormsby were wending their way through some crowded rooms of course i shall not influence cecil towards him it would not be honorable to do so since she might look for a higher title than my sons still if it should so fall out nothing would give me greater pleasure and really nothing would seem more natural with a little judicious manage may i have the honor of this valse with you was spoken in though not to lady marabouts ear it was a soft a rich a melodious voice enough and yet lady marabout would rather have heard the hiss of a cobra capella for the footmen might have caught the serpent and carried it off from cecil ormsbys vicinity and she couldnt very well tell them to rid the receptionchambers of chandos cheveley lady marabout vainly tried to catch cecils eye and warn her of the propriety of an utter and entire repudiation of the valse in question if there were no engaged producible to softly chill the hopes and repulse the advances of the aspirant but lady cecils soul was obstinately bent saltatorywards her chaperones ocular telegram was lost upon her and only caught by the last person who should have seen it who read the message off the wires to his own amusement but naturally was not magnanimous enough to pass it on i ought to have warned her never to dance with that detestable man if i could but have caught her eye even now thought lady marabout restlessly the capella would have been much the more endurable of the two the serpent couldnt have passed its arm round rosediamonds priceless daughter and whirled her down the ballroom to the music of coote and timneys band as chandos cheveley was now doing why did you not ask her for that waltz philip cried the good lady almost petulantly carruthers opened his eyes wide my dear mother you know i never dance i come to balls to oblige my hostesses and look at the women but not to carry a sevenstone weight of tulle illusion and white satin going at express pace with the thermometer at deg and a dense crowd jostling one at every turn in the circle bien oblige thats not my idea of pleasure if it were the pyrrhic dance now or the tarantella or the bolero under a castilian chestnuttree hold your tongue you might have danced for once just to have kept her from chandos cheveley from the best waltzer in london not so selfish ask amandines wife if women dont like to dance with that fellow i should be very sorry to mention his name to her or any of her set responded lady marabout getting upon certain virtuous stilts of her own which she was given to mount on rare occasion and at distant intervals always finding them very uncomfortable and unsuitable elevations and being as glad to cast them off as a traveller to kick off the echasses he has had to strap on over the sandy plains of the landes what could possess you to introduce him to cecil philip it was careless silly unlike you you know how i dislike men of hishisobjectionable stamp sighed lady marabout the white and gold namesakes in her coiffure softly trembling a gentle sigh in the perfumy zephyr raised by the rotatory whirl of the waltzers among whom she watched with a horrible fascination as one watches a tiger being pugged out of its lair or a deserter being led out to be shot chandos cheveley waltzing rosediamonds priceless daughter down the ballroom he is so dreadfully handsome i wonder why it is that men and women who have no fortune but their faces will be so dangerously so obstinately so provokingly attractive as one sees them so often thought lady marabout determining to beat an immediate retreat from the present salons since they were infested by the presence of her ogre to lady hauttons house in wilton crescent lady hautton headed charitable bazaars belonged to the cummingite nebulae visited homes and hospitals floating to the bedside of luckless feminine patients to read out divers edifying passages whose effect must have been somewhat neutralized to the hearers one would imagine by the envyinspiring rustle of her silks the flash of her rings and the chimes of her bracelets chains and chatelaine looked on the amandine set as lost souls and hence did not know chandos cheveleya fact which though the marabout and hautton antagonism was patent to all belgravia served to endear her all at once to her foe lady marabout like a good many other people being content to sink personal resentment and make a truce with the infidels for the sake of enjoying a mutual antipathythat closest of all links of union lady marabout and lady hautton were foes but they were dear helena and dear anne all the same dined at each others tables and smiled in each others faces they might be private foes but they were public friends and lady marabout beat a discreet retreat to the hauttons salonsso many engagements is so useful a pleaand from the hautton she passed on to a ball at the duke of doncasters and as at both if lady cecil ormsby did not move a goddess from above she moved a brilliant sparkling nonchalante dangerous beauty with some of her sexs faults all her sexs witcheries and more than her sexs mischief holding her own royally saucily and proudly and chandos cheveley was encountered no more but happily detained at petit souper in a certain section of the french embassy lady marabout drove homewards in the gray of the morning relieved complacent and gratified dozing deliciously till she was woke up with a start lady marabout what a splendid waltzer your ogre chandos cheveley is lady marabout opened her eyes with a jerk that set her feathers trembling her diamonds scintillating and her bracelets ringing an astonished little carillon my love how you frightened me cecil ormsby laugheda gay joyous laugh innocent of having disturbed a doze a lapse into human weakness of which her chaperone never permitted herself to plead guilty frightened you did i why your bete noire is as terrible to you as coeur de lion to the saracen children or black douglas to the lowland and really i cant see anything terrible in him he is excessively brilliant and agreeable has something worth hearing to say to you and his waltzing is lady cecil ormsby had not a word in her repertorythough it was an enthusiastic and comprehensive one and embraced five languagessufficiently commendatory to finish her sentence i dare say dear i never denied or heard denied his having every accomplishment under the sun the only pity is he has nothing more substantial returned lady marabout a little bit tartly for her lips only used to the softest and most genuine milk of roses lord rosediamonds daughter laughed a little mournfully and played with her fan poor man brilliant and beggared fashionable and friendless courted and cashiereda sad destiny do you know lady marabout i have half a mind to champion your ogre my love dont talk nonsense said lady marabout hastily at which lady cecil only laughed still more softly and gayly again and sprung down as the carriage stopped in lowndes square rosediamonds daughters deucedly handsome eh cheveley i saw you waltzing with her last night said goodwood at lords the next morning watching a match between the household cavalry and the zingari eleven yes she is the best thing we have seen for some time said cheveley glancing round to see if the marabout liveries were on the ground dont let the amandine or little marechale hear you say so or youll have a deuce of a row laughed goodwood shes worth a good deal too shes all her mothers property and thats something i know the deaths in her family have kept her back two years or more but now she is out i dare say lady tattersall will put her up high in the market no doubt why dont you make the investmentshes much more attractive than that valletort ice statue who hooked you so nearly last year fortescues out well done little jimmy ah theres the marabout carriage i am as unwelcome to that good lady i know as if i were quasimodo or quilp and as much to be shunned in her estimation as vidocq armed to the teeth nevertheless i shall go and talk to them if only in revenge for the telegraphic warning of dangerous she shot at lady cecil last night when i asked her to waltz goodwood dont you envy me my happy immunity from traps matrimonial there is that man againhow provoking i wish we had not come to see philips return match he is positively coming up to talk to us thought lady marabout restlessly as her ogre lifted his hat to her in vain did she do her best to look severe to look frigid to chill him with a withering good morning a little word capable if you notice of expressing every gradation in feeling from the nadir of delighted intimacy to the zero of rebuking frigidity her coldest ice was as warm as a pineapple ice that has been melting all day under a refreshment tent at a horticultural fete her role was not chilliness and never could be she would have beamed benign on a headsman who had led her out to instant decapitation and been no more able to help it than a peach to help its bloom or a claret its bouquet she did her utmost to freeze chandos cheveley but either she failed signally or he being blessed with the brazen conscience she had attributed to him was steeled to all the tacit repulses of her looks for he leant against the barouchedoor let her freeze him away as she might and chatted to cecil ormsby positively lady marabout remarked to that safest confidante herself positively as if the man had been welcome at my house for the last ten years if cecil would but second me he couldnt do it but she will smile and talk with him just as though he were goodwood or fitzbreguet it is very disagreeable to be forced against ones will like this into countenancing such a very objectionable person and yet what can one do which query she could by no means satisfactorily answer herself being a regular female nerva for clemency utterly incapable of the severity with which that stern catiline lady hautton would have signed the unwelcome intruder out of the way in a brace of seconds and under nervas gentle rule though nerva was longing with all her heart to have the courage to call the lictors and say away with him cheveley leant against the door of the carriage unmolested though decidedly undesired by one of its occupants talked to by lady cecil possibly because she found him as agreeable as her grace of amandine and lillia marechale had done before her possibly only from that rule of contrariety which is such a pet motorpower with her sex and lady marabout reclined among her cushions tucked up in her tigerskin in precisely that state of mind in which fuseli said to his wife swear my dear you dont know how much good it will do you dreading in herself the possible advent of the hautton carriage for that ancient enemy and rigid pietist of whose keen tongue and eminent virtue she always stood secretly in awe to see this worthless and utterly objectionable member of that fast graceless and very incorrect amandine set absolutely en sentinelle at the door of her barouche does your best friend ever come when you want him most doesnt your worst foe always come when you want him least of course at that juncture the hautton carriage came on the ground hautton was one of the zingari club and maternal interest brought her foe to lords as it had brought herself and the hautton eyeglass significantly and surprisedly raised said as distinctly to lady marabout as though elfishly endowed with vocal powers you allow that man acquaintance with rosediamonds daughter lady marabout was stung to the soul by the deserved rebuke but she didnt know how on earth to get rid of the sinner there he leaned calmly nonchalantly determinedly as if he were absolutely welcome and lady cecil talked on to him as if he were absolutely welcome too lady marabout felt branded in the eyes of all belgravia to have chandos cheveley at her carriagedoor the most objectionable man of all his most objectionable class it is very strange she thought i have seen that man about town the last fiveandtwenty yearsever since he was a mere boy taken up and petted by adeline patchouli for some piece of witty brummelian impudence he said to her on his first introductionand he has never sought my acquaintance before but always seemed to be quite aware of my dislike to him and all his set it is very grievous he should have chosen the very season i have poor dear rosediamonds daughter with me but it is always my fateif a thing can happen to annoy me it always will with which lady marabout getting fairly distracted under the iron hand of adverse fate and the ruthless surveillance of the hautton glass invented an impromptu necessity for immediate shopping at lewis and allonbys and drove off the ground at the sole moment of interest the match possessed for herviz when carruthers was rattling down hauttons stumps and getting innings innumerable for the household mais ce nest que le premier pas qui coute the old proverbs so true we wear it threadbare with repeating it lady marabout might as well have stayed on lords ground and not lacerated her feelings by leaving at the very hour of the household cavalrys triumphs for any good that she did thereby the hautton eyeglass had lighted on chandos cheveley and chandos cheveleys eyeglass on rosediamonds daughterand cecil ormsby arched her eyebrows and gave her parasol a little impatient shake as they quitted lords lady marabout i never could have believed you illnatured you interrupted my ball last night and my conversation this morning i shall scold you if you ever do so again and now tell me as curiosity is a weakness incidental to all women no woman ought to refuse to relieve it in another why are you so prejudiced against that very handsome and very amusing person prejudiced my dear child i am not in the least prejudiced returned lady marabout nobody ever admitted to a prejudice that i ever heard its a plant that grows in all gardens and is sedulously matted up watered and strengthened but invariably disavowed by its sturdiest cultivators as for chandos cheveley i merely mentioned to you what all town knows about him and the dislike i have to his class is one of principle not of prejudice lady cecil made a moue mutine oh lady marabout if you go to principle tout est perdu principle has been made to bear the onus of every private pique since the world began and has had to answer for more cruelties and injustice than any word in the language the romans flung the christians to the lions on principle and the europeans slew the mahomedans on principle and principle lighted the autosdafe and signed to the tormentor to give a turn more to the rack please dont appeal to anything so severe and hypocritical come what are the ogres sins lady marabout laughed despite the subject do you think i am a compiler of such catalogues my love pray do not let us talk any more about chandos cheveley he is very little worth it all i say to you is be as cool to him as you can without rudeness of course i am never at home when he calls and were i you i would be always engaged when he asks you to waltz his acquaintance can in no way benefit you lady cecil gave a little haughty toss of her head and lay back in the barouche i will judge of that i am not made for fetters of any kind you know and i like to choose my own acquaintance as well as to choose my own dresses i cannot obey you either this evening for he asked me to put him on my tablets for the first waltz at lord anisettes ball and i consented i had no engaged ready unless i had had a falsehood ready too and you wouldnt counsel that lady marabout i am very sure with which straightforward and perplexing question cecil ormsby successfully silenced her chaperone by planting her in that disagreeable position known as between the horns of a dilemma and lady marabout shrinking alike from the responsibility of counselling a necessary equivocation as society politely terms its indispensable lies and the responsibility of allowing cecil acquaintance with the very worst of the amandine set sighed wondered envyingly how anne hautton would act in her place and almost began to wish somebody else had had the onerous stewardship of that brilliant and priceless jewel rosediamonds daughter now that the jewel threatened to be possessed with a will of its ownthe greatest possible flaw in a gem of pure water which they only want to scintillate brilliantly among the bijouterie of society and let itself be placed passively in the setting most suitable for it that can be conceived in the eyes of lady lapidaries intrusted with its sale it is very odd thought lady marabout she seems to have taken a much greater fancy to that odious man than to philip or goodwood or fitz or any one of the men who admire her so much i suppose i always am to be worried in this sort of way however there can be no real danger chandos cheveley is the merest butterfly flirt and with all his faults none ever accused him of fortunehunting still they say he is wonderfully fascinating and certainly he has the most beautiful voice i ever heard and if cecil should ever like him at all i could never forgive myself and what should i say to general ormsby the general cecils uncle and guardian is one of the besthumored besttempered and most laissezfaire men in the service but was for all that a perpetual dead weight on lady marabouts mind just then for was not he the person to whom at the end of the season she would have to render up account of the successes and the shortcomings of her chaperones career do you think of proposing chandos cheveley as a suitable alliance for cecil ormsby my dear helena asked lady hautton with that smile which was felt to be considerably worse than strychnine by her foes and victims at a house in grosvenor place that night god forbid prayed lady marabout mentally as she joined in the hautton laugh and shivered under the stab of the hautton sneer which was an excessively sharp one lady hautton being one of a rather numerous class of eminent christians so panoplied in the armor of righteousness that they can tread without feeling it on the tender feet of others the evening was spoiled to lady marabout she felt morally and guiltily responsible for an unpardonable indiscretionwith that man waltzing with cecil ormsby her graceful graceless gracious grace of amandine visibly irritated with jealousy at the sight and anne hautton whispering behind her fan with acidulated significance lady marabout had never been more miserable in her life she heard on all sides admiration of rosediamonds daughter she was gratified by seeing goodwood fitzbreguet fulke nugent every eligible man in the room suing for a place on her tablets she had the delight of beholding carruthers positively join the negligent beautys train and yet the night was a night of purgatory to lady marabout for chandos cheveley had his first waltz and several after it and the amandine set were there to gossip and the hautton clique to be shocked at it soames tell mason when mr chandos cheveley calls i am not at home said lady marabout at breakfast yes my lady said soames who treasured up the order and told it to mr chandos cheveleys man at the first opportunity though greatly to his honor we must admit he did not imitate the mild formula of fib and tell his mistress her claret was not corked when it was so incontestably cecil ormsby lifted her head and looked across the table at her hostess and the steady gaze of those violet eyes which were rosediamonds daughters best weapons of war so discomposed lady marabout that she forgot herself sufficiently to proffer bijou a piece of bread an unparalleled insult which that canine sybarite did not forget all day long not at home sir said mason as duly directed when cheveleys cab pulled up a week or two after the general order at the door cheveley smiled to himself as his gray had her head turned and the wheel grated off the trottoir while he lifted his hat to cecil ormsby just visible between the amber curtains and above the balcony flowers of one of the windows of the drawingroomquite visible enough for her return smile and bow to be seen in the street by cheveley in the room by lady marabout some of lady tattersalls generalship he thought as the gray trotted out of the square well i have no business there cecil ormsby is not her grace of amandine nor little marechale and the good lady is quite right to brand me dangerous to her charge and pronounce me inadmissible to her footman ive very little title to resent her verdict my dearest cecil whatever possessed you to bow to that man cried lady marabout in direst distress is it not customary to bow to ones acquaintancesi thought it was asked lady cecil with demure mischief but my dear from a windowand when mason is saying we are not at home that isnt masons fib or masons fault lady marabout suggested cecil with wicked emphasis there is no falsehood or fault at all anywhereeverybody knows well enough what not at home means returned lady marabout almost pettishly oh yes laughed the young lady saucily it means i am at home and sitting in my drawing room but i shall not rise to receive you because you are not worth the trouble its a polite cut direct and a honeyed rudenessa bitter almond wrapped up in a sugar dragee like a good many other bonbons handed about in society my dear cecil you have some very strange ideas you will get called satirical if you dont take care said lady marabout nervously cecil ormsbys tone worried her and made her feel something as she felt when she had a restive halfbroken pair of horses in her carriage for the direction of whose next plunge or next kick nobody could answer and if i bewhat then my dear child you could not anyhow get a more disadvantageous reputation it may amuse gentlemen though it frightens half them but it offends all women irremediably you see there are so few whom it doesnt hit somewhere returned lady marabout quite innocent of the neat satire of her own last sentence cecil ormsby laughed and threw herself down by her chaperones side never mind i can bear their enmity it is a greater compliment than their liking the women whom women love are always quiet colorless inoffensivefoils lady marabout tell me why did you give that general order to mason i have told you before my dear because i have no wish to know mr chandos cheveley returned lady marabout as stiffly as she could say anything it is as i said not from prejudice but from prin lady marabout if you use that word again i will drive to uncle ormsbys rooms in the albany and stay with him for the season i will positively i am sure all the gentlemen there will be delighted to have my society pray what are your ogres crimes did you ever hear anything dishonorable mean ungenerous attributed to him did you ever hear he broke his word or failed to act like a gentleman or was a defaulter at any settling day lady marabout required some explanation of what a defaulter at a settling day might be and on receiving it was compelled to confess that she never had heard anything of that kind imputed to chandos cheveley of course i have not my dear the man is a gentleman everybody knows however idle and improvident a one if he could be accused of anything of that kind he would not belong to such clubs and associate with such men as he does besides philip would not know him certainly would not think well of him which i confess he does but that is not at all the question ne vous en deplaise i think it very much and very entirely the question returned lady cecil with a toss of her haughty little head if you can bring nothing in evidence against a man it is not right to send him to the galleys and mark him forcat my dear cecil there is plenty in evidence against him said lady marabout with a mental back glance to certain stories told of the amandine set though not of that kind a man may be perfectly unexceptionable in his conduct with his men friends but very objectionable acquaintance for us to seek all the same ah i see lord goodwood may bet and flirt and lounge his days away and be as fast a man as he likes and it is all right but if mr cheveley does the same it is all wrong because he is not worth forgiving naturally it is returned lady marabout seriously and naively but how very oddly you put things my love and why you should interest yourself in this man when everything i tell you is to his disadvantage i cannot imagine a remark that showed lady marabout a skilful tactician insomuch as it silenced cecila performance rather difficult of accomplishment i am very glad i gave the order to mason thought that good lady i only wish we did not meet the man in society but it is impossible to help that we are all cards of one pack and get shuffled together whether we like it or not i wish philip would pay her more attention he admires her i can see and he can make any woman like him in ten days when he takes the trouble but he is so tiresome she would be exactly suited to him she has all he would exactbeauty talent good blood and even fortune though that he would not need the alliance would be a great happiness to me well he dines here tonight and he gives that concert at his barracks tomorrow morning purely to please cecil i am sure i think it may be brought about with careful management with which pleasant reflection she went to drive in the ring thinking that her maternal and duenna duties would be alike well fulfilled and her chaperones career well finished if by any amount of tact intrigue finesses and diplomacy she could live to see cecil ormsby sign herself cecil carruthers if that man were only out of town she thought as cheveley passed them in amandines mailphaeton at the turn lady marabout might wish cheveley were out of townand wish it devoutly she didbut she wasnt very likely to have her desire gratified till the general migration should carry him off in its tide to the deck of a yacht a lodge in the highlands a german kursaal or any one of those myriad good houses where nobody was so welcome as he the best shot the best seat the best wit the best billiardplayer the best whistplayer and the best authority on all fashionable topics of any man in england cheveley used to aver that he liked lady marabout though she detested him nay that he liked her for her detestation he said it was cordial sincere and refreshing therefore a treat in the world of belgravia still he didnt like her so well as to leave town in the middle of may to oblige her and though he took her hint as it was meant and pulled up his hansom no more at her door he met her and rosediamonds daughter at dinners balls concerts morningparties innumerable he saw them in the ring he was seen by them at the opera he came across them constantly in the gyration of london life night after night lady cecil persisted in writing his name in her tablets evening after evening a bizarre fate worried lady marabout by putting him on the left hand of her priceless charge at a dinnerparty day after day all the harmony of a concert was marred to her ear by seeing her ogre talking of beethoven and mozart chamber music and bravura music in cecils morning after morning gall was poured into her luncheon sherry and wormwood mingled in her volauvent by being told with frank mischief by her desired daughterinlaw that she had seen mr cheveley leaning on the rails smoking when she had taken her afterbreakfast canter chandos cheveley getting up before noon he must mean something unusual thought her chaperone helena has set her heart on securing cecil ormsby for carruthers i hope she may succeed better than she did with poor goodwood last season laughed lady hautton with her inimitable sneer glancing at the young lady in question at a bazaar in williss rooms selling rosebuds for anything she liked to ask for them and cigars tied up with blue ribbon a guinea the halfdozen at the marabout stall lady hautton had just been paying a charitable visit to st cecilias refuge of which she was head patroness where having floated in with much benignity been worshipped by a select little toady troop administered spiritual consolation with admirable condescension and distributed illuminated texts for the adornment of the walls and refreshment of the souls she was naturally in a christian frame of mind towards her neighbors lady marabout caught the remarkas she was intended to doand thought it not quite a pleasant one but my good sir did you ever know those estimable people who spend all their time fitting themselves for another world ever take the trouble to make themselves decently agreeable in the present one the little pleasant courtesies affabilities generosities and kindnesses that rub the edge off the flintstones of the via dolorosa are quite beneath the attention of mary the saint and only get attended to by martha the worldly poor butterfly thing who is fit for nothing more serviceable and profitable lady marabout had set her heart on cecil ormsbys filling that post of honorof which no living woman was deserving in her opinionthat of philips wife an individual who had been for so many years a fond ideal a haunting anxiety and a dreaded rival en meme temps to her imagination she was a little bit of a matchmaker she had over and over again arranged the most admirable and suitable alliances alliances that would have shamed the scepticism of the world in general as to the desirability of the holy bonds and brought every refractory man to the steps of st georges alliances that would have come off with the greatest eclat but for one trifling hindrance and difficultynamely the people most necessary to the arrangements could never by any chance be brought to view them in the same light and were certain to give her diplomacy the crocenjambe at the very moment of its culminating glory and finishing finesses she was a little bit of a matchmakermost kindhearted women are the tinder they play with is much better left alone but they dont remember that like children in a forest they think theyll light a pretty bright fire just for fun and never remember what a seared dreary waste that fire may make or what a prairie conflagration it may stretch into before its stopped cecil ormsby is a terrible flirt said lady hautton to another lady glancing at the rapid sale of the rosebuds and cigars the bunches of violets and the sprays of lilies of the valley in which that brilliant beauty was doing such thriving business at such extravagant profits while the five ladies hautton presided solemnly over articles of gorgeous splendor which threatened to be left on hand and go in a tombola as ignominiously as a beauty after half a dozen seasons left unwooed and unwon goes to the pelemele raffle of german bad society and is sold off at the finish to an unknown of the line or a civil service fellow with five hundred a year was cecil a flirt wondered lady marabout lady marabout was fain to confess to herself that she thought she wasnay that she hoped she was if it wasnt flirting that way in which she smiled on chandos cheveley sold him cigarettes laughed with him over the ices and nectarines he fetched her and positively invested him with the cordon dhonneur of a little bouquet of fairy roses for which twenty men sued and he give satan his due did not even askif it wasnt flirting what was it lady marabout shivered at the suggestion and though she was on principle excessively severe on flirting she could be very glad of what she didnt approve when it aided her on occasionlike most other peopleand would so far have agreed with talleyrand as to welcome the worst crime of coquetry as far less a sin than the unpardonable blunder of encouraging an ogre i cant send cecil away from the stall as if she were a naughty child and i cant order the man out of williss rooms thought that unhappy and fatallyworried lady as she presided behind her stall an emphatic witness of the truth of the poeticism that grief smiles and gives no sign insomuch as she looked the fairest sunniest bestlooking and besttempered dowager that ever shrouded herself in chantilly lace i do think those ineligible detrimental objectionable persons ought not to be let loose on society as they are she pondered let them have their clubs and their mess breakfasts their ascot and their newmarket their lansquenet parties and their handicap pigeon matches if they like but to have them come amongst us as they do asked everywhere if they happen to have good blood and good style free to waltz and flirt and sing and show all sorts of attention to marriageable girls while all the while they are no more available for anything serious than if they were club stewards or cabmencreatures that live on their fashionable aroma and cant afford to buy the very bottles of bouquets on their toilettetablesfast men too who knowing they can never marry themselves make a practice of turning marriage into ridicule and help to set all the rich men more dead against it than they areto have them come promiscuously among the very best people with nothing to distinguish them as dangerous or label them as ought to be avoidedits dreadful its a social evil it ought to be remedied they muzzle dogs in june why cant they label ogres in the season i mustnt send poor little bijou out for a walk in kensington gardens without a string these men ought not to go about in society without restriction a snap of bijous doesnt do half such mischief as a smile of theirs and lady marabout chatted across the stall to his grace of doncaster and entrapped him into purchases of fitting ducal prodigality and smiled on scores of people she didnt know in pleasant pro tempore expediency that had like most expediency in our day its ultimate goal in their purses and pockets and longed for some select gendarmerie to clear williss rooms of her cobra capella and kept an eye all the while on cecil ormsbycecil selling off everything on the stall by sheer force of her bright violet eyes receiving tenpound notes for guinea trifles making her bourse rise as high as she liked courted for a spray of mignonette as entreatingly as ever law was courted in the rue quincampoix for mississippi scrip served by a corps delite in whom she had actually enlisted carruthers goodwood fulke nugent fitzbreguet and plenty of the most desirable and most desired men in town yet of whichoh the obstinacy of women she had actually made chandos cheveley with those wicked little fairy roses in his coat positively the captain and the chief it is enough to break ones heart thought lady marabout wincing under the hautton glance which she saw only the plainer because she wouldnt see it at all and which said with horrible distinctness there is that man who can hardly keep his own cab who floats on society like a pleasureboat without rudder ballast or anchors of whom i have told you in virtuous indignation and christian charity fifty thousand naughty stories who visits that wicked notorious little marechale who belongs to the amandine set who is everything that he ought not and nothing that he ought to be who hasnt a penny he doesnt make by a wellmade bettingbook or a dashedoff magazine articlethere he is flirting all day at your own stall with rosediamonds daughter and you havent the savoir faire the strength of will the tact the proper feeling to stop it to all of which charges lady marabout humbly bent her head metaphorically speaking and writhed in secret under the glance of her ancient enemy while she talked and laughed with the duke of doncaster c petronius talking epicureanisms and witicisms while the lifeblood was ebbing away at every breath was nothing to the suffering and the fortitude of helena lady marabout turning a smiling sunny tranquil countenance to the world in front of her stall while that world could see chandos cheveley admitted behind it i must do something to stop this thought lady marabout with the desperation of a charlotte corday is cheveley going in for the ormsby tin said amandine to eyre lee best thing he could do eh but lady tattersall and the trustees would cut rough i am afraid what does chandos mean with that daughter of rosediamonds wondered her grace annoyedly she had had him some time in her own rose chains and when ladies have driven a lover long in that sort of harness they could doublethong him with all the might of their little hands if they fancy he is trying to break away is chandos cheveley turning fortunehunter i suppose he would like lady cecils money to pay off his ascot losses said mrs marechale with a malicious laugh at ascot the day before he had not gone near her carriage the year before he had driven her down in her mailphaeton what would there be too black to say of him now i must do something to stop this determined lady marabout driving homewards and glancing at cecil ormsby as that young lady lay back in the carriage a little grave and dreamy after her days campaignsigns of the times terrifically ominous to her chaperone skilled in reading such meteorological omens but how was the drag to be put on the wheel that momentous question absorbed lady marabout through her toilette that evening pursued her to dinner haunted her through two soirees kept her wide awake all night woke up with her to her early coffee and flavored the potted tongue and the volaille a la richelieu she took for her breakfast i cant turn the man out of town and i cant tell people to strike him off their visitinglists and i cant shut cecil and myself up in this house as if it were a convent and as to speaking to her it is not the slightest use she has such a way of putting things that one can never deny their truth or reason them away as one can with other girls fond as i am of her shes fearfully difficult to manage still i owe it as a sacred duty to poor rosediamond and the general who says he places such implicit confidence in me to interfere it is my duty it cant be helped i must speak to chandos cheveley himself i have no right to consult my own scruples when so much is at stake valorously determined lady marabout resolved to follow stern moral rules and when right was right to let le diable prendre le fruit to be a perfect woman of the world i take it ladies must weed out early in life all such little contemptible weaknesses as a dislike to wounding other people and a perfect woman of the world therefore lady marabout was not and never would be nohow could she acquire anne hauttons invaluable sneernohow could she imitate that estimable pietists delightful way of dropping little icybarbed sentences under which i have known the bravest to shrink frozen out of her path lady marabout was grieved if she broke the head off a flower needlessly and she could not cure herself of the same lingering folly in disliking to say a thing that pained anybody it is incidental to the de boncoeur bloodcarruthers inherits itand i have seen fellows spared through it whom he could else have withered into the depths of their boots by one of his satirical mots so she did not go to her task of speaking to chandos cheveley armed at all points for the encounter and taking pleasure in feeling the edge of her rapier as lady hautton would have done the cobra was dangerous and must be crushed but lady marabout did not very much relish setting her heel on it it was a glittering terrible muchtobefeared and muchtobeabused serpentbut it might feel all the same you see i dislike the man on principle but i dont want to pain him she thought sighing for the hautton stern savoir faire and achilles impenetrability and goading herself on with the remembrance of duty and general ormsby when the opportunity she had resolved to seek presented itself accidentally at a breakfast at lady george frangipanes toy villa at fulham and she found herself comparatively alone in the rosegarden with cheveley for once without cecils terrible violet eyes upon her will you allow me a few words with you mr cheveley she asked in her blandest mannerthe kindly hypocrite the blow must be dealt but it might as well be softened with a few chloroform fumes and not struck savagely with an ironspiked mace cheveley raised his eyes with me with the greatest pleasure he is a mere fortunehunter i will not spare him i am resolved determined lady marabout as she toyed with her parasolhandle remarked incidentally how unequalled lady george was in roses especially in the tearose and dealt blow no mr cheveley i am going to speak to you very frankly i consider frankness in all things best myself cheveley bowed and smiled slightly i wish he would answer it would make it so much easier he will only look at one with those eyes of his and certainly they are splendid thought lady marabout as she went on quickly on the same principle as the chasseurs indiens approach an abattis at doublequick when lord rosediamond died last year he left as probably you are aware his daughter in my sole care it was a great responsibilityvery greatand i feel of course that i shall have to answer to him for my discharge of it lady marabout didnt say whether rosediamond was accustomed to visit her per medium and hear her account of her stewardship nightly through a tableclaw but we must suppose that he was cheveley bowed again and didnt inquire not being spiritually interested why wont he answer thought lady marabout that i have not been blind to your very marked attention to my dear cecil i think you must be aware mr cheveley and it is on that subject indeed that i wished to speak to me i understand said cheveley as she paused with that faint smile half sad half proud that perplexed lady marabout you are about to insinuate to me gently that those attentions have been exceedingly distasteful to you exceedingly unacceptable in me you would remind me that lady cecil ormsby is a beauty and an heiress and that i am a fortunehunter whose designs are seen through and motives found out you would hint to me that our intercourse must cease is it not so lady marabout cursed with that obstinate illbred unextinguishable weakness for truth incidental and ever fatal to the de boncoeurs couldnt say that it was not what she was going to observe to him but it was exceedingly unpleasant now it was put in such plain uncomplimentary terms to admit to the mans face that she was about to tell him he was a mercenary schemer whose attentions only sprang from a lawless passion for the beaux yeux of cecils cassette she would have told him all that and much more with greatest dignity and effect if he hadnt anticipated her but to have her weapon parried before it was fairly out of its sheath unnerved her arm at the outset what would anne hautton do dear me there never was anybody perpetually placed in such wretched positions as i am thought lady marabout as she played with her parasol and murmured something not very clear relative to responsibility and not desirable two words as infallibly a part of lady marabouts stock in trade as a sneer at the swells is of punchs how she sighed for some cold nonchalant bitter sentence such as the hautton repertoire could have supplied how she scorned herself for her own weakness and lack of severity but she would not have relished hurting a burglars feelings though she had seen him in the very act of stealing her jewelboxes by taxing him with the theft and though the ogre must be crushed the crushing began to give lady marabout neuralgic twinges she was no more able to say the stern things she had rehearsed and resolved upon than she was able to stab him with her parasol or strangle him with her handkerchief i guessed rightly what you were about to say to me said cheveley who seemed somehow or other to have taken all the talk into his own hands and to have become the master of the position i thought so i do not wonder at your construction i cannot blame you for your resolution lady cecil has some considerable fortune they say it is very natural that you should have imagined a man like myself with no wealth save a good name which only serves to make lack of wealth more conspicuous incapable of seeking her society for any better higher more disinterested motive than that of her money it was not charitable perhaps to decide unhesitatingly that it was impossible i could be drawn to her by any other attraction that it was imperative i must be dead to everything in her that gives her a nobler and a higher charm but it was very natural and one learns never to hope for the miracle of a charitable judgment even from lady marabout my dear mr cheveley indeed you mistake began lady marabout restlessly that was a little bit of a story he didnt mistake at all but lady marabout collapsing like an indiarubber ball under the prick of a sarcasm shivered all over at his words his voice his slight sad smile the man is as dreadful as cecil she thought he puts things so horribly clearly mistake i do not think i do you have thought all this and very naturally but now hear me for a moment i have sought lady cecils society that is perfectly true we have been thrown together in society very often accidentally sometimes i admit through my own seeking few men could be with her and be steeled against her i have been with her too much but i sought her at first carelessly then irresistibly and unconsciously never with the motive you attribute to me i am not as utterly beggared as you deem me but neither am i entirely barren of honor believe me lady marabout my pride alone would be amply sufficient to raise a barrier between me and cecil stronger than any that could be opposed to me by others yesterday i casually overheard words from amandine which showed me that society like you has put but one construction on the attention i have paid hera construction i might have foreseen had i not been unconsciously fascinated and forgetful for the time of the infallible whispers of my kind friends her fortune i know was never numbered among her attractions for me so little that now that amandines careless words have reminded me of the verdict of society i shall neither seek her nor see her again scores of men marry women for their money and their money alone but i am not one of them with my own precarious fortunes only escaping ruin because i am not rich enough to tempt ruin i would never take advantage of any interest i may have excited in her to speak to her of a passion that the world would tell her was only another name for avarice and selfishness i dare not trust myself with her longer perhaps i am no god to answer for my selfcontrol but you need not fear i will never seek her lovenever even tell her of mine i shall leave town tomorrow what i may suffer matters not lady cecil is safe from me whatever you may have heard of my faults follies or vices none ever told you i think that i broke my word and when the man said that my dear philip i assure you i felt as guilty as if i had done him some horrible wrong he stood there with his head up looking at me with his sad proud eyesand they are beautifultill positively i could almost have criedi could indeed for though i dont like him on principle i couldnt help pitying him said lady marabout in a subsequent relation of the scene to her son wasnt it a terrible position i was as near as possible forgetting everything due to poor rosediamond and saying to him that i believed cecil liked him and would never like anybody else but thank heaven i remembered myself and checked myself in time if it had been anybody but chandos cheveley i should really have admired him he spoke so nobly when he lifted his hat and left me though i ought to have been glad and i was glad of course that cecil would be free from the society of anybody so objectionable and so dangerous i felt wretched for himi did indeed it is so hard always to be placed in such miserable positions by which you will perceive that the triumphant crushing of lady marabouts cobra didnt afford her the unmixed gratification she had anticipated i have done what was my duty to poor rosediamond and what general ormsbys confidence merited she solaced herself that day feeling uncomfortably and causelessly guilty she hardly knew why when she saw chandos cheveley keeping sedulously with the amandine set and read in cecils telltale face wonder perplexity and regret thereat till the frangipane fete came to an end she had appeased the manes of the late rosediamond who to her imagination always appeared sitting up aloft keeping watch over the discharge of her chaperones duties but she had a secret and horrible dread that she had excited the wrath of rosediamonds daughter she had driven her ogre off the scene it is true but she could not feel that she had altogether come off the best in the contest anne hautton had congratulated her indeed on having acted with decision at last but then she had marred it all by asking if carruthers was likely to be engaged to cecil and lady marabout had been forced to confess he was not philip when pressed by her that very morning to be a little attentive to cecil having shaken his head and laughed shes a bewitching creature mother but she dont bewitch me you know what shakspeare says of wooing wedding and repentance ive no fancy for the inseparable trio altogether lady marabout was far from peace and tranquillity though the cobra was crushed as she drove away from the frangipane breakfast and she was little nearer them when cecil turned her eyes upon her with a question worse to lady marabouts ear than the roar of a lancaster battery what have you said to him my dear cecil what have i said to whom returned lady marabout with machiavellian surprise you know well enough lady marabout what have you said to himto mr cheveley cecils impetuosity invariably knocked lady marabout down at one blow as a ball knocks down the pegs at lawn billiards she rallied after the shock but not successfully and tried at coldness and decision as recommended by hautton prescriptions my dear cecil i have said to him what i think it my duty to say to him responsible as i am for you responsible for me lady marabout indeed you are not i am responsible for myself interrupted lady cecil with that haughty arch of her eyebrows and that flush on her face before which lady marabout was powerless what have you said to him i will know i said very little to him indeed my dear he said it all himself what did he say himself i must tell hershe is so dreadfully persistent thought the unhappy and badgered peeress and tell her she did being a means of lessening the young ladys interest in the subject of discussion as little judicious as she could well have hit upon lady cecil listened silent for once shading her face with her parasol shading the tears that gathered on her lashes and rolled down her delicate flushed cheeks at the recital of chandos cheveleys words from her chaperones sight lady marabout gathered courage from the tranquillity with which her recital was heard you see my love chandos cheveleys own honor points in the same direction with my judgment she wound up in conclusion he has acted rightly at last i allow and if youif you have for the moment felt a tinge of warmer interest in himif you have been taken by the fascination of his manner and invested him with a young girls romance you will soon see with us how infinitely better it is that you should part and how impossible it is that lady cecils eyes flashed such fire through their tears that lady marabout stopped collapsed and paralyzed it is by such advice as that you repay his nobility his generosity his honorit is by such words as those you reward him for acting as not one man in a hundred would have acted hush hush lady marabout i thought better of you good heavens where will it end thought lady marabout distractedly as rosediamonds wayward daughter sprang down at the door with a flush in her face and a contemptuous anger in her eyes that made bijou jumping on her stop stare and whine in canine dismay and i fancied she was listening passively thought lady marabout well the man is gone today that is one comfort i am very thankful i acted as i did reasoned that everworried lady in her boudoir the next morning i am afraid cecil is really very fond of him there were such black shadows under her eyes at breakfast poor child but it is much better as it ismuch better i should never have held up my head again if i had allowed her to make such a disadvantageous alliance i can hardly bear to think of what would have been said even now the danger is over while lady marabout was thus comforting herself over her embroidery silks cecil ormsby was pacing into the park with old twitters the groom ten yards behind her taking her early ride before the world was upit was only eleven oclock cecil had been used to early rising and would never leave it off having discovered some recipe that made her independent of ordinary mortals quantum of sleep surely he will be here this morning to see me for the last time thought that young lady as she paced up the new ride under the kensington gardens trees with her heart beating quickly under the gold aiglettes of her ridingjacket i must see her once more and then thought chandos cheveley as he leaned against the rails smoking as he had done scores of mornings before his man had packed his things his hansom was waiting at the gates to take him to the station and his portmanteau was lettered ischl he had only come to take one last look of the face that haunted him as no other had ever succeeded in doing the ring of a horses hoof fell on his ear there she came on her roan hack with the sun glancing off her chestnut hair he looked up to bow to her as she passed on for the ride had never been a rendezvous for more than a bow cecils insurrectionary tactics had always been carried on before lady marabouts face but the roan was pulled up by him that morning for the very first time and cecils eyes fell on him through their lashes mr cheveleyis it true you are going out of town quite true if her voice quivered as she asked the question he barely kept his own from doing the same as he answered it will you be gone long till next season at earliest his promise to lady marabout was hard to keep he would not have trusted his strength if he had known she would have done more than canter on with her usual bow and smile cecil was silent the groom waited like a statue his ten yards behind them she played with her reins nervously the color coming and going painfully in her face lady marabout told me ofof some conversation you had with her yesterday low as the words were cheveley heard them and his hand as it lay on the rails shook like a girls cecil was silent again she looked at him her eyes full of unshed tears as the color burned in her face and she drooped her head almost to a level with her hands as they played with the reins she told meyou she stopped again cecil was new to making proposals though not to rejecting them cheveley set his teeth to keep in the words that rushed to his lips and cecil saw the struggle as she bent her head lower and lower to the saddle and twisted the reins into a gordian knot do youmust wewhy should fragmentary monosyllables enough but sufficient to fell his strength for gods sake do not tempt me he muttered you little know i know all she whispered softly you cannot my worthless lifemy honor i could not take such a sacrifice i would not butif my peace she could not end her phrase yet it said enoughhis hand closed on hers your peace good god in my hands i stay thenlet the world say what it likes drive back i have changed my mind about going abroad today said cheveley as he got into his hansom at albert gate how soon she has got over it girls do thought lady marabout as cecil ormsby came in from her ride with the brightest bloom on her cheeks a june breeze ever fanned there she laid her hat on the table flung her gauntlets at bijou and threw herself on her knees by lady marabout a saucy smile on her face though her lashes were wet dear lady marabout i can forgive you now but you will never forgive me lady marabout turned white as her pointlace cap gave a little gasp of paralyzed terror and pushed back her chair as though a shell had exploded on the hearthrug cecil good heavenyou dont mean yes i do said cecil with a fresh access of color and a low soft laugh lady marabout gasped again for breath general ormsby was all she could ejaculate general ormsby what of him did you ever know uncle johnnie refuse to please me and if my money be to interfere with my happiness and not promote it as i conceive it its duty and purpose to do why i am of age in july you know and i shall make a deed of gift of it all to the soldiers home or the wellington college and there is only one person who will care for me then lady cecil was quite capable of carrying her threat into execution and lady cecil had her own way accordingly as she had had it from her babyhood i shall never hold up my head again and what a horrible triumph for anne hautton i am always the victimalways said lady marabout that day two months when the last guest at cecil ormsbys wedding dejeuner had rolled away from the house a girl who might have married anybody philip she refused twenty offers this seasonshe did indeed it is heartbreaking say what you like you neednt laugh it is why did i offer them fernditton for this month you say if i didnt countenance the alliance nonsense that is nothing to the purpose of course i seemed to countenance it to a degree for cecils sake and i admire chandos cheveley i confess at least i should do if i didnt dislike his class on principle but say what you like philip it is the most terrible thing that could have happened for me those men ought to be labelled or muzzled or done something with and not be let loose on society as they are he has a noble nature you say i dont say anything against his nature she worships him well i know she does what is that to the point he will make her happy i am sure he will he has the gentlest way with her possible but how does that console me think what you feel when an outsider as you call it beats all the favorites upsets all your bettingbooks and carries off the doncaster cup and then realize if youve any humanity in you what we feel under such a trial as this is to me only to think what anne hautton will always say lady marabout is not the only person to whom the first thought the most dreaded ghost the ghastliest skeleton the direst aggravation the sharpest daggerthrust under all troubles is the remembrance of that one omnipotent ogrequen diraton laugh at her mother counselled carruthers and amis lecteurs i pass on his advice to you as the best and sole bowstring for strangling the ogre in question which is the grimmest we have in all bogeydom lady marabouts troubles or the worries of a chaperone in three seasons season the thirdthe climax my dear philip the most unfortunate thing has happened said lady marabout one morning really the greatest contretemps that could have occurred i suppose i never am to be quiet whats the row now madre carissima asked her son it is no row but it is an annoyance you have heard me speak of my poor dear friend mrs montolieu you know she married unhappily poor thing to a dreadful creature something in a west india regimentnobody at all it is very odd and it is very wrong and there must be a great mistake somewhere but certainly most marriages are unhappy and yet you are always recommending the institution what an extraordinary obstinacy and opticism my dear mother i suppose you do it on the same principle as nurses recommend children nasty medicines or as old levett used to tender me dry biscuit sans confiture tisnt so nice as marmalade i know master philip but then dear its so wholesome hold your tongue philip cried lady marabout i dont mean it in that sense at all and you know i dont if poor lilla montolieu is unhappy i am sure it is all her abominable odious husbands fault she is the sweetest creature possible but she has a daughter and concerning that daughter she wrote to me about a month ago andi never was more vexed in my lifeshe wants me to bring her out this season a victim again my poor dear mother you certainly deserve a belgravian testimonial you shall have a statue set up in lowndes square commemorative of the heroic endurance of a chaperones existence subscribed for gratefully by the girls you married well and penitentially by the girls you couldnt marry at all lady marabout laughed a little but sighed again it is fun to you but it is death to me as the women say when we flirt with them interpolated carruthers you see poor dear lilla didnt know what to do there she is in that miserable island with the unpronounceable name that the man is governor of shut out of all society with nobody to marry this girl to if she had her there except their secretary or a west indian planter of course no mother would ruin her daughters prospects and take her into such an outoftheworld corner she knew no one so well as myself and so to me she applied she is the sweetest creature i would do anything to oblige or please her but i cant help being very sorry she has pounced upon me and i dont the least know what this girl is like not even whether she is presentable i dare say she was petted and spoiled in that lazy luxurious tropical life when she was little and she has been brought up the last few years in a convent in france the very last education i should choose for a girl fancy if i should find her an ignorant unformed hoyden or a lethargic overgrown child or an artificial french girl who goes to confession every day and carries on twenty undiscoverable love affairsfancy if she should be ugly or awkward or brusque or gauche as ten to one she will befancy if i find her utterly unpresentablewhat in the world shall i do decline her suggested carruthers i wouldnt have a horse put in my tilbury that id never seen and risk driving a spavined walleyed underbred brute through the park and i suppose the ignominy of the debut would be to you much what the ignominy of such a turnout would be to me decline her i cant my dear philip i agreed to have her a month ago i have never seen you to tell you till now you know youve been so sworn to newmarket all through the spring meetings decline her she comes tonight comes tonight laughed carruthers all is lost then we shall see the countess of marabout moving through london society with a west indian who has a skin like othello has as much idea of manners as a housemaid that suddenly turns out an heiress and is invited by people to whom she yesterday carried up their hot water reflects indelible disgrace on her chaperone by gaucheries unparalleled throws glass or silver missiles at soamess head when he doesnt wait upon her at luncheon to her liking as she has been accustomed to do at the negroes philip pray dont cried lady marabout piteously or we shall welcome under the marabout wing a young lady fresh from convent walls and pensionnaire flirtations who astonishes a dinnerparty by only taking the first course on the score of jours maigres and conscientious scruples who is visited by reverends peres from farm street and fills your drawingroom with high church curates whom she tries to draw over from their mothers to their sisters open arms who goes every day to early morning mass instead of taking an early morning canter and who when invited to sing at a soiree musicale begins sancta maria adorata philip dont cried lady marabout bark at him bijou the heartless man it is as likely as not little montolieu may realize one of your horrible sketches ah philip you dont know what the worries of a chaperone are thank heaven no laughed carruthers it is easy to make a joke of it and very tempting i dare sayones woes always are amusing to other people they dont feel the smart themselves and only laugh at the grimace it forces from onebut i can tell you philip it is anything but a pleasant prospect to have to go about in society with a girl one may be ashamed ofi dont know anything more trying i would as soon wear paste diamonds as introduce a girl that is not perfectly good style but why not have thought of all this in time lady marabout sank back in her chair and curled bijous ears with a sigh my dear philip if everybody always thought of things in time would there be any follies committed at all its precisely because repentance comes too late that repentance is such a horrible wasp with such a merciless sting besides could i refuse poor lilla montolieu unhappy as she is with that bear of a man i never felt more anxious in my life thought lady marabout as she sat before the fire in her drawingroomit was a chilly april daystirring the cream into her preprandial cup of tea resting one of her small satinslippered feet on bijous back while the firelight sparkled on the dresden figures the statuettes the fifty thousand costly trifles in which the marabout rooms equalled any in belgravia i never felt more anxiousnot on any of philips dreadful yachting expeditions nor even when he went on that perilous exploring tour into arabia deserta i do think if she should be unpresentableand then poor dear lillas was not much of a match and the girl will not have a sou she tells me frankly i can hardly hope to do anything for her there is one thing she will not be a responsibility like valencia or cecil and what would have been a bad match for them will be a good one for her she must accept the first offer made her if she have any at all which will be very doubtful few benedicts bow to beatrices nowadays unless beatrice is a good investment as they call it she will soon be here that is the carriage now stopped i do think how anxious i feel really it cant be worse for a turkish bridegroom never to see his wifes face till after the ceremony than it is for one not to have seen a girl till one has to introduce her if she shouldnt be good style and lady marabouts heart palpitated possibly prophetically as she set down her little sevres cup and rose out of her armchair with bijou shaking his silver collar and bells to welcome the new inmate of lowndes square with her sunny smile and her kindly voice and her soft beaming eyes which as i have often stated would have made lady marabout look amiable at an abruzzi bandit who had demanded her purse or an executioner who had led her out to capital punishment and now made her radiate warm and bright on a guest whose advent she dreaded hypocrisy you say not a bit of it hypocrisy may be eminently courteous but take my word for it its never cordial there are natures who throw such golden rays around them naturally as there are others who think brusquerie and acidity cardinal virtues and deal them out as points of conscience are there not sunbeams that shine kindly alike on fragrant violet tufts and barren brambles velvet lawns and muddy trottoirs are there not hailclouds that send jagged points of ice on all the world pelemele as mercilessly on the broken rose as on the granite boulder she is good style thank heaven thought lady marabout as she went forward with her white soft hands their jewels flashing in the light outstretched in welcome my dear child how much you are like your mother you must let me be fond of you for her sake first and thenfor your own the conventional thought did not make the cordial utterance insincere the two ran in coupleswe often drive such pairs every one of usand if they entail insincerity veritas vale madre mia i called to inquire if you have survived the anxiety of last night and to know what jeune sauvage or feir religieuse you may have had sent you for the galvanizing of belgravia said carruthers paying his accustomed visit in his mothers boudoir and throwing macaroons at bijous nose my dear philip i hardly know she puzzles me shes what if she were a man i should classify as a detrimental is she awkward not in the least perfect manners wherever she learned them brusque soft as a gazelle very like her mother brown fair as that statuette with a beautiful bloom lovely gold hair too and hazel eyes what are the shortcomings then there are none and its that that puzzles me shes been six years in that convent and yet i do assure you her style is perfect shes hardly eighteen but shes the air of the best society she isawell almost nobody as people rank now you know for poor dear lillas marriage was not what she should have made but the girl might be a royal dukes daughter for manner a premature artificial femme du monde bah nothing more odious said carruthers poising a macaroon on pandores nose make readypresentfire theres a good dog no nothing of that sort very natural frank vivacious nothing artificial about her very charming indeed but she might be a young countess the queen of a monde rather than a young girl just out of a french convent and you know my dear philip that sort of wit and nonchalance may be admirable for cecil cheveley assured of her position but theyre dangerous to a girl like this flora montolieu they will make people remark her and ask who she is and try to pull her to pieces if they dont find her somebody they dare not hit i would much rather she were of the general pattern pleasing but nothing remarkable wellbred but nothing to envy thoroughly educated but monosyllabic in society such a girl as that passes among all the rest suits mediocre men and the majority of men are mediocre you know my dear philip and pleases women because she is a nice girl and no rival but this little montolieu and lady marabout sighed with a prescience of coming troubles while carruthers laughed and rose will worry your life out i must go for i have to sit in courtmartial at two for a mere trifle a deuced bore to us but le service oblige so i shall escape introduction to your little montolieu today why will you fill your house with girls my dear motherit is fifty times more agreeable when you are reigning alone henceforth i cant come in to lunch with you without going through the formula of a mild flirtationwomen think you so illnatured if you dont flirt a little with them that amiable men like myself havent strength of mind to refuse you should keep your house an open sanctuary for me when you know ive no other in london except when i retreat into whites and the u s she puzzles me pondered lady marabout as despreaux disrobed her that night i always am to be puzzled i think i never can have one of those quiet mediocre wellmannered remarkablefornothing girls who have no idiosyncrasies and give nobody any trouble one marries them safely to some secondrate man nobody admires them and nobody dislikes them theyre to society what neutral tint is among bodycolors or rather what grays are among dresses inoffensive unimpeachable always look ladylike but never look brilliant colorless dresses are very useful and so are characterless girls and i dare say the draper would tell us the grays in the long run are the easiest to sell as the girls are to marry they please the commonplace taste of the generality and do for everyday wear flora montolieu puzzles me she is very charming very striking very lovable but she puzzles me i have a presentiment that that child will give me a world of anxiety an infinitude of trouble and lady marabout laid her head on her pillow not the happier that flora montolieu was lying asleep in the room next her dreaming of the wildvine shadows and the nightblooming flowers of her native tropics under the rosecurtains of her new home in lowndes square already a burden on the soul and a responsibility on the mind of that homes most genial and generous mistress if she were a man i should certainly call her a detrimental said lady marabout after a more deliberate study of her charge you know my dear philip the sort of man one call detrimental attractive enough to do a great deal of damage and ineligible enough to make the damage very unacceptable handsome and winning but a younger son or a something nobody wants a delightful flirtation but a terrible alliance you know what i mean well that is just what this little montolieu is in our sex i am quite sure it is what she will be considered and if it be bad for a man it is very much worse for a woman everybody will admire her and nobody will marry her i have a presentiment of it with which prophetical melange of the glorious and the inglorious for her charges coming career lady marabout sighed and gave a little shiver such as sous des maux ignores nous fait gemir davance as delphine gay well phrased it and she floated out of her boudoir to the diningroom for luncheon at which unformal and pleasant meal carruthers chanced to stay criticise a new dry sherry and take a look at this unsalable young filly of the marabout yearling sales i dont know about her being detrimental mother nor about her being little she in more than middle height laughed he but i vow she is the prettiest thing youve had in your list for some time youve had much greater beauties you say well perhaps so but i bet you any money she will make a sensation im sure she will reiterated lady marabout despairingly i have no doubt she will have a brilliant season there is something very piquante taking and uncommon about her but who will marry her at the end of it carruthers shouted with laughter heaven forbid that i should attempt to prophesy i would undertake as readily to say wholl be the owner of the winner of the oaks ten years hence i can tell you who wont yourself because youll never marry anybody at all cried lady marabout well i must say i should not wish you to renounce your misogamistic notions here the montolieus are not at all what you should look for and a child like flora would be excessively ill suited to you if i could see you married as i should desire to some woman of weight and dignity five or sixandtwenty fit for you in every way de grace de grace my dear mother the mere sketch will kill me if you insist on finishing it be reasonable can anything be more comfortable more tranquil than i am now i swing through life in a rockingchair if im a trifle bored now and then its my heaviest trial i float as pleasantly on the waves of london life in my way as the lotuseaters of poetry on the ganges in theirs and youd have the barbarity to introduce into my complacent existence the sting of matrimony the phosphorus of hymens torch the symbolical serpent of a weddingringfor shame lady marabout laughed despite herself and the solemnity in her eyes of the subject i should like to see you happily married for all that though i quite despair of it now but perhaps you are right of course i am right adam was tranquil and unworried till fate sent him a wife and he was typical of the destinies of his descendants those who are wise take warning those who are not neglect it and repent lady hautton et cie are very fond of twisting scriptural obscurities into types theres a type plain as day and salutary to mankind if detrimental to women philip you are abominable dont be so wicked cried lady marabout enjoying it all the more because she was a little shocked at it as your best women will on occasion human nature is human nature everywhere and the female heart gives pleasurable little pulses at the sight of forbidden fruits now as in the days of eve whos that miss montolieu with your mother this year phil dozens of men asked carruthers that season across the messtable in the smokingroom of the guards in the ride or the ring in the doorways of ballrooms or anywhere where suchlike questions are asked and new pretty women discussed what is it in her that takes so astonishingly wondered lady marabout who is like most women orthodox on all points loving things by rule worrying if they go out of the customary routine and was therefore quite incapable of reconciling herself to so revolutionary a fact as a young lady being admired who was not a beauty and sought while she was detrimental in every way it was out of the general rule and your orthodox people hate anything out of the general run as they hate their prosperous friends the force of hatred can no further go flora montolieus crime in belgravia was much akin to the bonapartes crimes to the bourbons thrones must be filled legitimately if not worthily in the eyes of the orthodox people and this petit caporal of lady marabouts had no business to reign where the hereditary princesses and all the other noble lines failed to sway the sceptre lady marabout belonging to the noble lines herself agreed in her heart with them and felt a little bit guilty to have introduced this democratic and unwelcome element in society flora montolieu took as people say of bubble companies meaning that they will pleasantly ruin a million or two or of new fashions meaning that they will become general with the many and sequitur unwearable with the few she had the brilliance and grace of one of her own tropical flowers with something piquante and attractive about her that one had to leave nameless but that was all the more charming for that very fact perhaps full of life and animation but soft as a gazelle as her chaperone averred not characterless as lady marabout fondly desired on the same principle i suppose as a timid whip likes a horse as spiritless as a ridingschool hack but gifted with plenty of very marked character so much indeed that it rather puzzled her cameriste girls shouldnt have marked character they should be clay that one can mould not a selfchiselled statuette that will only go into its own niche and wont go into any other this little montolieu would make just such a woman as vittoria colonna or madame de sable but one doesnt want those qualities in a girl who is but a single little ear in the wheatsheaf of society and whom one wants to marry off but cant expect to marry well her poor mother of course will look to me to do something advantageous for her and i verily believe she is that sort of girl that will let me do nothing thought lady marabout already beginning to worry as she talked to lady george frangipane at a breakfast in palace gardens and watched flora montolieu with carruthers on her left and goodwood on her right amusing them both to all semblance and holding her own to the lady hauttons despite who held their own so excessively chillily and loftily that no ordinary mortals cared to approach them but beholding them thought involuntarily of the stately icebergs off the spitzbergen coast only that the icebergs could melt or explode when their time came and the time was never known when the hautton surface could be moved to anger or melt to any sunshine whatever at least whether their maids or their mother ever beheld the first of the phenomena far be it from me to say but the world never saw either well miss montolieu how do you like our life here carruthers was asking which is preferablebelgravia or st denis oh belgravia decidedly laughed lady marabouts charge i think your life charming all change excitement gayety who would not like it nobodythat is not fresh to it fresh to it ah are you one of the class who find no beauty in anything unless it is new if so do not charge the blame on to the thing as your tone implies take it rather to yourself and your own fickleness perhaps i do smiled carruthers but whether ones self or the thing is to blame the results much the samesatiety wait till you have had two or three seasons and then tell me if you find this millwheel routine these circus gyrations so delightful we are the performing stud who go round and round in the hippodrome day after day for show till we are sick of the whole programme knowing our white stars are but a daub of paint and our gay spangles only tinfoil you are a little pony just joined to the troupe and just pleased with the glitter of the arena wait till youve had a few years of it before you say whether going through the same hoops and passing over the same sawdust is so very amusing if i do not i shall desert the troupe and form a circus of my own less mechanical and more enjoyable il faut souffrir pour etre belle il faut souffrir encore plus pour etre a la mode said goodwood on her right while lady egidia hautton thought how bold that little montolieu is and her sister lady feodorowna wondered what her cousin goodwood could see there i do not see the necessity interrupted flora and i certainly would never bow to the il faut i would make fashion follow me i would not follow fashion that child talks as though she were the duchess of amandine thought lady marabout catching fragmentary portions across the table the marabout oral and oracular organs being always conveniently multiplied when she was armed cap a pie as a chaperone sir philip you talk as if you belonged to the nothingisnew and nothingistrue and itdontsignify class i should have thought you were above the nil admirari affectation he admires as we all do when we find something that compels our homage said goodwood with an emphasis that would have made the hearts of any of the hereditary princesses palpitate with gratification but at which the ungrateful petit caporal only glanced at him a little surprisedly with her large hazel eyes as though she by no means saw the point of the speech carruthers laughed nil admirari oh no i enjoy life but then it is thanks to the clubs my yacht my cigarcase my stud a thousand thingsnot thanks at all to belgravia complimentary to the belgraviennes cried flora with a shrug of her shoulders they have not known how to amuse you then ladies never do amuse us sighed carruthers tant pis pour nous are you going to lady patchoulis this evening asked goodwood i believe we are i think lady marabout said so then i shall exert myself and go too it will be a terrible boreballs always are but to waltz with you i will try to encounter it flora montolieu arched her eyebrows and gave him a little disdainful glance lord goodwood do not be so sure that i shall waltz at all with you if you take vanity for wit i cannot accept discourtesy as compliment well hit little lady thought carruthers with a mental bravissima what a speech thought lady marabout across the table as shocked as though a footman had dropped a cascade of iced hock over her you got it for once goodwood laughed carruthers as they drove away in his tilbury you never had such a sharp brush as that by jove no positively it was quite a new sensationrefreshing indeed one grows so tired of the women who agree with one eternally shes charming on my word who is she phil in an heraldic sense i mean my dear child what could possess you to answer lord goodwood like that cried lady marabout as her barouche rolled down palace gardens possess me the demon of mischief i suppose but my love it was a wonderful compliment from him was it i do not see any compliment in those vain impertinent brummelian amourpropreisms i must coin the word there is no good one to express it but my dear flora you know he is the marquis of goodwood the duke of doncasters son it is not as if he were a boy in the lancers or an unfledged petit maitre from the foreign office were he her majestys son he should not gratify his vanity at my expense if he expected me to be flattered by his condescension he mistook me very much he has been allowed to adopt that tone i suppose but from a man to a woman a chivalrous courtesy is due though the man be an emperor perhaps soof course but that is their tone nowadays my love and you cannot alter it i always say the regencymen inaugurated it and their sons and grandsons outherod herod but to turn a tide or be a wit with impunity a woman wants to occupy a prominent and unassailable position were you the duchess of amandine you might say that sort of thing but a young girl just out must notindeed she must not the hauttons heard you and the hauttons are very merciless people perfectly bred themselves and pitiless on the least infringement of the convenances besides ten to one you may have gained goodwoods illwill and he is a man whose word has immense weight i assure you i do not see anything remarkable in him to give him weight said the literal and unimpressible little montolieu he is a commonplace person to my taste neither so brilliant nor so handsome by a great deal as many gentlemen i seeas sir philip for instance lady marabout an my son no my love he is not very few men have philips talents and person said lady marabout consciously mollified and propitiated but going on nevertheless with a spartan impartiality highly laudable goodwoods rank however is much higher than philips at least it stands so though really the carruthers are by far the older dating as far back as ethelbert ii while the doncaster family are literally unknown till the fourteenth century when gervaise dascotte received the acolade before ascalon from godfrey de bouillon goodwood has great weight my dear in the best circles a compliment from him is a great compliment to any woman and the sort of answer you gave him must have been a great treat to him dear lady marabout if every one is in the habit of kowtowing before him princes you know are never so happy as when they can have a little bit of nature and my speech must have been as refreshing to lord goodwood as the breath of his bearnese breezes and the freedom of his pyrenean forests were to henri quatre after the court etiquette and the formal ceremonial of paris i dont know about its being a treat to him my dear it was more likely to be a showerbath and your illustration isnt to the point the bearnese breezes were henri quatres native air and might be pleasant to him but the figurative ones are not goodwoods and i am sure cannot please him but lady marabout i do not want to please him persisted the young lady perversely i dont care in the least what he thinks or what he says of me dear me how oddly things go thought lady marabout there was valencia one of the proudest girls in england his equal in every way an acknowledged beauty who would have said the dust on the trottoir was diamonds and worn turquoises on azureline or emeralds on rose i verily believe if such opticisms and gaucheries had been goodwoods taste and here is this childfor whom the utmost one can do will be to secure a younger son out of the civil service or a country membercannot be made to see that he is of an atom more importance than soames or mason and treats him with downright nonchalant indifference what odd anomalies one sees in everything who is that young lady with you this season lady hautton asked smiling that acidulated smile with which that amiable saint always puts long questions to you of which she knows the answer would be peine forte et dure not the daughter of that horrid john montolieu who did all sorts of dreadful things and was put into a west india regiment indeed that man dear me married the sister of your incumbent at fernditton ah reallyvery singular but how do you come to have brought out the daughter at all of which remarks lady marabout winced and felt painfully guilty of a gross democratic dereliction from legitimate and beaten paths conscious of having sinned heavily in the eyes of the world and lady hautton by bringing within the sacred precincts of belgravia the daughter of a mauvais sujet in a west india corps and a sister of a perpetual curate the world was a terrible dragon to lady marabout to her imagination it always appeared an incarnated and omniscient bugbear arguseyed and with all its hundred eyes relentlessly fixed on her spying out each item of her shortcomings every little flaw in the marabout diamonds any spurmade tear in her honiton flounces any crease in her train at a drawingroom any lesemajeste against the royal rule of conventionalities any glissade on the polished oak floor of society though like a good many other people she often worried herself needlessly the flaws tears creases high treasons and false glissades being fifty to one too infinitesimal or too unimportant to society for one of the hundred eyes vigilant and unwinking though i grant they are to take note of them the world was a terrible bugbear to lady marabout and its special impersonation was anne hautton she disliked anne hautton she didnt esteem her she knew her to be a narrow censorious prejudiced and strongly malicious lady but she was the personification of the world to lady marabout and had weight and terror in consequence lady marabout is not the first person who has burnt incense and bowed in fear before a little miserable clay image she cordially despised for no better reasonfor the selfsame reason indeed she evidently thinks i ought not to have brought flora out and perhaps i shouldnt though poor little thing it seems very hard she may not enjoy societyfitted for society too as she isjust because her father is in a west india regiment and poor lilla was only a clergymans daughter goodwood really seems to admire her i can never forgive him for his heartless flirtation with valencia but if he were to be won by a montolieu what would the hauttons say and sitting against the wall with others of her sisterhood at a ball a glorious and golden vision rose up before lady marabouts eyes if the unknown unwelcome revolutionary little montolieu should go in and win where the lady hauttons had tried and failed through five seasonsif this little tropical flower should be promoted to the doncaster conservatory where all the stately stephanotises of the peerage had vainly aspired to bloomif this petit caporal should be crowned with the doncaster diadem that all the legitimate rulers had uselessly schemed to place on their brows the soul of lady marabout rose elastic at the bare prospectit would be a great triumph for a chaperone as for a general to conquer a valuable position with a handful of boy recruits if it should be anne hautton would have nothing to say after that and lady marabout though she was the most amiable lady in christendom was not exempt from a feeling of longing for a stone to roll to the door of her enemys stronghold or a flourish of trumpets to silence the boastful and triumphant fanfare that was perpetually sounding at sight of her defeats from her opponents ramparts wild visionary guiltily scheming sinfully revolutionary seemed such a project in her eyes still how tempting it would be a terrible blow to valencia whod tried for goodwood fruitlessly to be eclipsed by this unknown flora it would be a terrible blow to their graces of doncaster who held nobody good enough heraldically speaking for their heirapparent to see him give the best coronet in england to a bewitching little interloper sans money birth or rank they wouldnt like it of course i shouldnt like it for philip for instance though shes a very sweet little thing all the ascottes would be very vexed and all the valletorts would never forgive it but it would be such a triumph over anne hautton pondered lady marabout and the last clause carried the day did you ever know private pique fail to carry the day over public charity and lady marabout glanced with a glow of prospective triumph which though erring to her order was delicious to her individuality at goodwood waltzing with the little montolieu a suspicious number of times while lady egidia hautton was condemned to his young brother seton ascotte and lady feodorowna danced positively with nobody better than their own county member originally a scion of goodwoods bankers could the force of humiliation further go lady hautton sat smiling and chatting but the tiara on her temples was a figurative thorn crown and othellos occupation was gone when a ladys daughters are dancing with an unavailable cadet of twenty and a parvenu only acceptable in the last extremities of despair what good is it for her to watch the smiles and construe the attentions we shall see who triumphs now thought lady marabout with a glow of pleasure for which her heart reproached her a moment afterwards it is very wrong she thought if those poor girls dont marry one ought to pity them and as for hergoing through five seasons with a fresh burden of responsibility leaving the schoolroom and added on your hands each year must sour the sweetest temper it would do mine i am sure i dare say if i had had daughters i should have been ten times more worried even than i am which she would have been undoubtedly and the eligibles on her visitinglist ten times more too men wouldnt have voted the marabout dinners and soirees so pleasant as they did under the sway of that sunshiny hostess if there had been lady maudes and lady marys to exact attention and lay mines under the auxerre carpets and mantraps among the epergne flowers of lowndes square nor would lady marabout have been the same the sunshine couldnt have shone so brightly nor the milk of roses flowed so mildly under the weight and wear of marriageable but unmarried daughters the sunshine would have been fitful the milk of roses curdled at best and no wonder those poor women they have so much to go through in the world and play but such a monotonous role taken at its most brilliant and best from first to last from cradle to grave from the berceaunettes in which they commence their existence to the mausoleum in which they finish it if they do get a little bit soured when they have finished their own game and have to sit at the cardtables wide awake however weary vigilant however drowsy alert however bored to death superintending the hands of the fresh players surreptitiously suggesting means for securing the tricks keeping a dragons eye out for revokes and bearing all the brunt of the blame if the rubber be lostif they do get a little bit soured who can after all greatly wonder thats a very brilliant little thing that girl montolieu said goodwood driving over to hornsey wood the morning after with carruthers and some other men in his drag a deuced pretty waltzer said st lys of the bays turn her round in a square foot and looks very well in the saddle sits her horse better than any woman in the ride except rosalie rosiere and as she came from the cirque olympique originally one dont count her said fulke nugent i do like a woman to ride well i must say i promised your mother to take a look at the marabout yearling sale phil if ever i wanted the neverdesirable and everburdensome article she has to offer and if anything could tempt me to pay the price she asks i think it would be that charming montolieu shes the best thing lady tattersall ever had on hand said goodwood drawing his whip over his offwheelers back you know philgently gently coronetwhat spoilt your handsome cousin was as i said that it was all mechanism perfect mechanism i admit but all artificial prearranged put together wound up to smile in this place bow in that and frown in the other clockwork every inch of it nowsoho zouave confound you wont you be quietlittle montolieu hasnt a bit of artifice about her tisnt only that you dont know what shes going to say but that she doesnt either and whether its a smile or a frown a jest or a reproof its what the moment brings out not whats planned beforehand the hard hit you had the other day seems to have piqued your interest said carruthers smoothing a loose leaf of his manilla naturally the girl didnt care a button about my compliment i only said it to try her and the plucky answer she gave me amused me immensely anything unartificial and frank is as refreshing as hockandseltzer after a fielddayone likes it dont you know wonderfully eloquent you are goody if you come out like that in st stephens we shant know you and the ministerialists will look down in the mouth with a vengeance dont be satirical phil if i admire mademoiselle flora what is it to you pray nothing at all said carruthers with unnecessary rapidity of enunciation my love what are you going to wear tonight the bishop of bonviveur is coming he was a college friend of your poor uncles knew your dear mother before she married i want you to look your very best and charm him as you certainly do most people said lady marabout adroit intriguer the bishop was going sans doute the bishop loved good wine good dinners and good society and found all three in lowndes square but the bishop was entirely unavailable for purposes matrimonial having had three wives and being held tight in hand by a fourth however a bishop is a convenient piece to cover your king in chess and the bishop served admirably just then in lady marabouts moves as a locum tenens for goodwood flora montolieu in her innocence made herself look her prettiest for her mothers old friend and flora montolieu was conveniently ready looking her prettiest for her chaperones peteligible when goodwoodwho hated to dine anywhere in london except at the clubs the castle or the guards mess and was as difficult to get for your dinners as birdsnests soup or tokay purentered the marabout drawingrooms anne hautton will see he dined here tonight in the morning post tomorrow morning and she will know flora must attract him very unusually what will she and egidia and feodorowna say thought lady marabout with a glow of pleasure which she was conscious was uncharitable and sinful and yet couldnt repress let her try how she might in scheming for the future duke of doncaster for john montolieus daughter she felt much as democratically and treasonably guilty to her order as a prince of the blood might feel heading a chartist emeute but then suppose the chartist row was that princes sole chance of crushing an odious foe as it was the only chance for her to humiliate the hautton dont you think it might look tempting judge nobody my good sir till youve been in similar circumstances yourselfa golden rule which might with advantage employ those illuminating colors with which ladies employ so much of their time just now remembering it they might hold their white hands from flinging those sharp flinty stones that surely suit them so ill and that soil their fingers in one way quite as much as they soil the victims bowed head in another illuminate the motto mesdames and demoiselles perhaps you will do thaton a smalt ground with a gold persian arabesque round and impossible flowers twined in and out of the letters but remember itpardon it were asking too much my dear philip did you notice how very marked goodwoods attentions were to flora last night asked lady marabout the morning after in one of her most sunshiny and radiant moods as carruthers paid her his general matutinal call in her boudoir marked yes marked why do you repeat it in that tone if they were marked there is nothing to be ridiculed that i see they were very marked indeed especially for him hes such an unimpressible nevershowanything man i wonder you did not notice it my dear mother said carruthers a little impatiently brushing up the angora cats ruff the wrong way with his cane do you suppose i pass my evenings noticing the attentions other men may see fit to pay to young ladies welldont be impatient you never used to be said lady marabout if you were in my place just for a night or two or any other chaperones youd be more full of pity but people never will sympathize with anything that doesnt touch themselves the only chords that strike the keynote in anybody is the chord that sounds self and that is the reason why the world is as full of crash and tumult as beethovens storm quite right my dear mother of course its quite right i always think you have a great deal of sympathy for a man philip even for people you dont harmonize withyou could sympathize with that child flora yesterday in her rapturous delight at seeing that coccoloba uvifera in the patchouli conservatory because it reminded her of her west indian home and you care nothing whatever about flowers nor yet about the west indies i should supposebut you never will sympathize with me you know how many disappointments and grievances and vexations of every kind i have had the last ten twenty ay thirty forty seasonsever since i had to chaperone your aunt eleanore almost as soon as i was married and was worried more than anybody ever was worried by her coquetteries and her inconsistencies and her vacillationsso badly as she married too at the last those flirting beauties so often do they throw away a hundred admirable chances and put up with a wretched dernier resortlet a thousand salmon break away from the line out of their carelessness and end by being glad to land a little minnow i dont know when i havent been worried by chaperoning flora montolieu is a great anxiety a great difficulty little detrimental that she is detrimental what an odd word you choose for her i dont choose it for her she is it returned lady marabout decidedly how so how so why my dear philip i told you the very first day she came how so when she is john montolieus daughter when she has no birth to speak of and not a farthing to her fortune if she were jack ketchs daughter you could not speak much worse her highbreeding might do credit to a palace i only wish one found it in all palaces and i never knew you before measure people by their money my dear philip no more i do i cant bear you when you speak in that tone its so hard and sarcastic and unlike you i dont know what you mean either i should have thought a man of the world like yourself knew well enough what i intend when i say flora is a detrimental she has a sweet temper very clever very lively very charming as any one knows by the number of men that crowd about her but a detrimental she is poor little heart muttered carruthers in his beard too low for his mother to hear and yet i am quite positive that if she herself act judiciously and it is well managed for her goodwood may be won before the season is over concluded lady marabout carruthers not feeling much interest it is presumed in the exclusively feminine pursuit of matchmaking returned no answer but played with bijous silver bells and twisted his own tawny moustaches i am quite positive it may be if properly managed reiterated lady marabout you might second me a little philip i good heavens my dear mother what are you thinking of i would sooner turn torreador and throw lassos over bulls at madrid than help you to fling nuptial cables over poor devils in belgravia twenty to one im going to the yard to look at a bay filly of cope fieldens and then on to a messluncheon of the bays must you go said his mother looking lovingly on him you look tired philip dont you feel well perfectly but cambridge had us out over those confounded wormwood scrubs this morning and three hours in this june sun in our harness makes one swear if it were a sharp brush it would put life into one as it is it only inspires one with an intense suffering from boredom and an intense desire for hock and seltzer i am very glad you havent a sharp brush as you call it for all that said lady marabout it might be very pleasant to you philip but it wouldnt be quite so much so to me i wish you would stay to luncheon not today thanks i have so many engagements you have been very good in coming to see me this seasoneven better than usual it is very good of you with all your amusements and distractions you have given me a great many days this month said lady marabout gratefully anne hautton sees nothing of hautton she says except at a distance in pallmall or the park all the season through fancy if i saw no more of you do you know philip i am almost reconciled to your never marrying i have never seen anybody i should like at all for you unless you had chosen cecil ormsbycecil cheveley i mean and i am sure i should be very jealous of your wife if you had one i couldnt help it rest tranquil my dear mother you will never be put to the test said carruthers with a laugh as he bid her good morning perhaps it is best he shouldnt marry i begin to think so mused lady marabout as the door closed on him i used to wish it very much for some things he is the last of his name and it seems a pity there ought to be an heir for deepdene but still marriage is such a lottery he is right enough there though i dont admit it to him its a tombola where there is one prize to a million of blanks one cant help seeing that though on principle i never allow it to him or any of his men and if philip had any woman who didnt appreciate him or didnt understand him or didnt make him happy how wretched i should be i have often pictured philips wife to myself i have often idealized the sort of woman i should like to see him marry but its very improbable i shall ever meet my ideal realized one never does and after all whenever i have fancied years ago he might be falling in love i have always felt a horrible dread lest she shouldnt be worthy of hima jealous fear of her that i could not conquer its much better as it is there is no woman good enough for him with which compliment to carruthers at her sexs expense lady marabout returned to weaving her pet projected toils for the ensnaring of goodwood for whom also if asked i dare say the duchess of doncaster would have averred on her part looking through her maternal claude glasses no woman was good enough either when ladies have daughters to marry men always present to their imaginations a battalion of worthless decaloguesmashing utterly unreliable individuals amongst whom there is not one fit to be trusted or fit to be chosen but when their sons are the candidates for the holy bond they view all women through the same foggy and nonembellishing medium which if it does not speak very much for their unprejudiced discernment at least speaks to the oftdisputed fact of the equality of merit in the sexes and would make it appear that in vulgar parlance there must be six of the one and half a dozen of the other flora soft and careless and rebellious as she looks is ambitious and has set her heart on winning goodwood i do believe as much as ever poor valencia did true she takes a different plan of action as philip would call it and treats him with gay nonchalante indifference which certainly seems to pique him more than ever my poor nieces beauty and quiet deference to his opinions did but that is because she reads him better and knows more cleverly how to rouse him she has set her heart on winning goodwood i am certain ambitious as it seems how eagerly she looked out for the blues yesterday at that hyde park inspectionthough i am sure goodwood does not look half so handsome as philip does in harness as they call it philip is so much the finer man i will just sound her todayor tonight as we come back from the opera thought lady marabout one morning things were moving to the very best of her expectations learning experience from manifold failures lady marabout had laid her plans this time with a dexterity that defied discomfiture seconded by both the parties primarily necessary to the accomplishment of her manoeuvres with only a little outerworld opposition to give it piquancy and excitement she felt that she might defy the fates to checkmate her here this should be her marathon and lemnos which simply reverted to should be sufficient to secure her immunity from the attacks of any feminine xantippus who should try to rake up her failures and tarnish her glory to win goodwood with a nobodys daughter would be a feat as wonderful in its way as for miltiades to have passed in a single day and with a north wind as oracle exacted to the conquest of the pelasgian isles and lady marabout longed to do it as you my good sir may have longed in your day to take a king in check with your only available pawn or win one of the ribands of the turf with a little filly that seemed to general judges scarcely calculated to be in the first flight at the chester consolation scramble things were beautifully in train it even began to dawn on the perceptions of the hauttons usually very slow to open to anything revolutionary and unwelcome her grace of doncaster a large lethargic somnolent dowager rarely awake to anything but the interests and restoration of the old ultratory party in a utopia always dreamed of and never realized like many other utopias political and poetical public and personal had turned her eyes on flora montolieu and asked her son the question inevitable who is she to which goodwood had replied with a devilmaycare recklessness and a headlong indefiniteness which grated on her graces ears and imparted her no information whatever one of lady tattersalls yearlings and the most charming creature i ever met you know that why did you ask me then you know all i do and all i care to doa remark that made the duchess wish her very dear and personal friend lady marabout were comfortably and snugly interred in the mausoleum of fern ditton rather than alive in the flesh in belgravia chaperoning young ladies whom nobody knew and who were not to be found in any of sir e burkes triad of volumes belgravia and her sister mayfair wondered at it and talked over it raked up the parental montolieu lineage mercilessly and found out from the bishop of bonviveur and sauceblanche that the uncle on the distaff side had been only a tug at eton and had lived and died at fern ditton a perpetual curate and nothing elsenot even a dean not even a rector goodwood couldnt be serious settled the coteries but the more hints innuendoes questions and adroitly concealed but simply suggested animadversion lady marabout received the greater was her glory the warmer her complacency when she saw her little montolieu who was not little at all leading as she undoubtedly did lead the most desired eligible of the day captive in her chains sent bouquets by him begged for waltzes by him followed by him at the ride riveting his lorgnon at the opera monopolizing his attentionthough clever little intriguer she knew too well how to pique him ever to let him monopolize hers she certainly makes play as philip would call it admirably with goodwood said lady marabout admiringly at a morning party stirring a cup of orange pekoe yet with a certain irrepressible feeling that she should almost prefer so very young a girl not to be quite so adroit a schemer at seventeen that indifference and nonchalance is the very thing to pique and retain such a courted fastidious creature as goodwood and she knows it too now a clumsy casual observer might even fancy that she liked some otherseven you philip for instancemuch better she talks to you much more appeals to you twice as often positively teases you to stop and lunch or come to dinner here and really told you the other night at the opera she missed you when you didnt come in the morning but to anybody who knows anything of the world it is easy enough to see which way her inclinations yes i do hope it is inclination as well as ambitioni am not one of those who advocate pure mariages de convenance i dont think them right indeed though they are undoubtedly very expedient sometimes turn i do not think anybody ever could prove me to have erred in my quicksightedness in those affairs i may have been occasionally mistaken in other things or been the victim of adverse and unforeseen circumstances which were beyond my control and betrayed me but i know no one can read a girls heart more quickly and surely than i or a mans either for that matter oh we all know you are a clairvoyante in heart episodes my dear mother they are the one business of your life smiled carruthers setting down his ice and lounging across the lawn to a group of cedars where flora montolieu stood playing at croquet and who like a scheming adventuress as she was immediately verified lady marabouts words and piqued goodwood a outrance by avowing herself tired of the game and entering with animated verve into the prophecies for ascot with carruthers whose bay filly sunbeam sister to wildfalcon was entered to run for the queens cup what an odd smile that was of philips thought lady marabout left to herself and her orange pekoe he has been very intimate with goodwood ever since they joined the blues cornets together threeandtwenty years ago surely he cant have heard him drop anything that would make him fancy he was not serious an idle fear which lady marabout dismissed contemptuously from her mind when she saw how entirely goodwoodin defiance of the hauttons sneer the drowsy duchesss unconcealed frown all the comments sure to be excited in feminine minds and all the chaff likely to be elicited from masculine lips at the messtable and in the u s and in the guards box before the curtain went up for the balletvowed himself to the service of the little detrimental throughout that morning party and spoke a temporary adieu whose tenderness if she did not exactly catch lady marabout could at least construe as he pulled up the tigerskin over floras dainty dress before the marabout carriage rolled down the fulham road to town at which tenderness of farewell carrutherssteeled to all such weaknesses himselfgave a disdainful glance and a contemptuous twist of his moustaches as he stood by the door talking to his mother you too phil said goodwood with a laugh as the carriage rolled away carruthers stared at him haughtily as he will stare at his best friends if they touch his private concerns more nearly than he likes a stare which said disdainfully i dont understand you and thereby told the only lie to which carruthers ever stooped in the whole course of his existence goodwood laughed again if you poach on my manor here i shall kill you phil so gare a vous you are in an enigmatical mood today i cant say i see much wit in your riddles said carruthers with his grandest and most contemptuous air as he lit his havana confound that fellow id rather have had any other man in london for a rival twenty and more years ago how he cut me out with that handsome virginie peauderose that we were both such mad boys after in paris however it will be odd if i cant win the day here a goodwood rejectedpooh there isnt a woman in england that would do it thought goodwood as he drove down the fulham road his manor whos told him its his and if it be what is that to me thought carruthers as he got into his tilbury philip youre not a fool like the rest of them i hope youve not forsworn yourself surely pshawnonsenseimpossible certainly she has something very charming about her if i were a man i dont think i could resist her thought lady marabout as she sat in her box in the grand tier tenth from the queens moving her fan slowly lifting her lorgnon now and then listening vaguely to the music of the second act of the barbiere for probably about the two hundredth time in her life and looking at flora moutolieu sitting opposite to her the women are eternally asking me who she is i dont care a hang who but shes the prettiest thing in london said fulke nugent which was the warmest praise that any living man about town remembered to have heard fall from his lips which limited themselves religiously to one legitimate laudation which is a superlative nowadays though mr lindley murray if alive wouldnt perhaps receive or recognize it as such not badlooking it isnt who a woman is its what she is thats the question i take it said goodwood as he left the guards box to visit the marabout by george laughed nugent to carruthers goodey must be serious eh phil he dont care a button for little bibi he dont care even for zerlina when the ballet begins i verily believe hes thinking less of the women before him than of the woman who has left the house and if a fellow can give more ominous signs of being serious as the women phrase it i dont know em do you i dont know much about that sort of thing at all muttered carruthers as he went out to follow goodwood to the marabout box that is an old old story that of the fair emily stirring feud between palamon and arcite it has been acted out many a time since beaumont and fletcher lived and wrote their twinthoughts and won their twin laurels but the bars that shut the kinsmen in their prisonwalls the ivyleaves that filled in the rents of their prisonstones were not more entirely and blissfully innocent of the feud going on within and the battle foaming near them than the calm complacent soul of lady marabout was of the rivalry going on close beside her for the sake of little montolieu she certainly thought philip made himself specially brilliant and agreeable that night but then that was nothing new he was famous for talking well and liked his mother enough not seldom to shower out for her some of his very best things certainly she thought goodwood did not shine by the contrast and looked to use an undignified word rather cross than otherwise but then nobody did shine beside philip and she knew a reason that made goodwood pardonably cross at the undesired presence of his oldest and dearest chum even she almost wished philip away if the presence of her idolized son could have been unwelcome to her at any time it was so that night it isnt like philip to monopolize her so he who has so much tact usually and cares nothing for girls himself thought lady marabout he must do it for mischief and yet that isnt like him at all its very tiresome at any rate and with that skilful diplomacy in such matters on which if it was sometimes overthrown lady marabout not unjustly plumed herself she dexterously entangled carruthers in conversation and during the crash of one of the choruses whispered as he bent forward to pick up her fan which she had let drop leave flora a little to goodwood he has a righthe spoke decisively to her today carruthers bowed his head and stooped lower for the fan he left her accordingly to goodwood till the curtain fell after the last act of the barbiere and lady marabout congratulated herself on her own adroitness there is nothing like a little tact she thought what would society be without the guiding genius of tact i wonder one dreadful donnybrook fair but someway or other despite all her tact or because her son inherited that valuable quality in a triple measure to herself someway it was goodwood who led her to her carriage and carruthers who led the little montolieu terribly bete of philip how very unlike him mused lady marabout as she gathered her burnous round her carruthers talked and laughed as he led flora montolieu through the passages more gayly perhaps than usual my mother has told me some news tonight miss montolieu he said carelessly am i premature in proffering you my congratulations but even if i be so you will not refuse the privilege to an old friendto a very sincere friendand will allow me to be the first to wish you happiness lady marabouts carriage stopped the way flora montolieu colored looked full at him and went to it without having time to answer his congratulations in which the keenestsighted hearer would have failed to detect anything beyond everyday friendship and genuine indifference the most truthful men will make the most consummate actors when spurred up to it my dear child you look ill tonight i am glad you have no engagements said lady marabout as she sat down before the dressingroom fire toasting her little satinshod footshe has a weakness for fire even in the hottest weatherwhile flora montolieu lay back in a low chair crushing the roses mercilessly you do feel well i should not have thought so your face looks so flushed and your eyes so preternaturally dark perhaps it is the late hours you were not used to them in france of course and it must be such a change to this life from your unvarying conventual routine at st denis my love what was it lord goodwood said to you today do not speak to me of him lady marabout i hate his name lady marabout started with an astonishment that nearly upset the cup of coffee she was sipping hate his name my dearest flora why in heavens name flora did not answer she pulled the roses off her hair as though they had been infected with brinvilliers poison what has he done he has done nothing who has done anything then oh no oneno one has done anything buti am sick of lord goodwoods nametired of it lady marabout sat almost speechless with surprise tired of it my dear flora little montolieu laughed well tired of it perhaps from hearing him praised so often as the athenian trader grew sick of aristides and the jacobin of washingtons name is it unpardonably heterodox to say so lady marabout stirred her coffee in perplexity my dear child pray dont speak in that way thats like philips tone when he is enigmatical and sarcastic and worries me i really cannot in the least understand you about lord goodwood it is quite incomprehensible to me i thought i overheard him today at lady georges concert speak very definitely to you indeed and when he was interrupted by the duchess before you could give him his reply i thought i heard him say he should call tomorrow morning to know your ultimate decision was i right quite right he really proposed marriage to you today yes and yet you say you are sick of his name does it follow imperatively lady marabout that because the sultan throws his handkerchief it must be picked up with humility and thanksgiving asked flora montolieu furling and unfurling her fan with an impatient rapidity that threatened entire destruction of its ivory and feathers with their watteaulike group elaborately painted on themas pretty a toy of the kind as could be got for money which had been given her by carruthers one day in payment of some little bagatelle of a bet sultanhumility repeated lady marabout scarcely crediting her senses my dear flora do you know what you are saying you must be jesting there is not a woman in england who would be insensible to the honor of goodwoods proposals you are jesting flora i am not indeed you mean to say you could positively think of rejecting him cried lady marabout rising from her chair in the intensity of her amazement convinced that she was the victim of some horrible hallucination why should it surprise you if i did why repeated lady marabout indignantly do you ask me why you must be a child indeed or a consummate actress to put such a question excuse me my dear if i speak a little strongly you perfectly bewilder me and i confess i cannot see your motives or your meaning in the least you have made a conquest such as the proudest women in the peerage have vainly tried to make you have one of the highest titles in the country offered to you you have won a man whom everybody declared would never be won you have done this pardon me without either birth or fortune on your own side and then you speak of rejecting goodwoodgoodwood of all the men in england you cannot be serious flora or if you are you must be mad lady marabout spoke more hotly than lady marabout had ever spoken in all her life goodwood absolutely wongoodwood absolutely come to the pointthe crowning humiliation of the hauttons positively within her graspher marathon and lemnos actually gained and all to be lost and flung away by the unaccountable caprice of a wayward child it was sufficient to exasperate a saint and a saint lady marabout never pretended to be flora montolieu toyed recklessly with her fan you told sir philip this evening i think of i hinted it to him my dearyes philip has known all along how much i desired it and as goodwood is one of his oldest and most favorite friends i knew it would give him sincere pleasure both for my sake and goodwoods and yours too for i think philip likes you as much as he ever does any young girlbetter indeed and i could not imaginei could not dream for an instantthat there was any doubt of your acceptation as indeed there cannot be you have been jesting to worry me flora little montolieu rose threw her fan aside as if its ivory stems had been hot iron and leaned against the mantelpiece you advise me to accept lord goodwood then lady marabout my love if you need my advice certainlysuch an alliance will never be proffered to you again the brilliant position it will place you in i surely have no need to point out returned lady marabout the little hypocrite she mused angrily as if her own mind were not fully made upas if any girl in europe would hesitate over accepting the doncaster coronetas if a nameless montolieu could doubt for a moment her own delight at being created marchioness of goodwood such a triumph as thatwhy i wouldnt credit any woman who pretended she wasnt dazzled by it i thought you did not approve of marriages of convenience lady marabout played a tattooslightly perplexed tattoowith her spoon in her sevres saucer no more i do my dearthat is under some circumstances it is impossible to lay down a fixed rule for everything marriages of conveniencewell perhaps not but as i understand these words they mean a mere business affair arranged as they are in france without the slightest regard to the inclinations of either merely regarding whether the incidents of fortune birth and station are equal and suitable marriages de convenance are when a parvenu barters his gold for good blood or where an ancienne princesse mends her fortune with a nouveau riche profound indifference meanwhile on each side i do not call this so decidedly not goodwood must be very deeply attached to you to have forgotten his detestation of marriage and laid such a title as his at your feet have you any idea of the weight of the dukes of doncaster in the country have you any notion of what their rentroll is have you any conception of their enormous influence their very high place the magnificence of their seats helmsley almost equals windsor all these are yours if you will and you affect to hesitate to let lord goodwood buy me buy you your phraseology is as strange as my sons to accept him only for the coronet and the rentroll his position and his helmsley seems not a very grateful and flattering return for his preference i do not see that at all said lady marabout irritably is there anything more annoying than to have unwelcome truths thrust in our teeth it is not as though he were odious to youa hideous man a coarse man a cruel man whose very presence repelled you goodwood is a man quite attractive enough to merit some regard independent of his position you have an affectionate nature you would soon grow attached to him flora montolieu shook her head and in fact she went on warming with her subject and speaking all the more determinedly because she was speaking a little against her conscience and wholly for her inclinations my dear flora if you need persuasionwhich you must pardon me if i doubt your doing in your heart for i cannot credit any woman as being insensible to the suit of a future duke of doncaster or invulnerable to the honor it does herif you need persuasion i should think i need only refer to the happiness it will afford your poor dear mother amidst her many trials to hear of so brilliant a triumph for you you are proudgoodwood will place you in a position where pride may be indulged with impunity nay with advantage you are ambitiouswhat can flatter your ambition more than such an offer you are cleveras goodwoods wife you may lead society like madame de rambouillet or immerse yourself in political intrigue like the duchess of devonshire it is an offer which places within your reach everything most dazzling and attractive and it is one my dear flora which you must forgive me if i say a young girl of obscure rank as rank goes and no fortune whatever should pause before she lightly rejects you cannot afford to be fastidious as if you were an heiress or a ladyinyourownright that was as illnatured a thing as the bestnatured lady in christendom ever said on the spur of selfinterest and it stung flora montolieu more than her hostess dreamed the color flushed into her face and her eyes flashed you have said sufficient lady marabout i accept the marquis tomorrow and taking up her fan and her operacloak leaving the discarded roses unheeded on the floor she bade her chaperone goodnight and floated out of the dressingroom while lady marabout sat stirring the cream in a second cup of coffee a good deal puzzled a little awed by the odd turn affairs had taken with a slight feeling of guilt for her own share in the transaction an uncomfortable dread lest the day should ever come when flora should reproach her for having persuaded her into the marriage a comfortable conviction that nothing but good could come of such a brilliant and enviable alliance and above all other conflicting feelings one delicious dominant glorified security of triumph over the hauttons mere et filles but when morning dawned lady marabouts horizon seemed cleared of all clouds and only radiant with unshadowed sunshine goodwood was coming and coming to be accepted she seemed already to read the newspaper paragraphs announcing his capture and floras conquest already to hear the hauttons enforced congratulations already to see the nuptial party gathered round the altar rail of st georges lady marabout had never felt in a sunnier more lighthearted mood never more completely at peace with herself and all the world as she sat in her boudoir at her writingtable penning a letter which began my dearest lillawhat happiness it gives me to congratulate you on the brilliant future opening to your sweet flora and which would have continued no doubt with similar eloquence if it had not been interrupted by soames opening the door and announcing sir philip carruthers who walked in touched his mothers brow with his moustaches and went to stand on the hearth with his arm on the mantelpiece my dear philip you never congratulated me last night pray do so now cried lady marabout delightedly wiping her pen on the pennon which a small ormolu knight obligingly carried for that useful purpose ladies always wipe their pens as religiously as they bolt their bedroom doors believe in cosmetics and go to church on a sunday was your news of last night true then asked carruthers bending forwards to roll bijou on its back with his foot that goodwood had spoken definitively to her perfectly he proposed to her yesterday at the frangipane concertnot at the concert of course but afterwards when they were alone for a moment in the conservatories the duchess interrupted themdid it on purposeand he had only time to whisper hurriedly he should come this morning to hear his fate i dare say he felt tolerably secure of it last night i naturally spoke to flora about it oddly enough she seemed positively to think at first of rejecting himrejecting himonly fancy the madness between ourselves i dont think she cares anything about him but with such an alliance as that of course i felt it my bounden duty to counsel her as strongly as i could to accept the unequalled position it proffered her indeed it could have been only a girls waywardness a childs caprice to pretend to hesitate for she is very ambitious and very clever and i would never believe that any womanand she less than anywould be proof against such dazzling prospects it would be absurd you know philip whether it was hypocrisy or a real reluctance because she doesnt feel for him the idealic love she dreams of i dont know but i put it before her in a way that plainly showed her all the brilliance of the proffered position and before she bade me good night i had vanquished all her scruples if she had any and i am able to say good god what have you done done reechoed lady marabout vaguely terrified certainly i persuaded her to accept him she has accepted him probably he is here now i should have been a strange person indeed to let any young girl in my charge rashly refuse such an offer you induced her to accept him god forgive you lady marabout turned pale as death and gazed at him with undefinable terror philip you do not mean great heavens have you never seen mother he leaned his arms on the marble with his forehead bowed upon them and lady marabout gazed at him still as a bird at a basilisk philip philip what have i done how could i tell she murmured distractedly tears welling into her eyes if i had only known but how could i dream that child had any fascination for you how could i fancy hush no you are in no way to blame you could not know it i barely knew it till last night he answered gently philip loves her and i have made her marry goodwood thought lady marabout agonized remorseful consciencestruck heartbroken in a thousand ways at once the climax of her woes was reached life had no greater bitterness for her left her son loved and loved the last woman in england she would have had him love that woman was given to another and she had been the instrument of wrecking the life to save or serve which she would have laid down her own in glad and instant sacrifice lady marabout bowed her head under a grief before which the worries so great before the schemes but so lately so precious the small triumphs just now so allabsorbing shrank away into their due insignificance philip suffering and suffering through her self glided far away from lady marabouts memory then and she hated herself more fiercely than the gentlehearted soul had ever hated any foe for her own criminal share in bringing down this unforeseen terrific blow on her beloved ones head philip my dearest what can i do she cried distractedly if i had thoughtif i had guessed do nothing a woman who could give herself to a man whom she did not love should be no wife of mine let me suffer what i might but i persuaded her philip mine is the blame his lips quivered painfully had she cared for me asi may have fancied she had not been so easy to persuade she has much force of character where she wills he is here now you say i cannot risk meeting him just yet leave me for a little while leave mei am best alone gentle though he always was to her his mother knew him too well ever to dispute his will and the most bitter tears lady marabout had ever known ready as she was to weep for other peoples woes and rarely as she had to weep for any of her own choked her utterance and blinded her eyes as she obeyed and closed the door on his solitude philipher idolized philipthat ever her house should have sheltered this creature to bring a curse upon him that ever she should have brought this tropical flower to poison the air for the only one dear to her i am justly punished thought lady marabout humbly and penitentiallyjustly i thought wickedly of anne hautton i did not do as i would be done by i longed to enjoy their mortification i advised flora against my own conscience and against hers i am justly chastised but that he should suffer through me that my fault has fallen on his head that my philip my noble philip should love and not be loved and that i have brought it on himgood heaven what is that that was a man whom her eyes being misty with tears lady marabout had brushed against as she ascended the staircase ere she perceived him and who passing on with a muttered apology was down in the hall and out of the door mason held open before she had recovered the shock of the rencontre much before she had a possibility of recognizing him through the mist aforesaid a fear a hope a joy a dread one so woven with another there was no disentangling them sprang up like a ray of light in lady marabouts hearta possibility dawned in her to be rejected as an impossibility lady marabout crossed the anteroom her heart throbbing tumultuously spurred on to noble atonement and reckless selfsacrifice if fate allowed them she opened the drawingroom door flora montolieu was alone flora you have seen goodwood she turned her own face as pale and her own eyes as dim as lady marabouts yes you have refused him flora montolieu misconstrued her chaperones eagerness and answered haughtily enough i have told him that indifference would be too poor a return for his affections to insult him with it and that i would not do him the injury of repaying his trust by falsehood and deception i meant what i said to you last night i said it on the spur of pain indignation no matter what but i could not keep my word when the trial came lady marabout bent down and kissed her with a fervent gratitude that not a little bewildered the recipient my dear child thank god little as i thought to say so flora tell me you love some one else lady marabout you have no right yea i have a rightthe strongest right is not that other my son flora montolieu looked up then dropped her head and burst into tearstears that lady marabout soothed then tears that carruthers soothed yet more effectually still five minutes afterwards that i should have sued that little montolieu and sued to her for philip mused lady marabout it is very odd perhaps i get used to being crossed and disappointed and trampled on in every way and by everybody but certainly though it is most contrary to my wishes though a child like that is the last person i should ever have chosen or dreamt of as philips wife though it is a great pain to me and anne hautton of course will be delighted to rake up everything she can about the montolieus and it is heartbreaking when one thinks how a carruthers might marry how the carruthers always have married rarely any but ladies in their own right for countless generations still it is very odd but i certainly feel happier than ever i did in my life annoyed as i am and grieved as i am it is heartbreaking that horrid john montolieu i wonder what relation one stands in legally to the father of ones sons wife i will ask sir fitzroy kelley not that the montolieus are likely to come to englandit is very sad when one thinks whom philip might have married and yet she certainly is infinitely charming and she really appreciates and understands him if it were not for what anne hautton will always say i could really be pleased to think what an anxious hope what a dreaded ideal philips wife has always been to me and now just as i had got reconciled to his determined bachelor preferences and had grown to argue with him that it was best he shouldnt marry he goes and falls in love with this child everything is at crosspurposes in life i think there is only one thing i am resolved uponi will never chaperone anybody again and she kept her vow none can christen her lady tattersall any longer with point for there are no yearling sales in that house in lowndes square whatever there be in the other domiciles of that fashionable quarter lady marabout has shaken that burden off her shoulders and moves in blissful solitude and tripled serenity through belgravia relieved of responsibility and wearing her years as lightly losing the odd trick at her whist as sunnily and beaming on the world in general as radiantly as any dowager in the english peerage that she was fully reconciled to carrutherss change of resolve was shown in the fact that when anne hautton turned to her on the evening of his marriageday after the dinner to which lady marabout had bidden all her friends and a good many of her foes with an amiable murmur i am so grieved for you dearest helenai know what your disappointment must bewhat should i feel if hauttonyour bellefille is charming certainly very lovely but thensuch a connection you have my deepest sympathies i always told you how wrong you were when you fancied goodwood admired little montolieui beg her pardon i mean lady carruthersbut you will give your imagination such reins lady marabout smiled calmly and amusedly felt no pang andthought of philip i take it things must be very rosecolored with us when we can smile sincerely on our enemies and defeat their stings simply because we feel them not a study a la louis quinze or pendant to a pastel by la tour i have among others hanging on my wall a pastel of la tours of the artistlover of julie fel of the monarch of pastellistes the touch of whose crayons was a brevet of wit and of beauty and on whose easel bloomed afresh the laughing eyes the brilliant tints the rosehued lips of all the loveliest women of the regne galant from the princesses of the blood of the house of bourbon to the princesses of the greenroom of the comediefrancaise painted in the days of louis quinze the light of more than a century having fallen on its soft colors to fade and blot them with the icy brush of time my pastel is still fresh still eloquent the genius that created it is gonegone the beauty that inspired itbut the picture is deathless it shows me the face of a woman of a beautiful woman else be sure she would not have been honored by the crayons of la tour her full southern lips are parted with a smile of triumph a chefdoeuvre of coquetry a headdress of lace and pearls and little bouquets of roses is on her unpowdered hair which is arranged much like julie fels herself in the portrait that hangs if i remember right at the musee de saint quentin and her large eyes are glancing at you with languor malice victory all commingled at the back of the picture is written mlle thargelie dumarsais the letters are faded and yellow but the pastel is living and laughing yet through the divine touch of the genius of la tour with its perfume of dead glories with its odor of the beau siecle the pastel hangs on my wall living relic of a buried age and sometimes in my mournful moments the full laughing lips of my pastel will part and breathe and speak to me of the distant past when thargelie dumarsais saw all paris at her feet and was not humbled then as now by being only valued and remembered for the sake of the talent of la tour my beautiful pastel gives me many confidences i will betray one to youa single leaf from a life of the eighteenth century i the first morning in the heart of lorraine nestled down among its woods stood an old chateau that might have been the chateau of the sleeping beauty of fairy fame so sequestered it stood amidst its trees chained together by fragrant fetters of honeysuckle and wild vine so undisturbed slept the morning shadows on the wild thyme that covered the turf so unbroken was the silence in which the leaves barely stirred and the birds folded their wings and hushed their song till the heat of the noonday should be passed beyond the purple hills stretching up in the soft haze of distance in the same province of laughing luxurious sunlit lorraine was luneville the luneville of stanislaus montesquieu of voltaire of henault of boufflers a versailles in miniature even possessing a perfect replica of pompadour in its own pretty pagan of a marquise within a few leagues was luneville but the echo of its mots and madrigals did not reach over the hills did not profane the sunny air did not mingle with the vintagesong of the vinedressers the silver babble of the woodland brook the hushed chant of the ave maria the vesper bells chimed from the churches and monasteries which made the sole music known or heard in this little valley of lorraine the chateau of grande charmille stood nestled in its woods gray lonely still silent as death yet not gloomy for white pigeons circled above its pointed towers brilliant dragonflies fluttered above the broken basin of the fountain that sang as gayly as it rippled among the thyme as though it fell into a marble cup and bees hummed their busy happy buzz among the jessamine that clung to its ivycovered wallswalls built long before lorraine had ceased to be a kingdom and a power long before a craven and effeminated valois had dared to kick the dead body of a slaughtered guise not gloomy with the golden light of a summer noon playing amidst the tangled boughs and on the silvered lichens not gloomy for under the elmboughs on the broken stone steps that led to the fountain her feet half buried in violetroots and wild thyme leaning her head on her hand as she looked into the water where the birds flew down to drink and fluttered their wings fearless of her presence was a young girl of sixteenand if women sometimes darken lives it must be allowed that they always illumine landscapes aline when boufflers saw her in the spring morning in all the grace of youth and beauty unconscious of themselves made not a prettier picture than this young dreamer under the elmboughs of the lorraine woods as she bent over the water watching it bubble and splash from the fountainspout and hide itself with a rippling murmur under the broad green reeds and the leaves of the waterlily she was a charming picture a brunette with long ebon tresses with her lashes drooping over her black languid almondshaped eyes a smile on her halfpouted lips and all the innocence and dawning beauty of her sixteen years about her while she sat on the broken steps now brushing the waterdrops off the violets now weaving the reeds into a pretty useless toy now beckoning the birds that came to peck on the rosesprays beside her favette where are your dreams favette the young naiad of the lorraine elmwoods looked up the plait of rushes dropping from her hands and a warm sudden blush tinging her cheeks and brow with a tint like that on the damask roseleaves that had fallen into the water and floated there like delicate shells mon dieu monsieur leon how you frightened me and like a startled fawn or a young bird glancing round at a rustle amidst the leaves favette sprang up half shy half smiling all her treasures gathered from the woodsof flowers of mosses of berries of feathery grasses of long ivyspraysfalling from her lap on to the turf in unheeded disorder i frightened you favette surely not are you sorry to see me then sorry oh no monsieur leon and favette glanced through her thick curled lashes slyly yet archly and began to braid again her plait of rushes come tell me then what and whom were you dreaming of ma mie as you looked down into the water tell me favette you have no secrets from your playmate your friend your brother favette shook her head smiling and plaited her rushes all wrong the blush on her cheeks as bright as that on the cups of the roseleaves that the wind shook down in a fresh shower into the brook come tell me mignonne was itof me of you well perhapsyes it was first love that whispered in favettes pretty voice those three little words it was first love that answered in his as he threw himself down on the violettufted turf at her feet as boufflers at alines ah favette so should it be for every hope every dream every thought of mine is centred in and colored by you yet you can leave me today pouted favette with a sigh and a moue mutine and gathering tears in her large gazelle eyes leave you would to heaven i were not forced but against a kings will what power has a subject none are too great none are too lowly to be touched by that iron hand if they provoke its grasp vincennes yawns for those who dare to think forleveque for those who dare to jest monsieur de voltaire was sent to the bastille for merely defending a truth and his own honor against de rohanchabot who am i that i should look for better grace favette struck him with her plaited rushes a reproachful little blow monsieur vincennesmonsieur voltairewho are they i know nothing of those stupid people he smiled and fondly stroked her hair little darling the one is a prison that manacles the deadly crimes of free speech and free thought the other a man who has suffered for both but loves both still and will sooner or later help to give both to the world ah you think of your studies of your ambitions of your great heroes you think nothing of me save to call me a little darling you are cruel monsieur leon and favette twisted her hand from his grasp with petulant sorrow and dashed away her tearsthe tears of sixteenas bright and free from bitterness as the waterdrops on the violetbells i crueland to you my heart must indeed be badly echoed by my lips if you have cause to fancy so a single moment cruel to you favette favette is a man ever cruel to the dearest thing in his life the dearest name in his thoughts if i smiled i meant no sneer i love you as you are mignonne the picture is so fair one touch added or one touch effaced would mar the whole in my eyes i love you as you are with no knowledge but what the good sisters teach you in their convent solitude and what the songs of the birds the voices of the flowers whisper to you of their woodland lore i love you as you are every morning when i am far away from you and from lorraine i shall think of you gathering the summer roses calling the birds about you bending over the fountain to see it mirror your own beauty every evening i shall think of you leaning from the window chanting softly to yourself the ora pro nobis while the shadows deepen and the stars we have so often watched together come out above the pinehills favette favette exile will have the bitterness of death to me to give me strength to bear it tell me that you love me more dearly than as the brother you have always called me that you will so love me when i shall be no longer here beside you but shall have to trust to memory and fidelity to guard for me in absence the priceless treasure of your heart favettes head drooped and her hands played nervously with the now torn and twisted braid of rushes he saw her heart beat under its muslin corsage like a bee caught and caged in the white leaves of a lily and she glanced at him under her lashes with a touch of naive coquetry if i tell you so what gage have i monsieur leon that a few months gone by you will even remember it in those magnificent cities you will soon forget lorraine with the grandes dames of the courts you will soon cease to care for favette look in my eyes favette they alone can answer you as i would answer till we meet again none shall supplant you for an hour none rob you of one thought you have my first love you will have my last favette you believe me yesi believe murmured favette resting her large eyes fondly on him we will meet as we part though you are the swallow free to take flight over the seas to foreign lands and i am the violet that must stay where it is rooted in the lorraine woods accept the augury he whispered resting his lips upon her low smooth brow does not the swallow ever return to the violet holding it fairer than all the gaudy tropical flowers that may have tempted him to rest on the wing and delay his homeward flight does not the violet ever welcome him the same in its timid winning springtide loveliness when he returns to as when he quitted the only home he loves believe the augury favette we shall meet as we part and they believed the augury as they believed in life in love in faith they who were beginning all and had proved none of the treacherous triad what had he dreamed of in his solitary ancestral woods fairer than this lorraine violet that had grown up with him side by side since he a boy of twelve gathered heaths from the clefts of the rocks that the little child of six years old cried for and could not reach what had she seen that she loved half so well as m le chevalier from the castle whom her uncle the cure held as his dearest and most brilliant pupil whose eyes always looked so lovingly into hers and whose voice was always lavishing fond names on his petite favette they believed the augury and were happy even in the sweet sorrow of partingsorrow that they had never known beforeas they sat together in the morning sunlight while the water bubbled among the violet tufts among the grasses and wild thyme and the dragonflies fluttered their green and gold and purple wings amidst the tendrils of the vines and the roseleaves drifted gently by the wind floated down the brook till they were lost in deepening shadow under the drooping boughs ii the second morning savezvous que favart va ecrire une nouvelle comediela chercheuse desprit vraiment il doit bien ecrire cela car il soccupe toujours a le chercher et narrive jamais a le trouver the mot had true feminine malice but the lips that spoke it were so handsome that had even poor favart himself the poetpastrycook who composed operas and comedies while he made meringues and fanfreluches and dreamed of libretti while he whisked the cream for a supper been within hearing they would have taken the smart from the sting and as it was the hit only caused echoes of softlytuned laughter for the slightest word of those lips it was the fashion through paris just then to bow to applaud and reecho before her psyche shrouded in cobweb lace powdered by martini gleaming with pearls and emeralds scented with most delicate amber making her morning toilette and receiving her morning levee according to the fashion of the day sat the brilliant satirist of poor favart the ruelle was crowded three marshals de richelieu lowendal and maurice de saxe a prince de soubise a poet claude dorat an abbe voisenon a centenarian saintaulaire peers uncounted de bievre de caylus de villars detissac duras dargensona crowd of otherssurrounded and superintended her toilette in a glittering troop of courtiers and gentlemen dames datours for she had her maids of honor as well as marie leczinska handed her her flacons of perfume or her numberless notes on gold salvers chased by reveil the ermine beneath her feet humbly sent by the russian ambassadorfar superior to what the czarina sent to madame de maillyhad cost two thousand louis her bedroom outshone in luxury any at versailles choisy or la muette with its venetian glass its medallions of fragonard its plaques of sevres its landscapes of watteau framed in the carved and gilded wainscoting its chinese lamps swinging by garlands of roses its laughing cupids buried under flowers painted in fresco above the alcove its hangings of velvet of silk of lace and its cabinets its screens its bonbonnieres its jewelboxes were costly as those of the marquises de pompadour or de prie who was shea princess of the blood a duchess of france a mistress of the king lords of the chamber obeyed her wishes ministers signed lettres de cachet at her instance ces messieurs la queue de la regence had their rendezvous at her suppers she had a country villa that eclipsed trianon she had fetes that outshone the fetes at versailles she had a droit de chasse in one of the royal districts she had the first place on the easels of coypel lancret pater vanloo la tour the first place in the butterfly odes of crebillon le gai claude dorat voisenon who was shethe queen of france no much morethe queen of paris she was thargelie dumarsais matchless as claire clairon beautiful as madeleine gaussin resistless as sophie arnould great as adrienne lecouvreur she was a power in francefor was she not the empress of the comedie if madame lenormand detioles ruled the government at versailles mademoiselle thargelie dumarsais ruled the world at paris and if the kings favorite could sign her enemies by a smile to the bastille the courts favorite could sign hers by a frown to forleveque the foyer was nightly filled while she played in zaire or polyeucte or les folies amoureuses with a court of princes and poets marshals and marquises beaux esprits and abbes galants and mighty nobles strewed with bouquets the path from her carriage to the coulisses bouquets she trod on with nonchalant dignity as though flowers only bloomed to have the honor of dying under her foot louis quinze smilingly humored her caprices content to wait until it was her pleasure to play at his private theatre dukes marquises viscounts chevaliers vied who should ruin himself most magnificently and most utterly for her and lovers the most brilliant and the most flattering from richelieu roi de ruelles to dorat poet of boudoirgraces and courtsapphos left the titled beauties of versailles for the selfcrowned empress of the francais she had all paris for her chentela from versailles to the caveau for even the women she deposed the actors she braved the journalists she consigned to forleveque dared not raise their voice against the idol of the hour a queen of france bah pray what could marie leczinska the pale dull pietist singing canticles in her private chapel compare for power for sway for courtiers for brilliant sovereignty for unrivalled triumph with thargelie dumarsais the queen of the theatre ravishingly beautiful looked the matchless actress as she sat before her psyche flashing oeillades on the brilliant group who made every added aigrette every additional bouquet of the coiffure every little mouche every touch to the already perfect toilette occasion for flattering simile and softbreathed compliment ravishingly beautiful as she laughed at maurice de saxe or made a disdainful moue at an impromptu couplet of dorats or gave a blow of her fan to richelieu or asked saintaulaire what he thought of vanloos portrait of her as rodugune ravishingly beautiful with her charms that disdained alike rouge and marechale powder and were matchless by force of their own coloring form and voluptuous languor when her toilette finished followed by her glittering crowd she let richelieu lead her to his carriage there was a review of guards on the plain at sablons that morning a fete afterwards at which she would be surrounded by the most brilliant staff of an army of noblesse and richelieu was at that moment the most favored of her troop of lovers m le duc as every one knows never sued at court or coulisse in vain and the love of thargelie dumarsais though perhaps with a stronger touch of romance in it than was often found in the atmosphere of the foyer was like the love of her time and her class as inconstant and vivacious now settling here now lighting there as any butterfly that fluttered among the limes at trianon did not the jestloving parterre ever salute with gay laughter two lines in a bagatellecomedy of the hour oui lamour papillonne sans entraves a son gre charge longtemps de fers de soie meme il mourrait when spoken by thargelie dumarsaislaughter that hailed her as headpriestess of her pleasant creed in a city and a century where the creed was universal ah bonjour you have not seen her before have you semienglishman you have found nothing like her in the foggy isles i wager you fifty louis cried one of thargelie dumarsaiss court the marquis de la thorilliere meeting a friend of his who had arrived in paris only the day before m le chevalier de tallemont des reaux as richelieus cortege rolled away and the marquis crossed to his own carriage her whom i have not been in paris for six years you know what can i tell of its idols as i remember of old that they change every hour true but bon dieu not to know la dumarsais what it must be to have been buried in those benighted britannic isles did you not see her in richelieus carriage no i saw a carriage driving off with such an escort and such fracas that i thought it could belong to nobody less than to madame lenormand detioles but i did not observe it any further who is this beauty i ought to have seen thargelie dumarsais for whom we are all ruining ourselves with the prettiest grace in the world and for whom you will do the same when you have been once to the francais that is if you have the good fortune to attract her eyes and please her fancy which you may do for the fogs have agreed with you leoni should not wonder if you become the fashion and set the women raving of you as leur zer zevalier thanks for the prophecy but i shall not stay long enough to fulfil it and steal your myrtle crowns i leave again tomorrow leave sapristi see what it is to have become half english and imbibed a taste for spleen and solitude have you written another satire or have you learned such barbarism as to dislike paris neither but i leave for lorraine tomorrow it is five years since i saw my old pinewoods dame it is ten years since i saw the wilds of bretagne and i will take good care it shall be a hundred before i see them again hors de paris cest hors du monde come with me to la dumarsaiss petit souper tonight and you will soon change your mind my good armand you have not been an exile as i have you little know how i long for the very scent of the leaves the very smell of the earth at grande charmille but bah i talk in hebrew to you you have been lounging away your days in titled beauties petits salons making butterfly verses learning their broidery their lisp and their perfumes talking to their parrots and using their cosmetiques till you care for no air but what is muskscented but what of this dumarsais of yoursdoes she equal lecouvreur eclipses herwith paris as with maurice de saxe thargelie dumarsais is superb mon cherunequalled unrivalled we have had nothing like her for beauty for grace for talent nor pardieu for extravagance she ruined me last year in a couple of months richelieu is in favor just nowwith what woman is he not thargelie is very fond of the marshals of france saxe is fettered to her hand and foot and the duchesse de bouillon hates her as rancorously as she does adrienne come and see her play phedre tonight and you will renounce lorraine i will take you to supper with her afterwards she will permit any friend of mine entry and then generous man that i am i shall have put you en chemin to sun yourself in her smiles and ingratiate yourself in her favor dont give me too much credit for the virtue though for i confess i should like to see richelieu supplanted does his reign threaten to last long then the marquis shrugged his shoulders and gave his badine an expressive whisk dieu sait we are not prophets in paris it would be as easy to say where that weathercock may have veered tomorrow as to predict where la dumarsaiss love may have lighted ere a month where are you going may i ask to see lucille de verdreuil i knew her at luneville she and madame de boufflers were warm friends till stanislaus i believe found lucilles eyes lovelier than madame la marquise deemed fit and then they quarrelled as women ever do with virulence in exact proportion to the ardor of their friendship as the women quarrel at choisy for notre maitre they will be friends again when both have lost the game like louise de mailly and the duchesse de chateauroux the poor duchess fitzjames and maurepas chatillon and bouillon rochefoucauld and le pere perussot all together were too strong for her all the gossip of that metz affair reached you across the water i suppose those pests of jesuits if they want him to be their very christian king and to cure him of his worship of cupidon they will have to pull down all the stones of la muette and the parc aux cerfs what good is it to kill one poor woman when women are as plentiful as roses at versailles and now let me drive you to madame de vaudreuil if she do not convert you from your fancy for lorraine this morning thargelie dumarsais will tonight mon zer zevalier paris at adoable vous netes pas seieux en voulant le quitter zen suis sure cried the comtesse de vaudreuil in the pretty lisp of the day a charming little blonde patched and powdered nestled in a chair before a fire of perfumed wood teasing her monkey zulme with a fan of paters and giving a pretty little sign of contempt and disbelief with some sprays of jessamine employed in the chastisement of offenders more responsible and quite as audacious as zulme her companion her zer zevalier was a young man of sevenandtwenty with a countenance frank engaging nobly cast far more serious far more thoughtful in its expression than was often seen in that laughing and mocking age exiled when a mere boy for a satirical pamphlet which had provoked the wrath of the censeur royal and might have cost him the bastille but for intercession from luneville he had passed his youth less in pleasure than in those philosophical and political problems then beginning to agitate a few minds which were developed later on in the encyclopedie later still in the assemblee nationale voltaire and helvetius had spoken well of him at madame de geoffrins claudine de tencin had introduced him the night before in her brilliant salons the veteran fontenelle had said to him monsieur comme censeur royal je refusai mon approbation a votre brochure comme homme libre je vous en feliciteall that circle was prepared to receive him well the young chevalier de tallemont might make a felicitous season in paris if he chose with the romance of his exile about him and madame de vaudreuil smiling kindly on him the country she cried the country is all very charming in eclogues and pastorals but out of them it is a desert of ennui what can you mean leon by leaving paris tomorrow ah mechant there must be something we do not see some love besides that of the lorraine woods madame is there not my father bien zoli but at your age men are not so filial there is some other reasonbut what any love you had there five years ago has hardly any attractions now five years ma foi five months is an eternity that kills the warmest passion may there not be some love madame that time only strengthens i never heard of it if there be it would be a very dreary affair i should fancy smouldering smouldering on and on like an illlit fire nobody would thank you for it mon cher here come what is your secret tell it me leon de tallemont smiled the smile of a man who has happy thoughts and is indifferent to ridicule madame one can refuse you nothing my secret it is a very simple one the greatest pang of my enforced exile was the parting from one i loved the greatest joy of my return is that i return to her bon dieu comme cest drole here is a man talking to me of love and of a love not felt for me thought madame la comtesse giving him a soft glance of her beautiful blue eyes you are a very strange man you have lived out of france till you have grown wretchedly serious and eccentric loved this woman for five years leon leon you are telling me a fairy tale who is she this enchantress she must have some mysterious magic tell mequick she is no enchantress madame and she has no magic save the simple one of having ever been very dear to me we grew up together at grande charmille she was the orphan niece of the priest a fond innocent laughing child fresh and fair and as untouched by a breath of impure air as any of the violets in the valley she was scarcely out of the years of childhood when i left her with beauty whose sweetest grace of all was its own unconsciousness through my five long years of exile i have remembered favette as i saw her last under the elmboughs in the summer light her eyes dim with the tears of our parting her young heart heaving with its first grief i have loved her too well for others to have power to efface or to supplant her of her only have i thought of her only have i dreamed holding her but the dearer as the years grew further from the hour of our separation nearer to the hour of our reunion i have heard no word of her since we parted but of what value is love without trust and fidelity in trial the beauty of her childhood may have merged into the beauty of womanhood but i fear no other change in favette as we parted so we vowed to meet and i believe in her love as in my own i know that i shall find my lorraine violet without stain or soil madame favette is still dearer to me now heaven help me than five years ago five yearsfive yearstrue it is an eternity yet the bitterness of the past has faded for ever from me now and i only seethe future madame de vaudreuil listened in silence his words stirred in her chords long untouched never heard amidst the mots the madrigals the laughter of her world of paris versailles and choisy she struck him a little blow with her jessaminesprays with a mist gathering over her lovely blue eyes hush hush leon you speak in a tongue unknown here a word of the heart amongst us sounds a word of a gaulois out of fashionforbidden iii midnight the francais was crowded thargelie dumarsais great in electre chimene ines as in ninette a la cour les moissonneurs or annette et lubin was playing in phedre louis quinze was present with all the powdered marquises the titled wits the glittering gentlemen of the court of versailles but no presence stayed the shout of adoration with which the parterre welcomed the idol of the hour and louis le bienaime des femmes himself added his royal quota to the ovation and threw at her feet a diamond superb as any in his regalia it was whispered that the most christian king was growing envious of his favorites favor with la dumarsais and would ere long supersede him the foyer was filled with princes of the blood marshals of france dukes marquises the elite of her troop of lovers lords and gentlemen crowded the passages flinging their bouquets for her carpet as she passed and poor scholars young poets youths without a souamongst them diderot gilbert jeanjacques rousseaupressed forward to catch a glimpse by the light of the links of this beauty on which only the eyes of grands seigneurs who could dress cupidon in a court habit parfile dor were allowed to gaze closely as she left the francais after her unmatched and uninterrupted triumphs and went to her carriage with richelieu the suppers of thargelie dumarsais were renowned through paris they equalled in magnificence the suppers of the regency rivalled them for license and surpassed them for wit all the world might flock to her fetes where she undisguisedly sought to surpass the lavishness of versailles even by having showers of silver flung from her windows to the people in the streets below but to her soupers a huis clos only a chosen few were admitted and men would speak of having supped with la dumarsais as boastfully as women of having supped with the king at choisy what you have lost in not seeing her play phedre helvetius would have excused you all the talk of his salons is not worth one glance at la dumarsais mon ami you will be converted to paris when once you have seen her said the marquis de la thorilliere as his carriage stopped in the chaussee dantin leon de tallemont laughed and thought of the eyes that would brighten at his glance and the heart that would beat against his once more under the vine shadows of lorraine no new magic however seductive should have strength to shake his allegiance to that memory and true to his violet in lorraine he defied the queen of the foyer we are late but that is always a more pardonable fault than to be too early said the marquis as they were ushered across the vestibule through several salons into the supperroom hung with rich tapestries of les nymphes au bain diane chasseresse and apollon et daphne with gilded consoles and rosewood buffets enamelled with medallion groups and crowded with sevres and porcelaine de saxe while venetian mirrors at each end of the salle reflected the table with its wines and fruits and flowers its gold dishes and bohemian glass the air was heavily perfumed and vibrating with laughter the guests were richelieu bievre saxe detissac montcrif and lovely marie camargo the queen of the coulisses who introduced the short skirts of the ballet and upheld her innovation so stanchly amidst the outcries of scandalized jansenists and journalists but even marie camargo herself paledand would have paled even had she been what she was not in the first flush of her youthbefore the superb beauty the languid voluptuousness the sensuous grace the southern eyes the full lips like the open leaves of a damask rose melting yet mocking of the most beautiful and most notorious woman of a day in which beauty and notoriety were rife the woman with the diamond of louis quinze sparkling in the light upon her bosom whom versailles and paris hailed as thargelie dumarsais the air scented with amber rang with the gay echoes of a stanza of dorats chanted by marie camargo the cupids and bacchantes painted in the panels of sevres seemed to laugh in sympathy with the revel over which they presided the light flashed on the kings diamond to which richelieu pointed with a wicked whisper for the marshal was getting tired of his own reign and his master might pay his court when he would thargelie dumarsais more beautiful still at her petit souper than at her petit lever with her hair crowned with roses true flowers of venus that might have crowned aspasia looked up laughingly as her lacqueys ushered in le marquis de la thorilliere and le chevalier de tallemont m le marquis cried the actress you are late it is an impertinence forbidden at my court i shall sup in future with barred doors like m dorleans then all you latecomers through the scented air through the echoing laughter stopping her own words broke a startled bitter cry mon dieu cest favette thargelie dumarsais shrank back in her rose velvet fauteuil as though the blow of a dagger had struck her the color fled from her lips and underneath the delicate rouge on her cheeks her hand trembled as it grasped the kings aigrette favettefavette who calls me that it was a forgotten name the name of a bygone life that fell on her ear with a strange familiar chime breaking in on the wit the license the laughter of her midnight supper as the subdued and mournful sound of vesper bells might fall upon the wild refrains and noisy drinkingsongs of bacchanalian melody a surprised silence fell upon the group the laughter hushed the voices stopped it was a strange interruption for a midnight supper thargelie dumarsais involuntarily rose her lips white her eyes fixed her hand clasped convulsively on the kings diamond a vague speechless terror held mastery over her an awe she could not shake off had fastened upon her as though the dead had risen from their graves and come thither to rebuke her for the past forgotten the innocence lost the roses in her hair the flowers of revel touched a cheek blanched as though she beheld some unearthly thing and the hand that lay on the royal jewel shook and trembled favette favette she echoed again it is so many years since i heard that name her guests sat silent still comprehending nothing of this single name which had such power to move and startle her richelieu alone leaning back in his chair leisurely picked out one of his brandycherries and waited as a man waits for the next scene at a theatre is it an unexpected tragedy or an arranged comedy ma chere ought one to cry or to laugh give me the mot dordre his words broke the spell and called thargelie dumarsais back to the world about her actress by profession and by nature she rallied with a laugh putting out her jewelled hand with a languid glance from her long almondshaped eyes a friend of early years my dear duc that is all ah monsieur de tallemont what a strange rencontre when did you come to paris i scarcely knew you at the first moment you have so long been an exile one may pardonably be startled by your apparition and take you for a ghost i suppose you never dreamed of meeting favette fontanie under my nom de theatre ah how we change do we not leon time is so short we have no time to stand still marie ma chere give monsieur le chevalier a seat beside youhe cannot be happier placed leon de tallemont heard not a word that she spoke he stood like a man stunned and paralyzed by a sudden and violent blow his head bowed a mortal pallor changing his face to the hues of death the features that were a moment before bright laughing and careless now set in mute and rigid anguish favette favette he murmured hoarsely in the vague dreamy agony with which a man calls wildly and futilely on the beloved dead to come back to him from the silence and horror of the grave peste laughed richelieu this castoff lover seems a strange fellow does he not know that absent people have never the presumption to dream of keeping their places but learn to give them graciously upshall i teach him the lesson if he have his sixteen quarterings a prick of my sword will soon punish his impudence the jeer fell unheeded on leon de tallemonts ear had he heard it the flippant sneer would have had no power to sting him then regardless of the men around the suppertable he grasped thargelie dumarsaiss hands in his this is how we meet she shrank away from his glance terrified she scarce knew why at the mute anguish upon his face perhaps for a moment she realized how utterly she had abused the love and wrecked the life of this man perhaps with his voice came back to her thronging thoughts of guileless days memories ringing through the haze of years as distant chimes ring over the water from lands we have quitted reaching us when we have floated far away out to seamemories of an innocent and untroubled life when she had watched the woodland flowers open to the morning sun and listened to the song of the brooks murmuring over the violet roots and heard the sweet evening song of the birds rise to heaven under the deep vine shadows of lorraine one moment she was silent her eyes falling troubled and guilty beneath his gaze then she looked up laughing gayly and flashing on him her languid lustrous glance you look like a somnambulist mon ami did nobody ever tell you then how mme de la vrilliere carried me off from lorraine and brought me in her train to paris till when favette fontanie was tired of being petted like the spaniel the monkey and the parrot she broke away from madame la marquise and made after a little probation at the foire st laurent her appearance at the francais as thargelie dumarsais allons donc have i lost my beauty that you look at me thus you should be reminding me of the proverb on revient toujours a ses premiers amours surely thargelie dumarsais will be as attractive to teach such a lesson as that little peasant girl favette used to be bah leon can i not love you as well again in paris as i once loved you at grande charmille andwho knowsperhaps i will she leaned towards him her breath fanning his cheek her scented hair brushing his lips her lustrous eyes meeting his with eloquent meaning her lips parted with the resistless witchery of that melting and seductive sourire damour to which they were so admirably trained he gazed down on her breathless silencestrickengazed down on the sorceress beauty to which the innocent loveliness of his lorraine flower had changed was this woman with the rouge upon her cheeks the crimson roses in her hair the mocking light in her eyes the wicked laugh on her lips the diamond glittering like a serpents eye in her bosomwas she the guileless child he had left weeping on the broken steps of the fountain tears as pure as the dew in the violetbells with the summer sunlight streaming round her and no shade on her young brow darker than the fleeting shadow flung from above by the vineleaves a cry broke once more from his lips would to god i had died before tonight then he lifted his head with a smile upon his facea smile that touched and vaguely terrified all those who saw itthe smile of a breaking heart i thank you for your proffered embraces but i am faithful i love but one and i have lost her favette is dead i know nothing of thargelie dumarsais the courtesan he bowed low to her and left hernever to see her face again a silence fell on those he had quitted even upon richelieu perhaps even he realized that all beauty faith and joy were stricken from this mans life andreality of feeling was an exile so universally banished from the gay salons of the dixhuitieme siecle that its intrusion awed them as by the unwonted presence of some ghostly visitant thargelie dumarsais sat silenther thoughts had flown away once more from her brilliant supperchamber to the fountain at grande charmille she was seeing the dragonflies flutter among the elmboughs and the water ripple over the wild thyme she was feeling the old priests goodnight kiss upon her brow and her own hymn rise and mingle with the chant of the vesper choir she was hearing the song of the forestbirds echo in the lorraine woods and a fond voice whisper to her fear not favettewe shall meet as we part richelieu took up his dresden saucer of cherries once more with a burst of laughter voila un drolethis fellow takes things seriously what fools there are in this world it will be a charming little story for versailles dieu how louis will laugh when i tell it him i fear though ma cherie that the friend of your childhood will make you lose your reputation by his impolite epithets when one has nothing one can lose nothingeh ma chere laughed marie camargo monsieur le duc she does not hear us no linfidele cried richelieu mademoiselle i see plainly you love this rude lover of bygone days better than you do usis it not the truth chut nobody asks for truths in a polite age laughed thargelie dumarsais shaking off unwelcome memories once for all and looking down at the kings diamond gleaming in the lightthe diamond that prophesied to her the triumph of the kings love naturally added la camargo my friend i shall die with envy of your glorious jewel dieu comme il brille deadly dash a story told on the off day on the offday after the derby everybody except the great winners is it will be generally admitted the resigned prey to a certain gentle sadness not to say melancholy that will only dissipate itself under a prolonged regimen of s and b seidlitz well dashed with amontillado or certain heavenly west indian decoctionsthis indisposition i would suggest we should call delicately and dubiously epsomitis it will serve to describe innumerable forms and degrees of the reactionary malady there is the severest shape of all dead money that covers four figures dropped irretrievably and lost to the milkers lost always you say because of a cough or because of a close finish or because of something dark or because of a strain in the practising gallops or because of a couple of brutes that cannoned just at the start and never of course because the horse you had fancied was sheerly and simply only fit for a plater there is the second severe form when you awake with a cheerful expectation of a summons for driving at twelve miles an hour as if that wasnt moderate and discreet and for thereby smashing a greengrocers cart into the middle of next week and running a waggonette into an omnibus as you came back from the downs of which you have no more remembrance than that there was a crash and a smash and a womans screams and a mans dn the swells and a tintamarre of roaring conductor and bellowing greengrocer and infuriated females through which you dashed somehow with a cheermore shame for youand a most inappropriate lafricaine chorus from the men on your drag there is the milder form which is only the rueful recollection of seeing in a wild ecstasy the chestnut with the white blaze sweep with his superb stride to the front and of having in your moment of rapturous gratitude to the red and blue rushed unintentionally during the discussion of fortnum and masons hamper into a promise to take euphrosyne brown to baden in august where you know very well she will cost you more than all your sums netted through gladiateur there are the slenderer touches of the malady which give you over your breakfast coffee a certain dolorous meditation as to how you could have been such a fool as to have placed all your trust in danebury or to have put in a hole through spring cottage just what your yacht costs for three months which makes you wonder why on earth you took that lot of actresses on to the hill and threw money enough away on them in those wages of idiotcy or wages of sin as your uncle the dean would translate it of cashmeres eau de cologne gloves and bracelets to have purchased those two weightcarriers offered you at l the pair and dirtcheap at that or which makes you only dully and headachily conscious that you drank champagne up on the boxseat as if you were a young fellow from eton and now pay for the juvenile folly as you know you deserve to do when that beautiful white burgundy at your club or your own cool perfect claret at home seems to stare you in the face and ask why did you crack all those bottles of dry on the downs there are symptoms and varieties innumerable of the malady that i propose shall be known henceforward as epsomitis therefore the offday finds everybody more or less slightly doneup and mournful twentyfour hours and the oaks if properly prepared for by a strictly medicinal course of brulesgueules as the chasseurs say smoked perseveringly will bring all patients round on the friday but during the twentyfour hours a sense that all on and off the course is vanity and vexation of spirit will generally and somnolently predominate in the universal and fashionable disease of epsomitis one offday after the magnificent victory of monarques unrivalled son an acquaintance of mine suffering considerably from these symptoms sought my philosophy and my prescriptions a very sharp irritant for epsomitis may be administered in the form of i told you so its all your own fault but this species of blister and douche bath combined is rarely given unless the patient be mad enough to let his wife if he unluckily have one learn what ails him as far as i was concerned i was much too sympathetic with the sufferer to be down upon him with the triumphant reminder that i had cautioned him all along not to place his trust in russley i instead prescribed him cool wines and led him on to talk of other peoples misfortunes the very best way to get reconciled with your own we talked of old times of old memories of old acquaintance in the twilight between derby and oaks we got a little melancholy too much champagne is always productive on the morrow of a gently sentimental tinge and a man is always inclined to look on the world as a desert when he has the conviction that he himself has been made a fool in it among other names that of deadly dash came up between us what had become of him i did not know he did he told me and i will tell it here for the story is of the past now deadly dash what a shot he was never missed said my friend whose own gun is known well enough at hornseywood house therewith falling into a reverie tinged with the jacqueslike gloom of epsomitis in its severest form from which he awoke to tell me slowly between long draughts of iced drinks what i write now i alter his tale in nothing save in filling in with words the gaps and blanks that he made alleloquent in his halting oratory by meditative plaintive moralizing puffs from his tonic the brule gueule and an occasional appeal to my imagination in the customary formula of oh botheryou understandall the rest of it you know which though it tells everything over claret is not so clear a mode of relation in type for all else here the story is as he gave it to me deadly dash it was a fatal sounding sobriquet and had a fatal fascination for many for me as well as the rest when i was in my salad days and joined the old th amongst whose light dragoons it was so signally and ominously famous the nickname had a wide significance he always kills was said with twofold truth in twofold meaning of dash in a barriere duel he would wheel lightly aim carelessly and send the ball straight as any arrow through heart or lung just as he fancied in the neatest style anybody could dream of and in an intrigue he took just the same measures and hit as invariably with the selfsame skill and the selfsame indifference he always kills applied equally to either kind of affair and got him his sobriquet which he received with as laughing an equanimity as a riding man gets the gilt vase or a lover of the leash the ravensworth stakes or the puppy cup and goblet he was proud of it and had only one regret that he lived in the dead days of the duel and could only go out when he was on french soil in daredevilry of every sort he outheroded herod and distanced any who were mad enough to try the pace with him in that steeplechase commonly called going to the bad it was a miracle how often he used to reach the stage of complete ruin that the prince de soubise once sighed for as an unattainable paradise and picked himself up again without a hair turned as one may say and started off with as fresh a pace as though nothing had knocked him over other men got his speed sometimes but nobody could ever equal his stay for an out and out goer there was nobody like deadly dash and though only a captain of horse with few expectations he did what dukes darent have done and lived at a faster rate than all the elder sons in the kingdom put together dash had the best bow and the brightest wits the lightest morals and the heaviest debts of any sabreur in the service very unscrupulous fellows were staggered at his devilmecare vices and as for reputationa deuced pleasant fellow dash they used to say at the curragh in the guards club at thatched house anniversary dinners in north indian cantonments in brighton barrackrooms or in any of the many places where deadly dash was a household word a very pleasant fellow no end fit always best fun in life over the olives when you get him in humor shoot you dead though next morning if he want and you be handy for him in a neat snug little bad make some devil of a mot on you too afterwards just as pleasantly as if he were offering you a lopez to smoke now that was just the sort of celebrity that made me mad to see the owner of it there wasnt a living being except that years favorite out of the whitewall establishment that i was half so eager to look at or so reverent when i thought of as the killer i was very young then i had gone through a classic course of yellow covers from jeffs and rolandis and i had a vague impression that a man who had had a dozen barriere affairs abroad and been enfant to every lovely lionne of his day must of necessity be like the heroes of delphine demireps novels who had each of them always a je ne sais quoi de farouche et de fier dans ses grands yeux noirs et toute la revelation dune ame usee mais dominee par des passions encore inepuisables ecrite sur son sombre et pale visage c c in the demireps most telling style i dont know quite what i expected to see in the killer but i think it was a sort of compound of monte christo mephistopheles and murat mixed in one what i did see was a slight delicate man with a face as fair and soft as a girls the gentlest possible manners and a laugh like music deadly dash had led a life as bad as he could lead had lit his cigar without a tremor in the wrist on many gray mornings while his adversary lay dying hard among the red rank grasses had gamed so deep twentyfour hours at a stretch that the most reckless galerie in europe held their breath to watch his play had had a tongue of silver for his intrigues and a nerve of steel for his vendetta had lived in reckless rioting and drunk deep but the demirep would not have had him at any price in her romance he looked so simply and quietly thoroughbred he was so utterly guiltless of all her orthodox traits the gentlest of mortals was deadly dash when you first heard his sweet silvery voice and his laughter as light and airy as a womans you would never believe how often abroad there a dead man had been left to get stiff and cold among the clotted herbage while the killer went out of the town by the early express smoking and reading the charivari and sipping some cold curacoa punch out of his flask of course growled a man to me once in the guards smokingroom an order of the scots fusilleers to montreal having turned him misanthrope did mephistopheles ever come out in full harness with horns and tail complete eh not such a fool he looked like a gentleman and talked like a wit would the most dunderheaded cain in christendom i should be glad to know be such an ass as to go about town with the brand on his forehead when he could turn down bond street any day and get a dash of the ladies pearl powder who ever shows anything now my good fellow not that dash paints to give the deuce his dueexcept himself a little blacker even than he is he dont cant he couldnt cant not to save his life i believe but as to his bewitching you almost as bad as he does the women i know all about that i used to swear by him till till what till he cut a brother of mine out with rachel and shot him in the woods of chantilly for flaringup rough at the rivalry charlie was rather a good fellow and dash and i didnt speak after that you see great bore bosh too perhaps dash brews the best curacoa punch in europe and if he name you the winning mount for the granby you may let the talent damn you as they like still you know as he killed charlie and the guardsman stuck a great cheroot in his mouth in doubt as to whether after all it wasnt humbug and an uncalledfor sacrifice rather scenic and sentimental to drop an expert at curacoa brew and a sure prophet for croxton park just because in a legitimate fashion he had potted your brother and relieved your entailon the whole a friendly act rather than otherwise keep clear of the killer though young one he added as he sauntered out hes like that cheetah cub of berkeleys soft as silk you know patte de velours and what dye call em and all the rest of it but deucedly deadly to deal with i did know it was the eternal refrain that was heard on all sides from the wily jews through whose meshes he slipped the unhappy duns who were done by him the beauties who were bewitched by him the hosts and husbands who having him down for the pheasants found him poach other preserves than those of the coversides the women who had their characters shattered by a silvery sneer from a voice that was as soft in its murderous slander as in its equally murderous wooing and all the rest who in some shape or another owed ruin to that apollo apollyondeadly dash ruin which at last became so wide and so deep that even vice began to look virtuous when his name was mentioned vice always does when she thinks you are really cleared out and men of his own corps and his own club began to get shy of having the killers arm linked in theirs too often down pall mall for its wrist was terribly steady in either hazard whether of the yard of green table or the twenty yards of green turf at last the crisis came the killer killed one too many a russian prince in the bois de vincennes in a quarrel about a pretty wretched little chorussinger of the cafe alcazar who took their fancies both at once the mondes thought it terribly wicked not the deed you know but the audacity of a cavalry mans having potted a very serene high mightiness in a duke all these crimes and crimcons though as scarlet would have been held but the crimson golddotted fruit adorning the strawberryleaves deadly dash a light dragoon whose name was signed to plenty of floating little bills could not bid high enough to purchase his pardon from society which says to its sinners with austere front of virtue oblivion cannot be hiredunless adds society dropping to mellowest murmur her whisper unless you can give us a premium so dash with a certain irresistible though private pressure upon him from the horse guardssent in his papers to sell what had been done so often could not now be done again the first steeplechaser in the service could not at last even save his stake but was finally irretrievably struck out certainly the fellow was a bad fellow and deserved his crash so far he had no scruples and no conscience he spared neither woman nor man of remorse he had never felt a twinge and if you were in his path he would pick you off some way or other as indifferently as if you were one of the pigeons at hornsey and yet he had been kind to me though i was a young one with his own variable free lance sort of liberality the man would give his last sou to get you out of any difficulty and would carry off your mistress or beggar you at chickenhazard with the selfsame pleasant air the next day and i could not help being sorry that things had come to this pass with him he shot so superbly put him where you would in a warm corner while the bouquets of pheasants were told off in a punt while a square halfmile of wildducks whirred up from the marshes in a dark forest alley in transylvania while the great boar rushed down through the twilight foaming blood and roaring fury in a still indian night with the only target here and there a dusky head diving amidst the jhow jungle three hundred yards away put him where you would he was such a magnificent shot the sins of a frankenstein should not have lost such a marksman as deadly dash to the service but the authorities thought otherwise they were not open to the fact that the man who had been out in more barriere affairs and had won more grand military stakes than any other should by all laws of warpolicy have had his blackest transgressions forgiven him till he could have been turned to account against ghoorkas maories or caffres the authorities instead made him send in his papers not knowing the grand knack of turning a scamp into a heroa process that requires some genius and some clairvoyance in the manipulatorand deadly dash with his lightest and airiest laugh steamed down channel one late autumn night marked disgraced and outlawed for creditors by the score were after him knowing very well that he and his old gay lawless life and his own wild pleasant world and his old lands yonder in the green heart of the grass countries that had gone rood by rood to the hebrews were all divorced for ever with a great gulf between them that could never close so he dropped out of the service out of the country out of remembrance out of regret nobody said a de profundis over him and some men breathed the freer we can rarely be sure of any who will be sorry to miss us but we can always be certain of some to be glad we are gone and in the killers case these last were legion here and there were one or two who owed him a wayward inconstant bizarre fit of generosity but there were on the other hand hundreds who owed him nothing less than entire ruin so deadly dash went with nobody to regret him and nobody to think of him for a second after the nine hours wonder in the clubs and the messrooms that his levanting under a cloud occasioned and so the old sobriquet that had used to have so signal a notoriety dropped out of mens mouths and was forgotten where he was gone no one knew and to be sure no one asked metaphorically he was gone to the devil and when a man takes that little tour if he furnish talk for a day he has had very distinguished and lengthened obsequies as friendship goes in this world now and then in the course of halfadozen years i remembered him when i looked up at the head of a royal over my mantelpiece with thirteen points that he had stalked once in ayrshire and given to me but nobody else gave a thought to the killer time passed and whether he had been killed fighting in chili or bolivia shot himself at homburg become mussulman and entered the sultans army gone to fight with the kabyles and bedouins turned brigand for the neapolitan bourbons or sunk downward by the old wellworn stage so sadly and so often travelled into an adventurer living by the skill of his ecarte and the dread surety of his shot we did not know we did not care when society has given a man the sack it matters uncommonly little whether he has given himself a shroud seven or eight years after the name of deadly dash had ceased to be heard among cavalry men and quoted on all things horsey whether of the flat or of the ridge and furrow i was in the confederate states on leave for a six months tour there it was after lees raid across the border and the days of gettysburgh i had run the blockade in a fastbuilt clipper and pushed on at once into the heart of virginia to be in the full heat of whatever should come on the cards cutting the cities rather and keeping as much as i could to the camps and the woods for i wanted to see the real thing in the rough in my relish for adventure however i was a trifle as it proved too foolhardy starting alone one day to cross the thirty miles or so that parted me from the encampment of some virginian horse with no other companions than a very weedylooking steel gray and a brace of revolvers i fairly lost tracks and had not a notion of my way out of a wilderness of morass and forest all glowing with the scarlet and the green of the indian summer here and there were beautiful wild pools and lakes shut in by dense vegetation so dense that at noon it was dark as twilight and great tablelands of rock jutted out black and rugged in places but chiefly as far as was to be seen stretched the deep entangled woodland with nothing else to break it brooding quietly over square leagues of swamp the orioles were singing their sweetest wildest music overhead sign of war there was none save to be sure now and then when i came on a black arid circle where a few charred timbers showed where a hut had been burnt down and deserted or my horse shied and snorted uneasily and half stumbled over some shapeless log on the grounda log that when you looked closer was the swollen shattered body of a man who had died hard with the grasses wrenched up in his fingers that the ants had eaten bare and the hollows of his eyes staring open where the carrion birds had plucked the eyeballs out and near him there were sure to be half sunk in swamp or cleaned to skeletons by the eagles and hawks five or ten or twenty more lying nameless and unburied there where they had fallen in some scuffle with pickets or some stray cavalry skirmish to be told off as missing and to be thought of no more these groups i came upon more than once rotting among the rich virginian soil while the scarlet and purple weight of blossoming boughs swayed above and the bright insect life fluttered humming around them they were the only highway marks through the wooded wilderness so lonely was it mile after mile and so little notion had i of either the way in or the way out that the hallali of a boarhunt or the sweet mellow tongues of the hounds when they have found in the coverts at home were never brighter music to me than the sharp crack of rifles and the long sullen roll of musketry as they suddenly broke the silence while i rode along firing from the west that lay on my left the gray used to powder pointed his ears and quickened his pace though a weedy fiddleheaded beast his speed was not bad and i rattled him over the ground crashing through undergrowth and wading through pools with all my blood up at the tune of those ringing cheery shots the roar growing louder and louder with every moment and the sulphur scent of the smoke borne stronger and stronger down on the wind till the horse broke pelemele through a network of parasites dashed downward along a slope of dank herbage slipping at every step and with his hind legs tucked under him and shot like a runin for a race on to a green plateau where the skirmish was going on in hot earnest a glance told me how the land lay a handful of southern troopers held their own with tremendous difficulty against three divisions of federal infantry whom they had unexpectedly encountered as the latter were marching across the plateau with some batteries of foot artillerythe odds were probably scarcely less than five to one the southerners were fighting magnificently as firm in their close square of four hundred as the consular guard at marengo but so surrounded by the northern host that they looked like a little island circled round by raging breakers glancing down on the plain as my horse scoured and slid along the incline the nucleus of southerners looked hopelessly lost amidst the belching fire and pressing columns of the enemy the whole was surrounded and hidden by the whirling clouds of dust and smoke that swirled above in a white heavy mist but through this the sabres flashed the horses heads reared maddened and foamcovered like so many basreliefs of bucephalus the lean riflebarrels glittered and for a moment i saw the southern leader steady as a rock in the centre hewing like a trooper right and left and with a gray herons feather floating from his sombrero a signal that seemed as well known and as closely followed as the snowy plume of murat to have looked on at this and not have taken a share in it one would have been a stone not a man and much less a cavalryman i need not tell you that i smashed the gray across the plateau hurled him into the thick of the melee dashed somehow through the federal ranks and was near the gray plume and fighting for the old dominion before you could have shouted a stave of dixie i was a noncombatant i was a neutraldelicate angloeuphemism for coward friend to neither and traitor to bothi was on a tour of observation and had no business to fire a shot for one or the other perhaps but i forgot all that and with the bridle in my teeth and a pistol in each hand i rode down to give one blow the more for the weak side how superbly that gray feather foughtkeeping his men well up round him though saddle after saddle was emptied and horse after horse tore riderless out of the ranks or reeled over on their heads spurting blood he sat like a statue he fought like a titan his sabre seemed flashing unceasingly in the air so often was it raised to come down again like lightning through a swordarm or lay open a skull to the brains the shots ploughed up the earth round him and rattled like hail through the air a score of balls were aimed at him alone a score of sabres crossed his own but he was cool as st lawrence ice and laid the men dead in struggling heaps under his chargers hoofs only to fight near the man was a glorious intoxication you seemed to breathe blood till you got drunk with it the four hundred had been mowed down to two i did as good work as i could having wrenched a sword out of some dead troopers hand but i was only one and the northerners counted by thousands come out of it alive i never expected to do but i vow it was the happiest day of my lifethe pace was so splendidly fast the gray feather at last glanced anxiously around his men stuck like death to him ready to be hewed down one by one and die game his teeth were set tight and his eyes had a flash in them like steel charge and cut through he shouted his voice rolling out like a clarion giving an order that it seemed could be followed by nothing short of supernatural aid the southrons thought otherwise they only heard to obey they closed up as steadily as though they were a squadron on parade despite the great gaps between them of dying chargers and of heapedup killed and wounded that broke their ranks like so much piled stones and timber they halted a moment the murderous fire raking them right and left front and rear then with that dense mass of troops round them they charged shivered the first line that wedged them in pierced by sheer force of impetus the columns that opened fire in their path wrenched themselves through as through the steel jaws of a trap and swept out on to the green level of the open plateau with a wild rallying virginian shout that rings in my ears now i have been in a good many hot things in my time but i never knew anything that for pace and long odds could be anything near to that i had kept with them through the charge with no other scratch than a shoulder cut and i had been close to their chief through it all when we were clean out on the plains beyond pursuitfor the unionmen had not a squadron of cavalry though their guns at long range belched a storm in our wakehe turned in his saddle without checking his mares thundering gallop and levelled his rifle that was slung at his aide ill have the general anyhow he said quietly taking aimstill without checking his speedat the knot of staffofficers that now were scarce more than specks in a blurred mass of mist he fired and the centre figure in that indistinct and fastvanishing group fell from the saddle while the yell of fury that the wind faintly floated nearer told us that the shot had been deadly the gray feather laughed a careless airy laugh of triumph while he swept on at topmost pace a little more and we should dive down into the dark aisles of grand foresttrees and cavernous ravines of timber roads safe from all pursuit a second and we should reach the green core of the safe and silent woods the cool shelter of mountainbacked lakes the sure refuge of tangled coverts it was a guinea to a shilling that we gained it it was all but won a moments straight runin and we should have it but that moment was not to be ours out of the narrow cleft of a valley on the left all screened with hanging tumbled foliage and dark as death there poured suddenly across our front a dense body of federal troopers and horse artillery two thousand strong at the least full gallop to join the main army we were surrounded in a second in a second overpowered by sheer strength of numbers only two hundred of us many sorely wounded and on mounts that were jaded and ridden out of all pace let us fight as we would what could we do against fresh and picked soldiers swarming down on us like a swarm of hornets while in our rear was the main body through which we had just cut our way that the little desperate band died hard i need not say but the vast weight of the fresh squadrons pressed our little knot in as if between the jaws of a trap crushing it like grain between two iron weights the gray feather fought like all the knights of the round table merged in one till he streamed with blood from head to foot and his sabre was hacked and bent like an ashstick as did a man near him a tall superb virginian handsome as any vandyke or velasquez picture at last both the gray feather and he went down not by deathit would not come to thembut literally hurled out of their stirrupleathers by crowding scores who poured on them hamstrung or shot their horses and made them themselves prisonersnot however till the assailants lay heaped ten deep about their slaughtered chargers for myself a blow from a sabre a second afterwards felled me like so much wood i saw a whirling blaze of sun a confused circling eddy of dizzy color forked flames and flashes of light and i knew no more till i opened my eyes in a dark square unhealthy wooden chamber with a dreamy but settled conviction that i was dead and in the family vault far away under the green old elms of warwickshire with the rooks cawing above my head as the delusion dissipated and the mists cleared i saw through the uncertain light a face that was strangely but vaguely familiar to me connected somehow with incoherent memories of life at home and yet unknown to me it was bronzed deeply bearded with flakes of gray among the fairness of the hair much aged much worn scarred and stained just now with the blood of undressed wounds and the dust of the combat for there was no one merciful enough there to bring a stoup of water it was rougher darker sterner and yet with it all nobler too than the face that i had known i lay and stared blankly at it it was the face of the southern leader of the morning who sat now on a pile of straw looking wearily out to the dying sun one amongst a group of twenty prisoners all like myself i moved and he turned his eyes on me they had laid me down there as a gone coon and were amazed to see me come to life again as our eyes met i knew himhe was deadly dash the old name left my lips with a shout as strong as a halfkilled man can give it seemed so strange to meet him there captives together in the unionists hands it struck him with a sharp shock england and he had been divorced so long i saw the blood leap to his forehead and the light into his glance then with a single stride he reached the straw i lay on holding my hands in his looking on me with the kindly eyes that had used to make me like the killer and greeting me with a warmth that was only damped and darkened by regret that my battle done for fair virginia had laid me low a prisoner with himself and that we should meet thus in so sharp an hour of adversity with nothing before us but the capitol the carroll prison or worse yet thus we did meet once more and i knew at last what had been the fate of deadly dash whom england had outlawed as a scoundrel and the new world had found a hero though suffering almost equally himself he tended me with the kindliest sympathy he came out of his own care to ponder how possible it might be to get me eventual freedom as a tourist and a mere accidental sharer in the fray he was interested to hear all that i would tell him of my own affairs and of his old friends in england but of himself he would not speak he simply said he had been fighting for the confederacy ever since the war had begun and i saw that he strove in vain to shake off a deep heartbroken gloom that seemed to have settled on him doubtless as i thought from the cruel defeat of the noon and the hopeless captivity into which he the most restless and the most daring soldier that oversaw service was now flung i noticed too that every now and then while he sat beside me talking lowfor there were sentinels both in and out the rude outhouse of the farm that had been turned into our temporary prisonhis eyes wandered to the gallant virginian who had been felled down with himself and who covered like himself with blood and dust and with his broken left arm hanging shattered lay on the bare earth in a faroff corner motionless and silent with his lips pressed tight under their long black moustaches and such a mute unutterable agony in his eyes as i never saw in any human face though i have seen deaths enough in the field and the sickward the rest of the confederate captives were more ordinary men although from none was a single word of lament ever wrenched but this superb virginian excited my interest and i asked his name in that sort of languid curiosity at passing things which comes with weakness of the killer whose glance so incessantly wandered towards him stuart lane he answered curtly and added no more but if i ever saw in this world hatred passionate ungovernable and intense i saw it in the killers look as his glance flashed once more on to the motionless form of the handsomest bravest and most dauntless officer of his gallant regiment that he had seen cut to pieces there on that accursed plateau a major of yours i asked him ah i thought so he fought magnificently how wretched he looks though he is too proud to show it he is thinking ofof his bride he married three weeks ago the words were simple enough and spoken very quietly but there was an unsteadiness as of great effort over them and the heel of his heavy spurred jackboot crashed into the dry mud with a grinding crush as though it trod terrible memories down was it a woman who was between these two comrades in arms and companions in adversity i wondered if it were so even in that moment of keen and heavy anxiety for us all as i looked at the face that bent very kindly over the straw to which a shot in the knee and a deep though not dangerous shoulderwound bound me it was very different to the face of eight or nine years beforebrowner harder graver far and yet there was a look as if sorrow had passed by there and swept the old heartlessness and gay callousness away burning them out in its fires silence fell over us in that wretched outshed where we were huddled together i was hot with incipient fever and growing lightheaded enough though i knew what passed before me to speak to dash once or twice in a dreamy idea that we were in the shires watching the runin for the soldiers blue riband the minutes dragged very drearily as the day wore itself away there were the sullen monotonous tramp of the sentinels to and fro and from without the neighing of horses the bugle calls the roll of the drums the challenge of outpostsall the varied endless sounds of a camp for the farmhouse in whose shed we were thrown was the headquarters pro tem of the federal general who commanded the divisions that had cost the killers handful of horse so fearfully dear we were prisoners and escape was impossible all arms of course had been removed from us most like myself were too disabled by wounds to have been able to avail ourselves of escape had it been possible and the guard was doubled both in and out the shed there was nothing before any of us but the certainty of imprisonment in all its horrors in some faroff fortress or obscure jail there was the possible chance that since certain officers on whom the northerners set great store had lately fallen into southern hands an exchange might be effected yet on the other side graver apprehensions still existed since we knew that the general into whose camp we had been brought had proclaimed his deliberate purpose of shooting the three next secessionist officers who fell into his power in requital for three of his own officers who had been shot or were said to have been shot by a southern raider we knew very well that the threat made it would be executed and each of us as the sun sank gradually down through the hot skies that were purple and stormy after the burning day knew too that it might never rise again to greet our sight none of us would have heeded whether a ball would hit or miss us in the open in a fair fight in a mantoman struggle but the boldest and most careless amidst us felt it very bitter to die like dogs to die as prisoners even deadly dash coolest most hardened most devilmaycare of soldiers and of sinners sat with his gaze fastened on the slowly sinking light in the west with the shadow of a great pain upon his face while every now and then his glance wandered to stuart lane and a quick irrepressible shudder shook him whenever it did so the virginian never moved no sign of any sort escaped him but the passionate misery that looked out of his eyes i never saw equalled except perhaps in the eyes of a stag that i once shot in wallachia and that looked up with just such a look before it died he was thinking no doubt of the woman he lovedwooed amidst danger won amidst calamity scarcely possessed ere lost for everthinking of her proud beauty of her bridal caress that would never again touch his lips of her fair life that would perish with the destruction of his exhaustion from the loss of blood made everything pass dreamily and yet with extraordinary clearness before me i felt in a wakening dream and had no sense whatever of actual existence and yet the whole scene was so intensely vital and vivid to me that it seemed burned into my very brain itself it was like the phantasmagoria of delirium utterly impalpable but yet intensely real i had no power to act or resist but i seemed to have ten times redoubled power to see and hear and feel i was aware of all that passed with a hundredfold more susceptibility to it than i ever felt in health i remember a total impossibility that came on me to decide whether i was dreaming or was actually awake twilight fell night came there was a change of sentries and a light set up in a bottle shed a flickering feeble yellow gleam over the interior of the shed on the dark rembrandt faces of the southerners and on the steel of the guards bayonets and i recollect that the killer who sat by the tossed straw on which they had flung me laughed the old low sweet halfinsolent laugh that i had known so well in early days il faut souffrir pour etre beau we are picturesque at any rate quite salvatoresque little dickey would make a good thing of us if he could paint us now he is alive i suppose i answered him i believe in the affirmative but the name of that little bohemian of the brush who had used to be our butt and protege in england added a haze the more to my senses by this time i had difficulty to hold together the thread of how and when and why i had thus met again the face that looked out on me so strangely familiarly in the dull sickly trembling of the feeble light of this black noisome shed in the heart of federal divisions through that haze i heard the challenge of the sentries i saw a soldier prod with his bayonet a young lad who had fainted from haemorrhage and whom he swore at for shamming i was conscious of the entrance of a group of officers whom i knew afterwards to be the northern general and his staff who came to look at their captives i knew but only dreamily still that these men were the holders of our fate and would decide on it then and there i felt a listless indifference utter and opiumlike as to what became of me and i remember that stuart lane and dash himself rose together and stood looking with a serene and haughty disdain down on the conquerors who held their lives in the balancewithout a trace of pain upon their faces now i remember how like they looked to stags that turn at bay like the stags outnumbered hunted down with the blood of open wounds and the dust of the long chase on them but like the deer too uncowed and game to the finish very soon their doom was given seven were to be sent back with a flag of truce to be exchanged for the seven federal officers they wanted out of the southerners hands ten were to be transmitted to the prisons of the norththree were to be shot at daydawn in the reprisal before named the chances of life and of death were to be drawn for by lottery and at once not a sound escaped the virginians and not a muscle of their english leaders face moved the prisoners to a man heard impassively with a grave and silent dignity that they were to throw the die in hazard with death for the croupier and life for the stake the general and his staff waited to amuse themselves with personally watching the turns of this new rouge et noir gambling in lives was a little refreshing change that sultry dreary duncolored night camped amongst burntout farms and wasted cornlands slips of paper with exchange death and imprisonment written on them in the numbers needed were made ready rolled up and tossed into an empty canteen each man was required to come forward and draw i alone excepted because i was an officer of the british army i remember passionately arguing that they had no right to exempt me since i had been in the fray and had killed three men on my own hook and would have killed thirty more had i had the chance but i was perhaps incoherent in the fever that was fast seizing all my limbs from the rack of undressed wounds at any rate the northerners took no heed save to force me into silence and the drawing began as long as i live i shall see that night in remembrance with hideous distinctness the low blackened shed with its foetid odors from the cattle lately foddered there the yellow light flaring dully here and there the glisten of the cruel rifles the heaps of straw and hay soaked with clotted blood the group of union officers standing near the doorway and the warworn indomitable faces of the southerners with the fairer head and slighter form of their english chief standing out slightly in front of all the conscription of death commenced a federal private took the paper from each man as he drew it and read the word of destiny aloud not one amongst them faltered or paused one moment each wenteven those most exhausted most in agonywith a calm and steady step as they would have marched up to take the flag of the stars and bars from lee or longstreet not one waited a seconds breath before he plunged his hand into the fatal lottery deadly dash was the first called there was not one shadow of anxiety upon his face it was calm without effort careless without bravado simply entirely indifferent they took his paper and read the words of safety and of lifeexchange then for one instant a glory of hope flashed like the sun into his eyesto die the next die utterly three followed him and they all drew the fiat for detention the fifth called was stuart lane let him have suffered as he would he gave no sign of it now he approached with his firm bold cavalry step and his head haughtily lifted the proud fiery dauntless cavalier of ideal and of romance without a tremor in his wrist he drew his paper out and gave it one word alone fell distinct on the silence like the hiss of a shot through the nightdeath he bowed his head slightly as if in assent and stepped backwardstill without a sign his english chief gave him one lookit was that of merciless exultation of brutal joy of dark cainlike murderous hate but it passed passed quickly dashs head sank on his chest and on his face there was the shadow i think of a terrible strugglethe shadow i know of a great remorse he strove with his longing greed for this mans destruction he knew that he thirsted to see him die the virginian stood erect and silent a single night and the strong and gallant life the ardent passions the chivalrous courage to do and dare and the love that was in its first fond hours would all be quenched in him as though they had never been but he was a soldier and he gave no sign that his deathwarrant was not as dear to him as his bridalnight had been even his conquerors cast one glance of admiration on him it was only his leader who felt for him no pang of reverence and pity the lottery continued the hazard was played out life and death were scattered at reckless chance amidst the twenty who were the playthings of that awful gaming all had been done in perfect silence on the part of the condemned not one seemed to think or to feel for himself and in those who were sent out to their grave not a grudge lingered against their comrades of happier fortune deadly dash whose fate was release alone stood with his head sunk thoughtful and weary the three condemned to execution were remanded to separate and solitary confinement treated already as felons for that one short night which alone remained to them as his guards removed him stuart lane paused slightly and signed to his chief to approach him he held out his hand to dash and his voice was very low though it came to my ear where they stood beside me we were rivals once but we may be friends now as you have loved her be pitiful to her when you tell her of my deathgod knows it may be hers as you have loved her feel what it is to die without one last look on her face then and then only his bronze cheek grew white as a womans and his whole frame shook with one great silent sob his guard forced him on and his listener had made him no promise no farewell neither had he taken his hand he had heard in silence with a dark and evil gloom alone upon him the federal general sharply summoned him from his musing as the chief of those to be exchanged on the morrow under a white flag of parley there were matters to be stated to and to be arranged with him i will only see you alone general he answered curtly the northerner stared startled and casting a glance over the redoubtable leader of horse whose gray feather had become known and dreaded thought of possible assassination deadly dash laughed his old light ironic contemptuous laugh a wounded unarmed man can scarcely kill you have as many of your staff about you as you please but let none of my virginians be present at our interview the northerners thought he intended to desert to them or betray some movement of importance and assented and he went out with them from the cattleshed into the hot stormy night and the southerners who were condemned to death and detention looked after him with a long wistful doglike look they had been with him in so many spiritstirring days and nights of peril and they knew that never would they meet again he had not given one of them a word of adieu he had killed too many to be touched by his soldiers loss who could expect pity from deadly dash an hour passed i was removed under a guard to a somewhat better lodging in the granary where a surgeon hastily dressed my wounds and left me on a rough pallet with a jug of water at my side and the sentinel for my only watcher bidding me sleep sleep i could not have slept for my ransom though life had hardened me and made me sometimes as i fear callous enough i could not forget those who were to die when the sun rose specially i could not forget that gallant virginian to whom life was so precious yet who gave himself with so calm a fortitude to his fate the rivalry i thought must be deep and cruel to make the man from whom he had won what they both loved turn from him in hatred even in such extremity as his on the brink of a comrades grave feud might surely have been forgotten all that had just passed was reeling deliriously through my brain and i was panting in the sheer irritation and exhaustion of gunshot wounds when through the gloom dash entered the granary closely guarded but allowed to be with me on account of our common country never was i more thankful to see a familiar face from home than to see his through the long watches of that burning heavy interminable night he refused to rest he sat by me tending me as gently as a woman though he was suffering acutely himself from the injuries received in the course of the day he watched me unweariedly though often and often his gaze and his thoughts wandered far from me as he looked out through the open granary door past the form of the sentinel out to the starry solemn skies the deep woods and the dark silent land over which the stars were brooding large and clear was he thinking of the virginian whose life would die out for ever with the fading of those stars or of the woman whom he had lost whose love was the doomed soldiers and would never be his own though the grave closed over his rival with the morrows sun dreamily half unconsciously in the excitement of fever i asked him of her of whom i knew nothing did you love that woman so well his eyes were still fixed on the distant darkening skies and he answered quietly as though rather to his own thoughts than my wordsyes i love heras i never loved in that old life in england as we never love but once i think and she and shehas but one thought in the worldhim his voice as he answered now grated with dull dragging misery over the words had she so much beauty that she touched you like this he smiled slightly a faint mournful smile unutterably sad yes she is very lovely but her beauty is the least rare charm she is a woman for whom a man would live his greatest and if he cannot live for hermaydie the utterance was very slow and seemed to lie on me like a hand on my lips compelling me to silence he had forgotten all except his memory of her and where he sat with his eyes fixed outward on the drifting clouds that floated across the stars i saw his lips quiver once and i heard him murmur half aloud my darling my darling you will know how i loved you then and the silence was never broken between us but he sat motionless thus all the hours through looking out at the deep still woods and the serene and lustrous skies till the first beams of the sun shone over the hills in the east and i shuddered where i lay at its lightfor i knew it was the signal of death then he arose and bent towards me and the kindly eyes of old looked down on mine dear old fellow the general expects me at dawn i must leave you just now say goodbye his hand closed on mine he looked on me one moment longer a little lingeringly a little wistfully then he turned and went out with his guard went out into the young day that was just breaking on the world i watched his shadow as it faded and i saw that the sun had risen wholly and i thought of those who were to die with the morning light all was very calm for a while then the beat of a drum rolled through the quiet of the dawn and the measured tramp of armed men sounded audibly my heart stood still my lips felt parchedi knew the errand of that column marching so slowly across the parched turf a little while longer yet and i heard the sharp ring of the ramrods being withdrawn and the dull echo of the charge being rammed down with a single leap as though the bullets were through me i sprang weak as i was from my wretched pallet and staggered to the open doorway leaning there against the entrance powerless and spellbound i saw the file of soldiers loading i saw the empty coffinshells i saw three men standing bound their forms distinct against the clear bright haze of morning and the fresh foliage of the woods two of them were virginians but the third was not stuart lane with a great cry i sprang forward but the guards seized my arms and held me helpless as a woman in their gripe he whom we had called deadly dash heard and looked up and smiled his face was tranquil and full of light as though the pure peace of the day shone there the gripe of the sentinels held me as if in fetters of iron the world seemed to rock and reel under me a sea of blood seemed eddying before my eyes the young day was dawning and murder was done in its early hours and i was held there to look onits witness yet powerless to arrest it i heard the formulaso hideous thenmake readypresentfire i saw the long line of steel tubes belch out their smoke and flame i heard the sullen echo of the report roll down from the mountains above when the mist cleared away the three figures stood no longer clear against the sunlight they had fallen with the mad violence of desperation i wrenched myself from my guards and staggered to him where he lay he was not quite dead yet the balls had passed through his lungs but he breathed still his eyes were unclosed and the gleam of a last farewell came in them he smiled slightly faintly once more she will know how i loved her now tell her i died for her he said softly while his gaze looked upwards to the golden sunrays rising in the east and with these words life passed away the smile still lingering gently on his lipsand i knew no more for i fell like a man stunned down by him where he was stretched beside the grave that they had hewn for him ere he was yet dead i knew when i saw him there as well as i knew by detail long after that he had offered his life for stuart lanes and that it had been accepted the virginian ignorant of the sacrifice made for him had been sent to the southern lines during the night told by the northerners that he was pardoned on his parole to return in his stead a distinguished federal officer lately captured by him he knew nothing dreamt nothing of the exchange by which his life was given back to the woman who loved him when his english leader died in his place as the sun rose over the fresh summer world never again to rise for those whose deathshot rang sullen and shrill through its silence so deadly dash died and his grave is nameless and unknown there under the shadow of the great virginian forests he was outlawed condemned exiled and the world would see no good in him sins were on him heavily and vices lay darkly at his door but when i think of that grave in the south where the grass grows so rankly now and only the wild deer pauses i doubt if there was not that in him which may well shame the best amongst us we never knew him justly till he perished there and my friend who told me this said no more but took up his brulegueule regretfully the story is given as he gave it and the states could whisper from the depths of their silent woods many tales of sacrifice as generous of fortitude as great that when he had related it he was something ashamed of having felt it so much is true and you must refer the unusual weakness as he did to the fact that he told it on the offday of the derby after having put a cracker on wild charley a sufficient apology for any number of frailties the generals matchmaking or coaches and cousinship

perseverance on pollards fens and flatsflats fens and pollardsat the snails pace that according to the egr we must believe to be express i wrote and told the governor you were coming down with me sir

and choleric and as genial and goodhearted as any old brick that ever walked he was born as sweettempered and softmouthed as mamma when an eldest son waltzes twice with adeliza and the peppers been put into him by the currypowder the gentlemanlike transportation and the unlimited command over black devils enjoyed by gentlemen of the heics a nabob uncle thought keane oh i see yellow dyspeptic always boring one with how to govern india and recollections of when i served with napier what a fool i was to let sydie persuade me to go a month in lima and the pampas would be much pleasanter he came over last year continued sydie in blissful ignorance and bought the beeches a very jolly place only hes crammed it with everything anybody suggested and tried anything that any farmer recommended so that the house and the estate present a peculiar compendium of all theories of architecture and a general exhibition of all sorts of tastes hes his hobbies pouncing on and apprehending small boys is one of em for which practice he is endeared to the youth of st crucis as the old cove the injian devil and like affectionate cognomens but the generals weak point is meme and little fay his mare i

shes softmouthed enough when shes led mare no fays his niecemy cousin her father and my father went to glory when we were both smalls and left us in legacy to the general and a pretty pot of money the legacy has cost him your cousin indeed the names more like a mares than a girls answered keane thinking to himself a cousin i just wish id known that one of those indian girls i bet tanned brown as a berry flirts a outrance has run the gauntlet of all the calcutta balls been engaged to men in all the arms talks horridly broad angloindianenglish i know the style the engine screamed and pulled up at the st crucis station some seventy miles farther on lying in the midst of creswickian landscapes with woodlands and cottages and sweet fresh stretches of meadowland such as do ones heart good after hard days and late nights in dust and gaslight deuced fine points said sydie taking the ribbons of a highstepping bay that had brought one of the neatest possible traps to take him and keane to the beeches and springing in all his glory to the box than which no imperial throne could have offered to him onehalf so delightful a seat governor never keeps screws what a crying shame were not allowed to keep the sorriest hack at kings that comes of gentlemen slipping into shoes that were meant for beggars hallo there are the old beechtrees i vow i can almost taste the curry and dry from looking at them in dashed the bay through the parkgates sending the shingle flying up in small simoons and the rooks cawing in supreme surprise from their nests in the branches of the beechtrees hallo my ancient how are you began sydie to the butler while that stately person expanded into a smile of welcome down dog down pon my life the old place looks very jolly what have you hung all that armor up forto make believe our ancestors dwelt in these marble halls how devilish dusty i am wheres the general didnt know we were coming till next train fay fay where are you ashton wheres miss morton here sydie dear cried the young lady in question rushing across the hall with the most ecstatic delight and throwing herself into the cantabs arms who received her with no less cordiality and kissed her straightway regardless of the presence of keane the butler and harris oh sydie began the young lady breathlessly im so delighted youre come theres the archery fete and a picnic at shallowton and an election ball over at coverdale and i want you to dance with me and to try the new billiardtable and to come and see my aviary and to teach me pistolshooting because julia dupuis can shoot splendidly and talks of joining the rifles and to show me how to do euclid and to amuse me and to play with me and to tell me which is the prettiest of snowdrops pups to be saved and to she stopped suddenly and dropped from enthusiastic tirade to subdued surprise as she caught sight of keane for the first time oh sydie why did you not introduce me to your friend how rude i have been mr keane my cousin the torment of my existence miss morton in public little fay in private life there you know one another now i cant say any more do tell me where the governor is mr keane what can you think of me cried fay any friend of sydenhams is most welcome to the beeches and my uncle will scold me frightfully for giving you such a reception please do forgive me i was so delighted to see my cousin which i can fully enter into having a weakness for sydie myself smiled keane i am sure he is very fortunate in being the cause of such an excuse keane said it par complaisance but rather carelessly young ladies as a class being one of his aversions he looked at fay morton however and saw she was not an indianized girl after all she was not yellow but au contraire had waving fair hair long dark eyes and a mischievous sunny face a rosebud set with little wilful thorns and sweet as english air could make her wheres the governor fay reiterated sydie here my dear boy thought of your old uncle the first thing sydie god bless my soul how well you look confound you why didnt you tell me what train you were coming by devil take you ashton whys there no fire in the hall thought it was warm did you hum more fool you then uncle dear said miss fay here is sydies friend mr keane you are being as rude as i have been the general at this conjuration swung sharp round a stout hale handsome old fellow with gray moustaches and a high color holding a spade in his hand and clad in a linen coat bless my soul sir cried the general shaking keanes hand with the greatest possible energy charmed to see youdelighted pon my honor only hope youre come to stay till christmas there are plenty of bachelors dens devil take me of what was i thinking i was pleased to see that boy i suppose more fool i youll say a lazy goodfornothing young dog like him dont let me keep you standing in the hall cursed cold isnt it and theres little fay in muslin ashton send some hot water into the west room for mrmrconfound you sydie why didnt you telli mean introduce memr keane luncheon will be on the table in ten minutes like curry mr keane there get along sydie you foolish boy you can talk to fay after luncheon sydie whispered fay an hour before dinner when she had teased the cantabs life out of him till he had consented to pronounce judgment on the puppies what a splendid head that man has you brought with you hed do for plato with that grand calm brow and lofty unapproachable look who is he the greatest philosopher of modern times responded her cousin solemnly a condensation of solon thales plutarch seneca cicero lucullus bion theophrastes and co such a giant of mathematical knowledge and all other knowledge too that every day when he passes under bacons gate we are afraid the old legend will come to pass and it will tumble down as flat as a pancake a homage to him but a loss to cambridge nonsense said miss fay impatiently i like that sweet little thing with the black nose best dear who is he what is he how old is he whats his name where does he live gently young woman cried sydie he is tutor and fellow of kings and a great gun besides hes some twentyfive years older than you his name on the rolls is gerald i believe and he dwells in the shadow of mater beyond the reach of my cornet for which fact not being musically inclined he is barbarian enough to return thanks daily in chapel i am sorry he is come it was stupid of you to bring him wherefore ma cousine are you afraid of him you neednt be young ladies are too insignificant atoms of creation for him to criticise hell no more expect sense from you than from snowdrop and her pups afraid repeated fay with extreme indignation i should like to see any man of whom i should feel afraid if he doesnt like fun and nonsense i pity him but if he despise me ever so much for it i shall enjoy myself before him and in spite of him i was sorry you brought him because he will take you away when i want you all to myself and he looks so haughty that you are afraid of him fay and wont own it i am not reiterated fay impetuously and i will smoke a cigar with him after dinner to show you i am not one bit i bet you six pair of gloves you do no such thing young lady done do keep the one with a black nose sydie and yet that little livercolored darling is too pretty to be killed suppose we save them all snowdrop will be so pleased whereon fay kissed all the little snub noses with the deepest affection and was caught in the act by keane and the general theres that child with her arms full of dogs said the general beaming with satisfaction at sight of his niece shes a little spoilt wilful thing shes an old bachelors pet and you must make allowances i call her the fairy of the beeches god bless her she nursed me last winter when i was at deaths door from these cursed cold winds sir better than miss nightingale could have done what a devilish climate it is never two days alike i dont wonder englishwomen are such icicles poor things theyre frostbitten from their cradle upwards india warms them up general doesnt it the general shook with laughter to be sure to be sure if pruderys the fashion theyll wear it sir as they would patches or hairpowder but theyre always uncommonly glad to leave it off and lock it out of sight when they can what do you think of the kennels i say sydie confound you why did you bring down any traps with you havent room for em not for one couldnt cram a tilbury into the coachhouse a trap governor said sydie straightening his back after examination of the pups cant keep even a walleyed cabhorse wish i could wheres your drag then demanded the general my drag dont i just wish i had one to offer my bosom friend the v p a seat on the box calvert of trinity tooled us over in his to the spring meetings and his grays are the sweetest pair of goersthe leaders especiallythat ever you saw in harness we came back cross country to get in time for hall and a pretty mess we made of it for we broke the axle and lamed the offwheeler and but god bless my soul stormed the general excited beyond measure you wrote me word you were going to bring a drag down with you and of course i supposed you meant what you said and i had harris in about it and he swore the coachhouse was as full of traps as ever it could hold so i had my taxcart and fays phaeton turned into one of the stalls and then after all it comes out youve never brought it devil take you sydie why cant you be more thoughtful but my dear governor nonsense dont talk to me cried the general trying to work himself into a passion and diving into the recesses of six separate pockets one after another look here sir i suppose youll believe your own words here it is in black and whitep s i shall bring my coach down with me there what do you say now confound you what are you laughing at i dont see anything to laugh at in my day young fellows didnt make fools of old men in this way bless my soul why the devil dont you leave off laughing and talk a little common sense the things plain enoughps i shall bring my coach down with me so i have said sydie screaming with laughter look at himhes a firstrate coach too wheels always oiled and ready for any road always going up hill and never caught coming down started at a devil of a pace and now keeps ahead of all other vehicles on all highways a firstclass coach that will tool me through the tortuous lanes and treacherous pitfalls of the greats with flying colors my coach bravo general thats the best bit of fun ive had since i dressed up like sophonisba briggs and led the v p a dance all round the quad every hair on his head standing erect in his virtuous indignation at the awful morals of his college eh what grunted the general light beginning to dawn upon him do you mean mr keane hum hows one to be up to all your confounded slang how could i know devil take you sydie why cant you write common english you young fellows talk as bad jargon as sepoys youre sure im delighted to see you mr keane though i did make the mistake thank you general said keane but its rather cool of you master sydie to have forced me on to your uncles hands without his wish or his leave not at all not at all swore the general with vehement cordiality i gave him carte blanche to ask whom he would and unexpected guests are always most welcome not that you were unexpected though for id told that boy to be sure and bring somebody down here and have had the taxcart and my phaeton turned out to make comfortable quarters for him said miss fay with a glance at the coach to see how he took chaff and i only hope mr keane may like his accommodation perhaps miss morton said keane smiling i shall like it so well that you will have to say to me as poor voltaire to his troublesome abbe don quichotte prenait les auberges pour les chateaux mais vous avez pris les chateaux pour les auberges tiresome man thought fay i wish sydie hadnt brought him here but i shall do as i always do however grand and supercilious he may look he has lived among all those men and books till he has grown as cold as granite what a pity it is people dont enjoy existence as i do you are thinking miss morton said keane as he walked on beside her with an amused glance at her face which was expressive enough of her thoughts that if your uncle is glad to see me you are not and that sydie was very stupid not to bring down one of his kindred spirits instead ofdont disclaim it now you should veil your face if you wish your thoughts not to be read i was not going to disclaim it said fay quickly looking up at him with a rapid glance half penitence half irritation i always tell the truth but i was not thinking exactly that i dont want any of sydies friendsi detest boysbut i certainly was thinking that as you look down on everything that we all delight in i fancied you and the beeches will hardly agree if i am rude you must not be angry you wanted me to tell you the truth keane smiled again do i look down on the things you delight in i hardly know enough of you as we have only addressed about six syllables to each other to be able to judge what you like and what you dont like but certainly i must admit that caressing the little round heads of those puppies yonder which seemed to afford you such extreme rapture would not be any source of remarkable gratification to me fay looked up at him and laughed well i am fond of animals as you are fond of books is it not an open question whether the live dog or sheepskin is not as good as the dead morocco or russian leather is it an open question whether macaulays or aragos brain weighs no more than a cats or a puppys brain said impudent little fay are your great men always as honest and as faithful as my poor little snowdrop i have an idea that sheridans brains were often obscured by brandy that richelieu had the weakness to be prouder of his bad poems than his magnificent policies and that pope and byron had the folly to be more tenacious of a glance at their physical defect than an onslaught on their noblest works i could mention a good many other instances where brain was not always a voucher for corresponding strength of character keane was surprised to hear a sensible speech from this volatile little puss and honored her by answering her seriously say rather miss morton that those to whom many temptations fall should have many excuses made where the brain preponderates excelling in creative faculty and rapid thought there will the sensibilities be proportionately acute the vivacity and vigorous life which produced the rapid flow of sheridans eloquence led him into the dissipation which made him end his days in a spunginghouse men of cooler minds and natures must not presume to judge him they had not his temptation they cannot judge of his fault richelieu in all probability amused himself with his verses as he amused himself with his white kitten and its cork as a delassement had he piqued himself upon his poetry as they say he would have turned poetaster instead of politician as for the other two you must remember that popes deformity made him a subject of ridicule to the woman he was fool enough to worship and byron poor fellow was oversusceptible on all points or he would scarcely have allowed the venomed arrows from the scotch reviewers to wound him nor would he have cared for the desertion of a wife who was to him like ice to fire when you are older you will learn that it is very dangerous and unjust to say this thing is right that wrong that feeling wise or this foolish for all temperaments are different and the same circumstances may produce very different effects your puppies will grow up with dissimilar characters how much more so then must men miss fay was quiet for a minute then she flashed her mischievous eyes on him certainly but then by your own admission you have no right to decide that your love for mathematics is wise and my love for snowdrop foolish it may be quite au contraire perhaps after all i may have chosen the better part fay go in and dress for dinner interrupted the general trotting up your tongue would run on forever if nobody stopped it youre no exception to your sex on that point is she keane laughed perhaps miss mortons fraenum like sydies was cut too far in her infancy and therefore she has been unbridled ever since in all things cried little fay nobody has put the curb on me yet and nobody ever shall dont be too sure fay cried sydie rarey does wonders with the wildest fillies somebody may bring you down on your knees yet youll have to see to that sydie laughed the general come get along child to your toilette i never have my soup cold and my curry overdone to wait for his dinner is a stretch of good nature and patience that ought not to be expected of any man the soup was not cold nor the curry overdone and the dinner was pleasant enough in the long diningroom with the june sun streaming in through its baywindows from out the brilliantcolored garden and the walls echoing with the laughter of sydie and his cousin the young lady keeping true to her avowal of not caring for platos presence plato however listened quietly peeling his peaches with tranquil amusement for if the girl talked nonsense it was clever nonsense as rare by the way and quite as refreshing as true wit my gloves are safe youre too afraid of him fay whispered sydie bending forwards to give her some hautboys am i cried miss fay with a moue of supreme contempt neither the whisper nor the moue escaped keane as he talked with the governor on model drainage wheres my hookah fay asked the general after dessert get it will you my pet voila cried miss fay lifting the narghile from the sideboard then taking some cigars off the mantelpiece she put one in her own mouth struck a fusee and handing the case to keane said with a saucy smile in her soft bright eyes though to tell the truth she was a little bit afraid of taking liberties with him if you are not above such a sublunary indulgence will you have a cigar with me with the greatest pleasure said keane with a grave bow and if you would like to further rival george sand i shall be very happy to give you the address of my tailor thank you exceedingly but as long as crinoline is the type of the sex that are a little lower than the angels and ribbonties the seal of those but a trifle better than mephistopheles i dont think i will change it responded little fay contemptuously as she threw herself down on a couch with an indignant defiant glance and puffed at her manilla i hate him sydie said the little lady vehemently that night do you dear answered the cantab you see youve never had anybody to be afraid of or had any man neglect you before he may neglect me if he please i am sure i do not care rejoined fay disdainfully only i do wish sydie that you had never brought him here to make us all uncomfortable he dont make me uncomfortable quite otherwise nor yet the governor youre the only victim fay fay saw little enough of keane for the next week or two he was out all day with sydie troutfishing or walking over his farms with the general or sitting in the study reading and writing his articles for the cambridge journal leonvilles mathematical journal or the westminster review but when she was with him there was no mischief within her reach that miss fay did not perpetrate keane to tease her would condemnso seriously that she believed himall that she loved the best he would tell her that he admired quiet domestic women that he thought girls should be very subdued and retiring that they should work well and not care much for society at all of which being her extreme antipodes little fay would be vehemently wrathful she would get on her pony without any saddle in her evening dress and ride him at the fivebar gate in the stableyard she would put on sydies smokingcap and look very pretty in it and take a queens on the divan of the smokingroom reading bells life and asking keane how much he would bet on the october she would spend all the morning making wreaths of roses dressing herself and the puppies up in them inquiring if it was not a laudable and industrious occupation there was no nonsense or mischief fay would not imagine and forthwith commit and anything they wanted her not to do she would do straightway even to the imperilling of her own life and limb she tried hard to irritate or rouse plato as she called him but plato was not to be moved and treated her as a spoilt child whom he alone had sense enough to resist it will be great folly for you to attempt it miss morton those horses are not fit to be driven by any one much less by a woman said keane quietly one morning they were in the stableyard and chanced to be alone when a new purchase of the governorstwo scarcely brokenin thoroughbred coltswere brought with a new mailphaeton into the yard and miss fay forthwith announced her resolution of driving them round the avenue the groom that came with them told her they were almost more than he could manage their own coachman begged and implored keane reasoned quietly all to no purpose the rosebud had put out its little wilful thorns keanes words added fuel to the fire up she sprang looking the daintiest morsel imaginable perched up on that very exalted boxseat told the horrified groom to mount behind and started them off lifting her hat with a graceful bow to plato who stood watching the phaeton with his arms folded and his cigar in his mouth soon after he started in the contrary direction for the avenue circled the beeches in an oval of four miles and he knew he should meet her coming back he strolled along under the pleasant shadow of the great trees enjoying the sunset and the fresh air and capable of enjoying them still more but for an inward misgiving his presentiment was not without its grounds he had walked about a mile and a half round the avenue when a cloud of dust told him what was up and in the distance came the thoroughbreds broken away as he had prophesied tearing along with the bits between their teeth little fay keeping gallantly hold of the ribbons but as powerless over the colts now they had got their heads as the groom leaning from the back seat on came the phaeton bumping rattling oscillating threatening every second to be turned over keane caught one glance of fays face resolute and pale and of her little hands grasping the ribbons till they were cut and bleeding with the strain there was nothing for it but to stand straight in the animals path catch their heads and throw them back on their haunches luckily his muscles were like ironluckily too the colts had come a long way and were not fresh he stood like a rock and checked them running a very close risk of dislocating his arms with the shock but saving little fay from destruction the colts stood trembling the groom jumped out and caught the reins keane amused himself silently with the mingled penitence vexation shame and rebellion visible in the little ladys face well said he quietly as you were so desirous of breaking your neck will you ever forgive me for defeating your purpose pray dont cried fay passionately i do thank you so much for saving my life i think it so generous and brave of you to have rescued me at such risk to yourself i feel that i can never be grateful enough to you but dont talk in that way i know it was silly and selfwilled of me it was that fact is obvious then i shall make it more so cried miss fay with her old wilfulness i do feel very grateful and i would tell you so if you would let me but if you think it has made me afraid you are quite wrong and so you shall see and before he could interfere or do more than mechanically spring up after her she had caught the reins from the groom and started the trembling colts off again but keane put his hand on the ribbons foolish child are you mad he said so gravely yet so gently that fay let them go and let him drive her back to the stableyard where she sprang out and rushed away to her own room terrified the governor with a few vehement sentences which gave him a vague idea that keane was murdered and both fays legs broken and then had a private cry all to herself with her arms round snowdrops neck curled up in one of the drawingroom windows where she had not been long when the general and keane passed through not noticing her hidden as she was in curtains cushions and flowers shes a little wilful thing keane the general was saying but you mustnt think the worse of her for that i dont i am sick of those conventional young ladies who agree with everything one says to themwho keep all the frowns for mothers and servants and are as serene as a cloudless sky abroad smile blandly on all alike and havent an opinion of their own fays plenty of opinions of her own chuckled the general and she tells em pretty freely too bless the child shes not ashamed of any of her thoughts and never will be i hope not your little niece can do things that no other young lady could and they are so pretty in her that it would be a thousand pities for her to grow one atom less natural and wilful grapes growing wild are charminggrapes trained to a stake are ruined i assure you if i were you i would not scold her for driving those colts today high spirits and love of fun led her on and the courage and presence of mind she displayed are too rare among her sex for us to do right in checking them to be sure to be sure assented the governor gleefully god bless the child shes one among a thousand sir cognac not milk and water theres the dinnerbell confound it whereat the general made his exit and keane also and fay kissed the spaniel with even more passionate attachment than ordinary ah snowdrop i dont hate him any more he is a darling one glowing august morning keane was in the study pondering whether he would go to his moor or not the general had besought him to stay his gamekeeper wrote him that it was a horribly bad rainy season in invernessshire the trout and the rabbits were very good sport in a mild way here altogether keane felt half disposed to keep where he was when a shadow fell across his paper and as he looked up he saw in the open window the english rosebud is it not one of the open questions mr keane asked fay whether it is very wise to spend all this glorious morning shut out of the sight of the sunrays and the scent of the flowers how have you been spending it then putting bouquets in all the rooms cleaning my aviary talking to the puppies and reading jocelyn under the limes in the shrubberiesall very puerile but all very pleasant perhaps if you descended to a lazy day like that now and then you might be none the worse is that a challenge will you take me under the limes no indeed i do not admit men who despise them to my gardens of armida any more than you would admit me into your schools i have as great a scorn for a skeptic as you have for a tyro pardon me i have no scorn for a tyro but you would not come to the accademe you dislike plato too much fay looked up at him half shyly half mischievously yes i do dislike you when you look down on me as richelieu might have looked down on his kitten liking to see its play said keane half sadly contrasting its gay insouciance with his own toil and turmoil regretting perhaps the time when trifles made his joy as they did his kittens if i were to look on you so there would not be much to offend you you do not think so of me or you would speak to me as if i were an intelligent being not a silly little thing how do you know i think you silly because you think all women so perhaps but then you should rather try to redeem me from my error in doctrine come let us sign a treaty of peace take me under the limes i want some fresh air after writing all day and in payment i will teach you euclid as you vainly beseeched your cousin to do yesterday will you cried fay eagerly then she threw back her head i never am won by bribes nor yet by threats what a difficult young lady you are come show me your shrubbery sanctum now you have invaded mine the english rosebud laid aside its wilful thorns and fay a little less afraid of her plato and therefore a little less defiant to him led him over the grounds filled his hands with flowers showed him her aviary read some of jocelyn to him to show him she said that lamartine was better than the oedipus in coloneus and thought as she dressed for dinner i wonder if he does despise mehe has such a beautiful face if he were not so haughty and cold the next day keane gave her an hour of euclid in the study certainly the coach had never had such a pretty pupil and he wished every dull head he had to cram was as intelligent as this fairhaired one fay was quick and clever she was stimulated moreover by his decree concerning the stupidity of all women she really worked as hard as any young man studying for degrees when they supposed her fast asleep in bed and she got over the pons asinorum in a style that fairly astonished her tutor the coach did not dislike his occupation either it did him good after his life of solitude and study something as the kitten and cork did richelieu good after his cabinets and councils and little fay with her flowers and fun mischief and impudence and that winning wilfulness which it amused him gradually to tame down unbent the chillness which had grown upon him he was the better for it as a man after hard study or practice is the better for some fresh seabreezes and some days of careless dolce well fay have you had another poor devil flinging himself at your feet by means of a postagestamp said sydie one morning at breakfast you cant disguise anything from me your most interested anxious and near and dear relative whenever the governor looks particularly stormy i see the signs of the times that if i do not forthwith remove your dangerously attractive person all the bricks spooneys swells and donothings in the county will speedily fill the hanwell wards to overflowing dont talk such nonsense sydie said fay impatiently with a glance at keane as she handed him his chocolate ah deuce take the fellows chuckled the general love devotion admiration what a lot of stuff they do write i wonder if fay were a little beggar how much of it all would stand the test but we know a trick worth two of that try those sardines keane house is let fayeh house is let nobody need apply ha ha and the general took some more curry laughing till he was purple while fay blushed scarlet a trick of which she was rarely guilty sydie smiled and keane picked out his sardines with calm deliberation hallo god bless my soul burst forth the general again devil take me ill be hanged if i stand it confound em all i do call it hard for a man not to be able to sit at his breakfast in peace good heavens what will come to the country if all those little devils grow up to be food for calcraft hes actually pulling the bark off the trees as i live excuse me i cant sit still and see it wherewith the general bolted from his chair darted through the window upsetting three dogs two kittens and a stand of flowers in his exit and bolted breathlessly across the park with the poker in his hand bless his old heart aint he a brick shouted sydie do excuse me fay i must go and hear him blow up that boy skyhigh and give him a shilling for tuck afterwards it will be so rich the cantab made his exit and fay busied herself calming the kittens minds and restoring the dethroned geraniums keane read his times for ten minutes then looked up miss morton where is your tongue i have not heard it for a quarter of an hour a miracle that has never happened in the two months i have been at the beeches you do not want to hear it what am i in mauvais odeur again smiled keane i thought we were good friends have you found the q e d to the problem i gave you to be sure cried fay exultantly and kneeling down by him she went through the whole thing in exceeding triumph you are a good child said her tutor smiling in himself amazed at this volatile little things capacity for mathematics i think you will be able to take your degree if you like come do you hate me now fay no said fay a little shyly i never hated you i always admired you but i was afraid of you though i would never confess it to sydie never be afraid of me said keane putting his hand on hers as it lay on the arm of his chair you have no cause you can do things few girls can but they are pretty in you where they might benot so pretty in others i like them at the least you are very fond of your cousin are you not of sydie oh i love him dearly keane took his hand away and rose as the general trotted in god bless my soul keane how warm it is confoundedly hot without ones hat i can tell you had my walk all for nothing too that cursed little idiot wasnt trespassing after all stephen had set him to spud out the daisies and id thrashed the boy before id listen to him devil take him august went out and september came in and keane stayed on at the beeches they were pleasant days to them all knocking over the partridges right and left enjoying a cold luncheon under the luxuriant hedges and going home for a dinner full of laughter and talk and good cookery and fays songs afterwards as wild and sweet in their way as a goldfinchs on a hawthorn spray you like little fay dont you keane said the general as they went home one evening keane looked startled for a second of course he said rather haughtily that miss morton is very charming every one must admit bless her little heart shes a wild little filly keane but shell go better and truer than your quiet brokenin ones who wear the harness so respectably and are so wicked and vicious in their own minds and what do you think of my boy asked the general pointing to sydie who was in front how does he stand at cambridge sydie oh hes a nice young fellow he is a great favorite there and he isthe best things he can begenerous sweettempered and honorable to be sure echoed the general rubbing his hands hes a dear boya very dear boy theyre both exactly all i wished them to be dear children and i must say i am delighted to see em carrying out the plan i had always made for em from their childhood being what general may i ask why any one can see as plain as a pikestaff that theyre in love with each other said the general glowing with satisfaction and i mean them to be married and happy they dote on each other keane and i shant put any obstacles in their way youths short enough heaven knows let em enjoy it say i it dont come back again dont say anything to him about it i want to have some fun with him theyve settled it all of course long ago but he hasnt confided in me the sly dog trust an old campaigner though for twigging an affaire de coeur bless them both they make me feel a boy again well have a gay wedding keane mind you come down for it i dare say itll be at christmas keane walked along drawing his cap over his eyes the sun was setting full in his face well what sport cried fay running up to them pretty fair said keane coldly as he passed her it was an hour before the dinnerbell rang then he came down cold and calm particularly brilliant in conversation more courteous perhaps to her than ever but the frost had gathered round him that the sunny atmosphere of the beeches had melted and fay though she tried to tease and to coax and to win him could not dissipate it she felt him an immeasurable distance from her again he was a learned haughty grave philosopher and she a little naughty child as keane went upstairs that night he heard sydie talking in the hall yes my worshipped fay i shall be intensely and utterly miserable away from the light of your eyes but nevertheless i must go and see kingslake from johns next tuesday because ive promised and let one idolize your divine self ever so much one cant give up ones larks you know keane ground his teeth with a bitter sigh and a fierce oath little fay i would have loved you more tenderly than that he went in and threw himself on his bed not to sleep for the first time for many years he could not summon sleep at his will he had gone on petting her and amusing himself thinking of her only as a winning wayward child now he woke with a shock to discover too late that she had stolen from him unawares the heart he had so long refused to any woman with his high intellect and calm philosophy after his years spent in severe science and cold solitude the hot wellsprings of passion had broken loose again he longed to take her bright life into his own grave and cheerless one he longed to feel her warm young heart beat with his own icebound for so many years but little fay was never to be his in the bedroom next to him the general sat with his feet in his slippers and his dressinggown round him smoking his last cheroot before a roaring fire chuckling complacently over his own thoughts to be sure well have a very gay wedding such as the county hasnt seen in all its blessed days he muttered with supreme satisfaction sydie shall have this place what do i want with a great town of a house like this big enough for a barrack ill take that shootingbox thats to let four miles off thatll be plenty large enough for me and my old chums to smoke in and chat over bygone times and it will do our hearts goodfreshen us up a bit to see those young things enjoying themselves my little fay will be the prettiest bride that ever was seen silly young things to suppose i dont see through them trust an old soldier however love is blind they say how could they have helped falling in love with one another and whod have the heart to part em i should like to know keane stayed that day the next receiving a letter which afforded a true though a slight excuse to return to cambridge he went the general fay and sydie believing him gone only for a few days he knowing that he would never set foot in the beeches again he went back to his rooms whose dark monastic gloom in the dull october day seemed to close round him like an iron shroud here with his books his papers his treasures of intellect science and art his mind a kingdom to him he had spent many a happy day with his brain growing only clearer and clearer as he followed out a close reasoning or clenched a subtle analysis now for the sake of a mischievous child but half his age he shuddered as he entered well my dear boy began the general one day after dinner ive seen your game though you thought i didnt how do you know you young dog that i shall give my consent oh bother governor i know you will cried sydie aghast because you see if you let me have a few cool hundreds i can give the men such slapup winesand its my last year general you sly dog chuckled the governor im not talking of your winemerchant and you know im not master sydie its no good playing hideandseek with me i can always see through a milestone when cupid is behind it and theres no need to beat round the bush with me my boy i never gave my assent to anything with greater delight in my life ive always meant you to marry fay and marry fay shouted sydie good heavens governor what next and the cantab threw himself back and laughed till he cried and snowdrop and her pups barked furiously in a concert of excited sympathy why sir whywhy becausedevil take you sydiei dont know what you are laughing at do you cried the general starting out of his chair yes i do governor youre laboring under a most delicious delusion delusionehwhat why bless my soul i dont think you know what you are saying sydie stormed the general yes i do youve an ideahow you got it into your head heaven knows but there it isyouve an idea that fay and i are in love with one another and i assure you you were never more mistaken in your life seeing the general standing bolt upright staring at him and looking decidedly apocleptic sydie made the matter a little clearer fay and i would do a good deal to oblige you my beloved governor if we could get up the steam a little but im afraid we really cannot love aint in ones own hands you see but a skittish mare that gets her head and takes the bit between her teeth and bolts off with you wherever she likes is it possible that two people who broke each others toys and teased each others lives out and caught the measles of each other from their cradle upwards should fall in love with each other when they grow up besides i dont intend to marry for the next twenty years if i can help it i couldnt afford a milliners bill to my tailors and i should be ruined for life if i merged my bright particular star of a self into a respectable larkshunning billpaying shabbyhatted family man good heavens what a train of horrors comes with the bare idea do you mean to say sir you wont marry your cousin shouted the general bless your dear old heart no governorten times over no i wouldnt marry anybody not for half the universe then ive done with you siri wash my hands of you shouted the general tearing up and down the room in a quick march more beneficial to his feelings than his carpet you are an ungrateful unprincipled shameless young man and are no more worthy of the affection and the interest ive been fool enough to waste on you than a tomcat youre an abominably selfish ungrateful unnatural boy and though you are poor phils son i will tell you my mind sir and i must say i think your conduct with your cousin making love to herdesperate love to herwinning her affections poor unhappy child and then making a jest of her and treating it with a laugh is disgraceful sirdisgraceful do you hear yes i hear general cried sydie convulsed with laughter but fay cares no more for me than for those geraniums we are fond of one another in a cool cousinly sort of way but hold your tongue stormed the general dont dare to say another word to me about it you know well enough that it has been the one delight of my life and if youd had any respect or right feeling in you youd marry her tomorrow she wouldnt be a party to that few women are blind to my manifold attractions but fays one of em look here governor said sydie laying his hand affectionately on the generals shoulder did it never occur to you that though the pretty castles knocked down there may be much nicer bricks left to build a new one cant you see that fay doesnt care two buttons about me but cares a good many diamond studs about somebody else nothing has occurred to me but that you and she are two heartless selfish ungrateful chits hold your tongue sir but general hold your tongue sir dont talk to me i tell you in love with somebody else i should like to see him show his face here somebody shes talked to for five minutes at a raceball and proposed to her in a corner thinking to get some of my money some swindler or italian refugee or blackleg ill be boundtaken her in made her think him an angel and will persuade her to run away with him ill set the police round the houseill send her to school in paris what fools men are to have anything to do with women at all you seem in their confidence whos the fellow a man very like a swindler or a blacklegkeane keane shouted the general pausing in the middle of his frantic march keane responded sydie keane shouted the general again god bless my soul she might as well have fallen in love with the man in the moon why couldnt she like the person id chosen for her if one cant guide the mare ones self tisnt likely the governors can for one muttered sydie poor dear child fallen in love with a man who dont care a button for her eh humphthats always the way with womenlose the good chances and fling themselves at a mans feet who cares no more for their tomfoolery of worship than he cares for the blacking on his boots devil take young people what a torment they are the ungrateful little jade how dare she go and smash all my plans like that and if i ever set my heart on anything i set it on that match keane hell no more love anybody than the stone cherubs on the terrace hes a splendid head but his hearts every atom as cold as granite love her not a bit of it when i told him you were going to marry her i thought you would and so you will too if youve the slightest particle of gratitude or common sense in either of you he listened as quietly and as calmly as if he had been one of the men in armor in the hall love indeed to the devil with love say i its the head and root of everything thats mischievous and bad wait a bit uncle cried sydie you told him all about your previous matchmaking eh and didnt he go off like a shot two days after when we meant him to stay on a month longer cant you put two and two together my once wideawake governor tisnt such a difficult operation no i cant shouted the general i dont know anything i dont see anything i dont believe in anything i hate everybody and everything i tell you and im a great fool for having ever set my heart on any plan that wanted a womans concurrence for if she will she will you may depend ont and if she wont she wont and theres an end ont wherewith the general stuck his wideawake on fiercely and darted out of the baywindow to cool himself half way across the lawn he turned sharp round and came back again sydie do you fancy keane cares a straw for that child i cant say its possible humph well cant you go and see thats come of those mathematical lessons what a fool i was to allow her to be so much with him growled the general with many grunts and halfaudible oaths swinging round again and trotting through the window as hot and peppery as his own idolized curry keane was sitting writing in his rooms at kings some few days after the backs looked dismal with their leafless sepiacolored trees the streets were full of sloppy mud and dripping undergrads umbrellas his own room looked sombre and dark without any sunshine on its heavy oak bookcases and massive librarytable and dark bronzes his pen moved quickly his head was bent over the paper his mouth sternly set and his forehead paler and more severe than ever the gloom in his chambers had gathered round him himself when his door was burst open and sydie dashed in and threw himself down in a green leather armchair well sir here am i back again just met the v p in the quad and he was so enchanted at seeing me that he kissed me on both cheeks flung off his gown tossed up his cap and performed a pas dextase on the spot isnt it delightful to be so beloved granta looks very delicious today i must sayabout as refreshing and lively as an acidulated spinster going districtvisiting in a snowstorm and how are you most noble lord pretty well only that thought you were all muscle and iron i say what do you think the governor has been saying to me how can i tell tell no i should not have guessed it if id tried for a hundred years by george nothing less than that i should marry fay what do you think of that sir keane traced greek unconsciously on the margin of his times for the life of him with all his selfcommand he could not have answered marry fay i shouted sydie ye gods what an idea i never was so astonished in all my days marry little faythe governor must be mad you know you will not marry your cousin asked keane tranquilly though the rapid glance and involuntary start did not escape sydies quick eyes marry i by george no she wouldnt have me and im sure i wouldnt have her she is a dear little monkey and im very fond of her but i wouldnt put the halter round my neck for any woman going i dont like vexing the general but it would be really too great a sacrifice merely to oblige him she cares nothing for you then nothing well i dont know yes in a measure she does if i should be taken home on a hurdle one fine morning shed shed some cousinly tears over my inanimate body but as for the other thing not one bit of it tisnt likely were a great deal too like one another too full of devilry and carelessness to assimilate isnt it the delicious contrast and fiz of the sparkling acid of divine lemons with the contrariety of the fiery spirit of beloved rum that makes the delectable union known and worshipped in our symposia under the blissful name of punch marry little fay by jove if all the governors matchmaking was founded on no better reasons for success it is a small marvel that hes a bachelor now by george its time for hall and the cantab took himself off congratulating himself on the adroit manner in which he had cut the gordian knot that the general had muddled up so inexplicably in his unpropitious matchmaking keane lay back in his chair some minutes very still then he rose to dine in hall pushing away his books and papers as if throwing aside with them a dull and heavy weight the robins sang in the leafless backs the sun shone out on the sloppy streets the youth he thought gone for ever was come back to him oh strange stale story of hercules and omphale old as the hills and as eternal hercules goes on in his strength slaying his hydra and his laomedon for many years but he comes at last whether he like it or not to his omphale at whose feet he is content to sit and spin long golden threads of pleasure and of passion while his lions skin is motheaten and his club rots away little fay sat curled up on the study hearthrug reading a book her late guest had left behind hima very light and entertaining volume being delolme on the constitution but which she preferred i suppose to what will he do with it or the feuilles dautomne for the sake of that clear autograph gerald keane kings coll on its flyleaf a pretty picture she made with her handsome spaniels and she was so intent on what she was readingthe flyleaf by the waythat she never heard the opening of the door till a hand drew away her book then fay started up oversetting the puppies one over another radiant and breathless keane took her hands and drew her near him you do not hate me now then fay put her head on one side with her old wilfulness yes i dowhen you go away without any notice and hardly bid me goodbye you would not have left one of your men pupils so unceremoniously keane smiled involuntarily and drew her closer if you do not hate me will you go a step fartherand love me little fay my own darling will you come and brighten my life it has been a saddened and a stern one but it shall never throw a shade on yours the wild little filly was conqueredat last she came to hand docile and subdued and acknowledged her master she loved him and told him so with that frankness and fondness which would have covered faults far more glaring and weighty than little fays but you must never be afraid of me whispered keane some time after oh no and you do not wish sydie had never brought me here to make you all uncomfortable oh please dont cried fay plaintively i was a child then and i did not know what i said then being three months ago may i ask what you are now a child still in knowledge but your child whispered fay lifting her face to his to be petted and spoiled and never found fault with remember my little darling who would have the heart to find fault with you whatever your sins god bless my soul whats this cried a voice in the doorway there stood the general in wideawake and shootingcoat with a spade in one hand and a wateringpot in the other too astonished to keep his amazement to himself fay would fain have turned and fled but keane smiled kept one arm round her and stretched out his hand to the governor general i came once uninvited and i am come again will you forgive me i have a great deal to say to you but i must ask you one question first of all will you give me your treasure eh humph what welli supposeyes ejaculated the general breathless from the combined effects of amazement and excessive and vehement gardening but bless my soul keane i should as soon have thought of one of the stone cherubs or that bronze milton never mind one lives and learns mind devil take me what am i talking about i dont mind at all im very happy only id set my heart onyou know what more fool i fay you little imp come here are you fairly broken in by keane then yes said miss fay with her old mischief but a new blush as he has promised never to use the curb god bless you then my little pet cried the general kissing her some fifty times then he laughed till he cried and dried his eyes and laughed again and grunted and growled and shook both keanes hands vehemently i was a great fool sir and i dare say youve managed much better i did set my heart on the boy you know but it cant be helped now and i dont wish it should be kind to her thats all for though she maynt bear the curb the whip from anybody she cares about would break her heart shes a dear child keanea very dear child be kind to her thats all on the evening of january th beginning the lent term mr sydenham morton sat in his own rooms with half a dozen spirits like himself a delicious aroma surrounding them of maryland and rumpunch and a rapid flow of talk making its way through the dense atmosphere to think of granite keane being caught shouted one young fellow i should as soon have thought of the pyramids walking over to the sphinx and marrying her poor devil i pity him sneered henley of trinity aged nineteen he dont require much pity my dear fellow i think hes pretty comfortable rejoined sydie he did to be sure when he was trying to beat sense into your brainbox but thats over for the present come tell us about the wedding said somerset of kings i was sorry i couldnt go down well began sydie stretching his legs and putting down his pipe shethe she was dressed in white tulle and bother the dress go ahead the dress was no bother it was the one subject in life to the women you must listen to the dress because i asked the prettiest girl there for the description of it to enlighten your minds and it was harder to learn than six books of horace the bridesmaids wore tarlatane a la princesse stephanie trois jupes bouillonnees jupe desous de soie glacee guirlandes couleur dea yeux imperiaux deugenie corsets decolletes garnis de ruches de ruban du for heavens sake hold your tongue cried somerset that jargons worse than the yahoos the dead languages are bad enough to learn but womens living language of fashion is ten hundred times worse the twelve girls were dressed in blue and white and thought themselves angelswe understand cut along gunter was prime continued sydie and the governor was prime toosplendid old buck only when he gave her away he was very near saying devil take it which might have had a novel but hardly a solemn effect little fay was delightfulfor all the world like a bit of incarnated sunshine keane was granite all over except his eyes and they were lava if we hadnt for our own preservation let him put her in a carriage and started em off he might have become dangerous after the manner of etna ice outside and redhot coals within the bridesmaids tears must have washed the church for a week and made it rather a damp affair one would scarcely think women were so anxious to marry to judge from the amount of grief they get up at a friends sacrifice it looks uncommonly like envy but it isnt were sure the ball was like most other balls alternate waltzing and flirtation a vast lot of nonsense talked and a vast lot of champagne drunkcupid running about in every direction and a tremendous run on all the amatory poetsbrowning and tennyson being worked as hard as cabhorses and used up pretty much as those quadrupedsdandies suffering selfinflicted torture from tight boots and saying like cranmer when he held his hand in the fire that it was rather agreeable than otherwise considering it drew admirationspurs getting entangled in ladies dresses and ladies making use thereof for a display of amiability which the dragoons are very much mistaken if they fancied continued into private lifegirls believing all the pretty things said to themmen going home and laughing at them allwallflowers very black women engaged ten deep very sunshinythe governor very glorious and my noble self very fascinating and now said sydie taking up his pipe pass the punch old boy and never say i cant talk the story of a crayonhead or a doubleddown leaf in a mans life i was dining with a friend in his house on the lung arno he fills never mind what post in the british legation where i was passing an autumn month the night was oppressively hot a still sultry sky brooded over the city and the stars shining out from a purple mist on to the campanile near and the slopes of bellosguardo in the distance it was intensely hot not all the iced wines on his table could remove the oppressive warmth of the evening air which made both him and me think of evenings we had spent together in the voluptuous lassitude of the east in days gone by when we had travelled there fresh to life to new impressions to all that gives greenness to the grass and glory to the flower the arno ran on under its bridge and we leaned out of the balcony where we were sitting and smoking while i tossed over without thinking much of what i was doing a portfolio of his sketches position has lost for art many good artists since sir george beaumont my friend is one of them his sketches are masterly and had he been a vagrant bohemian instead of an english peer there might have been pictures on the walls of the r a to console one for the meretricious daubs and pet vulgarities of nursery episodes hideous babies and thirdclass carriage interiors which make ones accustomed annual visit to the rooms that once saw the beauties of reynolds and wilson and lawrence a positive martyrdom to anybody of decent refinement and educated taste the portfolio stood near me and i took out a sketch or two now and then between the pauses of our conversation looking lazily up the river while the moonlight shone on dantes city that so long forgot and has so late remembered him ah what a pretty face this is whos the original i asked him drawing out a female head done with great finish in pastel under which was written in his own hand florelle it was a face of great beauty with a low greek brow and bronzedark hair and those large soft liquid eyes that you only see in a southern and that looked at you from the sketch with an earnest wistful regard half childlike half impassioned he looked up glanced at the sketch and stretched out his hand hastily but i held it away from him i want to look at it it is a beautiful head i wish we had the original here now who is she as i spokeholding the sketch up where the light from the room within fell on what i had no doubt was a likeness of some fair face that had beguiled his time in days gone by a souvenir of one of his loves more lasting than souvenirs of such episodes in ones life often are if merely trusted to that inconstant capricieuse memoryi might have hit him with a bullet rather than asked him about a mere etude a deux crayons for he shuddered and drank off some white hermitage quickly i had forgotten that was in the portfolio he said hurriedly as he took it from me and put it behind him with its face against the wall as though it had been the sketch of a medusa what do you take it away for i had not half done looking at it who is the original one i dont care to mention because because the sight of that picture gives me a twinge of what i ought to be hardened againstregret regret is any woman worth that she was i dont believe it and i fancied you and i thought alike on such points of all the women for whom we feel twinges of conscience or selfreproach in melancholy moments how many loved us moralists and poets sentimentalize over it and make it a stalkinghorse whereby to magnify our sins and consign us more utterly to perdition while they do for themselves a little bit of poetic morality cheaply but in reality there are uncommonly few women who can love to begin with and in the second vanity avarice jealousy desires for pretty toilettes one or other or all combined have quite as much to do with their sacrifice for us as anything quite true butthere are women and women perhaps and it was not of that sort of regret that i spoke of what sort then he made me no reply he broke the ash off his manilla and smoked silently some moments leaning over the balcony and watching the monotonous flow of the arno with deeper gloom on his face than i remembered to have seen there any time before i was sorry i had chanced to light upon a sketch that had brought him back such painful recollections of whatever kind they might be and i smoked too sending the perfumed tobacco out into the still sultry night that was brooding over florence of what sort said he abruptly after some minutes pause shall i tell you then you can tell me whether i was a fool who made one grand mistake or a sensible man of the world who kept himself from a grand folly i have been often in doubt myself he leaned back his face in shadow so that i could not see it while the arnos ebb and flow was making mournful rivermusic under our windowswhile the purple glories of the summer night deepened round giottos tower where in centuries past the immortal of florence had sat dreaming of the paradiso the mortals passing by whispering him as the man who had seen hell and the light within the room shone on the olives and grapes the cutglass and silver claretjugs the crimson montepulciano and the white hermitage on the table as he told me the story of the head in crayons two years ago i went into the south of france i was charge daffaires at then you remember and the climate had told upon me i was not overwell and somebody recommended me the waters of eaux bonnes the waters i put little faith in but in the air of the pyrenees in the change from diplomacy to a life en rase campagne i put much and i went to eaux bonnes accordingly for july and august with a vow to forswear any society i might find at the bathsi had had only too much of society as it wasand to spend my days in the mountains with my sketchingblock and my gun but i did not like eaux bonnes it was intensely warm there were several people who knew me really no end of others who got hold of my name and wanted me to join their ridingparties and balls and picnics that was not what i wanted so i left the place and went on to luz hoping to find solitude there that valley of luzyou know itis it not as lovely as any artists dream of arcadia in the evening when the sunset light has passed off the meadows and cornlands of the lower valley and just lingers golden and rosy on the crests of the mountains while the glowworms are coming out among the grasses and the lights are being lit in the little homesteads nestling among their orchards one above another on the hillsides and its hundred streams are rushing down the mountains and under the trees foaming and tumbling and rejoicing on their way when i have had my fill of ambition and of pleasure i shall go and live at luz i think when well you are quite right to repeat it ironically that time will never come i dare say and why should it i am not the stuff to cogitate away my years in country solitudes if prizes are worth winning they are worth working for till ones death a man should never give up the field while he has life left in him well i went to luz and spent a pleasant week or so there knocking over a few chamois or izards or sketching on the sides of the pic du midi or tourmalet but chiefly lying about under the great beechtrees in the shade listening to the tinkle of the sheepbells like an idle fellow as i meant to be for the time i had allotted myself one day he stopped and blew some whiffs from his manilla into the air he seemed to linger over the prelude to his story and shrink from going on with the story itself i thought and he smothered a sigh as he raised himself how warm the night is we shall have a tempest reach me that wine theres a good fellow no not the amontillado the chateau margaux please one cant drink hot dry wines such a night as this but to satisfy your curiosity about this crayon studyone day i thought i would go to gavarnie i had heard a good deal of course about the great marble wall and the mighty waterfalls the rocks of marbore and the breche de roland but as it chanced i had never been up to the cercle nor indeed in that part of the midi at all so i went the gods favored me i remember there were no mists the sun was brilliant and the great amphitheatre was for once unobscured the white marble flashing brown and purple rose and golden in the light the cascades tumbling and leaping down into the gigantic basin the vast plains of snow glittering in the sunshine the twin rocks standing in the clear air straight and fluted as any two corinthian columns hewn and chiselled by man good heaven before a scene like gavarnie what true artist must not fling away his colors and his brushes in despair and disgust with his own puerility and impotence what can be transferred to canvas of such a scene as that what does the best beauty of claude the grandest sublimity of salvator the greatest power of poussin look beside nature when she reigns as she reigns at gavarnie i am an art worshipper as you know but there are times in my life places on earth that make me ready to renounce art for ever the day was beautiful and thinking i knew the country pretty well i took no guides i hate them when i can possibly dispense with them but the mist soon swooped down over the cercle and i began to wish i had had one when i turned my horses head back again you know the route of course through the chaosheaven knows it is deserving of its namedown the breakneck little bridlepath along the gave and over the scia bridge to st sauveur you know it then you know that it is much easier to break your neck down it than to find your way by it though by some hazard i did not break my neck nor the animals knees either but managed to get over the bridge without falling into the torrent and to pick my way safely down into more level ground once there i thought i should easily enough find my way to st sauveur but i was mistaken the mists had spread over the valley a heavy storm had come up and somehow or other i lost the way and could not tell where i was whether st sauveur was to the left or the right behind me or in front of me the horse a miserable little pyrenean beast was too frightened by the lightning to take the matter into his hands as he had done on the road through the chaos and i saw nothing for it but to surrender and come to grief in any way the elements best pleased swearing at myself for not having stayed at the inn at gavarnie or gedre wishing myself at the vilest mountain auberge that ever sheltered men and mules pelemele and calling myself hard names for not having listened to my landladys dissuasions of that morning as i left her door from my project of going to gavarnie without a guide which seemed to her the acme of all she had ever known or heard of english strangers fooleries the storm only increased the great black rocks echoing the roll of the thunder and the gave lashing itself into fury in its narrow bed happily i was on decently level ground and the horse being i suppose tolerably used to storms like it i pushed him on at last by dint of blows and conjurations combined to where in the flashes of the lightning i saw what looked to me like the outline of a homestead it stood in a cleft between two shelving sides of rock and a narrow bridlepath led up to it through high yews and a tangled wilderness of rhododendrons boxwood and birchone of those green slopes so common in the pyrenees that look in full sunlight doubly bright and arcadianlike from the contrast of the dark bare perpendicular rocks that shut them in i could see but little of its beauty then in the fog that shrouded both it and me but i saw the shape and semblance of a house and urging the horse up the ascent thundered on its gatepanels with my whiphandle till the rocks round echoed there was no answer and i knocked a little louder if possible than before i was wet to the skin with that wretched storm and swore not mildly at the inhospitable roof that would not admit me under it i knocked again inclined to pick up a piece of granite and beat the panel in and at last a facean old womans weatherbeaten face but with black southern eyes that had lost little of their fire with agelooked through a grating at me and asked me what i wanted i want shelter if you can give it me i answered her i have lost my way coming from gavarnie and am drenched through i will pay you liberally if you will give me an asylum till the weather clears her eyes blazed like coals through the little grille msieu we take no money herehave you mistaken it for an inn come in if you want shelter in heavens name the holy virgin forbid we should refuse refuge to any and she crossed herself and uttered some conjurations to mary to protect them from all wolves in sheeps clothing and guard their dwelling from all harm by which i suppose she thought i spoke fairly and looked harmless but might possibly be a thief or an assassin or both in one she unlocked the gate and calling to a boy to take my horse into a shed admitted me under a covered passageway into the house which looked like part and a very ruined part too of what had probably been in the times of henriquatre and his grandfather a feudal chateau fenced in by natural ramparts from the rocks that surrounded it shutting in the green slope on which it stood with only one egress the path through which i had ascended into the level plain below she marshalled me through this covered way into an interior passage dark and vaulted cheerless enough and opened a low oak door ushering me into a chamber bare gloomy yet with something of lost grandeur and past state lingering about its great hearth its massive walls its stained windows and its ragged tapestry hangings the woman went up to one of the windows and spoke with a gentleness to which i should have never thought her voice could have been attuned with its harsh patois mon enfant vla un msieu etranger qui vient chercher un abri pour un petit peu veuxtu lui parler the young girl she spoke to turned rose and coming forward bade me welcome with the grace simplicity and the naive freedom from embarrassment of a child looking up in my face with her soft clear eyes she was likeno matter you have seen that crayonhead it is but a portrayal of a face whose expression raphael and sassoferrato themselves would have failed to render in its earnest innocent elevated regard she was very young standing with reluctant feet where the brook and river meet womanhood and childhood fleet good heavens i am quoting poetry what will you think of me to have gone back to the wertherian and tennysonian days so far as to repeat a triplet of longfellows no man quotes those poets after his salad days except in a moment of weakness caramba why has one any weaknesses at all we ought not to have any we live in an atmosphere that would kill them all if they were not as obstinate and indestructible as all other weeds whose seeds will linger and peer up and spoil the ground let one root them out ever so i owed you an apology for that lapse into longfellow and i have made it am i to go on with this story he laughed as he spoke and his laugh was by no means heartfelt i told him to go on and he lighted another manilla and obeyed me while the arno murmured on its way and the dusky sultry clouds brooded nearer the earth and the lights were lit in the distant windows of the palace of the marchese acqua doro that fairest of florentines who rouges so indiscriminately and flirts her fan so inimitably to one of whose balls we were going that night he settled himself back in his chair with his face darkened again by the shadow cast on it from the pillar of the balcony and took his cigar out of his mouth she looked incongruous in that bare and gloomy room out of place with it and out of keeping with the old womana french peasantwoman weatherbeaten and bronzed such as you see any day by the score riding to market or sitting knitting at their cottagedoors it was impossible that the girl could be either daughter or granddaughter or any relation at all to her in that room she looked more as one of these myrtles might do set down in the stifling gloomy horrors of a london street than anything else save that in certain traces about the chamber as i told you there were relics of a faded grandeur which harmonized better with her i can see her now as she stood there with a strange foreign grace an indescribable patrician delicacy mingled with extreme youthfulness and naivete like an old picture in costume like one of raphaels childangels in facepoor little florelle you would stay till the storm is over monsieur you are welcome to shelter if you will she said coming forward to me timidly yet frankly cazot tells me you are a stranger and our mountain storms are dangerous if you have no guide i did not know who cazot was but i presumed her to be the old woman who seemed to be portress mistress domestic cameriste and all else in her single person but i thanked her for her permitted shelter and accepted her invitation to remain till the weather had cleared as you can imagine when you have lost your way any asylum is grateful however desolate and tumbledown they made me welcome she and the old peasantwoman with that simple unstrained and unostentatious hospitality which is after all the true essence of good breeding and of which your parvenu knows nothing when he keeps you waiting and shows you that you are come at an inapropos moment in his fussy fear lest everything should not be comme il faut to do due credit to him old cazot set before me some simple refreshment a grillade de chataignes some maize and milk and a dish of trout just caught in the gave below while i looked at my chatelaine marvelling how that young and delicate creature could come to be shut up with an old peasant on a remote hillside i did my best to draw her out and learn her history she was shy at first of a complete stranger as was but natural but i spoke of garvarnie of the beauty of the pyrenees or tourmalet and the lac bleu and warming with enthusiasm for her birthplace the girl forgot that i was a foreign tourist unknown to her and indebted to her for an hours shelter and before my impromptu supper was over i had drawn from her by a few questions which she was too much of a child and had too little to conceal not to answer with a childs ingenuousness the whole of her short history and the explanation of her anomalous position her name was florelle de lheris a name once powerful enough among the nobles of the midi and the old woman madame cazot was her fathers fostersister of her family beggared in common with the best aristocracy of france none were now left they had dwindled and fallen away till of the once great house of lheris this child remained alone its representative her mother had died in her infancy and her father either too idle or too brokenhearted to care to retrieve his fortunes lived the life of a hermit among these ruins where i now found his daughter educating her himself till his death which occurred when she was only twelve years old leaving her to poverty and obscurity and such protection and companionship as her old nurse cazot could afford her such was the story florelle de lheris told me as i sat there that evening waiting till the clouds should clear and the mists roll off enough to let me go to st sauveura story told simply and pathetically and which cazot sitting knitting in a corner added to by a hundred gesticulations expletives appeals to the virgin and prolix addenda glad i dare say of any new confident and disposed to regard me with gratitude for my sincere praises of her fried trout it was a story which seemed to me to suit the delicate beauty of the flower i had found in the wilderness and read more like a chapter of some versified novelette like lucille than a bona fide page out of the book of ones actual life especially in a life like mine of essentially material pleasures and emphatically substantial and palpable ambitions but there are odd stories in real lifestrange pathetic ones toostranger often than those that found the plot and underplot of a novel or the basis of a poem but when such men as i come across them they startle us they look bizarre and unlike all the other leaves of the book that glitter with worldly aphorisms philosophical maxims and pungent egotisms and we would fain cut them out they have the ring of that arcadia whose golden gates shut on us when we outgrew boyhood and in which en revanche we have sworn ever since to disbelievekeeping our word sometimes perhaps to our own hindranceheaven knows i stayed as long as i could that evening till the weather had cleared up so long and the sun was shining again so indisputably that i had no longer any excuse to linger in the darktapestried room with the chestnuts sputtering among the woodashes and madame cazots needles clicking one continual refrain and the soft gazelle eyes of my young chatelaine glancing from my sketches to me with that mixture of shyness and fearlessness innocence and candor which gave so great a charm to her manner she was a new study to me both for my palette and my minda pretty fresh toy to amuse me while i should stay in the midi i was not going to leave without making sure of a permission to return i wanted to have that face among my pastels and when i had thanked her for her shelter and her welcome i told her my name and asked her leave to come again where i had been so kindly received come again monsieur certainly if you care to come but you will find it a long way from luz i fear she said naively looking up at me with her large clear fawnlike eyeseyes so cloudless and untroubled thenas she let me take her hand and bade me adieu et bonsoir i reassured her on that score you can fancy and left her standing in the deepembrasured window a great staghound at her feet and the setting sun all the brighter for its past eclipse bathing her in light i can always see her in memory as i saw her then poor childfaugh how hot the night is cant we get more air anyhow if you come again up here msieu you will be the first visitor the nid de laigle has seen for four years said old cazot as she showed me out through the duskyvaulted passage she was a cheerful garrulous old woman strong in her devotion to the de lheris of the bygone past stronger even yet in her love for their single orphan representative of the beggared present visitors is it likely we should have any msieu those that would suit me would be bad company for maamselle florelle and those that should seek her never do i recollect the time msieu when the highest in all the departments were glad to come to the bidding of a de lheris but generations have gone since then and lands and gold gone too and if you cannot feast them what care people for you that is true in the pyrenees msieu as well as in the rest of the world i have not lived eighty years without finding out that if my child yonder were the heiress of the de lheris there would be plenty to court and seek her but she lives in these poor brokendown ruins with me an old peasant woman to care for her as best i can and not a soul takes heed of her save the holy women at the convent where maybe she will seek refuge at last she let me out at the gate where i had thundered for admittance two hours before and giving her my thanks for her hospitalitymoney she would not takei wished her good day and rode down the bridlepath to st sauveur and onwards to luz thinking at intervals of that fair young life that had just sprung up and was already destined to wither away its bloom in a convent any destiny would be better to proffer to her than that she interested me already by her childlike loveliness and her strange solitude of position and i thought she would while away some of the long summer hours during my stay in the midi when i was tired of chamois and palette and my lazy dolce under the beechwood shades at any rate she was newer and more charming than the belles of eaux bonnes the next morning i remembered her permission and my promise and i rode out through the town again up the mountainroad to the nid de laigle glad of anything that gave me an amusement and a pursuit i never wholly appreciate the far niente i think perhaps i have lived too entirely in the worldand a world ultracold and courtly tooto retain much patience for the meditative life the life of trees and woods sermons in stones and monologues in mountains i am a restless ambitious man i must have a pursuit be it of a great aim or a small or i grow weary and my time hangs heavily on hand already having found florelle de lheris among these hills reconciled me more to my pro tempo banishment from society excitement and pleasure and i thanked my good fortune for having lighted upon her she was very lovely and i always care more for the physical than the intellectual charms of any woman i do not share some mens visionary requirements on their mental score i ask but material beauty and am content with it i rode up to the nid de laigle by a clearer light it stood on a spot of great picturesqueness and before the fury of the revolutionary peasantry had destroyed what was the then habitable and stately chateau must have been a place of considerable extent and beauty and in the feudal times fenced in by the natural ramparts of its shelving rocks no doubt all but impregnable there were but a few ruins now that held together and had a roof over themthe part where madame cazot and the last of the de lheris lived it was perfectly solitary there was nothing to be heard round it but the foaming of the river the music of the sheepbells from the flocks that fed in the clefts and on the slopes of grassland and the shout of some shepherdboy from the path below but it was as beautiful a spot as any in the pyrenees with its overhanging beechwoods its wilderness of wildflowers its rocks covered with that soft gray moss whose tint defies one to repeat it in oil or water colors and its larches and beeches drooping over into the waters of the gave in such a home with no companions save her father old cazot and her great staghound and occasionally the quiet recluses of st marie purificatrice with everything to feed her native poetry and susceptibility and nothing to teach her anything of the actual and ordinary world it were inevitable that the character of florelle should take its coloring from the scenes around her and that she should grow up singularly childlike imaginative and innocent of all that in any other life she would unavoidably have known well educated she was through her father and the nuns but it was a semireligious and peculiar education of which the chief literature had been the legendary and sacred poetry of france and spain the chief amusement copying the illuminated missals lent her by the nuns or joining in the choral services of the convent an education that taught her nothing of the world from which she was shut out and encouraged all that was selfdevoted visionary and fervid in her nature leaving her at seventeen as unconscious of evil as the youngest child i despair of making you imagine what florelle then was had i never met her i should have believed in her as little as yourself and would have discredited the existence of so poetic a creation out of the world of fiction her ethereal delicacy her sunny gayety when anything amused her her intense sensitiveness pained in a moment by a harsh word pleased as soon by a kind one her innocence of all the blots and cruelties artifices and evils of that world beyond her nid de laigle made a character strangely new to me and strangely winning but which to you i despair of portraying i could not have imagined it had i never seen her and had i met with it in the pages of a novel i should have put it aside as a graceful but impossible conception of romance i went up that day to the nid de laigle and florelle received me with pleasure perhaps madame cazot had instilled into her some scepticism that a grand seigneur as the woman was pleased to term me would trouble himself to ride up the mountains from luz merely to repeat his thanks for an hours shelter and a supper of roasted chestnuts she was a simpleminded goodhearted old woman who had lived all her life among the rocks and rivers of the hautespyrenees her longest excursion a marketday to luz or bagneres she looked on her young mistress and charge as a childin truth florelle was but little moreand thought my visit paid simply from gratitude and courtesy never dreaming of attributing it to cette beaute hereditaire des lheris which she was proud of boasting was an inalienable heirloom to the family i often repeated my visits so often that in a week or so the old ruined chateau grew a natural resort in the long summer days and florelle watched for my coming from the deeparched window where i had seen her first or from under the boughs of the great copper beech that grew before the gate and looked for me as regularly as though i were to spend my lifetime in the valley of luz poor child i never told her my title but i taught her to call me by my christian name it used to sound very pretty when she said it with her long southern pronunciationprettier than it ever sounds now from the lips of beatrice acqua doro yonder in her softest moments when she plays at sentiment she had great natural talent for art hitherto uncultivated of course save by such instructions as one of the women at the convent skilful at illuminating had occasionally given her i amused myself with teaching her to transfer to paper and canvas the scenery she loved so passionately i spent many hours training this talent of hers that was of very unusual calibre and with due culture might have ranked her with elisabetta sirani or rosa bonheur sitting with her in the old room or under the beechtrees or by the side of the torrents that tore down the rocks into the gave it pleased me to draw out her unsullied thoughts to spread her mind out before me like a booka pure book enough god knows with not even a stain of the world upon itto make her eyes glisten and glow and dilate to fill them with tears or laughter at my will to wake up her young life from its unconscious untroubled childish repose to a new happiness a new pain which she felt but could not translate which dawned in her face for me but never spoke in its true language to her ignorant then of its very nameit amused me bah our amusements are cruel sometimes and costly too it was at that time i took the head in pastels which you have seen and she asked me in innocent admiration of its loveliness if she was indeed like thatthis night is awfully oppressive is there water in that carafe is it iced push it to me thank you i was always welcome at the nid de laigle old cazot with the instinct of servants who have lived with people of birth till they are as proud of their masters heraldry as though it were their own discerned that i was of the same rank as her adored house of de lherisif indeed she admitted any equal to themand with all the cheery familiarity of a frenchwoman treated me with punctilious deference being as thoroughly imbued with respect and adoration for the aristocracy as any of those who died for the white lilies in the place de la revolution and florelleflorelle watched for me and counted her hours by those i spent with her you are sure i had not read and played with womens hearts so longwomen too with a thousand veils and evasions and artifices of which she was in pure ignorance even of the existencewithout having this heart young unworn and unoccupied under my power at once plastic to mould as wax ready to receive any impressions at my hands and moulded easily to my will florelle had read no love stories to help her to translate this new life to which i awoke her or to put her on her guard against it i went there often every day at last teaching my pupil the art which she was only too glad and too eager to learn stirring her vivid imagination with descriptions of that brilliant outside world of whose pleasures gayeties and pursuits she was as ignorant as any little gentian flower on the rocks keeping her spellbound with glimpses of its life which looked to her like fairyland bizarre bal masque though it be to us and pleasing myself with awakening new thoughts new impressions new emotions which swept over her telltale face like the lights and shades over meadowland as the sun fades on and off it she was a new study a new amusement to me after the women of our world and i beguiled my time with her not thoughtlessly as i might have done not too hastily as i should have done ten years before but pleased with my new amusement and more charmed with florelle than i at first knew though i confess i soon wished to make her love me and soon tried my best to make her do soan easy task when one has had some practice in the rosehued atmosphere of the boudoir among the most difficile and the most brilliant coquettes of europe florelle with a nature singularly loving and a mind singularly imaginative with no rival for me even in her fancy soon lavished on me all the love of which her impassioned and poetic character was capable she did not know it but i did she loved me poor childlove more pure unselfish and fond than i ever won before than i shall ever win again basta why need you have lighted on that crayonhead and make me rake up this story i loathe looking at the past what good ever comes of it a wise man lives only in his present la vita e appunto una memoria una speranza un punto writes the fool of a poet as though the bygone memories and the unrealized hopes were worth a straw it is that very present instant that he despises which is available and in which when we are in our senses we absorb ourselves knowing that that alone will yield a fruit worth having what are the fruits of the others only dead sea apples that crumble into ash i knew that florelle loved me that i and i alone filled both her imagination and her heart i would not precipitately startle her into any avowal of it i liked to see it dawn in her face and gleam in her eyes guilelessly and unconsciously it was a new pleasure to me a new charm in that book of woman of which i had thought i knew every phase and had exhausted every reading i taught florelle to love me but i would not give her a name to my teaching till she found it herself i returned it o yes i loved her selfishly as most people men or women do love let them say what they will very selfishly perhapsa love that was beneath hera love for which had she seen into my heart she might have disdained and hated me if her soft nature could have been moved to so fierce a thing as hatea love that sought its own gratification and thought nothing of her welfarea love not worthy of her as i sometimes felt then as i believe now i had been about six weeks in the pyrenees since the day i lost myself en route from gavarnie most of the days i had spent three or four hours often more at the nid de laigle giving my painting lessons to florelle or being guided by her among the beechwooded and mountain passes near her home the dreariest fens and flats might have gathered interest from such a guide and the glorious beauties of the midi well suited to her gained additional poetry from her impassioned love for them and her fond knowledge of all their legends superstitions histories and associated memories gathered from the oral lore of the peasantry the cradle songs of madame cazot and the stories of the old chronicles of the south heavens what a wealth of imagination talent genius lay in her if i had not destroyed it at length the time drew near when my socalled sojourn at the baths must end one day florelle and i were out sketching as usual she sat under one of the great beeches within a few feet of one of the cascades that fell into the gave du pau and i lay on the grass by her looking into those clear gazelle eyes that met mine so brightly and trustfully watching the progress of her brush and throwing twigs and stones into the spray of the torrent i can remember the place as though it were yesterday the splash of the foam over the rocks the tinkle of the sheepbells from the hills the scent of the wild flowers growing round the glowing golden light that spread over the woodlands touching even the distant crest of mount aigu and the pic du midi strange how some scenes will stamp themselves on the camera of the brain never to be effaced let one try all that one may there that morning i for the first time since we had met spoke of leaving luz and of going back to that life which i had so often amused her by describing happy in her present ignorant of how soon the scenes so familiar and dear to her would tire and pall on me and infinitely too much of a child to have looked beyond or speculated upon anything which i had not spoken of to her it had not presented itself to her that this sort of life could not go on for ever that even she would not reconcile me long to the banishment from my own world and that in the nature of things we must either become more to each other than we were now or part as strangers whom chance had thrown together for a little time she loved me but as i say so innocently and uncalculatingly that she never knew it till i spoke of leaving her then she grew very pale her eyes filled with tears and shunned mine for the first time and as an anatomist watches the quiver of pain in his victim so i watched the suffering of mine it was her first taste of the bitterness of life and while i inflicted the pain i smiled at it pleased in my egotism to see the power i had over her it was cruel i grant it but in confessing it i only confess to what nine out of ten men have felt though they may conceal or deny it you will miss me florelle i asked her she looked at me reproachfully wistfully piteously the sort of look i have seen in the eyes of a dying deer too bewildered by this sudden mention of my departure to answer in words no answer was needed with eyes so eloquent as hers but i repeated it again i knew i gave pain but i knew too i should soon console her her lips quivered and the tears gathered in her eyes she had not known enough of sorrow to have learnt to dissemble it i asked her if she loved me so much that she was unwilling to bid me farewell for the first time her eyes sank beneath mine and a hot painful color flushed over her face poor child if ever i have been loved by any woman i was loved by her then i woke her heart from its innocent peaceful rest with words that spoke a language utterly new to her i sketched to her a life with me that made her cheeks glow and her lips quiver and her eyes grow dark she was lovelier in those moments than any art could ever attempt to picture she loved me and i made her tell me so over and over again she put her fate unhesitatingly into my hands and rejoiced in the passion i vowed her little understanding how selfishly i sought her little thinking in her ignorance of the evil of the world that while she rejoiced in the fondness i lavished on her and worshipped me as though i were some superior unerring godlike being she was to me only a new toy only a pursuit of the hour a plaything too of which i foresaw i should tire isnt it benjamin constant who saysmalheureux lhomme qui dans le commencement dun amour prevoit avec une precision cruelle lheure ou il en sera lasse as it happened i had made that morning an appointment in luz with some men i knew who happened to be passing through it and had stopped there that day to go up the pic du midi the next so that i could spend only an hour or two with florelle i took her to her home parted with her for a few hours and went down the path i remember how she stood looking after me under the heavy gray stonework of the gateway the tendrils of the ivy hanging down and touching her hair that glistened in the sunshine as she smiled me her adieux my words had translated for the first time all the newlydawned emotions that had lately stirred in her heart while she knew not their name i soon lost sight of her through a sharp turn of the bridlepath round the rocks and went on my way thinking of my new love of how completely i held the threads of her fate in my hands and how entirely it lay in my power to touch the chords of her young heart into acute pain or into as acute pleasure with one word of mineof how utterly i could mould her character her life her fate whether for happiness or misery at my will i loved her well enough if only for her unusual beauty to feel triumph at my entire power and to feel a tinge of her own poetry and tenderness of feeling stirring in me as i went on under the green drooping fanlike boughs of the pines thinking of florelle de lheris msieu permettezmoi vous parle un ptit mot madame cazots patois made me look up almost startled for the moment though there was nothing astonishing in her appearance there in her accustomed spot under the shade of a mountainash and a great boulder of rock occupied at her usual task washing linen in the gave as it foamed and rushed over its stones she raised herself from her work and looked up at me shading her eyes from the lighta sunburnt wrinkled hardy old woman with her scarlet capulet her blue cloth jacket and her brown woollen petticoat so strange a contrast to the figure i had lately left under the gateway of the nid de laigle that it was difficult to believe them even of the same sex or country she spoke with extreme deference as she always did but so earnestly that i looked at her in surprise and stopped to hear what it might be she had to say she was but a peasant woman but she had a certain dignity of manner for all that caught no doubt from her long service with and her pride in the de lheris msieu i have no right perhaps to address you you are a grand seigneur and i but a poor peasant woman nevertheless i must speak i have a charge to which i shall have to answer in the other world to god and to my master msieu pardon me what i say but you love maamselle florelle i stared at the woman astonished at her interference and annoyed at her presumption and motioned her aside with my stick but she placed herself in the patha narrow pathon which two people could not have stood without one or other going into the gave and stopped me resolutely and respectfully shading her eyes from the sun and looking steadily at my face msieu a little while ago in the gateway yonder when you parted with maamselle florelle i was coming out behind you to bring my linen to the river and i saw you take her in your arms and kiss her many times and whisper to her that you would come again ce soir then msieu i knew that you must love my little lady or at least must have made her love you i have thought herliving always with herbut a beautiful child still but you have found her a beautiful woman and loved her or taught her love msieu pardon me if i wrong your honor but my master left her in my charge and i am an ignorant old peasant ill fitted for such a trust but is this love of yours such as the sieur de lheris were he now on earth would put his hand in your own and thank you for or is it such that he would wash out its insult in your blood or his her words amazed me for a moment first at the presumption of an interference of which i had never dreamt next at the iron firmness with which this old woman nothing daunted spoke as though the blood of a race of kings ran in her veins i laughed a little at the absurdity of this crossquestioning from her to me and not choosing to bandy words with her bade her move aside but her eyes blazed like fire she stood firm as the earth itself msieu answer me you love maamselle florelleyou have asked her in marriage i smiled involuntarily my good woman men of my class dont marry every pretty face they meet we are not so fond of the institution you mean well i know at the same time you are deucedly impertinent and i am not accustomed to interference have the goodness to let me pass if you please but she would not move she folded her arms across her chest quivering from head to foot with passion her deepset eyes flashing like coals under her bushy eyebrows msieu i understand you well enough the house of the lheris is fallen ruined and beggared and you deem dishonor may approach it unrebuked and unrevenged listen to me msieu i am but a woman it is true and old but i swore by heaven and our lady to the sieur de lheris when he lay dying yonder years ago that i would serve the child he left as my forefathers had served his in peace and war for centuries and keep and guard her as best i might dearer than my own hearts blood listen to me before this love of yours shall breathe another word into her ear to scorch and sully it before your lips shall ever meet hers again before you say again to a de lheris poor and powerless what you would never have dared to say to a de lheris rich and powerful i will defend her as the eagles by the nid de laigle defend their young you shall only reach her across my dead body she spoke with the vehemence and passionate gesticulation of a southern in her patois it is true and with rude eloquence but there was an odd timbre of pathos in her voice harsh though it was and a certain wild dignity about her through the very earnestness and passion that inspired her i told her she was mad and would have put her out of my path but planting herself before me she laid hold of my arm so firmly that i could not have pushed forwards without violence which i would not have used to a woman and a woman moreover as old as she was listen to one word more msieu i know not what title you may bear in your own country but i saw a coronet upon your handkerchief the other day and i can tell you are a grand seigneuryou have the air of it the manner msieu you can have many women to love you cannot you spare this one you must have many pleasures pursuits enjoyments in your world can you not leave me this single treasure think msieu if maamselle florelle loves you now she will love you only the dearer as years go on and you you will tire of her weary of her want change fresh beauty new excitementyou must know that you will or why should you shrink from the bondage of marriageyou will weary of her you will neglect her first and desert her afterwards what will be the childs life then think you have done her cruel harm enough now with your wooing words why will you do her more what is your love beside hers if you have heart or conscience you cannot dare to contrast them together she would give up everything for you and you would give up nothing msieu florelle is not like the women of your world she is innocent of evil as the holy saints those who meet her should guard her from the knowledge and not lead her to it were the sieur de lheris living now were her house powerful as i have known them would you have dared or dreamt of seeking her as you do now msieu he who wrongs trust betrays hospitality and takes advantage of that very purity guilelessness and want of due protection which should be the best and strongest appeal to every man of chivalry and honorhe whoever he be the de lheris would have held as what he is a coward will you not now have pity upon the child and let her go i have seldom been moved in never been swayed from any pursuit or any purpose whether of love or pleasure or ambition but something in old cazots words stirred me strangely more strangely still from the daring and singularity of the speaker her intense love for her young charge gave her pathos eloquence and even a certain rude majesty as she spoke her bronzed wrinkled features worked with emotions she could not repress and hot tears fell over her hard cheeks i felt that what she said was true that as surely as the night follows the day would weariness of it succeed to my love for florelle that to the hospitality i had so readily received i had in truth given but an ill return and that i had deliberately taken advantage of the very ignorance of the world and faith in me which should have most appealed to my honor i knew that what she said was true and this epithet of coward hit me harder from the lips of a woman on whom her sex would not let me avenge it with whom my conscience would not let me dispute it than it would have done from any man i called a coward by an old peasant woman absurd idea enough wasnt it it is a more absurd one still that i could not listen to her unmoved that her words touched mehow or why i could not have toldstirred up in me something of weakness unselfishness or chivalrousnessi know not what exactlythat prompted me for once to give up my own egotistical evanescent passions and act to florelle as though all the males of her house were on earth to make me render account of my acts at old cazots words i shrank for once from my own motives and my own desires shrank from classing florelle with the cocottes of my world from bringing her down to their level and their life you will have pity on her msieu and go asked old cazot more softly as she looked in my face i did not answer her but put her aside out of my way went down the mountainpath to where my horse was left cropping the grass on the level ground beneath a planetree and rode at a gallop into luz without looking back at the grayturreted ruins of the nid de laigle and i left luz that night without seeing florelle de lheris againa tardy kindnessone perhaps as cruel as the cruelty from which old cazot had protected her dont you think i was a fool indeed for once in my life to listen to an old womans prating call me so if you like i shall not dispute it we hardly know when we are fools and when wise men well i have not been much given to such weaknesses i left luz sending a letter to florelle in which i bade her farewell and entreated her to forget mean entreaty which while i made it i felt would not be obeyedone which in the selfishness of my heart i dare say i hoped might not be i went back to my old diplomatic and social life to my customary pursuits amusements and ambitions turning over the leaf of my life that contained my sojourn in the pyrenees as you turn over the page of a romance to which you will never recur i led the same life occupied myself with my old ambitions and enjoyed my old pleasures but i could not forget florelle as wholly as i wished and tried to do i had not usually been troubled with such memories if unwelcome i could generally thrust them aside but florelle i did not forget the more i saw of other women the sweeter and brighter seemed by contrast her sensitive delicate nature unsullied by the world and unstained by artifice and falsehood the longer time went on the more i regretted having given her upperhaps on no better principle than that on which a child cares most for the toy he cannot have perhaps because away from her i realized i had lost the purest and the strongest love i had ever won in the whirl of my customary life i sometimes wondered how she had received my letter and how far the iron had burnt into her young heartwondered if she had joined the sisters of sainte marie purificatrice or still led her solitary life among the rocks and beechwoods of nid de laigle i often thought of her little as the life i led was conducive to regretful or romantic thoughts at length my desire to see her again grew ungovernable i had never been in the habit of refusing myself what i wished a man is a fool who does if his wishes are in any degree attainable and at the end of the season i went over to paris and down again once more into the midi i reached luz lying in the warm golden pyrenean light as i had left it and took once more the old familiar road up the hills to the nid de laigle there had been no outward change from the year that had flown by there drooped the fanlike branches of the pines there rushed the gave over its rocky bed there came the silvery sheepbell chimes down the mountainsides there over hill and wood streamed the mellow glories of the southern sunlight there is something unutterably painful in the sight of any place after ones lengthened absence wearing the same smile lying in the same sunlight i rode on picturing the flush of gladness that would dawn in florelles face at the sight of me thinking that mme cazot should not part me from her again even i thought as i saw the old gray turrets above the beechwoods if i paid old cazots exacted penalty of marriage i loved florelle more deeply than i had done twelve months before labsence allument les grandes passions et eteignent les petites they say it had been the reverse with me i rode up the bridlepath and passed through the old gateway there was an unusual stillness about the place nothing but the roar of the torrent near and the songs of the birds in the branches speaking in the summer air my impatience to see florelle or to hear her grew ungovernable the door stood open i groped my way through the passage and pushed open the door of the old room under the oriel window where i had seen her first she lay on a little couch i saw her againbut how my god to the day of my death i shall never forget her face as i saw it then it was turned from me and her hair streamed over her pillows but as the sunlight fell upon it i knew well enough what was written there old cazot sitting by the bed with her head on her arms looked up and came towards me forcing me back you are come at last to see her die look on your worklook well at itand then go with my curse upon you i shook off her grasp and forcing my way towards the window threw myself down by florelles bed till then i never knew how well i loved her my voice awoke her from her sleep and with a wild cry of joy she started up weak as she was and threw her arms round my neck clinging to me with her little hands and crying to me deliriously not to leave her while she livedto stay with her till death should take her where had i been so long why had i come so late so latethose piteous words as i held her in my arms unconscious from the shock and saw the pitiless marks that disease the most hopeless and the most cruel had made on the face that i had left fair bright and full of life as any childs i felt the full bitterness of that piteous reproach why had i come so late what need to tell you more florelle de lheris was dying and i had killed her the child that i had loved so selfishly had loved me with all the concentrated tenderness of her isolated and impassioned nature the letter i wrote bidding her farewell had given her her deathblow they told me that from the day she received that letter everything lost its interest for her she would sit for hours looking down the road to luz as though watching wearily for one who never came or kneeling before the pictures i had left as before some altar praying to heaven to take care of me and bless me and let her see me once again before she died consumption had killed her mother in her youth during the chill winter at the nid de laigle the hereditary disease settled upon her when i found her she was dying fast all the medical aid all the alleviations luxuries resources that money could procure to ward off the death i would have given twenty years of my life to avert i lavished on her but they were useless for my consolation they told me that used a few months earlier they would have saved her she lingered three weeks fading away like a flower gathered before its fullest bloom each day was torture to me i knew enough of the disease to know from the first there was no hope for her or me those long terrible nighthours when she lay with her head upon my shoulder and her little hot thin hands in mine while i listened uncertain whether every breath was not the last or whether life was not already fled by god i cannot think of them one of those long summer nights florelle died happy with me loving and forgiving me to the last speaking to the last of that reunion in which she in her innocent faith believed and hoped according to the promise of her creeddied with her hands clasped round my neck and her eyes looking up to mine till the last ray of light was quenched in themdied while the morning dawn rose in the east and cast a golden radiance on her face the herald of a day to which she never awoke there was a dead silence between us the arno splashed against the wall below murmuring its eternal song beneath its bridge while the dark heavy clouds drifted over the sky with a sullen roll of thunder he lay back in his chair the deep shadow of the balcony pillar hiding his face from me and his voice quivered painfully as he spoke the last words of his story he was silent for many minutes and so was i regretting that my careless question had unfolded a page out of his lifes history written in characters so painful to him such skeletons dwell in the hearts of most hands need be tender that disentomb them and drag out to daylight ashes so mournful and so grievous guarded so tenaciously hidden so jealously each of us is tender over his own but who does not think his brothers fit subject for jest for gibe for mocking dance of death he raised himself with a laugh but his lips looked white as death as he drank down a draught of the hermitage well what say you is the maxim right yatil femmes et femmes caramba why need you have pitched upon that portfoliothere are the lights in the acqua doros palace we must go or we shall get into disgrace we went and beatrice acqua doro talked very ardent italian to him and the comtesse bois de sandal remarked to me what a brilliant and successful man lord was but how unimpressionableas cold and as glittering as ice nothing had ever made him feel she was quite certain pretty complimentary nonsense though he often talked what would the marchesa and the comtesse have said i wonder had i told them of that little grave under the pyrenean beechwoods so much does the world know of any of us in the lives of all men are doubleddown pages written on in secret folded out of sight forgotten as they make other entries in the diary and never read by their fellows only glanced at by themselves in some midnight hour of solitude basta they are painful reading my friends dont you find them so let us leave the skeletons in the closet the pictures in the portfolio the doubleddown pages in the locked diary and go to beatrice acqua doros where the lights are burning gayly what is madame bois de sandal nee dashwood singing in the music room the tender grace of a day that is dead will never come back to me that is the burden of many songs sung in this world for some dead flowers strew most paths and grass grows over myriad graves and many leaves are folded down in many lives i fear andretrospection is very idle my good fellow and regret is as bad as the tic and flirting is deucedly pleasant the white hermitage we drank tonight is gone we know but are there no other bottles left of wine every whit as good shall we waste our time sighing after spilt lees surely not and yetah methe dead fragrance of those vines that yielded us the golden nectar of our youth the beauty of vicq dazyr or not at all a proper person bon ami do you consider the possession of sisters an agreeable addition to anybodys existence i hold it very intensely the reverse who pats a man down so spitefully as his sisters who refuses so obstinately to see any good in the nazarene they have known from their nurseries who snubs him so contumaciously when hes a little chap in jackets and they young ladies already out who worries him so pertinaciously to marry their pet friend who has ten thousand a year dear red hair im sure she has not its the most lovely auburn but you never see any beauty in refined women who if you incline towards a pretty little ineligible rakes up so laboriously every scrap of gossip detrimental to her and pours into your ear the delightful intelligence that she has been engaged to powell of the grays is a shocking flirt wears false teeth is full five years older than she says she is and has most objectionable connections who i should like to know does any and all of these things my good fellow so amiably and unremittingly as your sisters tillsome day of grace perhapsyou make a telling speech at st stephens and fling a secondhand aroma of distinction upon them or marry a coheiress and ladyinherownright and they raffolent of that charming creature speculating on the desirability of being invited to your house when the men are down for september then what a dear fellow you become they always were so fond of you a little wild oh yes but they are so glad you are changed and think more seriously now it was only from a real interest in your welfare that they used to grieve c c my sisters were my natural enemies i remember when i was in the daisy age and exposed to their thraldom they were so blandly superior so ineffably condescending and wielded with such smiling dexterity that feminine power of torture known familiarly as nagging now of course they leave me in peace but from my earliest to my emancipated years they were my natural enemies i might occasionally excite the enmity it is possible i remember when i was aged eight covering constance a stately brunette with a mortifying amount of confusion by asking her as she welcomed a visitor with effusion why she said she was delighted to see her when she had cried theres that odious woman again as we saw the carriage drive up i have a criminal recollection of taking gwendolinas fan fresh from howell and jamess and stripping it of its goldpowdered down before her face ere she could rush to its rescue as an invaluable medium in the manufacture of mayflies i also have a dim and guilty recollection of saying to the hon george cursitt standing then in the interesting position of my prospective brotherinlaw mr cursitt agneta doesnt care one straw for you i heard her saying so last night to con and that if you werent so near the title she would never have accepted you which revelation inopportunely brought that desirable alliance to an end and olympian thunders on my culprits head i had my sins doubtless but they were more than avenged on me my sisters were my natural enemies and i never knew of any mans who werent so more or less ah my good sirs those domesticities are all of them horrid bores and how any man happily and thrice blessedly free from them can take the very worst of them voluntarily on his head by the gate of marriage which differs thus remarkably from a certain gate at jerusalem that at the one the camels kneel down to be lightened of all their burdens ere they can pass through it at the other the poor human animal kneels down to be loaded with all his ere he is permitted to enter does pass my comprehension i confess i might amply avenge the injuries of my boyhood received from mesdemoiselles mes soeurs could i not tell gwendolina of the pot of money dropped by her caro sposo over the cesarewitch stakes could i not intimate to agneta where her right honorable lord and master spent the small hours last night when popularly supposed to be nodding on the treasury benches in the service of the state could i not rend the pride of constance by casually asking monsieur her husband as i sip her coffee in her drawingroom this evening who was that very pretty blonde with him at the crystal palace yesterday the blonde being as well known about town as any other star of the demimonde of course i could but i am magnanimous i can too thoroughly sympathize with those poor fellows my vengeance would recoil on innocent heads so i am magnanimous and silent my sisters have long ceased to be mesdemoiselles they have become mesdames in that transforming crucible of marriage in which assuredly all that glitters is not gold but in which much is swamped and crushed and fused with uncongenial metal and from which the elixir of happiness but rarely exhales whatever feminine alchemists who patronize the hymeneal furnace may choose to assure us to the contrary my sisters are indisputably very fine women and develop in full bloom all those essential qualities which their moral and mental trainers sedulously instilled into them when they were limited to the schoolroom and thoroughbass garcia and an expurgated shakespeare the society of mademoiselle colletmonte and fraeulein von engel and the occasional refection of a mild religious respectablytwaddling fiction of the milkandwater pioustendency nurserychronicling and grammardisregarding class nowadays indited for the mental improvement of a commonplace generation in general and growing young ladies in particular my sisters are women of the world to perfection indeed for talent in refrigerating with a glance in expressing disdain of a toilette or a ton by an upraised eyebrow in assuming a various impenetrable plaitil expression at a moments notice in sweeping past intimate friends with a charming unconsciousness of their existence when such unconsciousness is expedient or desirable in reducing an unwishedfor intruder into an instantaneous and agonizing sense of his own de tropism and insignificancein all such accomplishments and acquirements necessary to existence in all proper worlds i think they may be matched with the bestbred lady to be found any day from april to august between berkeley square and wilton crescent constance now lady marechale is of a saintly turn and touched with fashionable fanaticism pets evangelical bishops and ragged schoolboys drives to special services and is called our noble and christian patroness by physicians and hon secs holds doctrinal points and strong tracts mixed together in equal proportion an infallible chloride of lime for the disinfectance of our polluted globe and appears to receive celestial telegrams of indisputable veracity and charming acrimony concerning the destiny of the vengeful contents of the seven vials agneta now mrs albany protocol is a cabinet ministress and a second duchesse de longueville in her own estimation at the least is strengthening her party when she issues her dinner invitations whispers awfully of a crisis when even pennypaper leaders cant get up a breeze and spends her existence in pushing poor protocol who thorough englishman that he is considers it a point of honor to stand still in all paths with praiseworthy britannic obstinacy and opticism gwendolina now lady frederic farniente is a butterfly of fashion has delicate health affects dilettanteism is interested by nothing has many other charming minauderies and lives in an exclusive circleso tremendously exclusive indeed that it is possible she may at last draw the cordon sanitaire so very tight that she will be left alone with the pretty woman her mirrors reflect they have each of them attained to what the world calls a good positionan eminence the world dearly reveres if you can climb to it do never mind what dirt may cling to your feet or what you may chance to pull down in your ascent so questions will be asked you at the top when you wave your flag victoriously from a plateau at a good elevation they havent all their ambitionswho has if a fresh alexander conquered the world he would fret out his life for a standingplace to be able to try archimedes little experiment on his newlywon globe lady marechale dies for entrance to certain salons which are closed to her she is but a baronets wife and though so heavenlyminded has some weaknesses of earth mrs protocol grieves because she thinks a grateful country ought to wreathe her lords brow with laurelsanglice strawberryleavesand the country remains ungrateful and the brows bare lady frederic frets because her foe and rival lady maria fitzsachet has footmen an inch taller than her own they havent all their ambitions satisfied we are too occupied with kicking our dear friends and neighbors down off the rounds of the social ladder to advance ourselves always perhaps as entirely as we otherwise might do but still they occupy unexceptionable positions and from those fortified and impregnable citadels are very severe upon those who are not and very jealous of those who are similarly favored by fortune when st peter lets ladies through the celestial portals hell never please them unless he locks out all their acquaintance and indulges them with a gratifying peep at the rejected candidates the triad regard each other after the manner of ladies that is to say lady marechale holds mrs protocol and lady frederic frivolous and worldly lady frederic gives them both one little supercilious expressive epithet precieuses mrs protocol considers lady marechale a pharisee and lady frederic a butterflyin a word there is that charming family love to one another which ladies so delight to evince that i suppose we must excuse them for it on the plea that tis their nature to which dr watts puts forward so amiably and grammatically in excuse for the bellicose propensities of the canine race but which is never remembered by priest or layman in extenuation of the human they dislike one anotherrelatives always dostill the three arms will combine their horse line and field batteries in a common cause and against a common enemy the saint the politician and the butterfly have several rallyingpoints in common and when it comes to the question of extinguishing an ineligible of combining a sneer with a smile of blending the unexceptionablycourteous with the indescribablycontemptuous of calmly shutting their doors to those who wont aggrandize them and blandly throwing them open to those who will it would be an invidious task to give the golden apple and decide which of the three ladies most distinguishes herself in such social prowess need i say that i dont see very much of themsevere strictures on society in general with moral platitudes over the luncheon wines at lady marechales discourse redolent of bluebooks with vindictive hits at protocol and myself for our disinclination to accept a mission and our levity of life and opinions at a period so full of social revolutions and widespread agitation as the present through the soup and fish at agnetas softly hissed acerbities and languidly yawned satires on the prettiest women of my acquaintance over the coffee at lady frederics are none of them particularly inviting or alluring and as they or similar conversational confections are invariably included in each of the three ladies entertainments en petit comite it isnt wonderful if i forswear their drawingrooms cheres dames you complain and your chosen defenders for you that men dont affect your society nowadays save and except when making love to you it isnt our fault indeed you bore us andwhat can we dowe shrink as naturally and pardonably from voluntary boredom as from any other voluntary suffering and shirk an air redolent of ennui from the same principle as we do an air redolent of diphtheria selfpreservation is a law of nature and female society consists too exclusively of milkandwater dashed here and there with citric acid of malice to be either a recherche or refreshing beverage to palates that have tasted warmer spices or more wholesome tonics so i dont see much of my triad of sisters unless accidentally but last august i encountered them by chance at vicq dazyr do you know vicq dazyr no all right when it is known universally it will be spoilt it will soon be fashionable dyspeptic artificial like the crowds that will flock to it its warm bubbling springs will be gathered into long upright glasses and quaffed by yellowvisaged groups brass bands will bray where now the thrushes orioles and nightingales have the woodlands to themselves cavalcades of hired hacks will cut up its thymecovered turf and young ladies will sketch in tortured outline and miserable washes the glorious sweep of its mountains the crimson tints of its forests the rush of its tumbling torrents the golden gleam of its southern sun vicq dazyr will be a spa and will be spoilt dyspepsia and bronchia vanities and flirtations cares and conquests physicians and intrigantes real marchionesses puffing under asthma fictitious marquises strewing chaff for pigeons monde and demimonde grandes dames and dames dindustrie will float into it a mighty army of butterflies with a locust power of destruction vicq dazyr will be no more and in its stead we shall havea fashionable bath vicq dazyr however is free yet from the hand of the spoiler and is charmingits vineclad hills stretching up in sunny slopes its little homesteads nestling on the mountains sides among the pines that load the air with their rich heavy perfume its torrents foaming down the ravines flinging their snowy spray far over the bows of arbutus and mountainash that bend across the brinks of their rushing courses its darkeyed peasant girls that dance at sunset under the lindentrees like living incarnations of florians pastorals its sultry brilliant summer nights when all is still when the birds are sleeping among the ilexleaves and the wind barely stirs the tangled boughs of the woodland when night is down on the mountains wrapping hill and valley crag and forest in one soft purple mist and the silence around is only broken by the mystic music of the rushing waters the soft whirr of the nightbirds wings or the distant chime of a village clock faintly tolling through the aircaramba messieurs i beg your pardon i dont know why i poetize on vicq dazyr i went there to slay not to sketch with a rifle not with a stylus to kill izzards and chamois not to indite a poem a la mode with doublebarrelled adjectives no metre and a purpose nor to add my quota to the luckless loaded walls of the academy by a preraphaelite landscape of arsenical green with the effete trammels of perspective gallantry disregarded and trees like dr syntaxs wife roundabout and rather squat with just twodozenandseven leaves apiece for liberal allowance i went to vicq dazyr amongst other places last august for chamoishunting with dunbar of the queens bays taking up our abode at the toison dor whither all artists tourists men who come for the sport women who come for its scenery or invalids who come for its waters whose properties miserabile dictu are just being discovered as a panacea for every human illfrom a migraine to an incurable pulmonary affliction seek accommodation if they can have it since it is the only hotel in the place though a very good one is adorned with a balcony running round the house twined and buried in honeysuckle and wild clematis which enchants young ladies into instant promotion of it into their sketchbooks and gives you what is of rather more importance and what makes you ready to admire the clematis when under gastronomic exasperation you might swear at it as a harbor for tarantulean omelette i assure you wellnigh as well cooked as you have it at mivarts or meurices at the toison dor we took up our abode and at the toison dor we encountered my two elder sisters constance and agneta travelling for once on the same road as they had left paris together and were together going on to the fashionable capital of a fashionable little toy duchy on the other side of the rhine when they should have finished with the wilder beauties and more unknown charms of vicq dazyr and its environs each lady had her little train of husband courier valet ladysmaid small dog and giant jewelbox i have put the list in the inverse ratio of their importance i believe your husband versus your jewelbox of course my dear madam absurd whats the value of a little simple gold ring against a dozen glittering circlets of diamonds emeralds rubies and garnets each lady was bent on recruiting herself at vicq dazyr after the toils of the season and of shining apres with all the brilliance that a fair share of beauty good positions and money fairly entitled them to expect at the little court ofwe will call it lemongenseidlitzdenominated by its charming duchess princess helene of lemongenseidlitzphizzstrelitz the loveliest and most volage of all minor royalties each lady was strongly opposed to whatever the other wished each thought the weather sultry when the other thought it chilly and vice versa each considered her own ailments unheardof suffering deari could never make any one feel c cand assured you with mild disdain that the others malady was purely nervous entirely exaggerated but she will dwell on it so much poor darling each related to you how admirably they would have travelled if her counsel had been followed and described how the other would take the direction of everything would confuse poor chanderlos the courier till he hardly knew where he was and would take the night express out of pure unkindness just because she knew how ill it always made her the speaker feel to be torn across any country the whole night at that dreadful pace each was dissatisfied with everything pleased with nothing and bored as became ladies of good degree each found the sun too hot or the wind too cold the mists too damp or the air too dry and both combined their forces to worry their ladiesmaids find fault with the viands drive their lords to the registering of an oath never to travel with women again welcome us benignly since they thought we might amuse them and smile their sunniest on dunbarhes heirprospective to the gwynne marquisate and lady marqueterie the saint is not above keeping one eye open for worldly distinctions while mrs albany protocol though a radical is like certain others of the ultraliberal party not above a personal kowtowing before those ridiculous and oughttobe exploded conservative institutionsrank and title at the toison dor i say when after knocking over izzards ad libitum in another part of the district we descended one evening into the valley where vicq dazyr lies nestled in the sunset light with the pretty vendangeuses trooping down from the sloping vineyards and the cattle winding homewards down the hillside paths and the vesperbells softly chiming from the conventtower rising yonder above its woods of linden and acaciaat the toison dor just alighting with the respective suites aforesaid and all those portable embarrassments of books tigerskin rugs flacons of bouquet travellingbags warranted to carry any and everything that the most fastidious can require en route from piccadilly to peru with which ladies do love to encumber and embitter their own persons and their companions lives we met as i have told you mesdames mes soeurs what dear me how very singular never should have dreamt of meeting you so much too quiet a place i should have thought no kursaal here come for sportoh take spes will you poor little dear hes been barking the whole way because he couldnt see out of the window ah major dunbar charmed to see you what an amusing rencontre is it not and lady marechale slightly out of temper for so eminent a christian at the commencement of her greeting smoothed down her ruffled feathers and turned smilingly on dunbar i have said he will be one day marquis of gwynne by george old fellow you in this outoftheway place thats all right sport good here glad to hear it the deuce take me if ever i am lured into travelling in a partie carree again and marechale raised his eyebrows and whispered confidentially to me stronger language than i may commit to print though considering his provocation it was surely as pardonable as uncle tobys the thing i dislike in this sort of hotels and places is the admixture of people with whom one is obliged to come in contact said constance putting up her glass as she entered the long low room where the humble table dhote of the toison dor was spread lady marechale talks sweetly of the equality of persons in the sight of heaven but i never heard her recognize the same upon the soil of earth exactly one may encounter such very objectionable characters i wished to dine in our own apartments but albany said no and he is so positive you know this place seems miserably primitive responded agneta mrs protocol pets rouges and republicans of every country talks liberalism like a feminine sieyes or john bright projects a reform bill that shall bear the strongest possible family resemblance to the decrets du aout and considers social distinctions odious between man and man but her practice is scarcely consistent with her theory seeing that she is about as tenacious and resentful of objectionable contact as a seaanemone who is that i wonder whispered lady marechale acidulating herself in readiness after the custom of english ladies when catching sight of a stranger whom they dont know i wonder all alonehow very queer echoed mrs protocol drawing her black lace shawl around her with that peculiar movement which announces a womans prescience of something antagonistic to her that is to be repelled davance as surely as a hedgehogs transfer of itself into a prickly ball denotes a sense of a coming enemy and a need of caution and selfprotection who is that deucedly handsome woman whispered marechale to me what a charming creature echoed dunbar the person referred to was the only woman at the table dhote besides my sistersa sistertourist probably a handsomenay more a beautiful woman about eightandtwenty distinguishedlooking brilliant with a figure voluptuously perfect as was ever the princess borgheses to say a woman looks a lady means nothing in our day that young lady will wait on you sir says the shopman referring to the shopwoman who will show you your gloves hand the errings to that lady joe you hear a fishmonger cry as you pass his shopdoor referring by his epithet to some mrs gamp or betsy priggs in search of that piscatory cheer at his stall heaven forbid we should give the abused and degenerate title to any woman deserving of the name generalize a thing and it is vulgar a gentleman of my acquaintance says spriggs an auctioneer and houseagent to smith a collector of the waterrate a man i know says pursang one of the cabinet to greville tempest who is heir to a dukedom and has intermarried with a royal house the reason is plain enough spriggs thinks it necessary to inform smith who otherwise might remain ignorant of so signal a fact that he actually does know a gentleman or rather what he terms such pursang knows that tempest would never suspect him of being lie with men who were anything else the one is proud of the fine english the other is content with the simple phrase heaven forbid i say we should nowadays call any woman a lady who is veritably such let us fall back on the dignified definitive courtly lastcenturyname of gentlewoman i should be glad to see that name revived it draws a line that snobbissimi cannot pass and has a grand simplicity about it that will not attract spriggs smith and spark and mesdames s leurs femmes our sistertourist then at the toison dor looked to my eyes at the least much more than a lady she looked an aristocrate jusquau bout des ongles a beautiful brilliant dazzling brunette with lovely hazel eyes flashing like a tartaret falcons under their arched pencilled eyebrows quite an unhoped godsend in vicq dazyr where only stragglers resort as yet thoughalas for my arcadiamy sisters pet physician who sent them thither is about i believe to publish a work entitled the waterspring in the wilderness or a scamper through spots unknown which will do a little advertising of himself opportunely and send hundreds next season to invade the wild woodlands and sunny valleys he inhumanly drags forth into the gasglare of the world the brilliant hazel eyes were opposite to me at dinner and were i confess more attractive to me than the stewed pigeons the crisp froglegs and the other viands prepared by the considering we were in the heart of one of the most remote provinces really not bad cook of the toison dor lady marechale and mrs protocol honored her with that stare by which one woman knows so well how to destroy the reputation of another without speech they had taken her measurement by some method of feminine geometry unknown to us and the result was apparently not favorable to her for over the countenances of the two ladies gathered that expression of stiff dignity and virtuous disdain in the assuming of which as i have observed before they are inimitable proficients evidently not a proper person was written on every one of their lineaments constance and agneta had made up their minds with celerity and decision as to her social status with it is to be presumed that unerring instinct which leads their sex to a conclusion so instantaneously that according to a philosopher a woman will be at the top of the staircase of reasoning by a single spring while a man is toiling slowly up the first few steps you are intending to remain here some days madame asked the fair stranger with a charming smile of lady marechalea pleasant little overture to chance ephemeral acquaintance such as a table dhote surely well warrants but the pleasant little overture was one to which lady marechale was far too english to respond with that inimitable breeding for which our countrymen and women are continentally renowned she bent her head with stately stiffness indulged herself with a haughty stare at the offender and turned to agneta to murmur in english her disgust with the cuisine of the really unoffending toison dor poor spes would eat nothing fenton must make him some panada but perhaps there was nothing better than goats milk in the house what could dr berkeley be thinking of he described the place quite as though it were a second meurices or badischer hof a look of amusement glanced into the sparkling yet languid eyes of my opposite neighbor english she murmured to herself with an almost imperceptible but sufficiently scornful elevation of her arched eyebrows and a slight smile just showing her white teeth as i addressed her in french and she answered me with the ease the aplomb the ever suave courtesy of a woman of the world with that polish which gives the most common subjects a brilliance never their own and that vivacity which confers on the merest trifles a spell to amuse and to charm she was certainly a very lovely creature and a very charming one too frank animated witty with the tone of a woman who has seen the world and knows it dunbar adored her at first sight he is an inflammable fellow and has been ignited a thousand times at far less provocation marechale prepared for himself fifty conjugal orations by the recklessness with which under the very eyes of madame he devoted himself to another woman even albany protocol dull somnolent and superior to such weaknesses as becomes a president of many boards and a chairman of many committees opened his eyes and glanced at her and some young cantabs and artists at the other end of the table stopped their own conversation envying dunbar and myself i believe for our juxtaposition with the belle inconnue while my sisters sat trifling with the wing of a pigeon in voluntary starvation they would have had nothing to complain of you see if they had suffered themselves to dine well with strong disapprobation marked upon their lineaments of this lovely vivacious unknown whoever she might be talking exclusively to each other with a certain expression of sarcastic disdain and offended virtue hinting far more forcibly than words that they thought already the very worst of her so severe indeed did they look that dunbar who is a goodnatured fellow and thinksand thinks justlythat constance and agneta are very fine women left me to discuss hoffmann heine and the rest of germanys satirical poets with my opposite neighbor and endeavored to thaw my sisters a very difficult matter when once those ladies are iced he tried paris but only elicited a monosyllabic remark concerning its weather he tried vicq dazyr and was rewarded for his trouble by a withering sarcasm on the unlucky toison dor he tried chitchat on mutual acquaintances and the unhappy people he chanced to name were severally dismissed with a cutting satire appended to each lady marechale and mrs protocol were in one of those freezing and unassailable moods in which they sealed a truce with one another and combining their forces against a common foe dealt out sharp spherical hardhitting little bullets of speech from behind the abatis in which they intrenched themselves at last he in despair tried lemongenseidlitz and the ladies thawed slightlytheir anticipations from that fashionable little quarter were couleur de rose they would meet their people of the best monde all their dearestthat is of course their most fashionablefriends the dear duchess of frangipane the millamonts those charming people m le marquis de croixetcordon sir henry pullinger mrs merivaledelafield were all there that delightful person too the graf von rosenlaeu who amused them so much at baden last year was as of course dunbar knew master of the horse to the prince of lemongenseidlitzphizzstrelitz they would be well received at the court which last thing however they did not say though they might imply and assuredly fully thought it since lady marechale already pictured herself gently awakening his serene highness to the spiritual darkness of his soul in legitimatizing gamingtables in his duchy and mrs protocol already beheld herself closeted with his first minister giving that venerable metternich lessons in political economy and developing to him a system for filling his beggared treasury to overflowing without taxing the people a kreutzera problem which though it might have perplexed kaunitz colbert pitt malesherbes talleyrand and palmerston put together offered not the slightest difficulty to her enterprising intellect have i not said that sherlock states women are at the top of the staircase while we are toiling up the first few steps the duchessprincess helene is a lovely woman i think winton saw her at the tuileries last winter and raved about her beauty said dunbar finding he had hit at last on an acceptable subject and pursuing it with more zeal than discretion for if there be one thing i take it more indiscreet than another it is to praise woman to woman constance coughed and agneta smiled and both assented oh yesvery lovely they believed and very livelyup to everything i think i have heard went on dunbar blandly unconscious of the meaning of cough smile and assent very lively sighed the saint very lively smiled the politician as gay a woman as marie antoinette continued dunbar too intent on the truffles to pay en meme temps much heed to the subject he was discussing shes copied the trianon hasnt shehas fetes and pastorals there acts in comedies herself shakes off etiquette and ceremonial as much as she can and all that sort of thing i believe lady marechale leaned back in her chair the severe virtue and dignified censure of a british matron and a modern lucretia expressed in both attitude and countenance a second marie antoinettetoo truly and unfortunately so i have heard levity in any station sufficiently reprehensible but when exhibited in the persons of those whom a higher power has placed in exalted positions it is most deeply to be deplored the evil and contagion of its example become incalculable and even when which i believe her excusers are wont to assert of princess helene it is merely traceable to an overgayety of spirit and an overcarelessness of comment and censure it should be remembered that we are enjoined to abstain from every appearance of evil with which constance shook out her phylacteries represented by the thirtyguinea bracadesilk folds of her skirt a dress i heard her describe as very plainserviceable for travelling and glanced at my opposite neighbor with a look which said you are evidently not a proper person but you hear for once what a proper person thinks our charming companion did hear it for she apparently understood english very well she laughed a littlea sweet low ringing laughi was rather in love with her i must sayi am stilland spoke with a slight pretty accent true madame but ah what a pity your st paul did not advise too that people should not go by appearances and think evil where evil is not lady marechale gave stare number two with a curl of her lip and bent her head stiffly what a very strange person she observed to agneta in a murmur meant like a stage aside to be duly heard and appreciated by the audience and yet my sisters are thought very admirably bred women too but then a woman alonea foreigner a strangersurely no one would exact courtesy to such from ladies of position have you ever seen princess helene the duchess of lemongenseidlitz may i ask marechale inquired hastily to cover his wifes sneer hes a very good fellow and finds the constant and inevitable society of a saint slightly trying and a very heavy chastisement for a few words sillily said one morning in st georges i have seen her monsieuryes and is she a second marie antoinette she laughed gayly showing her beautiful white teeth ah bah monsieur many would say that is a great deal too good a comparison for her a second louise de savoiea second duchesse de chevreusenay a second lucrezia borgia some would tell you she likes pleasurewho does not though except those with whom les raisins sont trop verts et bons pour des goujats what an insufferably bold person murmured constance very disagreeable to meet this style of people returned agneta and both stiffened themselves with a little more starch and we know that british wheats produce the stiffest starch in the world who indeed cried marechale regardless of madames frown you know this for truth then of princess helene ah bah monsieur who knows anything for truth laughed the lovely brunette the world dislikes truth so much it is obliged to hide itself in outoftheway corners and very rarely comes to light nobody knows the truth about her some think her as you say a second marie antoinette who is surrendered to dissipation and levity cares for nothing and would dance and laugh over the dead bodies of the people others judge her as others judged marie antoinette discredit the gossip and think she is but a lively woman who laughs at forms likes to amuse herself and does not see why a court should be a prison the world likes the darker picture best let it have it i do not suppose it will break her heart and the fair stranger laughed so sweetly that every man at the dinnertable fell in love with her on the spot and lady marechale and mrs protocol sat throughout the remainder of the meal in frozen dignity and unbreakable silence while the lovely brunette talked with and smiled on us all with enchanting gayety wit and abandon chatting on all sorts of topics of the day dinner over she was the first to rise from the table and bowed to us with exquisite grace and that charming smile of hers of which the sweetest rays fell upon me i swear whether you consider the oath an emanation of personal vanity or not my good sir my sisters returned her bow and her good evening to them with that pointed stare which says so plainly you are not my equal how dare you insult me by a courtesy and scarcely had we begun to sip our coffee upstairs in the apartments chanderlos had secured for the miladies anglaises than the duo upon her began as the two ladies sat with spes between them on a sofa beside one of the windows opening on the balcony that ran round the house a chance inadvertent assent of dunbars a propos ofoh sin unpardonablethe beauty of the incognitas eyes touched the valve and unloosened the hot springs that were seething below in silence a handsome womanoh yes a gentlemans beauty i dare saybut a very odd person commenced mrs protocol a very strange person assented mrs marechale very free manners added agneta quite french chorused constance she has diamond ringspaste no doubt said the politician and rougesthe colors much too lovely to be natural sneered the saint paints her eyebrows too not a doubtand tints her lashes an adventuress i should say or worse evidently not a proper person certainly not through the soft mellow air hushed into evening silence the words reached me as i walked through the window on to the balcony and stood sipping my coffee and looking lazily over the landscape wrapped in sunset haze over the valley where the twilight shadows were deepening and the mountains that were steeped yet in a rosehued golden radiance from the rays that had sunk behind them my dear ladies i cried involuntarily cant you find anything a little more kindly to say of a stranger who has never done you any harm and who fifty to one will never cross your path again bravo echoed marechale who has never gone as quietly in the matrimonial break as protocol and indeed will never be thoroughly broken inbravo women are always studying to make themselves attractive its a pity they dont put down among the items a trifle of generosity and charity it would embellish them wonderfully lady marechale beat an injured tattoo with the spoon on her saucer and leaned back with the air of a martyr and drawing in her lips with a smile whose inimitable sneer any lady might have enviedit was quite priceless it is the first time sir george i should presume that a husband and a brother were ever heard to unite in upbraiding a wife and a sister with her disinclination to associate with or her averseness to countenance an improper person an improper person i cried but my dear constance who ever told you that this lady you are so desperately bitter upon has any fault at all save the worst fault in her own sexs eyesthat of beauty i see nothing in her her manners are perfect her tone you must pardon me if i decline taking your verdict on so delicate a question interrupted lady marechale with withering satire very possibly you see nothing objectionable in hernothing at least that you would call so your views and mine are sufficiently different on every subject and the women with whom i believe you have chiefly associated are not those who are calculated to give you very much appreciation for the more refined classes of our sex very possibly the person in question is what you and sir george too perhaps find charming but you must excuse me if i really cannot to oblige you stoop to countenance any one whom my intuition and my knowledge of the world both declare so very evidently what she should not be she will endeavor most probably if she remain here to push herself into our acquaintance but if you and my husband should choose to insult us by favoring her efforts agneta and i happily can guard ourselves from the objectionable companionship into which those who should be our protectors would wish to force us with which lady marechale with a little more martyrdom and an air of extreme dignity had recourse to her flacon of viola montana and sank among the sofa cushions a model of outraged and spartan virtue i set down my coffeecup and lounged out again to the peace of the balcony marechale shrugged his shoulders rose and followed me lo on the part of the balcony that ran under her windows leaning on its balustrade her white hand white as the flowers playing with the clematis tendrils the paste diamond flashing in the last rays of the setting sun stood our dame dindustrieor worse she was but a few feet farther on she must have heard lady marechales and mrs protocols duo on her demerits she had heard it without doubt for she was laughing gayly and joyously laughter that sparkled all over her riante face and flashed in her bright falcon eyes laughing still she signed me to her i need not say that the sign was obeyed chivalrous knight i thank you you are a bayard of chivalry you defend the absent what a miracle mon dieu tell your friends from me not to speak so loudly when their windows are open and for yourself rest assured your words of this evening will not be forgotten i am happy indeed if i have been fortunate enough to obtain a chance remembrance but do not give me too much praise for so simple a service the clumsiest cimon would be stirred into chivalry under such inspiration as i had the beautiful hazel eyes flashed smilingly on me under their lashes those lashes tinted heaven forgive the malice of women she broke off a sprig of the clematis with its long slender leaves and fragrant starry flowers and gave it to me tenez mon ami if ever you see me again show me that faded flower and i shall remember this evening at vicq dazyr nay do not flatter yourselfdo not thrust it in your breast it is no gage damour it is only a reward for loyal service and a souvenir to refresh my own memory which is treacherous sometimes though not in gratitude to those who serve me adieu mon bayardet bonsoir but i retained the hand that had given me my clematisspray meet you again but will not that be tomorrow if i am not to see you as your words threaten till the clematis be faded and myself forgotten let me at least i beseech you know where who by what name she drew her hand away with something of a proud surprised gesture then she laughed again that sweet ringing mocking laugh no no bayard it is too much to ask leave the future to hazard it is always the best philosophy au revoir adieuperhaps for a day perhaps for a century and the bewitching mystery floated away from me and through the open window of her room you will imagine that my intuition did not lead me to the conclusion to which lady marechales led her or assuredly should i have followed the donor of the clematis despite her prohibition even with my intuition pointing where it did i am not sure what i might have done if in her salon i had not caught sight of a valet and a ladys maid in waiting with her coffee and they are not such spectators as one generally selects the servants closed her windows and drew down their venetian blinds and i returned to my coffee whether the two ladies within had overheard her conversation as she had heard theirs i cannot say but they looked trebly refrigerated had congealed themselves into the chilliest human ice that is imaginable and comported themselves towards me fully as distantly as though i had brought a dozen balletgirls in to dinner with them or introduced them to my choicest acquaintance from the chateau des fleurs a mans taste is so pitiably low remarked lady marechale in her favorite stage aside to mrs protocol to which that other lady responded disgracefully so who was my lovely unknown with the bright falcon eyes and the charming laugh with her strange freedom that yet was not somehow free and her strange fascination i bade my man ask chanderlos her namecouriers know everything generallybut neither mills nor chanderlos gave me any information the people of the house did not know or said they did not they only knew she had servants in attendance who came with her who revealed nothing and paid any price for the best of everything are impertinent questions ever asked where money is plentiful i was dressing the next morning something later than usual when i heard the roll of a carriage in the courtyard below i looked through the halfopen persiennes with a semipresentiment that it was my sweet foreigner who was leaving ere i could presume on my clematis or improve our acquaintance true enough she it was leaving vicq dazyr in a travellingcarriage with handsome roans and servants in imperialblue liveries who the deuce could she be well constance said i as i bade lady marechale good morning your bete noire wont press herself into your acquaintance as you were dreading last night and wont excite marechale and me to any more high treason wont you chant a te deum she left this morning so i perceived answered lady marechale frigidly by which i suppose she had not been above the weakness of looking through her persiennes what a pity you and agneta agitated yourselves with such unnecessary alarm it must have cost you a great deal of eaudecologne and salvolatile i am afraid last night do you think she contaminated the air of the salleamanger because i will order mills to throw some disinfectant about before you go down i have no inclination to jest upon a person of that stamp rejoined lady marechale with immense dignity settling her turquoise wristbandstuds that stamp of persons what do you think she is an adventuress an intrigante or worse still then i hoped her dashing equipage might have done something towards cleansing her character wealth is a universal purifier generally flippant impertinence murmured lady marechale disgustedly to mrs protocol as she swept onwards down the staircase not deigning me a glance much less a response stiffening herself with a little extra starch of lucretian virtue and britishmatronly dignity which did not grow limp again throughout breakfast while she found fault with the chocolate considered the petits pains execrable condemned the sardines as uneatable petted spes kept marechale and me at coventry and sighed over their enforced incarceration by dr berkeleys orders in vicq dazyr that kept them in this stupid place away from lemongenseidlitz their anticipations from lemongenseidlitz were charmingly golden and rosetinted they looked forward to consolidating their friendship with the dear duchess in its balmy air to improving a passing acquaintance into an intimate one with that charming person the baroness liebenfrauenmilch mistress of the robes to princess helene and to being very intimate at the court while the pullingers their bosomfriends and very dear rivals would be simply presented and remain in chagrin uninvited to the state balls and palace festivities and what more delightful than that last clause for what sauce invented from careme to soyer flavors our own plats so deliciously i should like to know as thinking that our beloved nextdoor neighbor is doomed to a very dry cutlet as perette in a humbler fashion built visions from the pot of milk so mesdames mes soeurs from the glittering court and capital of lemongenseidlitz erected brilliant chateaux en espagne of all their sayings and doings in that fashionable little city whither they were bound and into which they had so many invaluable passports they were impatient to be journeying from our humble solitary valley and after a month of vicq dazyr they departed for their golden land and i went with them as i had slain izzards almost ad nauseam and dunbars expiration of leave had taken him back to dublin it was five oclock when we reached its reidenscher hof nine when we had finished dinner it was stupid work yawning over coffee and galignani what was to be done marechale proposed the opera and for the first time in his life was unopposed by his wife constance was in a suave benignant mood she was thinking of her graf von rosenlaeu of the pullingers and of the sweet adroit manner in which she wouldwhen she had captivated him and could proffer such hintsawaken his serene highness to a sense of his moral guilt in not bringing to instant capital punishment every agent in those satanusfarmed banks that throve throughout his duchy lady marechale and mrs protocol assented and to the little miniature gaylydecorated opera house we drove they were in the middle of the second act of ernani ernani was stale to us all and we naturally lorgned the boxes in lieu of the stage i had turned my glass on the lefthand stagebox and was going steadily round when a faint cry of dismay alarm amazement horror broke muffled and low from mesdames mes soeurs their lorgnons were riveted on one spot their cheeks were blanched their hands were tremulous if they had beheld a spiritual visitant no consternation more profound more intense could have seized both with its iron hand my sisters too the chilliest the calmest the most impenetrable the most unassailable of mortals and we called her in her hearing not a proper person gasped lady marechale we thought her a lorette an intrigante a dame dindustrie echoed mrs protocol who wore paste jewels who came from the rue breda who wanted to know us whom we wouldnt know i turned my voightlander where their voightlanders turned there in the royal box leaning back in the fauteuil that marked her rank there with her lovely hazel eyes her witching smile her radiant beauty matchless as the pearls gleaming above her brow there sat the adventuressor worse of vicq dazyr the evidently a not proper person of my discerning sistershsh princess helene grandduchess of lemongenseidlitzphizzstrelitz great heavens how had we never guessed her before how had we never divined her identity how had we never remembered all we had heard of her love of laisseraller her taste for adventure her delight in travelling when she could unattended and incognita how had we never put this and that together and penetrated the metamorphosis and i called her not a proper person gasped lady marechale again shrinking back behind the azure curtains the projectiles she had shot with such vindictive severity such delighted acrimony from the murderous mortar of malice recoiling back upon her head for once and crushing her to powder what reception would they have now at the court von rosenlaeu would be powerless the pullingers themselves would be better off perettes pot of milk was smashed and spilt adieu veau vache cochon couvee when the pitcher lies shivered into fragments and the milk is spilt you know poor perettes dreams are shivered and spilt with them i have not seen you at the palace yet asked her grace of frangipane we do not see you at the court mesdames asked m de la croixetcordons how did it happen you were not at the duchesss ball last night asked those odious pullingers and what had my sister to say in reply my clematis secured me a charming receptionhow charming i dont feel called upon to revealbut princess helene with that calm dignity which easily replaced when she chose her witching abandon turned the tables upon her detractors and taught them how dangerous it may be to speak illof the wrong people a study a la louis quatorze pendant to a portrait by mignard she was surpassingly fair madame la marquise mignards portraits of her may fully rival his farfamed portrait aux amours one of them has her painted as venus victrix in the fashion of the day one of them as herself as leontine opportune de vivonne de rennecourt marquise de la riviere with her crevecoeurs and her diamonds and her gay smile showing her teeth white and gleaming as the pearls mingled with her curls a la mode montespan not louise de la beaumeleblanc when the elmboughs of st germain first flung their shadow on her golden head before it bent for the carmelite veil before the altar in the rue st jacques not henriette dangleterre when she listened to the trouveres romances sung under her balcony at st cloud before her young life was quenched by the hand of morel and the order of monsieur not athenais de mortemart when the liveries of lapis lazuli blue dashed through the streets of paris and the outriders cleared her path with their whips before the game was lost and the iron spikes were fastened inside the montespan braceletsnone of them her contemporaries and acquaintances eclipsed in loveliness madame la marquise had she but been fair instead of dark the brown bourbon eyes would have fallen on her of a surety she would have outshone the lapis lazuli liveries with a royal guard of scarlet and gold and her friend athenais would have hated her as that fair lady hated la sotte fontanges and saint maintenon for their sex in all ages have remembered the sages precept love as though you will one day hate and invariably carry about with them ready for need a little essence of the acid of malice to sour in an instant the sugared cream of their loves and their friendships if occasion rise up and the stormcloud of rivalry loom in the horizon she was a beauty madame la marquise and she knew it as she leaned out over the balcony of her chateau of petite foret that lay close to clagny under the shadow of the wood of ville davree outside the gates of versailles looking down on her bosquets gardens and terraces designed by le notre for though she was alone and there was nothing but her little dog osmin to admire her white skin and her dark eyes and her beautiful hands and arms and her diamond pendants that glittered in the moonlight she smiled her flashing triumphant smile as she whispered to herself he is minemine bah how can he help himself and pressed the ruby agraffe on her bosom with the look of a woman who knew no resistance and brooked no reluctance to worship at her shrine nothing ever opposed madame la marquise and life went smoothly on with her if bossuet ever reproved her it was in those anathemes caches sous des fleurs doranger in which that politic priest knew how to deal when expedient however haughty and relentless to the world in general m le marquis was not a savage eccentricity like m de pardaillon de gondran would never have dreamt of imitating the eccentricity of going into mourning but if the bourbon eye had fallen on his wife would have said like a loyal peer of france that all his household treasures were the kings disagreeables fled before the scintillations of her smiles as the crowd fled before her gilded carriage and her flanders horses and if ever a little fit of piety once in a while came over her and conscience whispered a mal a propos word in her delicate ear she would give an enamelled lamp to sainte marie reparatrice by the advice of the comtesse de soubise and the princesse de monaco who did such expiatory things themselves and knew the comfort they afforded and emerge from her repentance one of the most radiant of all the brilliant butterflies that fluttered their gorgeous wings in the jardin de flore under the sunny skies of versailles the moonlight glittered on the fountains falling with measured splash into their marble basins the limeleaves faintly stirred by the sultry breezes perfumed the night with their voluptuous fragrance and the roses twining round the carved and gilded balustrade shook off their bowed head drops of dew that gleamed brightly as the diamonds among the curls of the woman who leaned above resting her delicate rouged cheek on her jewelled hand alonea very rare circumstance with the marquise de la riviere osmin did not admire the rare solitude for he rattled his silver bells and barkedan italian greyhounds shrill fretful barkas his quick ears caught the distant sound of steps coming swiftly over the turf below and his mistress smiled as she patted his head ah osminhere he is a man came out from under the heavy shadow of lime sand chestnuts whose darkness the moons rays had no power to pierce crossed the lawn just under the balcony and coming up the terracesteps stood near hera man young fair handsome whose age and form the uniform of a captain of the guards would have suited far better than the dark robes of a priest which he wore his lips were pressed closely together and his face was pale with a pallor that consorted painfully with the warm passionate gleam of his eyes so you are late in obeying my commands monsieur surely no other man in france would have stood silent beside her under the spell of her dazzling glances with such a picture before him as madame la marquise in her azure silk and her point dangleterre with her diamond pendants shaking among her hair and her arched eyebrows lifted imperiously but he did his lips pressed closer his eyes gleaming brighter she changed her tone it was soft seductive reproachful and the smile on her lips was tenderas tender as it ever could be with the mockery that always lay under it and it broke at last the spell that bound him as she whispered ah gaston you love me no longer not love you o god they were but five words but they told madame la marquise of a passion such as she had never roused despite all her fascinations and intrigues in the lovers that crowded round her in the salons within or at versailles over the trees yonder where love was gallantry and all was light comedy with nothing so foolish as tragedy known he clasped her hands so closely that the sharp points of the diamond rings cut his own though he felt them not not love you great heaven not love you near you i forget my oath my vows my godi forget all save you whom i adore as till i met you i adored my church torture endured with you were dearer than paradise won alone once with you i have no strength you bow me to your will as the wind bows the limeleaf oh woman woman could you have no mercy that with crowds round you daily worshipping your slightest smile you must needs bow me down before your glance as you bow those who have no oaths to bind them no need to scourge themselves in midnight solitude for the mere crime of thought had you no mercy that with all hearts yours you must have mine to sear it and destroy it have you not lives enough vowed to you that you seek to blast mine for ever i was content untroubled till i met you no womans glance stirred my heart no womans eyes haunted my vigils no womans voice came in memory between my soul and prayer what devil tempted you to throw your spells over mecould you not leave one man in peace ah bah the tempted love the game of temptation generally full as well as the tempters thought madame la marquise with an inward laugh why did she allow such language to go unrebuked why did she to whom none dared to breathe any but words the most polished and love vows the most honeyed permit herself to be addressed in such a strain possibly it was very new to her such energy as this and such an outbreak of passion amused her at any rate she only drew her hands away and her brilliant brown eyes filled with tearstears were to be had at versailles when needed even her friend montespan knew how to use them as the worst weapons against the artillery of the eveque de comdomand her heart heaved under the filmy lace ah gaston what words what devil tempted me i know scarcely whether love be angel or devil he seems either or both but you love me little unless in that name you recognize a plea for every madness and every thought the scarlet blood flushed over his face and his eyes shone and gleamed like fire while he clenched his hands in a mortal anguish angel or devil ay which indeed the one when it comes to us the other when it leaves us you have roused love in me i shall bear to my grave but what gage have i that you give it me back how do i know but that even now you are trifling with me mocking at me smiling at the beardless priest who is unlearned in all the gay gallantries of libertine churchmen and soldierly courtiers my heaven how know as i stand beside you whether you pity or disdain me love or scorn me the passionate words broke in a torrent from his lips stirred the stillness of the summer eve with a fiery anguish little akin to it do i not love you her answer was simple but as leontine de rennecourt spoke it leaning her cheek against his breast with her eyes dazzling as the diamonds in her hair looking up into his by the light of the stars they had an eloquence far more dangerous than speech and delirious to the senses as magicians perfumes his lips lingered on hers and felt the loud fast throbs of the heart she had won as he bent over her pressing her closer and closer to himvanquished and conquered as men in all ages and of all creeds have been vanquished and conquered by women all other thoughts fleeing away into oblivion all fears dying out all vows forgotten in the warm living life of passion and of joy that for the first time in a brief life flooded his heart with its golden voluptuous light you love me so be it he murmured but beware what you do my life lies in your hands and you must be mine till death part us till my fancy change rather thought madame la marquise as she put her jewelled hand on his lips her hair softly brushing his cheek with a touch as soft and an odor as sweet as the leaves of one of the roses twining below two men strolling below under the limes of petite foretdiscussing the last scandals of versailles talking of the ascendency of la fontanges of the spanish dress his majesty had reassumed to please her of the brinvilliers poudre de succession of the new chateau given to pere de la chaise of daubignys last extravagance and lauzuns last mot and the last gossip about bossuet and mademoiselle de mauleon and all the chitchat of that varied day glittering with wit and prolific of poisonglanced up to the balcony by the light of the stars that cursed priest muttered the younger le vicomte de saintelix as he struck the head off a lily with his delicate cane in a fools paradise ahha madame la marquise laughed the otherthe old duc de closvougeottaking a chocolate sweetmeat out of his emeraldstudded bonbonniere as they walked on while the limeblossoms shook off in the summer night wind and dropped dead on the grass beneath laughing at the story of the box dartagnan had found in lauzuns rooms when he seized his papers containing the portraits of sixty women of high degree who had worshipped the resistless captain of the guard with critical and historical notices penned under each notices dartagnan and his aide could not help indiscreetly retailing in despite of the bourbon command of secrecysecrecy so necessary where sixty beauties and saints were involved a fools paradise said the duc de closvougeot tapping his bonbonniere enamelled by petitot the duc was old and knew women well and knew the value and length of a paradise dependent on that most fickle of butterfliesfemale fidelity he had heard ninon de lenclos try to persuade scarrons wife to become a coquette and scarrons wife in turn beseech ninon to discontinue her coquetteries had seen that however different their theories and practice the result was the same and already guessed right that if paris had been universally won by the one its monarch would eventually be won by the other a fools paradise the courtier was right but the priest had he heard him would never have believed his heaven shone in those dazzling eyes till the eyes closed in death his heaven was safe he had never loved he had seen nothing of women he had come straight from the monastic gloom of a dominican abbey in the very heart of the south down in languedoc where costly missals were his only idol and rigid pietists profoundly ignorant of the ways and thoughts of their brethren of paris had reared him up in anchorite rigidity and scourged his mind with iron philosophies and stoiclike doctrines of selfmortification that would have repudiated the sophistries and ingenuities of sanchez escobar and mascarenhas as suggestions of the very master of evil himself from the ascetic gloom of that languedoc convent he had been brought straight by superior will into the glare of the life at versailles that brilliant gorgeous sparkling bizarre life scintillating with wit brimful of intrigue crowded with the men and women who formed the court of that age and the history of the next where he found every churchman an abbe galant and heard those who performed the mass jest at it with those who attended it where he found no lines marked of right and wrong but saw them all fused in a gay tangled web of two court colorsexpediency and pleasure a life that dazzled and tired his eyes as the glitter of lights in a room dazzles and tires the eyes of a man who comes suddenly in from the dark night air till he grew giddy and sick and in the midst of the gilded salons or soft confessions of titled sinners would ask himself if indeed he could be the same man who had sat calm and grave with the mellow sun streaming in on his missalpage in the monastic gloom of the languedoc abbey but so few brief months before when all this world of versailles was unknown the same man truly notnever again the same since madame la marquise had bent her brown eyes upon him been amused with his singular difference from all those around her had loved him as women loved at versailles and bowed him down to her feet before he guessed the name of the forbidden language that stirred in his heart and rushed to his lips untaught and unbidden a fools paradise said the duc sagaciously tapping his gold bonbonniere but many a paradise like it has dawned and faded before and since the versailles of louis quatorze he loved and madame la marquise loved him through one brief tumult of struggle he passed struggle between the creed of the dominican abbey where no sin would have been held so thrice accursed so unpardonable so deserving of the scourge and the stake as thisand the creed of the bourbon court where churchmens gallantries were everyday gossip where the abbe de rance ere he founded the saintly gloom of la trappe scandalized town and court as much as lauzun where the pere de la chaise smiled complacently on la fontanges ascendancy where three nobles rushed to pick up the handkerchief of that royal confessor who washed out with holy water the royal indiscretions as you wash off grains of dust with perfumed water where the great and saintly bishop of condom could be checked in a rebuking harangue and have the tables turned on him by a mischievous reference to mademoiselle de mauleon where life was intrigue for churchmen and laymen alike and where the abbes rochet and the cardinals scarlet covered the same vices as were openly blazoned on the gold aiglettes of the garde du corps and the costly lace of the chambellan du roi a storm brief and violent as the summer storms that raged over versailles was roused between the conflicting thoughts at war within him between the principles deeply rooted from long habit and stern belief and the passions sprung up unbidden with the sudden growth and gorgeous glow of a tropical flowera storm brief and violent a struggle ended that night when he stood on the balcony with the woman he loved felt her lips upon his and bowed down to her feet delirious and strengthless i have won my wager with adeline i have vanquished mon beau de launay thought madame la marquise smiling two days after as she sat en neglige in her broidered chair pulling osmins ears and stirring the frothy chocolate handed to her by her negro azor brought over in the suite of the african embassy from ardra full of monkeyish espieglerie and covered with gemsa priceless dwarf black as ink and but two feet high who could match any day with the queens little moor he amuses me with his vows of eternal love eternal lovehow de trop we should find it here in versailles but it is amusing enough to play at for a season no that is not half enoughhe adores this poor gaston so in the salons of versailles and in the world where ninon reigned by the court ladies while they loitered in the newmade gardens of marly among other similar things jested of was this new amour of madame de la riviere for the young pere de launay she was always eccentric and he was very handsome and would have charming manners if he were not so grave and so silent the women averred while the young nobles swore that these meddling churchmen had always the best luck whether in amatory conquest or on fat lands and rich revenues what the priest of languedoc thought a love that would outlast life and repay him for peace of conscience and heaven both lost was only one of the passing bubbles of gossip and scandal floating for an hour amidst myriads like it on the glittering fastrushing diamondbright waters of life at versailles a new existence had dawned for him far away in the dim dusky vista of forgotten things though in reality barely distant a few short months lay the old life in languedoc vague and unremembered as a passed dream with its calm routine its monastic silence its unvarying alternations of study and prayer its ironbound thoughts its rigid creed it had sunk away as the peaceful gray twilight of a summers night sinks away before the fiery burst of an artificial illumination and a new life had dawned for him radiant tumultuous conflicting deliciousthat dazzled his eyes with the magnificence of boundless riches and unrestricted extravagance that charmed his intellect with the witty coruscations the polished esprit of an age unsurpassed for genius grace and wit and that swayed alike his heart his imagination and his passions with the subtle intoxication of this syren of love whose forbidden song had never before in faintest echo fallen on his ear far away in the dim lifeless pulseless past sank the memory of the old dominican abbey of all it had taught him of all it had exacted in its iron stoical merciless creed a new life had arisen for him and gaston de launay waking from the semislumber of the living death he had endured in languedoc and liked because he knew no other was happyhappy as a prisoner is in the wild delight with which he welcomes the sunlight after lengthened imprisonment happy as an opiumeater is in the delicious delirium that succeeds the lulling softness of the opiate he loves me poor gaston bah but how strangely he talks if love were this fiery changeless earnest thing with us that it is with him what in the world should we do with it we should have to get a lettre de cachet for it and forbid it the court send it in exile to pignerol as they have just done lauzun love in earnest we should lose the best spice for our wine the best toy for our games and mon dieu what embroilments there would be love in earnest bagatell louise de la valliere shows us the folly of that but for its quixotisms she would now be at vaujours instead of buried alive in that rue st jacques with nothing to do but to weep for louison count her beads and listen to m de condoms merciless eloquence like the king jaime quon maime mais avec de lesprit people have no right to reproach each other with inconstancy ones caprices are not in ones own keeping and one can no more help where ones fancy blows than that limeleaf can help where the breeze chooses to waft it but poor gaston how make him comprehend that thought madame la marquise as she turned and smiled and held out her warm jewelled hands and listened once again to the words of the man who was in her power as utterly as the bird in the power of the snake when it has once looked up into the fatal eyes that lure it on to its doom you will love me ever he would ask resting his lips on her white low brow ever would softly answer madame la marquise and her lover believed her should his deity lie he believed her what did he fresh from the solitude of his monastery gloomy and severe as that of the trappist abbey with its perpetual silence its lowered glances its shrouded faces its everpresent memento mori know of womens faith of womens love of the sense in which they meant that vow for ever he believed her and never asked what would be at the end of a path strewn with such odorous flowers alone it is true in moments when he paused to think he stood aghast at the abyss into which he had fallen at the sin into which a few months before haughty and stern in virtue against the temptation that had never entered his path he would have defied devils in legion to have lured him yet into which he had now plunged at the mere smile of a woman out of her presence out of her spells standing by himself under the same skies that had blooded over his days of peace in languedoc back on his heart with a sickening anguish would come the weight of his sin the burden of his broken oaths the scorch of that curse eternal which by his creed he held drawn down on him here and hereafter and gaston de launay would struggle again against this idolatrous passion which had come with its fell delusion betwixt him and his god strugglevainly idlystruggle only to hug closer the sin he loved while he loathed only to drink deeper of the draught whose voluptuous perfume was poison only to forget all forsake all dare all at one whisper of her voice one glance of her eyes one touch of the lips whose caress he held would be bought by a curse through eternity few women love aught for ever save perchance diamonds lace and their own beauty and madame la marquise was not one of those few certainly notshe had no desire to make herself singular in her generation and could set fashions much more likely to find disciples without reverting to anything so eccentric plebeian and out of date love one for ever she would have thought it as terrible waste of her fascinations as for a jewel to shine in the solitude of its case looked on by only one pair of eyes or for a priceless enamel by petitot to be only worn next the heart shrouded away from the light of day hidden under the folds of linen and lace love one for evermadame la marquise laughed at the thought as she stood dressed for a ball after assisting at the representation of a certain tragedy called berenice in which mesdames deshoulieres and de sevigne despite their esprit alone of all paris and the court could see no beauty and glanced in the mirror at her radiant face her delicate skin her raven curls with their pendants shaking her snowwhite arms and her costly dress of the newest mode its stomacher gleaming one mass of gems love one for ever the droll idea is it not enough that i have loved him once it was more than enough for his rivals who bitterly envied him courtly abbes with polished smiles and young chanoines with scented curls and velvet toques courtiers who piqued themselves on reputations only second to lauzuns and men of the world who laughed at this new caprice of madame la marquise alike bore no good will to this languedoc priest and gave him a significant sneer or a compliment that roused his blood to fire and stung him far worse than more open insult when they met in the salons or crossed in the corridors at versailles or petite foret those men those men should he ever lose her to any one of them he would think over and over again clenching his hand in impotent agony of passion that he had not the sword and the license of a soldier to strike them on the lips with his glove for the smile with which they dared to speak her name to make them wash out in blood under the trees before the sun was up the laugh the mot the delicate satire which were worse to bear than a blow to the man who could not avenge them pardieu madame must be very unusually faithful to her handsome priest she has smiled on no other for two months what unparalleled fidelity said the vicomte de saintelix with petulant irritation jealous leonce laughed the old duc whom he spoke to tapping the medallion portrait on his bonbonniere take comfort when the weather has been so long fixed it is always near a change ah m de launay overhears he looks as if he would slay us very unchristian in a priest gaston de launay overheard as he stood by a croisee at petite foret playing with osminhe liked even the dog since the hand he loved so often lay on its slender neck and toyed with its silver chain and sworn as he was to the service of his church sole mistress as his church had been till leontine de rennecourts eyes had lured him to his desertion of her apostate in his own eyes as such a thought confessed him to have grown he now loathed the garb of a priest that bound his hands from vengeance and made him powerless before insult as a woman fierce ruthless longing for revenge upon these men seized on him devilish desires the germ of which till that hour he never dreamt slumbered within him woke up into dangerous vigorous life had he lived in the world its politic reserve its courtly sneer its light gallantries that passed the time and flattered amourpropre its dissimulated hate that smiled while plotting and killed with poisoned bonbons would never have been learnt by him and having long lived out of it having been suddenly plunged into its whirl not guessing its springs ignorant of its diplomacies its suave lies termed good breeding its legeres philosophies he knew nothing of the wisdom with which its wise men forsook their loves and concealed their hatreds both passions now sprung up in him at one birth both the stronger for the long years in which a chill artificial but unbroken calm had chained his very nature down and fettered into an iron monotony an unnatural and colorless tranquillity a character originally impetuous and vivid as the frosts of a winter chill into one cold even glassy surface the rapids of a tumultuous river with the same force and strength with which in the old days in languedoc he had idolized and served his church sparing himself no mortification believing every iota of her creed carrying out her slightest rule with merciless selfexamination sothe tide once turned the other wayso the priest now loved so he now hated he is growing exigeant jealous presuming he amuses me no longerhe wearies i must give him his conge thought madame la marquise this play at eternal passion is very amusing for a while but like all things gets tiresome when it has lasted some time what does not poor gaston it is his provincial ideas but he will soon rub such off and find like us all that sincerity is troublesome ever de trop and never profitable he loves mebut bah so does saintelix so do they all and a jealous husband like m de nesmond le drole could scarcely be worse than my young de launay is growing and madame la marquise glanced at her face in the mirror and wished she knew madame de maintenons secret for the breuvage indien wished she had one of the clefs de faveur to admit her to the grande salle du parlement wished she had the couronne dagrippine her friend athenais had just shown her wished le brun were not now occupied on the ceiling of the kings grande galerie and were free to paint the frescoes of her own newbuilt chapel wished a thousand unattainable things as spoilt children of fortune will do and swept down her chateau staircase a little out of tempershe could not have told whyto receive her guests at a fete given in honor of the marriage of mademoiselle de blois and the prince de conti there was the young comte de vermandois who would recognize in the dauphin no superiority save that of his frere aine there was le petit bossu prince eugene then soliciting the rochet of a bishop and equally ridiculed when he sought a post in the army there was m de louvois who had just signed the order for the dragonades there was the palatine de baviere with her german brusquerie who had just clumsily tried to insult madame de montespan by coming into the salon with a great turnspit led by a similar ribbon and called by the same name in ridicule of the pet montespan poodle there was la montespan herself with her lovely gold hair her doves eyes and her serpents tongue there was madame de sevigne and madame de grignan the duchesse de richelieu and the duchesse de lesdiguieres there was bussy rabutin and hamilton who was there not that was brilliant that was distinguished that was high in rank and famed in wit at the fete of madame la marquisemadame la marquise who floated through the crowd that glittered in her salon and gardens who laughed and smiled showing her dazzling white teeth who had a little cupid gleaming with jewels emblematic enough of cupid as he was known at versailles to present the princesse de conti with a bridal bouquet whose flowers were of pearls and whose leaves were of emeralds who piqued herself that the magnificence of her fete was scarcely eclipsed by his majesty himself who yielded the palm neither to la vallieres lovely daughter nor to her friend athenais nor to any one of the beauties who shone with them and whose likeness by mignard laughed down from the wall where it hung matchless double of her own matchless self the priest of languedoc watched her the relentless fangs of passion gnawing his heart as the wolf the spartan for the first time he was forgotten his idol passed him carelessly gave him no glance no smile but lavished a thousand coquetries on saintelix on de rohansoubise on the boy vermandoison any who sought them once he addressed her madame la marquise shrugged her snowwhite shoulders and arched her eyebrows with petulant irritation and turned to laugh gayly at saintelix who was amusing her and la montespan and madame de thianges with some gay mischievous scandal concerning madame de lesdiguieres and the archbishop of paris for scandals if not wholly new are ever diverting when concerning an enemy especially when dressed and served up with the piquant sauce of wit i no longer then madame lead a dogs life in jealousy of this priest whispered saintelix after other whispers in the ear of madame la marquise the vicomte adored her not truly in languedoc fashion but very warmlya la mode de versailles the marquise laughed perhaps not you know i bet mme de montevreau that i would conquer him i have won now hush he is close there will be a tragedy mon ami m le vicomte if you have the honor of a noble the heart of a man you fight me tonight i seek no shelter under my cloth saintelix turned as he heard the words laughed scornfully and signed the speaker away with an insolent sneer bah reverend pere we do not fight with women and churchmen the fete was ended at last the lights that had gleamed among the limes and chestnuts had died out the gardens and salons were emptied and silent the little cupid had laid aside his weighty jewelled wings the carriages with their gorgeous liveries their outriders and their guards of honor had rolled from the gates of petite foret to the palace of versailles madame la marquise stood alone once more in the balcony of her salons leaning her white arms on its gilded balustrade looking down on to the gardens beneath silvered with the breaking light of the dawn smiling her white teeth gleaming between her parted rosehued lips and thinkingof what who shall say still still as death lay the gardens below that an hour ago had been peopled with a glittering crowd reechoing with music laughter witty response words of intrigue where the lights had shone on diamonds and pearlbroidered trains on softly rouged cheeks and goldlaced coats on jewelled swords and broideries of gold the gray hue of the breaking day now only fell on the silvered leaves of the limes the turf wet with dew he drooped heads of the provence roses and madame la marquise standing alone started as a step through the salon within broke the silence madame will you permit me a word now gaston de launay took her hands off the balustrade and held them tight in his while his voice sounded even in his own ears strangely calm yet strangely harsh madame you love me no longer monsieur i do not answer questions put to me in such a manner she would have drawn her hands away but he held them in a fierce grasp till her rings cut his skin as they had done once before no trifling answeryes or no well no then monsieur since you will have the truth do not blame me if you find it uncomplimentary and unacceptable he let go her hands and reeled back staggered as if struck by a shot mon dieu it is trueyou love me no longer and you tell it me thus madame la marquise for an instant was silenced and touched for the words were uttered with the faint cry of a man in agony and she saw even by the dim twilight of dawn how livid his lips turned how ashy gray grew the hue of his face but she smiled playing with osmins new collar of pearls and coral tell it you thus i would not have told it you thus monsieur if you had been content with a hint and had not evinced so strong a desire for candor undisguised but if people will not comprehend a delicate suggestion they must be wounded by plainer truthsit is their own fault did you think i was like a little shepherdess in a pastoral to play the childish game of constancy without variations had you presumption enough to fancy you could amuse me for ever he stopped her his voice broken and hoarse as he gasped for breath silence woman have you no mercy for youfor such as youi have flung away heaven steeped myself in sin lost my church my peace my allforfeited all right to the reverence of my fellows all hope for the smile of my god for youfor such as youi have become a traitor a hypocrite an apostate whose prayers are insults whose professions are lies whose oaths are perjury at your smile i have flung away eternity for your kiss i have risked my life here my life hereafter for your love i held no price too vast to pay weighed with it honor faith heaven all seemed valuelessall were forgotten you lured me from tranquil calm you broke in on the days of peace which but for you were unbroken still you haunted my prayers you placed yourself between heaven and me you planned to conquer my anchorites pride you wagered you would lure me from my priestly vows and yet you have so little mercy that when your bet is won when your amusement grows stale when the victory grows valueless you can turn on me with words like these without one selfreproach ma foi monsieur it is you who may reproach yourself not i cried his hearer insolently are you so very provincial still that you are ignorant that when a lover has ceased to please he has to blame his own lack of power to retain any love he may have won and is far too wellbred to utter a complaint your language is very new to me most men monsieur would be grateful for my slightest preference i permit none to rebuke me for either giving or withdrawing it the eyes of madame la marquise sparkled angrily and the smile on her lips was a deadly one full of irony full of malice as he beheld it the scales fell at last from the eyes of gaston de launay and he saw what this woman was whom he had worshipped with such mad blind idolatrous passion he bowed his head with a low broken moan as a man stunned by a mortal blow while madame la marquise stood playing with the pearlandcoral chain and smiling the malicious and mischievous smile that showed her white teeth as they are shown in the portrait by mignard comme les hommes sont fous laughed madame la marquise he lifted his eyes and looked at her as she stood in the faint light of the dawn with her rich dress her gleaming diamonds her wicked smile her matchless beauty and the passion in him broke out in a bitter cry god help me my sin has brought home its curse he bent over her his burning lips scorching her own like fire holding her in one last embrace that clasped her in a vice of iron she had no power to break angel devil temptress this for what i have deemed theethat for what thou art he flung her from him with unconscious violence and left herlying where she fell the gray silvery dawn rose and broke into the warmth and sunlight of a summer day the deer nestled in their couches under the chequered shadows of the woodlands round and the morning chimes were rung in musical carillons from the campanile of the chateau the provence roses tossed their delicate heads joyously shaking the dew off their scented petals the blossoms of the limes fell in a fragrant shower on the turf below and the boughs swayed softly by the wind brushed their leaves against the sparkling waters of the fountains the woods and gardens of petite foret lay bright and laughing in the mellow sunlight of the new day to which the world was waking and with his face turned up to the sky clasped in his hand a medallion enamel on which was painted the head of a woman the grass and ferns where he had fallen stained crimson with his lifeblood lay a dead man while in his bosom nestled a little dog moaning piteous plaintive cries and vainly seeking its best to wake him to the day that for him would never dawn when her household trembling spread the news that the dead priest had been found lying under the limes slain by his own hand and it reached madame la marquise in her private chambers she was startled shocked wept hiding her radiant eyes in her broidered handkerchief and called azor and bade him bring her her flask of scented waters and bathed her eyes and turned them dazzling bright on saintelix and stirred her chocolate and asked the news on peut etre emue aux larmes et aimer le chocolat thought madame la marquise with her friend montespanwhile without under the waving shadow of the lindenboughs with the sunlight streaming round him the little dog nestling in his breast refusing to be comforted lay the man whom she had murdered the portrait of mignard still hangs on the walls of the chateau and in its radiant colors madame la marquise still lives fair type of her age smiling her victorious smile with the diamonds shining among her hair and her brilliant eyes flashing defiance irony and coquetry as of yore when she reigned amidst the beauties of versaillesand in the gardens beyond in the summer nights the limeboughs softly shake their fragrant flowers on the turf and the moonlight falls in hushed and mournful calm streaming through the network of the boughs on to the tangled mass of violets and ferns that has grown up in rank luxuriance over the spot where gaston de launay died transcribers notes obvious punctuation errors have been
