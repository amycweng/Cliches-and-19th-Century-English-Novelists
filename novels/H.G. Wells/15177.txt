nocturne by frank swinnerton to martin secker this nocturne introduction by hg wells but do i see afore me him as i ever sported with in his times of happy infancy and may imay i this may i meant might he shake hands dickens great expectations i do not know why i should be so overpoweringly reminded of the immortal if at times impossible uncle pumblechook when i sit down to write a short preface to mr swinnertons nocturne jests come at times out of the backwoods of a writers mind it is part of the literary quality that behind the writer there is a subwriter making a commentary this is a comment against which i may reasonably expostulate but which nevertheless i am indisposed to ignore the task of introducing a dissimilar writer to a new public has its own peculiar difficulties for the elder hand i suppose logically a writer should have good words only for his own imitators for surely he has chosen what he considers to be the best ways what justification has he for praising attitudes he has never adopted and commending methods of treatment from which he has abstained the reader naturally receives his commendations with suspicion is this man he asks stricken with penitence in the flower of his middleage has he but just discovered how good are the results that the other game the game he has never played can give or has he been disconcerted by the criticism of the young the fear of the young is the beginning of his wisdom is he taking this alienspirited work by the hand simply to say defensively and vainly i assure you indeed i am not an old fogy i quite understand it there it is i fancy that the pumblechook quotation creeps in to all of which suspicions enquiries and objections i will quote tritely but conclusively in my fathers house are many mansions or in the words of mr kipling there are five and forty ways of composing tribal lays and every blessed one of them is right indeed now that i come to think it over i have never in all my life read a writer of closely kindred method to my own that i have greatly admired the confessed imitators give me all the discomfort without the relieving admission of caricature the parallel instances i have always wanted to rewrite while on the other hand for many totally dissimilar workers i have had quite involuntary admirations it isnt merely that i dont so clearly see how they are doing it though that may certainly be a help it is far more a matter of taste as a writer i belong to one school and as a reader to anotheras a man may like to make optical instruments and collect old china swift sterne jane austen thackeray and the dickens of bleak house were the idols of my youthful imitation but the contemporaries of my early praises were joseph conrad wh hudson and stephen crane all utterly remote from that english tradition with such recent admirations of mine as james joyce mr swinnerton rebecca west the earlier works of mary austen or thomas burke i have as little kindred as a tunny has with a cuttlefish we move in the same medium and that is about all we have in common this much may sound egotistical and the impatient reader may ask when i am coming to mr swinnerton to which the only possible answer is that i am coming to mr swinnerton as fast as i can and that all this leads as straightly as possible to a definition of mr swinnertons position the science of criticism is still crude in its classification there are a multitude of different things being done that are all lumped together heavily as novels they are novels as distinguished from romances so long as they are dealing with something understood to be real all that they have in common beyond that is that they agree in exhibiting a sort of story continuum but some of us are trying to use that story continuum to present ideas in action others to produce powerful excitements of this sort or that as burke and mary austen do while others again concentrate upon the giving of life as it is seen only more intensely personally i have no use at all for life as it is except as raw material it bores me to look at things unless there is also the idea of doing something with them i should find a holiday doing nothing amidst beautiful scenery not a holiday but a torture the contemplative ecstacy of the saints would be hell to me in thei forget exactly how manybooks i have written it is always about life being altered i write or about people developing schemes for altering life and i have never once presented life my apparently most objective books are criticisms and incitements to change such a writer as mr swinnerton on the contrary sees life and renders it with a steadiness and detachment and patience quite foreign to my disposition he has no underlying motive he sees and tells his aim is the attainment of that beauty which comes with exquisite presentation seen through his art life is seen as one sees things through a crystal lens more intensely more completed and with less turbidity there the business begins and ends for him he does not want you or any one to do anything mr swinnerton is not alone among recent writers in this clear detached objectivity we have in england a writer miss dorothy richardson who has probably carried impressionism in fiction to its furthest limit i do not know whether she will ever make large captures of the general reader but she is certainly a very interesting figure for the critic and the amateur of fiction in pointed roofs and honeycomb for example her story is a series of dabs of intense superficial impression her heroine is not a mentality but a mirror she goes about over her facts like those insects that run over water sustained by surface tension her percepts never become concepts writing as i do at the extremest distance possible from such work i confess i find it altogether too muchor shall i say altogether too littlefor me but mr swinnerton like mr james joyce does not repudiate the depths for the sake of the surface his people are not splashes of appearance but living minds jenny and emmy in this book are realities inside and out they are imaginative creatures so complete that one can think with ease of jenny ten years hence or of emmy as a baby the fickle alf is one of the most perfect cockneysa type so easy to caricature and so hard to get truein fiction if there exists a better writing of vulgar lovemaking so base so honest so touchingly mean and so touchingly full of the craving for happiness than this that we have here in the chapter called after the theatre i do not know of it only a novelist who has had his troubles can understand fully what a dance among china cups what a skating over thin ice what a tightrope performance is achieved in this astounding chapter a false note one fatal line would have ruined it all on the one hand lay brutality a hundred imitative louts could have written a similar chapter brutally with the soul left out weve loads of such strong stuff and it is nothing on the other side was the still more dreadful fall into sentimentality the tear of conscious tenderness the redeeming glimpse of better things in alf or emmy that would at one stroke have converted their reality into a genteel masquerade the perfection of alf and emmy is that at no point does a natures gentleman or a natures lady show through and demand our refined sympathy it is only by comparison with this supreme conversation that the affair of keith and jenny seems to fall short of perfection but that also is at last perfected i think by jennys final keith oh keith above these four figures again looms the majestic invention of pa every reader can appreciate the truth and humour of pa but i doubt if any one without technical experience can realise how the atmosphere is made and completed and rounded off by pas beer pas needs and pas accident how he binds the bundle and makes the whole thing one and what an enviable triumph his achievement is but the book is before the reader and i will not enlarge upon its merits further mr swinnerton has written four or five other novels before this one but none of them compare with it in quality his earlier books were strongly influenced by the work of george gissing they have something of the same fatigued greyness of texture and little of the artistic completeness and intense vision of nocturne he has also made two admirable and very shrewd and thorough studies of the work and lives of robert louis stevenson and george gissing like these two he has had great experience of illness he is a young man of so slender a health so frequently ill that even for the most sedentary purposes of this war his country will not take him it was in connection with his gissing volume for which i possessed some material he needed that i first made his acquaintance he has had something of gissings restricted and grey experiences but he has nothing of gissings almost perverse gloom and despondency indeed he is as gay a companion as he is fragile he is a twinkling addition to any christmas party and the twinkle is here in the style and having sported with him in his times of happy infancy i add an intimate and personal satisfaction to my pleasant task of saluting this fine work that ends a brilliant apprenticeship and ranks swinnerton as master this is a book that will not die it is perfect authentic and alive whether a large and immediate popularity will fall to it i cannot say but certainly the discriminating will find it and keep it and keep it alive if mr swinnerton were never to write another word i think he might count on this much of his work living as much of the work of mary austen wh hudson and stephen crane will live when many of the more portentous reputations of today may have

westminster bridge was intense and as the tramcar turned the corner from the embankment jenny craned to look at the thickly running water below the glistening of reflected lights which spotted the surface of the thames gave its rapid current an air of such mysterious and especially sinister power that she was for an instant aware of almost uncontrollable terror she could feel her heart beating yet she could not withdraw her gaze it was nothing no danger threatened jenny but the danger of uneventful life and her sense of sudden yielding to unknown force was the merest fancy to be quickly forgotten when the occasion had passed none the less for that instant her dread was breathless it was the fear of one who walks in a wood at an inexplicable rustle the darkness and the sense of moving water continued to fascinate her and she slightly shuddered not at a thought but at the sensation of the moment at last she closed her eyes still however to see mirrored as in some visual memory the picture she was trying to ignore in a faint panic hardly conscious to her fear she stared at her neighbours newspaper spelling out the headings to some of the paragraphs until the need of such protection was past as the car proceeded over the bridge grinding its way through the still rolling echoes of the striking hour it seemed part of an endless succession of such cars all alike crowded with homewardbound passengers and all to the curious mind resembling ships that pass very slowly at night from safe harbourage to the unfathomable elements of the open sea it was such a cold still night that the sliding windows of the car were almost closed and the atmosphere of the covered upper deck was heavy with tobacco smoke it was so dark that one could not see beyond the fringes of the lamplight upon the bridge the moon was in its last quarter and would not rise for several hours and while the glitter of the city lay behind and the sky was greyed with light from below the surrounding blackness spread creeping fingers of night in every shadow the man sitting beside jenny continued to puff steadfastly at his pipe lost in the news holding mechanically in his further hand the return ticket which would presently be snatched by the hurrying tramconductor he was a shabby middleaged clerk with a thin beard and so he had not the least interest for jenny whose eye was caught by other beauties than those of assiduous labour she had not even to look at him to be quite sure that he did not matter to her almost jenny did not care whether he had glanced sideways at herself or not she presently gave a quiet sigh of relief as at length the river was left behind and the curious nervous tensionno more lasting than she might have felt at seeing a man balancing upon a high windowsillwas relaxed she breathed more deeply perhaps for a few instants and then quite naturally she looked at her reflection in the sliding glass that hat as she could see in the first sure speedless survey had got the droops see about you she said silently and threateningly jerking her head the hat trembled at the motion and was thereafter ignored stealthily jenny went back to her own reflection in the window catching the clearlychiselled profile of her face bereft in the dark mirror of all its colour she could see her nose and chin quite white and her lips as part of the general colourless gloom a little white brooch at her neck stood boldly out and that was all that could be seen with any clearness as the light was not directly overhead her eyes were quite lost apparently in deep shadows yet she could not resist the delight of continuing narrowly to examine herself the face she saw was hardly recognisable as her own but it was bewitchingly pale a study in black and white the kind of face which in a man would at once have drawn her attention and stimulated her curiosity she had longed to be pale but the pallor she was achieving by millinery work in a stuffy room was not the marble whiteness which she had desired only in the sliding window could she see her face ideally transfigured there it had the brooding dimness of strange poetic romance you couldnt know about that girl she thought youd want to know about her youd wonder all the time about her as though she had a secret the reflection became curiously distorted jenny was smiling to herself as soon as the tramcar had passed the bridge lighted windows above the shops broke the magic mirror and gave jenny a new interest until as they went onward a shopping district ablaze with colour crowded with loitering people and alive with din turned all thoughts from herself into one absorbed contemplation of what was beneath her eyes so absorbed was she indeed that the conductor had to prod her shoulder with his two fingers before he could recover her ticket and exchange it for another arf asleep some people he grumbled shoving aside the projecting arms and elbows which prevented his free passage between the seats feyuss please jenny shrugged her shoulder which seemed as though it had been irritated at the conductors touch it felt quite bruised silly old fool she thought with a brusque glance then she went silently back to the contemplation of all the life that gathered upon the muddy and glistening pavements below ii in a few minutes they were past the shops and once again in darkness grinding along pitching from end to end the drivers bell clanging every minute to warn carts and people off the tramlines once with an awful thunderous grating of the brakes the car was pulled up and everybody tried to see what had provoked the sense of accident there was a little shouting and jenny staring hard into the roadway thought she could see as its cause a small girl pushing a perambulator loaded with bundles of washing her first impulse was pitypoor little thing but the words were hardly in her mind before they were chased away by a faint indignation at the child for getting in the trams way everybody ought to look where they were going evry body ought to look where they were going said the pitching tramcar evry body oh sickening jenny looked at her neighbours paperher refuge striking speech she read whose what did it matter talk talk why didnt they do something what were they to do the tram pitched to the refrain of a comic song actions speak louder than words that kid who was wheeling the perambulator full of washing jennys attention drifted away like the speech of one who yawns and she looked again at her reflection the girl in the sliding glass wouldnt say much shed think the more shed say when sir herbert pressed for his answer my thoughts are my own sir herbert mainwaring what was it the girl in one of the best said you may command an army of soldiers but you cannot still the beating of a womans heart silly fool she was jenny had felt the tears in her eyes burning and her throat very dry when the words had been spoken in the play but jenny at the theatre and jenny here and now were different persons different why there were fifty jennys but the shrewd romantic honest true jenny was behind them all not stupid not sentimental bold as a lion destructively experienced in hardship and endurance very quick indeed to single out and wither humbug that was within her range of knowledge but innocent as a child before any other sort of humbug whatsoever that was why she could now sneer at the stageheroine and could play with the mysterious beauties of her own reflection but it was why she could also be led into quick indignation by something read in a newspaper tumty tumty tumty tum said the tram there were some more shops there were straggling shops and fullblazing rows of shops there were stalls along the side of the road women dancing to an organ outside a publichouse shops shops houses houses houses light darkness jenny gathered her skirt this was where she got down one glance at the tragic lady of the mirror one glance at the rising smoke that went to join the general cloud and she was upon the ironshod stairs of the car and into the greasy roadway then darkness as she turned along beside a big building into the side streets among rows and rows of the small houses of kennington park iii it was painfully dark in these side streets the lamps drew beams such a short distance that they were as useless as the hidden stars only down each street one saw mild spots starting out of the gloom fascinating in their regularity like shining beads set at prepared intervals in a body of jet the houses were all in darkness because evening meals were laid in the kitchens the front rooms were all kept for sunday use excepting when the emeralds and edwins and geralds and dorises were practising upon their mothers pianos then you could hear a din but not now now all was as quiet as night and even doors were not slammed jenny crossed the street and turned a corner on the corner itself was a small chandlers shop with magnificent tea per lb excellent tea per d lb good tea per d lb advertised in great bills upon its windows above a huge collection of unlikely goods gathered together like a happy family in its tarnished abode jenny passed the dullylighted shop and turned in at her own gate in a moment she was inside the house sniffing at the warm odourladen air within doors her mouth drew down at the corners stew tonight an amused gleam lost upon the dowdy passage fled across her bright eyes emmy wouldnt have thanked her for that emmysick to death herself of the smell of cookingwould have slammed down the pot in despairing rage in the kitchen a table was laid and emmy stretched her head back to peer from the scullery where she was busy at the gas stove she did not say a word jenny also was speechless and went as if without thinking to the kitchen cupboard the table was only halflaid as usual but that fact did not make her action the more palatable to emmy emmy who was older than jenny by a mysterious perioddiminished by herself but kept at its normal term of three years by jenny except in moments of some heat when it grew for purposes of retortwas also less effective in many ways such as in appearance and in adroitness and jenny comprised in herself as it were the good looks of the family emmy was the housekeeper who looked after pa blanchard jenny was the roving blade who augmented pas pension by her own fluctuating wages that was another slight barrier between the sisters nevertheless emmy was quite generous enough and was longsuffering so that her resentment took the general form of silences and secret broodings upon their different fortunes there was a great deal to be said about this difference and the saying grew more and more remote from explicit utterance as thought of it ground into emmys mind through long hours and days and weeks of solitude pa could not hear anything besides the banging of pots and he was too used to sudden noises to take any notice of such a thing but the pots themselves occasionally dented in savage dashes against each other or against the taps might have heard vicious apostrophes if they had listened intently to emmys ejaculations as it was with the endurance of pots they mutely bore their scars and waited dumbly for superannuation and every bruise stood to emmy when she renewed acquaintance with it as mark of yet another grievance against jenny for jenny enjoyed the liberties of this life while emmy stayed at home jenny sported while emmy was engaged upon the hideous routine of kitchen affairs and upon the nursing of a comparatively helpless old man who could do hardly anything at all for himself pa was in his bedroomthe back room on the groundfloor chosen because he could not walk up the stairs but must have as little trouble in selfconveyance as possiblestaggeringly making his toilet for the meal to come sitting patiently in front of his dressingtable by the light of a solitary candle he would appear in due course when he was fetched he had been a strong man a runner and cricketer in his youth and rather obstreperously disposed but that time was past and his strength for such pursuits was as dead as the wife who had suffered because of its vagaries he could no longer disappear on the saturdays as he had been used to do in the old days his chair in the kitchen the horsehair sofa in the sittingroom the bed in the bedroom were the only changes he now had from one days end to another emmy and jenny pledges of a real but not very delicate affection were all that remained to call up the sorrowful thoughts of his old love and those old times of virility when pa and his strength and his rough boisterousness had been the delight of perhaps a dozen regular companions he sometimes looked at the two girls with a passionless scrutiny as though he were trying to remember something buried in ancient neglect and his eyes would thereafter perhaps at the mere sense of helplessness fill slowly with tears until emmy smothering her own rough sympathy would dab pas eyes with a harsh handkerchief and would rebuke him for his decay those were hard moments in the blanchard home for the two girls had grown almost manlike in abhorrence of tears and with this masculine distaste had arisen a corresponding feeling of powerlessness in face of emotion which they could not share it was as though pa had become something like an old and beloved dog unable to speak pitied and despised yet claiming by his very dumbness something that they could only give by means of pats and halfbullying kindness at such times it was jenny who left her place at the table and popped a morsel of food into pas mouth but it was emmy who best understood the bitterness of his soul it was emmy therefore who would snap at her sister and bid her get on with her own food while pa blanchard made trembling scrapes with his knife and fork until the mood passed but then it was emmy who was most with pa it was emmy who hated him in the middle of her love because he stood to her as the living symbol of her daily inescapable servitude in this household jenny could never have felt that she would like to kill pa emmy sometimes felt that she at times when he had been provoking or obtuse so shook with hysterical anger born of the inevitable days in his society and in the kitchen that she could have thrown at him the battered pot which she carried or could have pushed him passionately against the mantelpiece in her fierce hatred of his helplessness and his occasional perverse stupidity he was rarely stupid with jenny but giggled at her teasing jenny was taller than emmy by several inches she was tall and thin and dark with an air of something like impudent bravado that made her expression sometimes a little wicked her nose was long and straight almost sharppointed her face too thin to be a perfect oval her eyes were wide open and so full of power to show feeling that they seemed constantly alive with changing and mocking lights and shadows if she had been stouter the excellent shape of her body now almost too thick in the waist would have been emphasised happiness and comfort a decrease in physical as in mental restlessness would have made her more than ordinarily beautiful as it was she drew the eye at once as though she challenged a conflict of will and her movements were so swift and eager so little clumsy or jerking that jenny had a carriage to command admiration the resemblance between the sisters was ordinarily not noticeable it would have needed a photographbecause photographs besides flattening the features also in some manner compose and distinguish themto reveal the likenesses in shape in shadow even in outline which were momentarily obscured by the natural differences of colouring and expression emmy was less dark more temperamentally unadventurous stouter and possessed of more colour she was twentyeight or possibly twentynine and her mouth was rather too hard for pleasantness it was not peevish but the lips were set as though she had endured much her eyes also were hard although if she cried one saw her face soften remarkably into the semblance of that of a little girl from an involuntary defiance her expression changed to something really pathetic one could not help loving her then not with the free give and take of happy affection but with a shamed hope that nobody could read the conflict of sympathy and contempt which made ones love frigid and selfconscious jenny rarely cried her cheeks reddened and her eyes grew full of tears but she did not cry her tongue was too ready and her brain too quick for that also she kept her temper from flooding over into the selfabandonment of angry weeping and vituperation perhaps it was that she had too much prideor that in general she saw life with too much selfcomplacency or that she was not in the habit of yielding to disappointment it may have been that jenny belonged to that class of persons who are called selfsufficient she plunged through a crisis with her own zest meeting attack with counterattack keeping her head surveying with the instinctive irreverence and selfprotective wariness of the london urchin the possibilities and swaying fortunes of the fight emmy so much slower so much less selfreliant had no refuge but in scolding that grew shriller and more shrill until it ended in violent weeping a withdrawal from the field entirely abject she was not a born fighter she was harder on the surface but weaker in powers below the surface her long solitudes had made her build up grievances and devastating thoughts had given her a thousand bitter things to fling into the conflict but they had not strengthened her character and she could not stand the strain of prolonged argument sooner or later she would abandon everything exhausted and beaten into impotence she could bear more endure more than jenny she could bear much so that the story of her life might be read as one long scene of endurance of things which jenny would have struggled madly to overcome or to escape but having borne for so long she could fight only like a cat her head as it were turned aside her fur upon end stealthily moving paw by paw always keeping her front to the foe but seeking for escapeuntil the pride perilously supporting her temper gave way and she dissolved into incoherence and quivering sobs it might have been said roughly that jenny more closely resembled her father whose temperament in her carefree happygolucky way she understood very well better than emmy did and that while she carried into her affairs a necessarily more delicate refinement than his she had still the daredevil spirit that pas friends had so much admired she had more humour than emmymore power to laugh to be detached to be indifferent emmy had no such power she could laugh but she could only laugh seriously or at obviously funny things otherwise she felt everything too much as jenny would have said she couldnt take a joke it made her angry or puzzled to be laughed at jenny laughed back and tried to score a point in return not always scrupulously emmy put a check on her tongue she was sometimes virtuously silent jenny rarely put a check on her tongue she sometimes let it say perfectly outrageous things and was surprised at the consequences for her it was enough that she had not meant to hurt she sometimes hurt very much she frequently hurt emmy to the quick darting in one of her sure careless stabs that shattered emmys selfcontrol so while they loved each other jenny also despised emmy while emmy in return hated and was jealous of jenny even to the point of actively wishing in moments of furtive and shamefaced savageness to harm her that was the outward difference between the sisters in time of stress of their inner truer selves it would be more rash to speak for in times of peace jenny had innumerable insights and emotions that would be forever unknown to the elder girl the sense of rivalry however was acute it coloured every moment of their domestic life unwinking and incessant when emmy came from the scullery into the kitchen bearing her precious dish of stew and when jenny standing up was measured against her this rivalry could have been seen by any skilled observer it rayed and forked about them as lightning might have done about two adjacent trees emmy put down her dish fetch pa will you she said briefly one could see who gave orders in the kitchen iv jenny found her father in his bedroom sitting before the dressingtable upon which a tall candle stood in an equally tall candlestick he was looking intently at his reflection in the lookingglass as one who encounters and examines a stranger in the glass his face looked red and ugly and the tossed grey hair and heavy beard were made to appear startlingly unkempt his mouth was open and his eyes shaded by lowered lids in a rather trembling voice he addressed jenny upon her entrance is supper ready he asked i heard you come in yes pa said jenny arent you going to brush your hair got a fancy for it like that have you my what a man with his shirt unbuttoned and his tie out come here lets have a look at you although her words were unkind her tone was not and as she rectified his omissions and put her arm round him jenny gave her father a light hug all right are you been a good boy yes a good boy he feebly and waveringly responded whats the noos tonight jenny jenny considered it made her frown so concentrated was her effort to remember well somebodys made a speech she volunteered they can all do that cant they and somebodys paid five hundred pounds transfer for jack sutherdon is it barnsley or burnley andoh a fire at southwark just the usual sort of news pa no murders ah they dont have the murders they used to have grumbled the old man thats the police pa jenny wanted to reassure him i dont know how it is he trembled stiffening his body and rising from the chair perhaps they hush em up that was a shock to him he could not move until the notion had sunk into his head or perhaps people are more careful dont get leaving themselves about like they used to pa blanchard had no suggestion such perilous ideas so frequently started by jenny for his mystification joggled together in his brain and made there the subject of a thousand ruminations they tantalised pas slowly revolving thoughts and kept these moving through long hours of silence such notions preserved his interest in the world and his senile belief in magic as nothing else could have done together their pace suited to his step the two moved slowly to the door it took a long time to make the short journey though jenny supported her father on the one side and he used a stick in his right hand in the passage he waited while she blew out his candle and then they went forward to the meal at the approach pas eyes opened wider and luminously glowed is there dumplings he quivered seeming to tremble with excitement one for you pa cried emmy from the kitchen pa gave a small chuckle of joy his progress was accelerated they reached the table and emmy took his right arm for the descent into a substantial chair upon pas plate glistened a fair dumpling a glorious mountain of paste amid the wreckage of meat and gravy and now perhaps emmy went on smoothing back from her forehead a little streamer of hair youll close the door jenny it was closed with a bang that made pa jump and emmy look savagely up sorry cried jenny hows that dumpling pa she sat recklessly at the table v to look at the three of them sitting there munching away was a sight not altogether pleasing pas veins stood out from his forehead and the two girls devoted themselves to the food as if they needed it there was none of the airy talk that goes on in the houses of the rich while maids or menservants come respectfully to right or left of the diners with decanters or dishes here the food was the thing and there was no speech sometimes pas eyes rolled sometimes emmy glanced up with unconscious malevolence at jenny sometimes jenny almost winked at the lithograph portrait of edward the seventh as prince of wales which hung over the mantelpiece above the oneandtenpennyhapenny clock that ticked away so busily there something had happened long ago to edward the seventh and he had a stain across his field marshals uniform something had happened also to the clock which lay upon its side as if kicking in a death agony something had happened to almost everything in the kitchen even the plates on the dresser and the cups and saucers that hung or stood upon the shelves bore the noble scars of service every time emmy turned her glance upon a damaged plate as sharp as a stalactite she had the thought jennys doing every time she looked at the convulsive clock emmy said to herself that was miss jennys cleverness when she chucked the cosy at alf and when emmy said in this reflective silence of animosity the name alf she drew a deep breath and looked straight up at jenny with inscrutable eyes of pain vi the stew being finished emmy collected the plates and retired once again to the scullery now did jenny show afresh that curiosity whose first flush had been so illsatisfied by the meat course when however emmy reappeared with that most domestic of sweets a bread pudding jennys face fell once more for of all dishes she most abominated bread pudding under her breath she adversely commented oh lor she whispered stew and bp what a life emmy not hearing but second sighted on such matters shot a malevolent glance from her place in an awful voice intended to be a trifle arch she addressed her father bready butter pudding pa she inquired the old man whinnied with delight and emmy was appeased she had one satisfied client at any rate she cut into the pudding with a knife producing wedges with a dexterous hand hey ho observed jenny to herself tastelessly beginning the work of laborious demolition jenny thinks its common she ought to have the job of getting the meals cried emmy bitterly obliquely attacking her sister by talking at her something to talk about then she sneered with chagrin up in arms at a criticism well the truth is drawled jenny if you want it i dont like bread pudding somehow she had never said that before in all the years but it seemed to her that bread pudding was like ashes in the mouth it was like duty or funerals or stew the stuffs got to be finished up flared emmy defiantly with a sense of being adjudged inferior because she had dutifully habituated herself to the appreciation of bread pudding you might think of that what else am i to do thats just it old girl just why i dont like it i just hate to feel im finishing it up same with stew i know its been something else first its not fresh same old thing week in week out finishing up the scraps proud stomach a quick flush came into emmys cheeks and tears started to her eyes perhaps it is oh but em dont you feel like that yourself sometimes ooh she drawled the word wearily oh for a bit more money then we could give stew to the catsmeat man and bread to old thompsons chickens and then we could have nice things to eat nice birds and pastry and trifle and ices and wine not all this muck muck cried emmy her lips seeming to thicken when im so hot and sick of it all you go out you do just exactly what you like and then you come home and she began to gulp what about me well its just as bad for both of us jenny did not think so really but she said it she thought emmy had the bread and butter pudding nature and that she did not greatly care what she ate as long as it was not too fattening jenny thought of emmy as born for housework and cookingof stew and bread puddings for herself she had dreamed a nobler destiny a destiny of romance of delicious unknown things romantic and indescribably exciting she was to have the adventures because she needed them emmy didnt need them it was all very well for emmy to say what about me it was no business of hers what happened to emmy they were different still she repeated more confidently because there had been no immediate retort well its just as bad for both of us just as bad tisnt youre out all daydoing what you like oh jennys eyes opened with theatrical wideness at such a perversion of the facts doing what i like the millinery you are you dont have to do all the scraping to make things go round like i have to no you dont here have i been in this place slaving hour after hour i wish youd try and manage better i bet youd be thankful to finish up the scraps some wayany old way id like to see you do what i do momentarily jennys picture of emmys nature drawn accommodatingly by herself in order that her own might be differentiated and exalted by any comparison was shattered emmys vehemence had thus the temporary effect of creating a fresh reality out of a common idealisation of circumstance the legend would reform later perhaps and would continue so to reform as persuasion flowed back upon jennys egotism until it crystallised hard and became unchallengeable but at any rate for this instant jenny had had a glimmer of insight into that tamer discontent and rebelliousness that encroached like a canker upon emmys originally sweet nature the shock of impact with unpleasant conviction made jenny hasten to dissemble her real belief in emmys born inferiority her note was changed from one of complaint into one of persuasive entreaty its not that its not that not at all but wouldnt you like a change from stew and bread pudding yourself sometimes i mean you seem to like it all right at that illconsidered suggestion made with unintentional savageness jenny so worked upon herself that her own colour rose high her temper became suddenly unmanageable you talk about me being out she breathlessly exclaimed when do i go out when tell me ooh i like that what about going to the pictures with alf rylett emmys hands were jerking upon the table in her anger youre always out with him me well i never im not when they were interrupted unexpectedly by a feeble and jubilant voice more bready butter pudding said pa blanchard tipping his plate to show that he had finished yes pa for the moment emmy was distracted from her feud in a mechanical way as mothers sometimes deep in conversation attend to their childrens needs she put another wedge of pudding upon the plate well i say you are she resumed in the same strained voice and tell me when i go out i go out shopping thats all but for that im in the house day and night you dont care tuppence about alfyou wouldnt not if he was walking the soles off his boots to come to you you never think about him hes like dirt to you yet you go out with him time after time her lips as she broke off were pursed into a trembling unhappy pout sure forerunner of tears her voice was weak with feeling the memory of lonely evenings surged into her mind evenings when jenny was out with alf while she the drudge stayed at home with pa until she was desperate with the sense of unutterable wrong time after time you go sorry im sure flung back jenny fairly in the fray too quick not to read the plain message of emmys tone and expression too cruel to relinquish the sudden advantage i never guessed you wanted him i wouldnt have done it for worlds you never said you know satirically she concluded with a studiously careful accent which she used when she wanted to indicate scorn or innuendo im sorry i ought to have asked if i might then with a dash into grimmer satire why doesnt he ask you to go with him funny his asking me isnt it emmy grew violently crimson her voice had a roughness in it she was mortally wounded anybodyd know you were a lady she said warmly theyre welcome retorted jenny her eyes flashed glittering in the paltry gaslight hes never emmy i didnt know you were such a silly little fool fancy going on like that about a man like him at your age vehement glances flashed between them all emmys jealousy was in her face clear as day jenny drew a sharp breath then obstinately she closed her lips looking for a moment like the girl in the sliding window inscrutable emmy also recovering herself spoke again trying to steady her voice its not what you think but i cant bear to see you playing about with him its not fair he thinks you mean it you dont course i dont i dont mean anything a fellow like that jenny laughed a little woundingly whats the matter with him savagely emmy betrayed herself again she was trembling from head to foot her mind blundering hither and thither for help against a quickerwitted foe its only you hes not good enough for she said passionately whats the matter with him jenny considered her pale face now deadly white all the heat gone from her cheeks though the hard glitter remained in her eyes cruelly indicating the hunger within her bosom oh hes all right in his way she drawlingly admitted hes clean thats in his favour but hes quiet hes got no devil in him sort of man who tells you what he likes for breakfast i only go with him well you know why as well as i do hes all right enough as far as he goes but hes never on for a bit of fun thats it hes got no devil in him i dont like that kind prefer the other sort during this speech emmy had kept back bitter interruptions by an unparalleled effort it had seemed as though her fury had flickered blazing and dying away as thought and feeling struggled together for mastery at the end of it however and at jennys declared preference for men of devil emmys face hardened you be careful my girl she prophesied with a warning glance of anger if thats the kind youre after take care youre not left oh i can take care jenny said with cold nonchalance trust me vii later when they were both in the chilly scullery washing up the supper dishes they were again constrained somehow when they were alone together they could not quarrel it needed the presence of pa blanchard to stimulate them to retort in his rambling silences they found the spur for their unkind eloquence and too often pa was used as a stalkinghorse for their angers he could hardly hear and could not follow the talk but by directing a remark to him so that it cannoned off at the other each obtained satisfaction for the rivalry that endured from day to day between them their hungry hearts all the latent bitternesses in their natures yearning for expression found it in his presence but alone whatever their angers they were generally silent it may have been that their love was strong or that their courage failed or that the energy required for conflict was not aroused that they deeply loved one another was sure there was rivalry jealousy irritation between them but it did not affect their love the jealousy was a part of their general discontenta jealousy that would grow more intense as each remained frustrate and unhappy neither understood the forces at work within herself each saw these perversely illustrated in the others faults in each case the cause of unhappiness was unsatisfied love unsatisfied craving for love it was more acute in emmys case because she was older and because the love she needed was under her eyes being wasted upon jennyif it were love and not that mixture of admiration and desire with selfesteem that goes to make the common formula to which the name of love is generally attached jenny could not be jealous of emmy as emmy was jealous of jenny she had no cause emmy was not her rival jennys rival was life itself as will be shown hereafter she had her own pain it was thus only natural that the two girls having pushed pas chair to the side of the kitchen fire and having loaded and set light to pas pipe should work together in silence for a few minutes clearing the table and washing the supper dishes they were distant both aggrieved emmy with labouring breath and a sense of bitter animosity jenny with the curled lip of one triumphant who does not need her triumph and would abandon it at the first move of forgiveness they could not speak the work was done and emmy was rinsing the washing basin before jenny could bring herself to say awkwardly what she had in her mind em she began i didnt know you you know a silence emmy continued to swirl the water round with the small washingmop her face averted jennys lip stiffened she made another attempt to be the last restraining her irritation with a great effort if you like i wont i wont go out with him any more oh you neednt worry emmy doggedly said with her teeth almost clenched im not worrying about it she tried then to keep silent but the words were forced from her wounded heart with uncontrollable sarcasm she said its very good of you im sure em it was coaxing jenny went nearer still there was no reply em dont be a silly cat if hed only ask you to go once or twice hed always want to you neednt worry about me being see i like somebody elseanother fellow hes on a ship nowhere near here i only go with alf because well after all hes a man and theyre scarce suppose i leave off going with him both knew she had nothing but kind intention as in fact the betrayal of her own secret proved but as jenny could not keep out of her voice the slightest tinge of complacent pity so emmy could not accept anything so intolerable as pity thanks she said in perfunctory refusal but you can do what you like just what you like she was implacable she was drying the basin her face hidden im not going to take your leavings at that her voice quivered and had again that thread of roughness in it which had been there earlier not likely well i cant help it can i cried jenny out of patience if he likes me best if he wont come to you i mean if i say i wont go out with himwill that put him on to you or send him off altogether em do be sensible really i never knew never dreamt of it ive never wanted him its not as though hed whistled and id gone trotting after him em you get so ratty about superior cried emmy gaspingly look down on me she was for an instant hysterical speaking loudly and weepingly then she was close against jenny and they were holding each other tightly while emmys dreadful quiet sobs shook both of them to the heart and jenny above her sisters shoulder could see through the window the darkness that lay without and her eyes grew tender at an unbidden thought which made her try to force herself to see through the darkness as though she were sending a speechless message to the unknown then feeling emmy still sobbing in her arms she looked down laying her face against her sisters face a little contemptuous smile appeared in her eyes and her brow furrowed well emmy could cry she couldnt she didnt want to cry she wanted to go out in the darkness that so pleasantly enwrapped the earth back to the stir and glitter of life somewhere beyond abruptly jenny sighed her vision had been far different from this scene it had carried her over land and sea right into an unexplored realm where there was wild laughter and noise where hearts broke tragically and women in the hour of ruin turned triumphant eyes to the glory of life and where blinding streaming lights and scintillating colours made everything seem different made it seem romantic rapturous indescribable from that vision back to the cupboardlike house in kennington park and stodgy alf rylett and supper of stew and bread and butter pudding and pa and this little sobbing figure in her arms was an incongruous flight it made jennys mouth twist in a smile so painful that it was almost a grimace oh lor she said again under her breath as she had said it earlier what a life chapter ii the treat i gradually emmys tearless sobs diminished she began to murmur broken meaningless ejaculations of selfcontempt and to strain away from jenny at last she pushed jenny from her feverishly freeing herself so that they stood apart while emmy blew her nose and wiped her eyes all this time they did not speak to each other and when emmy turned blindly away jenny mechanically took hold of the kettle filled it and set it to boil upon the gas emmy watched her curiously feeling that her nose was cold and her eyes were burning little dry tremors seemed to shake her throat dreariness had settled upon her pressing her down making her feel ashamed of such a display of the long secret so carefully hoarded away from prying glances whats that for she miserably asked indicating the kettle going to steam my hat jenny said the brims all floppy there was now only a practical note in her voice she too was ashamed youd better go up and lie down for a bit ill stay with pa in case he falls into the fire just the sort of thing he would do on a night like this just because youre upset i shant go up its too cold ill sit by the fire a bit they both went into the kitchen where the old man was whistling under his breath was there any noos on the playcards he inquired after a moment becoming aware of their presence emmyjenny no pa i told you have to wait till sunday funny thing theres so much more news in the sunday papers i suppose people are all extra wicked on saturdays they get paid friday night i shouldnt wonder and it goes to their heads silly emmy said under her breath its the weeks news thats all right old girl admonished jenny i was only giving him something to think about poor old soul now about this hat the girls all go on at me say i dress like a brokersman im going to smarten myself up you never know what might happen why i might get off with a duke emmy was overtaken by an impulse of gratitude you can have mine if you like she said the one you gave me on my birthday jenny solemnly shook her head she did not thank her sister thanks were never given in that household because they were a part of peliteness and were supposed to have no place in the domestic arena not if i know it she humorously retorted i made it for you and it suits you not my style at all ill just get out my box of bits youll see something thatll surprise you my girl the box proved to contain a large number of bits of all sizes and kindsfragments of silk plain and ribbed of plush of ribbon both wide and narrow small sprays of marguerites a rose or two some poppies and a bunch of violets a few made bows in velvet and silk some elastic some satin some feathers a wing here and there the miscellaneous assortment of oddsandends always appropriated or in the modern military slang won by assistants in the millinery some had been used some were startlingly new jenny was more modest in such acquirements than were most of her associates but she was affected as all such must be by the prevailing wind strangely enough it was not her habit to wear very smart hats for business or at any other time she would have told you in the event of any such remark that when you had been fiddling about with hats all day you had other things to do in the evenings yet she had good taste and very nimble fingers when occasion arose in bringing her box from the bedroom she brought also from the stand in the passage her drooping hat against which she proceeded to lay various materials trying them with her sure eye seeking to compose a picture with that instructive sense of cynosure which marks the crafty expert fascinated with her lips parted in an expression of that stupidity which is so often the sequel to a fit of crying emmy watched jennys proceedings her eyes travelling from the hat to the evergrowing heap of discarded ornaments she was dully impressed with the swift judgment of her sister in consulting the secrets of her inner taste it was a judgment unlike anything in her own nature of which she was aware excepting the measurement of ingredients for a pudding so they sat all engrossed while the kettle began to sing and the desired steam to pour from the spout clouding the scullery the only sound that arose was the gurgling of pa blanchards pipe for he was what is called in kennington park a wet smoker he sat remembering something or pondering the insufficiency of news nobody ever knew what he thought about in his silences it was a mystery over which the girls did not puzzle because they were themselves in the habit of sitting for long periods without speech pas broodings were as customary to them as the absorbed contemplativeness of a baby give him his pipe as jenny said and hell be quiet for hourstill it goes out then theres a fuss my word what a racket talk about a fire alarm and on such occasions she would mimic him ridiculingly to diminish his complaints while emmy roughly relighted the hubblebubble and patted her father once more into a contented silence pa was to them although they did not know it their bond of union without him they would have fallen apart like the outer pieces of a wooden boottree for his sake with all the apparent lack of sympathy shown in their behaviour to him they endured a life which neither desired nor would have tolerated upon her own account so it was that pas presence acted as a check and served them as company of a meagre kind although he was less interesting or expansive than a little dog might have been when jenny went out to the scullery carrying her hat after sweeping the scraps she had declined back into the old drapers cardboard box which amply contained such treasures and preserved them from dust emmy now quite quiet again continued to sit by the fire staring at the small glowing strip that showed under the door of the kitchen grate every now and then she would sigh wearily closing her eyes and her breast would rise as if with a sob and she would sometimes look slowly up at the clock with her head upon one side in order to see the hands in their proper aspect as if she were calculating ii from the scullery came the sound of jennys whistle as she cheerily held the hat over the steam pa heard it as something far away like a distant salvationists band and pricked up his ears emmy heard it and her brow was contracted her expression darkened jenny began to hum oh liza sweet liza if you die an old maid youll have only yourself to blame it was like a sudden noise in a forest at night so poignant was the contrast of the radiating silences that succeeded jennys voice stopped sharply perhaps it had occurred to her that her song would be overheard perhaps she had herself become affected by the meaning of the words she was so carelessly singing there was once more an air of oblivion over all things the old man sank back in his chair puffing slowly blue smoke from the bowl of the pipe grey smoke from between his lips emmy looked again at the clock she had the listening air of one who awaits a bewildering event once she shivered and bent to the fire raking among the red tumbling small coal with the bent kitchen poker jenny began to whistle again and emmy impatiently wriggled her shoulders jarred by the noise suddenly she could bear no longer the whistle that pierced her thoughts and distracted her attention but went out to the scullery how are you getting on she asked with an effort fine this gas leaks cant you whiff it dont know which one it is pa all right yes hes all right nearly finished getting on tram nearly ran over a kid tonight she was wheeling a pram full of washing on the line there wasnt half a row about itshouting and swearing anybody would have thought the kid had laid down on the line i expect she was frightened out of her witsall those men shouting at her there now ill lay it on the plate rack over the gas for a bit look smart shant i with a red rose in it and a red ribbon not going to have those streamers or any lace are you not likely you see the kids round here wearing them but the kids round here are always a season late same with their costumes they dont know any better i do jenny was cheerfully contemptuous she knew what was being worn along regent street and in bond street because she saw it with her own eyes then she came home and saw the girls of her own district swanking about like last years patterns as she said she couldnt help laughing at them it made her think of the tales of savages wearing top hats with strings of beads and thinking they were all in the latest european fashion that is the constant amusement of the expert as she regards the amateur she has all the satisfaction of knowing better without the turmoil of competition a fact which distinguishes the superior spirit from the struggling helot jenny took full advantage of her situation and her knowledge yes you know a lot emmy said dryly ah youve noticed it jenny was not to be gibed at without retort im glad so you think emmy added as though she had not heard the reply there came at this moment a knock at the front door emmy swayed grew pale and then slowly reddened until the colour spread to the very edges of her bodice the two girls looked at one another a deliberate interchange of glances that was at the same time upon both sides an intense scrutiny emmy was breathing heavily jennys nostrils were pinched well at last said jenny drawlingly didnt you hear the knock arent you going to answer it she reached as she spoke to the hat lying upon the plate rack above the gas stove looking fixedly away from her sister her air of gravity was unchanged emmy hesitating made as if to speak to implore something but being repelled she turned and went thoughtfully across the kitchen to the front door jenny carried her hat into the kitchen and sat down at the table as before the halfcontemptuous smile had reappeared in her eyes but her mouth was quite serious iii pa blanchard had worked as a boy and man in a large iron foundry he had been a very capable workman and had received as the years went on the maximum amount with overtime to be earned by men doing his class of work he had not been abstemious and so he had spent a good deal of his earnings in what is in kennington park called pleasure but he had also possessed that common kind of sense which leads men to pay money into sick and benefit clubs accordingly his wifes illness and burial had as he had been in the habit of saying cost him nothing they were paid by his societies similarly when he had himself been attacked by the paralytic seizure which had wrecked his life the societies had paid and now in addition to the pension allowed by his old employers he received a weekly dole from the societies which brought his income up to fifty shillings a week the pension of course would cease upon his death but so long as life was kept burning within him nothing could affect the amounts paid weekly into the blanchard exchequer pa was fiftyseven and normally would have had a respectable number of years before him his wants were now few and his days were carefully watched over by his daughters he would continue to draw his pensions for several years yet unless something unexpected happened to him meanwhile therefore his pipe was regularly filled and his old pewter tankard appeared at regular intervals in order that pa should feel as little as possible the change in his condition mrs blanchard had been dead ten years she had been very much as emmy now was but a great deal more cheerful she had been plump and freshcoloured and in spite of pa blanchards ways she had led a happy life in the old days there had been friends and neighbours now all lost in course of removals from one part of london to another so that the girls were without friends and knew intimately no women older than themselves mrs blanchard perhaps in accord with her cheerfulness had been a complacent selfish little woman very neat and clean and disposed to keep her daughters in their place jenny had been her favourite and even so early had the rivalry between them been established besides this emmy had received all the rebuffs needed to check in her the same complacent selfishness that distinguished her mother she had been frustrated all along first by her mother then by her mothers preference for jenny finally after a period during which she dominated the household after her mothers death by jenny herself it was thus not upon a pleasant record of personal success that emmy could look back but rather upon a series of chagrins of which each was the harder to bear because of the history of its precursors emmy between eighteen and nineteen at the time of her mothers death had grasped her opportunity and had made the care of the household her lot she still bore what was a very different reading of her ambition the cares of the household jenny as she grew up had proved unruly pa blanchards illness had made home service compulsory and so matters were like to remain indefinitely is it any wonder that emmy was restive and unhappy as she saw her youth going and her horizons closing upon her with the passing of each year if she had been wholly selfish that fact would have been enough to sour her temper but another emotionally more potent fact produced in emmy feelings of still greater stress to that fact she had this evening given involuntary expression now how would she how could she handle her destiny jenny shrewdly thinking as she sat with her father in the kitchen and heard emmy open the front door pondered deeply as to her sisters ability to turn to account her own sacrifice iv within a moment alf rylett appeared in the doorway of the kitchen emmy standing behind him until he moved forward and then closing the door and leaning back against it his first glance was in the direction of jenny who however did not rise as she would ordinarily have done he glanced quickly at her face and from her face to her hands so busily engaged in manipulating the materials from which she was to retrim her hat then he looked at pa blanchard whom he touched lightly and familiarly upon the shoulder alf was a rather squarely built young man of thirty well under six feet but not ungainly he had a florid reddish complexion and his hair was of a common but unnamed colour between brown and grey curly and crisp he was cleanshaven alf was obviously one who worked with his hands in the little kitchen he appeared to stand upon the tips of his toes in order that his walk might not be too noisy that fact might have suggested either mere nervousness or a greater liking for life out of doors when he walked it was as though he did it all of a piece so that his shoulders moved as well as his legs the habit was shown as he lunged forward to grip jennys hand when he spoke he shouted and he addressed pa as a boy might have done who was not quite completely at his ease but who thought it necessary to pretend that he was so good evening mr blanchard he cried boisterously sitting by the fire i see pa looked at him rather vacantly apparently straining his memory in order to recognise the newcomer it was plain that as a personal matter he had no immediate use for alf rylett but he presently nodded his head sitting by the fire he confirmed getting a bit warm its cold tonight is there any noos alf rylett lots of it roared alf speaking as if it had been to a deaf man or a foreigner they say this fire at southwark means ten thousand pounds damage big factory theregutted of course no outside fire escapes as usual fully insured though itll cost them nothing you cant help wondering what causes these fires when theyre heavily insured eh blazing all night it was twentyfive engines twentyfive mind you that shows it was pretty big eh i saw the red in the sky myself well i thought to myself theres somebody stands to lose something i thought but the insurance companies are too wide to stand all the risk themselves they share it out you know its a mere fleabite to them and a well then theres a see then theres a bigamy case hey cried pa sharply brightening whats that about nothing much only a couple of skivvies about ten pound three and fourpence between the pair of them that was all he got pas interest visibly faded he gurgled at his pipe and turned his face towards the mantelpiece and a lets see what else is there alf racked his brains puffing a little and arching his brows at the two girls who seemed both to be listening emmy intently as though she were repeating his words to herself he went on tram smash in newcastle car went off the points eleven injured nobody killed i dont call that much said jenny critically with a pin in her mouth not much more than i told him an hour ago he wants a murder or a divorce all these little tinpot accidents arent worth printing at all what he wants is the crossexamination of the man who found the bones it was comical to notice the change on alf at jennys interruption from the painful concentration upon memory which had brought his eyebrows together there appeared in his expression the most delighted ease a sort of archness that made his face look healthy and honest whats that youre doing he eagerly inquired forsaking pa and obviously thankful at having an opportunity to address jenny directly he came over and stood by the table in spite of the physical effort which emmy involuntarily made to will that he should not do so emmys eyes grew tragic at his intimate possessive manner in speaking to jenny i say continued alf admiringly a new hat is it smart looks absolutely a real west end style isnt it going to have some chiffong sit down alf it was emmy who spoke motioning him to a chair opposite to pa he took it his shoulder to jenny while emmy sat by the table looking at him her hands in her lap how is he alf asked jerking his head at pa perked up when i said bigamy didnt he hes been very good i will say answered emmy been quiet all day and he ate his supper as good as gold jennys smile and little amused crouching of the shoulders caught her eye well so he did she insisted jenny took no notice hes had hismustnt say it because he always hears that word and its not time for his evening eight oclock he has it whats that said alf incautiously beer beer cried pa beer it was the cry of one who had been malignantly defrauded a piteous wail there said both the girls simultaneously jenny added now youve done it all right pa not time yet but emmy went to the kitchen cupboard as pa continued to express the yearning that filled his aged heart sorry whispered alf hold me hand out naughty boy hes like a baby with his titty bottle explained emmy now hell be quiet again alf fidgeted a little this contretemps had unnerved him he was less sure of himself well he said at last darkly what i came in about quarter to eight is it by jove im late thats telling mr blanchard all the news the fact is ive got a couple of tickets for the theatre down the roadfor this evening i thought erum oh extravagance cried jenny gaily dropping the pin from between her lips and looking in an amused flurry at emmys anguished face opposite it was as though a chill had struck across the room as though both emmys heart and her own had given a sharp twist at the shock ah thats where youre wrong thats what cleverness does for you alf nodded his head deeply and reprovingly given to me they were by a pal o mine who works at the theatre theyre for tonight i thought jenny with her heart beating was stricken for an instant with panic she bent her head lower holding the rose against the side of her hat watching it with a zealous eye once again to test the effect he thought she was coquetting and leaned a little towards her he would have been ready to touch her face teasingly with his forefinger oh jenny exclaimed with a hurried assumption of matter of fact ease suddenly ousting her panic thats very good so you thought youd take emmy that was a very good boy i thought heavily stammered alf his eyes opening in a surprised way as he found himself thus headed off from his true intention he stared blankly at jenny until she thought he looked like the bull on the hoardings who has heard that they want more emmy stared at her also quite unguardedly a concentrated stare of agonised doubt and impatience emmys face grew pinched and sallow at the unexpected strain upon her nerves that was what you thought wasnt it jenny went on impudently shooting a sideways glance at him that made alf tame with helplessness poor old em hasnt had a treat for ever so long do her good to go you did mean that didnt you i said alf i he was inclined for a moment to bluster he looked curiously at jennys profile judicial in its severity then some kind of tact got the better of his first impulse well i thought one of you girls he said will you come em have to look sharp really emmy jumped up her face scarlet and tears of joy in her eyes she did not care how it had been arranged her pride was unaroused the other thought the triumph of the delicious moment was overwhelming afterwardsah no no she would not think she was going she was actually going in a blur she saw their faces their kind eyes good boy cried jenny buck up em if youre going to change your dress seats my word how splendid she clapped her hands quickly immediately again taking up her work so as to continue it into her eyes had come once more that strange expression of pitying contempt her white hands flashed in the wan light as she quickly threaded her needle and knotted the silk chapter iii rows i after emmy had hurried out of the room to change her dress alf stood still apparently stupefied at the unscrupulous rush of jennys feminine tactics rubbing his hand against the back of his head he looked cautiously at pa blanchard and from him back to the mysterious unknown who had so recently defeated his object alf may or may not have prepared some kind of set speech of invitation on his way to the house obviously it is a very difficult thing where there are two girls in a family to invite one of them and not the other to an evenings orgy if it had not previously occurred to alf to think of the difficulty quite as clearly as he was now being made to do that must have been because he thought of emmy as imbedded in domestic affairs after all damn it as he was thinking if you want one girl it is rotten luck to be fobbed off with another alf knew quite well the devastating phrase at one time freely used as an irresistible quip like theres hair or thats all right tell your mother itll be ninepence by which one suggested disasterand that spoilt his evening the phrase was in his mind horrible to feel yet what could he have done in face of the direct assault must be a gentleman he could hardly have said before emmy no its you i want he began to think about emmy she was all righta quiet little piece and all that but she hadnt got jennys cheek that was it jenny had got the devils own cheek and this was an example of it but this was an unwelcome example of it he ruminated still further until he found he was standing on one foot and rubbing the back of his head just like any stage booby oh damn he cried putting his raised foot firmly on the ground and bringing his wandering fist down hard into the open palm of his other hand here here protested jenny pretending to be scandalised thats not the sort of language to use before pa hes not used to it were awfully careful what we say when pas here youre making a fool of me spluttered alf glaring at her thats about the size of it what about your pa and ma she inquired gibing at him ive done nothing why dont you sit down of course you feel a fool standing i always do when the manager sends for me think im going to get the sack she thought he was going to bellow at her i hear they want more the mere notion of it made her smile and alf imagined that she was still laughing at her own manoeuvre or at her impertinent jest what did you do it for he asked coming to the table cause it was all floppy what did you think why the girls all talk about me wearing it so long im not talking about that he said in a new voice of exasperated determination you know what im talking about oh yes you do im talking about those tickets and me and you jennys eyes contracted she looked fixedly at her work her hands continued busy well youre going to take emmy arent you she prevaricated you asked her to go no he said im going with her because shes said shell go but it was you that asked her did i how could i they werent mine youre a man you brought the tickets you asked her yourself jenny shook her head oh no alf rylett you mustnt blame me take my advice my boy you be very glad emmys going if you mean me i should have said no because ive got to do this hat emmys going tonight youll enjoy yourself far more oh he did not use an oath but it was implied what did you do it for didnt you want to come yourself no look here jenny i want to know whats going on youve always come with me before he glared at her in perplexity puzzled to the depths of his intelligence by a problem beyond its range women had always been reported to him as a mystery but he had never heeded its emmys turn then jenny went on she could not resist the display of a sisterly magnanimity although it was not the true magnanimity and in fact had no relation to the truth poor old em gets stuck in here day after day she pleaded shes always with pa till he thinks shes a fixture well why shouldnt she have a little pleasure you get her some chocs at that shop you know itll be the treat of her life shell be as grateful to you for it oh im very glad shes got the chance of going itll keep her happy for days jenny trying with all her might to set the affair straight and satisfy everybody was appealing to his vanity to salve his vanity alf saw himself recorded as a public benefactor he perceived the true sublimity of altruism yes he said doggedly recovering himself and becoming a man becoming alf rylett once again thats all bally fine sounds well as you put it but you knew as well as i did that i came to take you i say nothing against em shes a good sort but jenny suddenly kindled he had never seen her so fine shes the best sort she said with animation and dont you forget it alf mewhy im as selfish as as dirt beside her look a little closer my lad youll see ems worth two of me any day you think yourself jolly lucky shes going with you thats all ive got to say to you she had pushed her work back and was looking up at him with an air of excitement she had really been moved by a generous impulse her indifference to alf no longer counted it was swept away by a feeling of loyalty to emmy the tale she had told the plea she had advanced upon emmys behalf if it had not influenced him had sent a warm thrill of conviction through her own heart when she came thus to feel deeply she knew as if by instinct that emmy irritable unsatisfied emmy was as much superior to alf as she herself was superior to him a wave of arrogance swept her because he was a man and therefore so delectable in the lives of two lonely girls he was basely sure of his power to choose from among them at will he had no such power at that moment in jennys mind he was the clay for emmy or herself to mould to their own advantage you can think yourself jolly lucky my lad she repeated i can tell you that much ii jenny leant back in her chair exhausted by her excitement alf reached round for the chair he had left and brought it to the table he sat down his elbows on the table and his hands clasped and he looked directly at jenny as though he were determined to explode this false bubble of misunderstanding which she was sedulously creating as he looked at her with his face made keen by the strength of his resolve jenny felt her heart turn to water she was physically afraid of him not because he had any power to move her but because in sheer bullocklike strength he was too much for her as in tenacity he had equally an advantage as a skirmisher or in guerrilla warfare in which he might always retire to a hidden fastness baffling pursuers by innumerable ruses and doublings jenny could hold her own on the plain in face of superior strength she had not the solid force needed to resist strong will and clear issues alf looked steadily at her his reddish cheeks more red his obstinate mouth more obstinate so that she could imagine the bones of his jaws cracking with his determination it wont do jen he said and you know it jenny wavered her eyes flinched from the necessary task of facing him down where women of more breeding have immeasurable resources of tradition behind them to quell any such inquisition she was by training defenceless she had plenty of pluck plenty of adroitness but she could only play the sex game with alf very crudely because he was not fine enough to be diverted by such finesse as she could employ all jenny could do was to play for safety in the passage of time if she could beat him off until emmy returned she could be safe for tonight and if she were safe nowanything might happen another day to bring about her liberation bullying wont do i grant that she retorted defiantly you neednt think it will she jerked her head were going to have this out alf went on jenny darted a look of entreaty at the kicking clock which lay so helplessly upon its side if only the clock would come to her aid forgetting the episode of the teacosy take you all your time she said swiftly why the theatres all full by now the people are all in theyre tuning up for the overture look at it she pointed a wavering finger at the clock were going to have this outnow repeated alf you know why i brought the tickets here it was because i wanted to take you its no good denying it thats enough somehowi dont know whyyou dont want to go and while im not looking you shove old em on to me thats what you say jenny protested alf took no notice of her interruption he doggedly proceeded as i say ems all right enough no fault to find with her but shes not you and its you i wanted now if i take her youll enjoy it very much she weakly asserted ever so much besides alfshe began to appeal to him in an attempt to wheedleems a real good sort you dont know half the things i know all about em i dont need you to tell me what she is i can see for myself alf rocked a little with an ominous obstinacy his eyes were fixed upon her with an unwinking stare it was as though having delivered a blow with the full weight of party bias he were desiring her to take a commonsense view of a vehement political issue what can you see with a feeble dash of spirit jenny had attempted tactical flight the sense of it made her feel as she had done as a little girl in playing touch when with a swerve she had striven to elude the pursuer so tense were her nerves on such occasions that she turned what is called goosey with the feel of the evaded fingers alf rolled his head again slightly losing his temper at the inconvenient question which if he had tried to answer it might have diverted him from the stern chase upon which he was engaged the sense of that made him doubly resolved upon sticking to the point oh never you mind he said stubbornly quite enough of that now the question isand its a fair onewhy did you shove em on to me i didnt you did it yourself well thats a flat lie he cried slapping the table in a sudden fury and glaring at her thats what that is jenny crimsoned it made the words no better that alf had spoken truly she was deeply offended they were both now sparkling with temper restless with it and jennys teeth showing im a liar am i she exclaimed well you can just lump it then i shant say another word not if you call me a liar youve come here her breath caught and for a second she could not speak youve come here kindly to let us lick your boots i suppose is that it well were not going to do it we never have and we never will never its a drop for you you think to take emmy out a bit of kindness on your part shes not up to west end style that it but you neednt think youre too good for her theres no reason im sure youre not all because youre a man auch im sick of the men you think youve only got to whistle yes you do you think if you crook your little finger oh no my lad thats where youre wrong youre making a big mistake there we can look after ourselves thank you no chasing after the men pas taught us that were not quite alone we havent got to takeweve neither of us got to takewhatevers offered to us as you think weve got pa still her voice had risen an unexpected interruption stopped the argument for the merest fraction of time aye said pa theyve got their old pa he had taken his pipe out of his mouth and was looking towards the combatants with an eye that for one instant seemed the eye of perfect comprehension it frightened jenny as much as it disconcerted alf it was to both of them but especially to alf like the shock of a cold sponge laid upon a heated brow i never said you hadnt he sulkily said and turned round to look amazedly at pa but pa had subsided once more and was drinking with mournful avidity from his tankard occupied with the tankard pa had neither eye nor thought for anything else alf resumed after the baffled pause yes youve got him all right enough then youre trying to turn it off with your monkey tricks he said suddenly but i see what it is i was a fool not to spot it at once youve got some other fellow in tow im not good enough for you any longer got no use for me yourself but you dont mind turning me over to old em he shook his head well i dont understand it he concluded miserably i used to think you was straight jen i am it was a desperate cry from her heart alf sighed youre not playing the game jen old girl he said more kindly more thoughtfully thats whats the matter i dont know what it is or what youre driving at but thats whats wrong whats the matter with me anything i know im not much of a one to shout the odds about i dont expect you to do that never did but i never played you a trick like this what is it whats the game you think youre playing when she did not answer his urgent and humble appeal he went on in another tone i shall find out mind you its not going to stop here i shall ask emmy i can trust her you cant ask her jenny cried it was wrung from her you just dare to ask her if she knew you hadnt meant to take her tonight it ud break her heart it would there her voice had now the ring of intense sincerity she was not afraid not defiant she was a woman defending another womans pride alf groaned his cheeks became less ruddy he looked quickly at the door losing confidence no i dont know what it is he said again i dont understand it he sat biting his under lip miserably undetermined his grim front had disappeared he was from the conquering hero become a crestfallen young man he could not be passionate with pa there he felt that if only she were in his arms she could not be untruthful could not resist him at all but with the table between them she was safe from any attack he was powerless and he could not say he loved her he would never be able to bring himself to say that to any woman a woman might ask him if he loved her and he would awkwardly answer that of course he did but it was not in his nature to proclaim the fact in so many words he had not the fluency the dramatic sense the imaginative power to sink and to forget his own selfconsciousness and so jenny had won that battlenot gloriously but through the sheer mischance of circumstances alf was beaten and jenny understood it dont think about me she whispered in a quick pity alf still shook his head reproachfully eyeing her with the old bulllike concern im not worth thinking about im only a beast and you say you can trust emmy shes ever so ah but she cant make me mad like you do he said simply jen will you come another night do he was beseeching her his hands stretched towards her across the table as near to making love as he would ever be it was his last faint hope for the changing of her heart towards him but jenny slowly shook her head from side to side a judge refusing the prisoners final desperate entreaties no she said its no good alf itll never be any good as long as i live iii alf put out his hand and covered jennys hand with it and the hand he held after a swift movement remained closely imprisoned and just at that moment when the two were striving for mastery the door opened and emmy came back into the room she was fully dressed for going out her face charmingly set off by the hat she had offered earlier to jenny her eyes alight with happiness her whole bearing unutterably changed now whos waiting she demanded and at the extraordinary sight before her she drew a quick breath paling it did not matter that the clinging hands were instantly apart or that alf rose hurriedly to meet her whats that she asked in a trembling tone what are you doing as though she felt sick and faint she sat sharply down upon her old chair near the door jenny rallied only a kids game she said nothing at all alf said nothing looking at neither girl emmy tried to speak again but at first the words would not come finally she went on with dreadful understanding didnt you want to take me alf did you want her to go it was as though her short absence perhaps even the change of costume had worked a curious and cognate change in her mind perhaps it was that in her flushed happiness she had forgotten to be suspicious or had blindly misread the meanings of the earlier colloquy as a result of which the invitation had been given dont be so silly quickly cried jenny of course he wanted you to go alf emmys eyes were fixed upon him with a look of urgent entreaty she looked at alf with all the love all the extraordinary intimate confidence with which women of her class do so generally regard the men they love ready to yield judgment itself to his decision when he did not answer but stood still before them like a redfaced boy staring down at the floor she seemed to shudder and began despairingly to unfasten the buttons of her thick coat jenny darted up and ran to check the process dont be a fool she breathed like that youve got no time for a scene turning to alf she motioned him with a swift gesture to the door look sharp she cried im not going emmy struggled with jennys restraining hands its no good fussing me jenny im not going he can take who he likes but its not me alf and jenny exchanged angry glances each bitterly blaming the other em jenny shouted youre mad no im not let me go let me go he didnt want me to go he wanted you oh i knew it i was a fool to think he wanted me then looking with a sort of crazed disdain at jenny she said coolly well how is it youre not ready dont you see your substitutes waiting your land lover land cried alf land a sailor he flushed deeply raising his arms a little as if to ward off some further revelation jenny desperate had her hands higher than her head protestingly quelling the scene in a loud voice she checked them do not be fools she cried whats all the fuss about simply because alfs a born booby standing there like a fool i cant go i wouldnt goeven if he wanted me but he wants you she again seized emmy delaying once more emmys mechanical unfastening of the big buttons of her coat alf get your coat get her out of the house i never heard such rubbish alf say tell her you meant her to go say it wasnt me i shouldnt believe him emmy said clearly i know i saw him holding your hand jenny laughed hysterically what a fuss she exclaimed hes been doing palmistryreading it all about whats going to happen to me wasnt it alf emmy disregarded her watching alfs tootransparent uneasiness you always were a little lying beast she said venomously a trickster you see jenny said defiantly to alf what my own sister says so you were with your sailor and playing the fool with alf emmys voice rose you always were i wonder alfs never seen it long ago at this moment with electrifying suddenness pa put down his tankard what aint you gone yet he trembled i thought you was going out how did he know they all looked sharply at one another sobered so for one instant they stood incapable of giving any explanation to the meekly inquiring old man who had disturbed their quarrel alf so helpless before the girls was steeled by the interruption he took two steps towards emmy well have this out later on he said meanwhile come on em its just on eight come along theres a good girl he stooped took her hands and drew her to her feet then with uncommon tenderness he rebuttoned her coat and with one arm about her led emmy to the door she pressed back but it was against him within the magic circle of his arm suddenly deliriously happy jenny still panting stood as she had stood for the last few minutes and watched their departure she heard the front door close as they left the house and with shaky steps went and slammed the door of the kitchen trembling violently she leant against the door as emmy had done earlier for a moment she could not speak could not think or feel and only as a clock in the neighbourhood solemnly recorded the eighth hour did she choke down a little sob and say with the ghost of her bereaved irony thats done it chapter iv the wish i waiting until she had a little recovered her selfcontrol jenny presently moved from the door to the fireplace and proceeded methodically to put coals on the fire she was still shaking slightly and the corners of her mouth were uncontrollably twitching with alternate smiles and other raiding emotions so that she did not yet feel in a fit state to meet pas scrutiny he might be the old fool he sometimes appeared to be and inconveniently he might not just because she did not want him to be particularly bright it was quite probable that he would have a flourish of brilliance that is as it occasionally happens in the dullest of mortals so jenny was some time in attending to the fire until she supposed that any undue redness of cheek might be imagined to have been occasioned by her strenuous activities she then straightened herself and looked down at pa with a curious mixture of protectiveness and anxiety pleased with yourself arent you she inquired more to make conversation which might engage the ancient mind in ruminant pastime than to begin any series of inquiries into pas mental states eh jenny said pa staring back at her aint you gone out is it emmy thats gone out what did that fool alf rylett want he was shouting i heard him yes pa but you shouldnt have listened rebuked jenny with a fine colour pa shook his shaggy head he felt cunningly for his empty tankard hoping that it had been refilled by his benevolent genius it was not until the full measure of his disappointment had been revealed that he answered her i wasnt listening he quavered i didnt hear what he said did emmy go out with him yes pa to the theatre alf brought tickets tickets tickets for seats oh dear why cant you understand didnt have to pay at the door pa suddenly understood oh ah he said didnt have to pay there was a pause thats like alf rylett presently added pa jenny sat looking at him in consternation at such an uncharitable remark its not she cried i never knew you were such a wicked old man pa gave an antediluvian chuckle that sounded like a magical and appalling rattle from the inner recesses of his person he was getting brighter and brighter as the stars appear to do when the darkness deepens see he proceeded did alf say there was any noos he admitted an uncertainty furtively he looked at her suspecting all the time that memory had betrayed him but in his ancient way continuing to trust to magic well you didnt seem to think much of what he did bring but ill tell you a bit of news pa and that is that youve got a pair of the rummiest daughters i ever struck pa looked out from beneath his bushy grey eyebrows resembling a worn and dilapidated perversion of whistlers portrait of carlyle his eyelids seemed to work as he brooded upon her announcement it was as though together these two explored the blanchard archives for confirmation of jennys sweeping statement the blanchards of several generations might have been imagined as flitting across a fantastic horizon keening for their withered laurels thrown into the shades by these more brighter eccentrics it was or it might have been a fascinating speculation but pa did not indulge this antique vein for very long the moment and its concrete images beguiled him back to the daughter before him and the daughter who was engaged in an unexpected emotional treat he said i know and gave a wide grin that showed the gaps in his teeth as nothing else could have donenot even the profoundest yawn jenny was stunned by this evidence of brightness in her parent well youre a caution she cried and to think of you sitting there saying it and i reckon theyve got a pretty rummy old paif the truth was only known pas grin if possible stretched wider again that terrible chuckle which suggested a derangement of his internal parts or the runningdown of an overwound clock wheezed across the startled air maybe pa said with some unpardonable complacency maybe bless my soul exclaimed jenny she could not be sure when his manner returned to one of vacancy and when the kitchen was silent whether pa and she had really talked thus or whether she had dreamed their talk to her dying day she was never sure for pa certainly added nothing to the conversation thereafter was it real or had her too excited brain played her a trick jenny pinched herself it was like a fairy tale in which cats talk and little birds humanly sing or the tiniest of fairies appear from behind clocks or from within flowerpots she looked at pa with fresh awe there was no knowing where you had him he had the interest for her of one returned by miracle from other regions gifted with preposterous knowledges he became at this instant fabulous like rip van winkle or the sleeping beauty or the white cat in her perplexity jenny fell once more into a kind of dream an argumentative dream she went back over the earlier rows reliving them exaggerating unconsciously the noble unselfishness of her own acts and the pointed effectiveness of her speeches until the scenes were transformed they now appeared in other hues in other fashionings this is what volatile minds are able to do with all recent happenings whatsoever recasting them in form altogether more exquisite than the crude realities the chiaroscuro of their experiences is thus so constantly changing and recomposing thatwhatever the apparent result of the scene in factthe dreamer is in retrospect always victor in the heroic limelight with jenny this was a mood not a preoccupation but when she had been moved or excited beyond the ordinary she often did tend to put matters in a fresh aspect more palatable to her selflove and more picturesque in detail than the actual happening that is one of the advantages of the rapidlyworking brain that its power of improvisation is in solitude very constant and reassuring it is as though such a grain upon this more strictly personal side were a commonwealth of little cellbuilding microbes the chief microbe comes like the engineer to estimate the damage to ones amour propre and to devise means of repair he then summons all his necessary workmen who are tiny selfloves and ancient praises and habitual complacencies and the staircase words of which one thinks too late for use in the scene itself and with their help he restores that proportion without which the human being cannot maintain his selfrespect jenny was like the british type as recorded in legend being beaten she never admitted it but even five minutes later through the adroitness of her special engineer and his handymen would be able quite seriously to demonstrate a victory to herself defeat never how alf and emmy shrank now before her increasing skill in argument how were they shattered how inept were their feebleness how splendid jenny had been in act in motive in speech in performance er yes jenny said beginning to ridicule her own highly coloured picture well it was something like that she had too much sense of the ridiculous to maintain for long unquestioned the heroic vein as natural to her own actions more justly she resumed her consideration of the scenes pondering over them in their nakedness and their meanings trying to see how all these stupid little feelings had burst their way from overcharged hearts and how each word counted as part of the mosaic of misunderstanding that had been composed oh blow jenny impatiently ejaculated with a sinking heart at the thought of any sequel a sequel there was bound to behowever muffled it did not rest with her there were emmy and alf both alike burning with the wish to avenge themselvesupon her if only she could disappearjust drop out altogether like a man overboard at night in a storm and leave emmy and alf to settle together their own trouble she couldnt drop out nobody could without dying though they might often wish to do so and even then their bodies were the only things that were gone because for a long time they stubbornly survived in memory no she couldnt drop out there was no chance of it she was caught in the web of life not alone but a single small thing caught in the general mixup of actions and interactions she had just to go on as she was doing waking up each morning after the events and taking her old place in the world and in this instance she would have somehow to smooth matters over when the excitements and agitations of the evening were past it would be terribly difficult she could not yet see a clear course if only emmy didnt live in the same house if only by throwing alf over as far as concerned herself she could at the same time throw him into emmys waiting arms why couldnt everybody be sensible if only they could all be sensible for halfanhour everything could be arranged and happiness could be made real for each of them no misunderstandings were bound to come angers and jealousies conflicting desires stupid suspicions jenny fidgeted in her chair and eyed pa with a sort of vicarious hostility why even that old man was a complication nay he was the worst thing of all but for him she could drop out there was no getting away from him he was as much permanently there as the chair upon which he was drowsing she saw him as an incubus and then emmy being so fussy standing on her dignity when shed give her soul for happiness and then alf being so what was alf well alf was stupid that was the word for alf he was stupid as stupid as any stupid member of his immeasurably stupid sex could be great booby muttered jenny why look at the way he had behaved when emmy had come into the room it wasnt honesty mind you because he could tell any old lie when he wanted to it was just funk he hadnt known where to look or what to say too slow he was to think of anything what could you do with a man like that oh what stupids men were she expected that alf would feel very fine and noble as he walked old em along to the theatreand afterwards when the evening was over and he had gone off in a cloud of glory he would think it all over and come solemnly to the conclusion that the reason for his mumbling stupidity his toeing and heeling and all that idiotic speechlessness that set emmy on her hind legs was sheer love of the truth he couldnt tell a lieto a woman that would be it he would pretend that jenny had chivvied him into taking em that he was too noble to refuse to take em or to let em really see pointblank that he didnt want to take her but when it came to the pinch he hadnt been able to screw himself into the truly noble attitude needed for such an act of selfsacrifice he had been speechless when a prompt lie added to the promptitude and exactitude of jennys lie would have saved the situation not alf i cannot tell a lie sneered jenny to a woman george washington i dont think yes but then said her secret complacency preening itself and suggesting that possibly a moment or two of satisfied pity might be at this point in place hed really wanted to take jenny he had taken the tickets because he had wanted to be in jennys company for the evening not emmys there was all the difference if you wanted a cream bun and got fobbed off with a scone there was something in that jenny was rather flattered by her happy figure she even excitedly giggled at the comparison of emmy with a scone jenny did not like scones she thought them stodgy she had also that astounding feminine love of cream buns which no true man could ever acknowledge or understand so emmy became a scone with not too many currents in it jennys fluent fancy was inclined to dwell upon this notion she a little lost sight of alfs grievance in her pleasure at the figures she had drawn her mind was recalled with a jerk now what was it alf had wanted to take herjenny right he had taken emmy because he had taken emmy he had a grievance right but against whom against emmy certainly not against himself by no means against jenny a horribly exulting and yet nervously penitent little giggle shook jenny at her inability to answer this point as she had answered the others for alf had a grievance against jenny and she knew it no amount of ingenious thought could hoodwink her sense of honesty for more than a debaters five minutes no alf had a grievance jenny could not in strict privacy deny the fact she took refuge in a shameless piece of bluster well after all she cried he had the tickets given to him its not as though they cost him anything so whats all the row about ii thereafter she began to think of alf he had taken her out several timesnot as many times as emmy imagined because emmy had thought about these excursions a great deal and not only magnified but multiplied them nevertheless alf had taken jenny out several times to a music hall once or twice to the pictures where they had sat and thrilled in cushioned darkness while acrobatic humans and greyfaced tragic creatures jerked and darted at top speed in and out of the most amazingly telescoped accidents and difficulties and alf had paid more than once for all pa said it is true that jenny had paid on her birthday for both of them and that she had occasionally paid for herself upon an impulse of sheer independence but there had been other times when alf had really paid for both of them he had been very decent about it he had not tried any nonsense because he was not a flirtatious fellow well it had been very nice and now it was all spoilt it was spoilt because of emmy emmy had spoilt it by wanting alf for herself ugh thought jenny em had always been a jealous cat if she had just seen alf somewhere she wouldnt have wanted him that was it em saw that alf preferred jenny she saw that jenny went out with him and because she always wanted to do what jenny did and always wanted what jenny had got em wanted to be taken out by alf jenny with the cruel unerringness of an exasperated woman was piercing to emmys heart with fierce lambent flashes of insight and if alf had taken em once or twice and jenny once or twice not wanting either one or the other or not wanting one of them more than the other em would have been satisfied it would have gone no further it would still have been sensible without nonsense but it wouldnt do for em so long as jenny was going out emmy stayed at home she had said to herself why should jenny go and not me having all this pleasure that had been the first stagejenny worked it all out first of all it had been envy of jennys going out then had come stage number two why should alf rylett always take jenny and not me that had been the first stage of jealousy of alf and the next time alf took jenny em had stayed at home and thought herself sick about it supposing that alf and jenny were happy and that she was unhappy supposing they had all the fun envying them the fun hating them for having what she had not got hating jenny for monopolising alf hating alf had monopolising jenny then as she was a woman hating jenny for being a more pleasing woman than herself and having her wounded jealousy moved into a strong craving for alf driven deeper and deeper into her heart by longcontinued thought and frustrated desire and so she had come to look upon herself as one defrauded by jenny of pleasureof happinessof loveof alf rylett and she calls it love thought jenny bitterly if thats love ive got no use for it loves giving not getting i know that much loves giving yourself wanting to give all youve got its got nothing at all to do with envy or hating people or being jealous then a swift feeling of pity darted through her changing her thoughts changing every shade of the portrait of emmy which she had been etching with her quick corrosive strokes of insight poor old em she murmured shes had a rotten time i know she has let her have alf if she wants i dont want him i dont want anybody except she closed her eyes in the most fleeting vision nobody except just keith slowly jenny raised her hand and pressed the back of her wrist to her lips not kissing the wrist but holding it against her lips so that they were forced hard back upon her teeth she drew presently a deep breath releasing her arm again and clasping her hands over her knees as she bent lower staring at the glowing heart of the fire her lips were closely seriously set now her eyes sorrowful alf and emmy had receded from her attention as if they had been fantastic shadows pa sitting holding his exhausted hubblebubble was as though he had no existence at all jenny was lost in memory and the painful aspirations of her own heart iii how the moments passed during her reverie she did not know for her it seemed that time stood still while she recalled days that were beautified by distance and imagined days that should be still to come made to compensate for that long interval of dullness that pressed her each morning into acquiescence she bent nearer to the fire smiling to herself the fire showing under the little door of the kitchener was a bright red glowing ash the redness that came into her imagination when the words fire or heat were usedthe red heart burning and consuming itself in its passionate immolation she loved the fire it was to her the symbol of rapturous surrender that feminine ideal that lay still deeper than her pride locked in the most secret chamber of her nature and then as the seconds ticked away jenny awoke from her dream and saw that the clock upon the mantelpiece said halfpast eight halfpast eight was what in the blanchard home was called time when pa was recalcitrant jenny occasionally shouted very loud with what might have appeared to some people an undesirable knowledge of customs act of parliament gentlemen pleasewhich is a phrase sometimes used in clearing a publichouse tonight there was no need for her to do that she had only to look at pa to take from his hand the almost empty pipe to knock out the ashes and to say time pa obediently pa held out his right hand and clutched in the other his sturdy walkingstick together they tottered into the bedroom stood a moment while jenny lighted the peep of gas which was pas guardian angel during the night and then made their way to the bed pa sat upon the bed like a child jenny took off pas collar and tie and his coat and waistcoat she took off his boots and his socks she laid beside him the extraordinary faded scarlet nightgown in which pa slept away the darkness then she left him to struggle out of his clothes as well as he could which pa did with a skill worthy of his best days the cunning which replaces competence had shown him how the braces may be made to do their own work how the shirt may with one hand be so manipulated as to be drawn swiftly over the head pa was adept at undressing he was in bed within five minutes after a panting exhausted interval during which he sat in a kind of trance and was then proudly as usual knocking upon the floor with his walkingstick for jenny to come and tuck him in for the night jenny came gave him a big kiss and went back to the kitchen where she resumed work upon her hat it had lost its interest for her she stitched quickly and roughly not as one interested in needlework or careful for its own sake of the regularity of the stitch ordinarily she was accurate tonight her attention was elsewhere it had come back to the rows because there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it ever so much more important than it really is loneliness with happy thoughts is perhaps an ideal state but no torment could be greater than loneliness with thoughts that wound jennys thoughts wounded her the mood of complacency was gone that of shame and discontent was upon her distress was uppermost in her mindnot the petulant wriggling of a spoilt child but the sober consciousness of pain in herself and in others in vain did jenny give little gasps of annoyance intended by her humour to disperse the clouds the gasps and exclamations were unavailing she was angry chagrined miserable at last she could bear the tension no longer but threw down her work rose and walked impatiently about the kitchen oh do shut up she cried to her insistent thoughts enough to drive anybody off their nut and theyre not worth it either of them ems as stupid as she can be thinking about herself and as for alfanybodyd think id tricked him i havent ive gone out with him but whats that lots of girls go out with fellows for months and nobody expects them to marry the girls may want it but the fellows dont they dont want to get settled down and i dont blame them why is alf different i suppose its me thats different im not like other girls that notion cheered her no im not like other girls i want my bit of fun ive never had any and just because i dont want to settle down and have a lot of kids that mess the place to bits of course i get hold of alf its too bad why cant he choose the right sort of girl why cant he choose old em shes the sort that does want to get settled she knows shell have to buck up about it too she said i should get left thats what shes afraid of herself only shes afraid of getting left on the shelf i wonder why it is the marrying men dont get hold of the marrying girls they do sometimes i suppose jenny shrugged restlessly and stood looking at nothing oh its sickening you cant do anything you like in this world nothing at all youve always got to do what you dont like they say its good for you its your duty who to and who are they to say such a thing what are they after just to keep people like me in their placedo as youre told well im not going to do as im told they can lump it thats what they can do what does it matterwhat happens to me im me arent i got a right to live havent i why should i be somebodys servant all my life i wont if alf doesnt want to marry emmy he can go and whistle somewhere else theres plenty of girls whod jump at him but just because i dont hell worry me to death if i was to be all over himsee alf sheer off hed think there was something funny about me well there is im jenny blanchard and im going to keep jenny blanchard if ive got no right to live then nobodys got any right to keep me from living if theres no rights other people havent got any more than i have they cant make me do anythingby any right theyve got peoplemanaging peoplethink that because there isnt a corner of the earth they havent collared they can tell you what youve got to do give you a ticket and a number get up at six eat so much a day have six children do what youre told that may do for some people but its slavery and im not going to do it see she began to shout in her excited indignation see she cried again just because im poor im to do what im told they seem to think that because they like to do what theyre told everybody ought to be the same theyre afraid theyre afraid of themselvesafraid of being left alone in the dark they think everybody ought to be afraidin case anybody should find out that theyre cowards but im not afraid and im not going to do what im told i wont in a frenzy she walked about the room her eyes glittering her face flushed with tumultuous anger this was her defiance to life she had been made into a rebel through long years in which she had unconsciously measured herself with others because she was a human being jenny thought she had a right to govern her own actions with a whole priesthood against her jenny was a rebel against the world as it appeared to hera crushing numerically overwhelming pressure that would rob her of her one spiritual realitythe sense of personal freedom oh i cant stand it she said bitterly i shall go mad and em taking it all in and ready to have alfs foot on her neck for life and alf ready to have em chained to his foot for life the fools why i wouldnt not even to keith no i wouldnt fancy being boxed up and pretending i liked itjust because other people say they like it do as youre told do like other people all be the samea sticky mass of silly fools doing as theyre told all for a bit of bread because somebodys bagged the flour for ever and whats the good of it if it was any goodbut its no good at all and they go on doing it because theyre cowards cowards thats what they all are well im not like that exhausted jenny sat down again but she could not keep still her feet would not remain quietly in the place she as the governing intelligence commanded they too were rebels nervous rebels controlled by forces still stronger than the governing intelligence she felt trapped impotent as though her hands were tied as though only her whirling thoughts were unfettered again she took up the hat but her hands so trembled that she could not hold the needle steady it made fierce jabs into the hat stormily unhappy she once more threw the work down her lips trembled she burst into bitter tears sobbing as though her heart were breaking her whole body was shaken with the deep and passionate sobs that echoed her despair iv presently when she grew calmer jenny wiped her eyes her face quite pale and her hands still convulsively trembling she was worn out by the stress of the evening by the vehemence of her rebellious feelings when she again spoke to herself it was in a shamed giggling way that nobody but emmy had heard from her since the days of childhood she gave a long sigh looking through the blur at that clear glow from beneath the iron door of the kitchen grate miserably she refused to think again she was half sick of thoughts that tore at her nerves and lacerated her heart to herself jenny felt that it was no goodcrying was no good thinking was no good loving and sympathising and giving kindnessall these things were in this mood as useless as one another there was nothing in life but the endless sacrifice of human spirit oh she groaned passionately if only something would happen i dont care what but something something new exciting something with a bite in it she stared at the kicking clock which every now and again seemed to have a spasm of distaste for its steady record of the fleeting seconds wound up to go all day she thought comparing the clock with herself in an angry impatience and then as if it came in answer to her poignant wish for some untoward happening there was a quick double knock at the front door of the blanchards dwelling and a sharp whirring ring at the pushbell below the knocker the sounds seemed to go violently through and through the little house in rapid waves of vibrant noise part two night chapter v the adventure i so unexpected was this interruption of her loneliness that jenny was for an instant stupefied she took one step and then paused dread firmly in her mind paralysing her what could it be she could not have been more frightened if the sound had been the turning of a key in the lock were they back already had her hope been spoiled by some accident surely not it was twenty minutes to nine they were safe in the theatre by now oh she was afraid she was alone in the houseworse than alone jenny cowered she felt she could not answer the summons tickticktick said the clock striking across the silences again jenny made a step forward then terrifying her the noise began once morethe thunderous knock the pingpingpingwhir of the bell wrenching her mind away from apprehensiveness she moved quickly to the kitchen door and into the dimlylighted dowdy passageway somewhere beyond the gas flicker and the hatstand laywhat with all her determination she pushed forward almost running to the door her hand hovered over the little knob of the lock only horror of a renewal of that dreadful sound prompted her to open the door quickly she peered into the darkness faintly silhouetted against the wavering light of the gas a man stood there evening miss said the man miss jenny blanchard she could see there something white he was holding it out to her a letter for me she asked her voice still unsteady she took the letter a large square envelope mechanically she thanked the man puzzling at the letter from whom could a letter be brought to her theres an answer she heard it came from ever so far away in the dim distance beyond her vague wonderings jenny was lost submerged in the sensations through which she had passed during the evening she was quite unlike herself timid and fearful a frightened girl alone in an unhappy house wait a bit she said will you wait there yes answered the man startlingly enough ive got the car here the car what did it mean she caught now as her eyes were more used to the darkness the sheen of light upon a peaked cap such as would be worn by a chauffeur it filled her mind that this man was in uniform but if so why from whom should the letter come he had said miss jenny blanchard you did say it was for me ill take it inside she left the door unfastened but the man pulled it right to so that the catch clicked then jenny held the letter up under the flame of the passage gas she read there by this meagre light her own name the address written in a large hand very bold with a sharp sweeping stroke under all such as a man of impetuous strength might make there was a blue seal fastening the flapa great pool of solid wax trembling so that she was hardly able to tear the envelope jenny returned to the kitchen again scanning the address the writing the blue seal with its minerva head still in her perplexity it seemed as though her task was first to guess the identity of the sender who could have written to her it was unheard of a think for wondering jest if only her lips had been steady and her heart beating with normal pulsation with a shrug she turned back from the seal to the address she felt that some curious mistake had been made that the letter was not for her at all but for some other jenny blanchard of whom she had never until now heard then casting such a fantastic thought aside with another impatient effort she tore the envelope past the seal in a ragged dash her first glance was at the signature yours always keith keith jenny gave a sob and moved swiftly to the light her eyes were quite blurred with shining mist she could not read the words keith she could only murmur his name holding the letter close against her ii my dear jenny said the letter do you remember i said i should write to you when i got back well here i am i cant come to you myself im tied here by the leg and mustnt leave for a moment but you said youd come to me will you do if you can come youll be a most awful dear and i shall be out of my wits with joy not really out of my wits do come theres a dear good girl its my only chance as im off again in the morning the man who brings this note will bring you safely to me in the car and will bring you quite safely home again do come im longing to see you i trust you to come i will explain everything when we meet yours always keith a long sigh broke from jennys lips as she finished reading she was transfigured gone was the defiant look gone were the sharpnesses that earlier had appeared upon her face a soft colour flooded her cheeks her eyes shone come to him she would go to the end of the world keith she said it aloud in a voice that was rich with her deep feeling magically transformed come to you my dear said jenny as if you need ask then she remembered that emmy was out that she was left at home to look after her father that to desert him would be a breach of trust quickly her face paled and her eyes became horrorladen she was shaken by the conflict of love and love love that was pity and love that was the overwhelming call of her nature the letter fluttered from her fingers swooping like a wounded bird to the ground and lay unheeded at her feet iii what shall i do nobody to turn to no help from any hand to stay was to give up the chance of happiness to gooh she couldnt go if keith was tied so was jenny half demented she left the letter where it had fallen a white square upon the shabby rug in a frenzy she wrung her hands what could she do it was a cry of despair that broke from her heart she couldnt go and keith was waiting that it should have happened upon this evening of all others it was bitter to send back a message even though it be written with all her love which still she must not express to keith in case he should think her lightly won would be to lose him for ever he would never stand it she saw his quick irritation the imperious glance he was a king among men she must go whatever the failure in trust whatever the consequences she must go she couldnt go whatever the loss to herself her place was here emmy would not have gone to the theatre if she had not known that jenny would stay loyally there it was too hard the months the long months during which keith had not written were upon her mind like a weariness she had had no word from him and the little photograph that he had laughingly offered had been her only consolation yes well why hadnt he written quickly her love urged his excuse she might accuse him of having forgotten her but to herself she explained and pardoned all that was not for this moment keith was not in fault it was this dreadful difficulty of occasion binding her here when her heart was with him to sit moping here by the fire when keith called to her dutythe word was a mockery they would say she ought to stay hidden voices throbbed the same message into her consciousness but every eager impulse winged with love bade her go to whom was her heart given to pa pity pity she pitied him helpless at home if anything happened to him nothing would happen what could happen supposing she had gone to the chandlers shop in those few minutes all might happen that could happen in all the hours she was away yet emmy often ran out leaving pa alone he was in bed asleep he would not awaken and would continue to lie there at rest until morning supposing she had gone to bedshe would still be in the house but in no position to look after pa he might die any night while they slept it was only the idea of leaving him the superstitious idea that just because she was not there something would happen suppose she didnt go but sat in the kitchen for two hours and then went to bed would she ever forgive herself for letting slip the chance of happiness that had come direct from the clouds never but if she went and something did happen would she ever in that event know selfcontent again in all the days of her life roughly she shouldered away her conscience those throbbing urgencies that told her to stay she was to give up everything for a fear she was to let keith go for ever jenny wrung her hands drawing sobbing breaths in her distress something made her pick the letter swiftly up and read it through a second time so wild was the desire to go that she began to whimper kissing the letter again and again holding it softly to her cold cheek keith what did it matter what did anything matter but her love was she never to know any happiness where then was her reward a heavenly crown of martyrdom what was the good of that who was the better for it passionately jenny sobbed at such a mockery of her overwhelming impulse they hadnt such a problem to solve they didnt know what it was to have your whole nature craving for the thing denied they were cowards enemies to freedom because they liked the music of their manacles they could not understand what it was to love so that one adored the beloved not blood but water ran in their veins they didnt know they couldnt feel jenny knew jenny felt jenny was racked with the sweet passion that blinds the eyes to consequences she must go wickedness might be her nature what then it was a sweet wickedness it was her choice jennys glance fell upon the trimmed hat which lay upon the table nothing but a cry from her father could have prevented her from taking it up and setting it upon her head the act was her defiance she was determined as one deaf and blind she went out of the kitchen and to the hallstand fumbling there for her hatpins she pinned her hat as deliberately as she might have done in leaving the house any morning her pale face was set she had flung the gage there remained only the acts consequential and of those since they lay behind the veil of night who could now speak not jenny iv there was still pa he was there like a secret lying snug in his warm bed drowsily coaxing sleep while jenny planned a desertion even when she was in the room her chin grimly set and her lips quivering a shudder seemed to still her heart she was afraid she could not forget him he lay there so quiet in the semidarkness a long mound under the bedclothes and she was almost terrified at speaking to him because her imagination was heightened by the sight of his dim outline he was so helpless ah if there had only been two jennies one to go one to stay the force of uncontrollable desire grappled with her pity she still argued within herself a weary echo of her earlier struggle he would need nothing she was sure it would be for such a short time that she left him he would hardly know she was not there he would think she was in the kitchen but if he needed her if he called if he knocked with his stick and she did not come he might be alarmed or stubborn and might try to find his way through the passage to the kitchen if he fell her flesh crept as she imagined him helpless upon the floor feebly struggling to rise it was of no use she was bound to tell him jenny moved swiftly from the room and returned with his nightly glass and jug of water there could be nothing else that he would want during the night it was all he ever had and he would sleep so until morning she approached the bed upon tiptoe pa she whispered are you awake he stirred and looked out from the bedclothes and she was fain to bend over him and kiss the tumbled hair pa dear i want to go out ive got to go out will you be all right if i leave you sure youll be a good boy and not move i shall be back before emmy and you wont be lonely or frightenedwill you she exhorted him see ive got to go out and if i cant leave you you are awake pa yes breathed pa half asleep a good boy night jenny my dearie girl she drew back from the bed deeply breathing and stole to the door one last glance she took at the room and at the bed closed the door and stood irresolute for a moment in the passage then she whipped her coat from the peg and put it on she took her key and opened the front door everything was black except that upon the roofs opposite the rising moon cast a glittering surface of light and the chimney pots made slanting broad markings upon the silvered slates the road was quite quiet but for the purring of a motor and she could now as her eyes were clearer observe the outline of a large car drawn to the left of the door as the lock clicked behind her and as she went forward the side lights of the motor blazed across her vision blinding her again are you there she softly called yes miss the mans deep voice came sharply out of the darkness and he jumped down from his seat to open the door of the car the action startled jenny why had the man done that did you know i was coming she suddenly asked drawing back with a sort of chill yes miss said the man jenny caught her breath she half turned away like a shy horse that fears the friendly hand he had been sure of her then oh that was a wretched thought she was shaken to the heart by such confidence he had been sure of her there was a flash of time in which she determined not to go but it passed with dreadful speed too late now to draw back keith was waiting he expected her the tears were in her eyes she was more unhappy than she had been yet and her heart was like water the man still held open the door of the car the inside was warm and inviting his hand was upon her elbow she was lost in the soft cushions and drowned in the sweet scent of the great nosegay of flowers which hung before her in a shining holder and the car was purring more loudly and moving moving as a ship moves when it glides so gently from the quay jenny covered her face with her hands which cooled her burning cheeks as if they had been ice slowly the car nosed out of the road into the wider thoroughfare her adventure had begun in earnest there was no drawing back now chapter vi the yacht i to lie deep among cushions and gently to ride out along streets and roads that she had so often tramped in every kind of weather was enough to intoxicate jenny she heard the soft humming of the engine and saw lamps and other vehicles flashing by with a sense of effortless speed that was to her incomparable if only she had been mentally at ease and free from distraction she would have enjoyed every instant of her journey even as it was she could not restrain her eagerness as they overtook a tramcar and the chauffeur honked his horn and they glided nearer and nearer and passed and seemed to leave the tram standing each time this was in process of happening jenny gave a small excited chuckle thinking of the speed and the ease and of how the people in the tram must feel at being defeated in the race every such encounter became a race in which she pressed physically forward as if to urge her steed to the final effort never had jenny teen so eager for victory so elated when its certainty was confirmed it was worth while to live for such experience how she envied her driver with his steady hands upon the steering wheel ah he was like a sailor like the sailor of romance with the wind beating upon his face and his eyes everwatchful and under his hand the car rode splendidly to keith jenny closed her eyes she could feel her heart beating fast and the blood heating her cheeks reddening them the blood hurt her and her mouth seemed to hurt too because she had smiled so much she lay back thinking of keith and of their meetingsso few so long ago so indescribably happy and beautiful she always remembered him as he had been when first he had caught her eye when he had stood so erect among other men who lounged by the sea smoking and lolling at ease he was different as she was different and she was going to him how happy she was and why did her breath come quickly and her heart sink she could not bother to decide that question she was too excited to do so in all her life she had never known a moment of such breathless anticipation of excitement which she believed was all happiness there was one other thought that jenny shirked and that went on nevertheless in spite of her inattention plying and moulding somewhere deep below her thrilling joy the thought was that she must not show keith that she loved him because while she knewshe felt surethat he loved her she must not be the smallest fraction of time before him in confession she was too proud for that he would tell her that he loved her and the spell would be broken her shyness would be gone her bravado immediately unnecessary but until then she must beware it was as necessary to keiths pride as to her own that he should win her the keith she loved would not care for a love too easily won the consciousness of this whole issue was at work below her thoughts and her thoughts from joy and dread to the discomfort of doubt raced faster than the car speedless and headlong among them were two that bitterly corroded they were of pa and of keiths confidence that she would come both were as poison in her mind ii and then there came a curious sense that something had happened the car stopped in darkness and through the air there came in the huge tones of big ben the sound of a striking hour it was nine oclock they were back at westminster before her was the bridge and above was the lighted face of the clock like some faded sun and the strokes rolled out in swelling waves that made the whole atmosphere feel soundladen the chauffeur had opened the door of the car and was offering his free hand to help jenny to step down to the ground are we there she asked in a bewildered way as if she had been dreaming how quick weve been yes miss mr redingtons down the steps you see them steps mr redingtons down there in the dinghy mind how you go miss hold tight to the rail he closed the door of the car and pointed to the steps the dinghy those stone steps to the black water jenny was shaken by a shudder the horror of the water which had come upon her earlier in the evening returned more intensely the strokes of the clock were the same the darkness the feeling of the sinister water rolling there beneath the bridge resistlessly carrying its burdens to the sea if keith had not been there she would have turned and run swiftly away overcome by her fear she timidly reached the steps and stopped peering down through the dimness she put her foot forward so that it hung dubiously beyond the edge of the pavement what a coward she thought violently with selfcontempt it drove her forward and at that moment she could see below at the edge of the lapping water the outline of a small boat and of a man who sat in it using the oars against the force of the current so as to keep the boat always near the steps she heard a dear familiar voice call out with a perfect shout of welcome jenny good girl how are you come along be careful how you come thats it six more and then stop jenny obeyed himshe desired nothing else and her doubtings were driven away in a breath she went quickly down the back water lapped and wattled against the stone and the boat and she saw keith stand up drawing the dinghy against the steps and offering her his hand he had previously been holding up a small lantern that gilded the brown mud with a feeble colour and made the water look like oil now he cried quickly step the boat rocked and jenny crouched down upon the narrow seat aflame with rapture but terrified of the water it was so near so inescapably near the sense of its smooth softness its yieldingness and the danger lurking beneath the flowing surface was acute she tried more desperately to sit exactly in the middle of the boat so that she should not overbalance it she closed her eyes sitting very still and heard the water saying plupplupplup all round her and she was afraid it meant soft death she could not forget that jenny could not swim she was stricken between terror and joy that overwhelmed her then thats my boat keith said pointing i say you are a sport to come jenny saw lights shining from the middle of the river and could imagine that a yacht lay there stubbornly resisting the current of the flowing thames iii crouching still she watched keith bend to his oars driving the boats nose beyond the shadowy yacht because he knew that he must allow for the current her eyes devoured him and her heart sang plupplupplupplup said the water the oars plashed gently jenny saw the blackness gliding beside her thick and swift they might go down down down in that black nothingness and nobody would know of it the oars ground against the edge of the dinghywood against wood grumbling and echoing upon the water behind everything she heard the roaring of london and was aware of lights moving and stationary high above them how low upon the water they were it seemed to be on a level with the boats edges and how much alone they were moving there in the darkness while the life of the city went on so far above if the boat sank jenny shivered for she knew that she would be drowned she could imagine a white face under the rivers surface lanterns flashing and thennothing it would be all another secret happening a mystery the work of a tragic instant and jenny blanchard would be forgotten for ever as if she had never been it was a horrid sensation to her as she sat there so near death and all the time that jenny was mutely enduring these terrors they were slowly nearing the yacht which grew taller as they approached and more clearly outlined against the sky the moon was beginning to catch all the buildings and to lighten the heavens far above and very pale were stars but the sky was still murky so that the river remained in darkness they came alongside the yacht keith shipped his oars caught hold of something which jenny could not see and the dinghy was borne round away from the yachts side he half rose catching with both his hands at an object projecting from the yacht and hastily knotting a rope jenny saw a short ladder hanging over the side and a lantern shining there you are keith cried up you go its quite steady hold the brass rail after a second in which her knees were too weak to allow of her moving jenny conquered her tremors rose unsteadily in the boat and cast herself at the brass rail that keith had indicated to the hands that had been so tightly clasped together steeling her the rail was startlingly cold but the touch of it nerved her because it was firm she felt the dinghy yield as she stepped from it and she seemed for one instant to be hanging precariously in space above the terrifying waters then she was at the top of the ladder ready for keiths warning shout about the descent to the deck she jumped down she was aboard the yacht and as she glanced around keith was upon the deck beside her catching her arm jennys triumphant complacency was so great that she gave a tiny nervous laugh she had not spoken at all until this moment keith had not heard her voice well said jenny thats over and she gave an audible sigh of relief thank goodness and here you are keith cried aboard the minerva iv he led her to a door and down three steps and then it seemed to jenny as if paradise burst upon her she had never before seen such a room as this cabin it was a room such as she had dreamed about in those ambitious imaginings of a wondrous future which had always been so vaguely irritating to emmy it seemed partly because the ceiling was low to be very spacious the walls and ceiling were of a kind of dusky amber hue a golden brown was everywhere the prevailing tint the tiny curtains the long settees into which one sank the chairs the shades of the mellow lightsall were of some variety of this delicate golden brown in the middle of the cabin stood a square table and on the table arrayed in an exquisitely white tablecloth was laid a wondrous meal the table was laid for two candles with amber shades made silver shine and glasses glitter upon a fruit stand were peaches and nectarines upon a tray she saw decanters little dishes crowding the table bore mysterious things to eat such as jenny had never before seen upon a side table stood other dishes a tray bearing coffee cups and ingredients for the provision of coffee curious silver boxes everywhere she saw flowers similar to those which had been in the motor car under her feet was a carpet so thick that she felt her shoes must be hidden in its pile and over all was this air of quiet expectancy which suggested that everything awaited her coming jenny gave a deep sigh glanced quickly at keith who was watching her and turned away her breath catching the contrast was too great it made her unhappy she looked down at her skirt at her hands she thought of her hat and her hidden shoes she thought of emmy the bread and butter pudding of alf rylett of pa lying at home in bed alone in the house v keith drew her forward slightly until she came within the soft radiance of the cabin lights i say it is sporting of you to come he said lets have a look at youdo they stood facing one another keith saw jenny tall and pale looking thin in her shabby dress but indescribably attractive and beautiful even in her new shyness and jenny saw the man she loved her eyes were veiled but they were unfathomably those of one deeply in love she did not know how to hide the emotions with which she was so painfully struggling pride and joy in him shyness and a sort of dread hunger and reservekeith might have read them all so plainly were they written yet her first words were wounded and defiant the man that man he knew i was coming she said in a voice of reproach you were pretty sure i should come you know keith said quietly i hoped you would and then he lowered his eyes she was disarmed and they both knew keith redington was nearly six feet in height he was thin and even bony but he was very toughly and strongly built and his face was as clean and brown as that of any healthy man who travels far by sea he was less dark than jenny and his hair was almost auburn so rich a chestnut was it his eyes were blue and heavily lashed his hands were long and brown with small freckles between the knuckles he stood with incomparable ease his hands and arms always ready but in perfect repose his lips for he was cleanshaven were keen and firm his glance was fearless as the phrase is he looked every inch a sailor born to challenge the winds and the waters to jenny who knew only those men who show at once what they think or feel his greater breeding made keith appear inscrutable as if he had belonged to a superior race she could only smile at him with parted lips not at all the baffling lady of the mirror or the contemptuous younger sister or the daring franctireur of her little home at kennington park jenny blanchard she remained but the simple eager jenny to whom these other jennies were but imperious moods well ive come she said but you neednt have been so sure keith gave an irrepressible grin he motioned her to the table shaking his head at her tone come and have some grub he said cheerfully i was about as sure as you were you neednt worry about that old sport theres so little time come and sit down theres a good girl and presently ill tell you all about it he looked so charming as he spoke that jenny obediently smiled in return and the light came rushing into her eyes chasing away the shadows so that she felt for that time immeasurably happy and unsuspicious she sat down at the laden table smiling again at the marvels which it carried my word what a feast she said helplessly talk about the ritz keith busied himself with the dishes the softly glowing cabin threw over jenny its spell the comfort the faint slow rocking of the yacht the sense of enclosed solitude lulled her every small detail of ease which might have made her nervous merged with the others in a marvellous contentment because she was with keith cut off from the world happy and at peace if she sighed it was because her heart was full but she had forgotten the rest of the evening her shabbiness every care that troubled her normal days she had cast these things off for the time and was in a glow of pleasure she smiled at keith with a sudden mischievousness they both smiled without guilt and without guile like two children at a reconciliation vi soup said keith and laid before her a steaming plate all done by kindness have you been cooking some impulse made jenny motherly it seemed a strange reversal of the true order that he should cook for her its like the white cat to have it its a secret keith laughed tell you later fire away he tasted the soup while jenny looked at five little letter biscuits in her own plate she spelt them out e t k i hkeith he watched her enjoying the spectacle of the naive mind in action as the light darted into her face ive got jenny he said embarrassed she craned and read the letters with open eyes of marvel they both beamed afresh at the primitive fancy how did you do it jenny asked inquisitively but its nice they supped the soup followed whitebait thousands of little fish jenny hardly liked to crunch them keith whipped away the plates and dived back into the cabin with a huge pie that made her gasp my gracious said jenny i can never eat it not all of it keith admitted just a bit eh he carved oh thank goodness its not stew and bread and butter pudding cried jenny as the first mouthful of the pie made her shut her eyes tightly its like heaven if they have pies there jenny had not meant that she had meant only that her sensations were those of supreme contentment give me the old earth and supper with jenny really jenny was all brimming with delight what will you have to drink claret burgundy keith was again upon his feet he poured out a large glass of red wine and laid it before her jenny saw with marvel the reflections of light on the wine and of the wine upon the tablecloth she took a timid sip and the wine ran tingling into her being high life she murmured dont make me tipsy they exchanged overjoyed and intimate glances laughing there followed trifle trifle had always been jennys dream and this trifle was her dream come true it melted in the mouth its flavours were those of innumerable spices she was transported with happiness at the mere thought of such trifle as her palate vainly tried to unravel the secrets of the dish keith who was closely observant saw that she was lost in a kind of fanatical adoration of trifle you like it he asked i shall never forget it cried jenny never as long as i live when im an old greataunt she had hesitated at her destiny i shall bore all the kids with tales about it i shall say that night on the yacht when i first knew what trifle meant they wont half get sick of it but i shant youll like to think about it asked keith like to remember tonight will you parried jenny the night you had jenny blanchard to supper their eyes met in a long and searching glance in which candour was not unmixed with a kind of measuring distrust vii keiths face might have been carven for all the truth that jenny got from it then there darted across her mind the chauffeurs certainty that she was to be his passenger she took another sip of wine yes she said again very slowly you were sure i was coming you got it all ready been a bit of a sell if i hadnt come youd have had to set to and eat it yourself or get somebody else to help you she meant another girl but she did not know she meant that until the words were spoken her own meaning stabbed her heart that icy knowledge that keith was sure of her was bitterest of all it made her happiness defiant rather than secure he was the only man for her how did she know there were not other women for keith how could she ever know that rather it sank into her consciousness that there must be other women his very ease showed her that the equanimity of his laughing expression brought her the unwelcome knowledge i should have looked pretty small if id made no preparations shouldnt i keith inquired in a dry voice if youd come here and found the place cold and nothing to eat youd have made a bit of a shindy a reserve had fallen between them jenny knew she had been unwise it pressed down upon her heart the feeling that he was somehow still a stranger to her and all the time they had been apart he had not seemed a stranger but one to whom her most fleeting and intimate thoughts might freely have been given that had been the wonderful thought to herthat they had met so seldom and understood each other so well she had made a thousand speeches to him in her dreams together in these same dreams they had seen and done innumerable things together always in perfect confidence in perfect understanding yet now when she saw him afresh all was different keith was different he was browner thinner less warm in manner and more familiar too as though he were sure of her his clothes were different and his carriage he was not the same man it was still keith still the man jenny loved but as though he were also somebody else whom she was meeting for the first time her love the love intensified by long broodings was as strong but he was a stranger all that intimacy which seemed to have been established between them once and for ever was broken by the new contact in unfamiliar surroundings she was shy uncertain hesitating and in her shyness she had blundered she had been unwise and he was offended when she could least afford to have him so offended it took much resolution upon jennys part to essay the recovery of lost ground but the tension was the worse for this mistake and she suffered the more because of her anxious emotions oh well she said at last as calmly as she could i daresay we should have managed i mightnt have come but ive come and you had all these beautiful things ready and her courage to be severe abruptly failed and lamely she concluded and its simply like fairyland im ever so happy keith grinned again showing perfect white teeth for a moment he looked jenny thought quite eager or was that only her fancy because she so desired to see it she shook her head and that drew keiths eye more trifle he suggested with an arch glance jenny noticed he wore a gold ring upon the little finger of his right hand it gleamed in the faint glow of the cabin so also did the fascinating golden hairs upon the back of his hand gently the cabin rose and fell rocking so slowly that she could only occasionally be sure that the movement was true she shook her head in reply ive had one solid meal tonight she explained wish i hadnt if id known i was coming out id have starved myself all day then youd have been shocked at me keith demurely answered as if to reassure her takes a lot to shock me have a peach i must she breathed i cant let the chance slip ooh what a scent she reached the peach towards him grand isnt it jenny discovered for keiths quizzical gaze an unexpected dimple in each pale cheek he might have been adam and she the original temptress shall i peel it seems a shame to take it off jenny watched his deft fingers as he stripped the peach the glowing skin of the fruit fell in lifeless peelings upon his plate dying as it were under her eyes keith had poured wine for her in another smaller glass she shook her head i shall be drunk she protested then i should sing horrible it would be not with a little port im not pressing you to a lot am i he brought coffee to the table and she began to admire first of all the pattern of the silver tray jenny had never seen such a tray before outside a shop nor so delicately porcelain a coffeeservice it helped to give her the sense of strange unforgettable experience you didnt say if youd remember this evening she slowly reflected keith looked sharply up from the coffee which he was pouring she saw from a thermos flask didnt i he said of course i shall remember it ive done better ive looked forward to it thats something youve not done ive looked forward to it for weeks you dont think of that weve been in the mediterranean coasting about ive been planning what id do when we got back then templecombe said hed be coming right up to london and i planned to see you templecombe jenny queried whos he hes the lord who owns this yacht did you think it was my yacht no i hoped it wasnt jenny said slowly viii keiths eyes were upon her but she looked at her peach stone her hand still lightly holding the fruit knife and her fingers half caught by the beam of a candle which stood beside her he persisted well templecombe took his valet who does the cooking and my handmy sailormanwanted to go and visit his wife and that left me to see after the yacht dyou see i had the choice of keeping tomkins aboard or staying aboard myself you might almost have given me longer notice urged jenny it seems to me no im under instructions im not a free man said keith soberly i was once but im not now im captain of a yacht i do what im told jenny fingered her portwine glass and in looking at the light upon the wine her eyes became fixed will you ever do anything else she asked keith shrugged slightly you want to know a lot he said i dont know very much do i jenny answered in a little dead voice just somewhere about nothing at all i have to pretend the rest dyou want to know it jenny gave a quick look at his hands which lay upon the table she could not raise her eyes further she was afraid to do so her heart seemed to be beating in her throat its funny me having to ask for it isnt it she said suddenly haggard chapter vii mortals i keith did not answer that was the one certainty she had and her heart sank he did not answer that meant that really she was nothing to him that he neither wanted nor trusted her and yet she had thought a moment beforeonly a moment beforethat he was as moved as herself they had seemed to be upon the brink of confidences and now he had drawn back each instant deepened her sense of failure when jenny stealthily looked sideways keith sat staring before him his expression unchanged she had failed you dont trust me she said with her voice trembling there was another silence then dont i keith asked indifferently he reached his hand out and patted hers even holding it lightly for an instant i think i do you dont think so no she merely framed the word sighing youre wrong jenny keiths voice changed he deliberately looked round the table at the little dishes that still lay there untouched have some of these sweets will you no jenny could only draw her breath sharply shaking her head almonds then she moved impatiently her face distorted with wretched exasperation as if he could see that and as if fear of the outcome hampered his resolution keith hurried on well look here well clear the table together if you like take the things through the other cabinthat oneto the galley root up the table by its old legsill show you how its doneand then we can have a talk ill ill tell you as much as i can about everything you want to know that do i cant stay long ive left pa in bed she could not keep the note of roughness from her pleading voice although shame at being petulant was struggling with her deeper feeling well he wont want to get up again yet will he keith answered composedly oh he had nerves of steel thought jenny i mean this is his bedtime i suppose there was no answer jenny looked at the tablecloth numbed by her sensations do you have to look after him all the time thats a bit rough no was forced from jenny no i dont not generally but tonightbut thats a long story too with rows in it which made keith laugh he laughed not quite naturally forcing the last several jerks of his laughter so that she shuddered at the thought of his possible contempt it was as if everything she said was lost before ever it reached his heartas if the words were like weak blows against an overwhelming strength discouragement followed and deepened after every blowevery useless and baffled word there was again silence while jenny set her teeth forcing back her bitterness and her chagrin trying to behave as usual and to check the throbbing within her breast he was trying to charm her teasingly to wheedle her back into kindness altogether misunderstanding her mood he was guarded and considerate when she wanted only passionate and abject abandonment of disguise well toss up who shall begin first keith said in a jocular way hows that for an idea jenny felt her lips tremble frantically she shook her head compressing the unruly lips only by keeping in the same position by making herself remain still could she keep back the tears her thought went on that keith was cruelly playing with her mercilessly watching the effect of his own coldness upon her too sensitive heart eh but it was a lesson to her what brutes men could be at this game and that thought gave her presently an unnatural composure if he were cruel she would never show her wounds she would sooner die but her eyes invisible to him were dark with reproach and her face drawn with agony well wed better do something she said in a sharp voice and rose to her feet where is it the things go keith also rose and jenny felt suddenly sick and faint at the relaxation of her selfcontrol ii hullo hullo keith cried and was at once by her side here have a drink of water jenny steadying herself by the table sipped a little of the water is it the wine thats made me stupid she asked i feel as if my teeth were swollen and my skin was too tight for my bones beastly how horrid keith said lightly taking from her hand the glass of water if its the wine you wont feel the effects long go on deck if you like youll feel all right in the air ill clear away jenny would not leave him she shook her head decidedly wait a minute then ill come too they moved quickly about leaving the fruit and little sweets and almonds upon the sidetable but carrying everything else through a sleepingcabin into the galley it was this other cabin that still further deepened jennys sense of painof inferiority that was the feeling now most painful she had just realised it she was a common girl and keithah keith was secure enough she thought in that moment jenny deliberately gave him up she felt it was impossible that he should love her when she looked around it was with a sorrowfulness as of farewell these things were the things that keith knew and had knownthat she would never again see but in the bitter memories of this night the night would pass but her sadness would remain she would think of him here she gave him up quite humble in her perception of the disparity between them and yet her own love would stay and she must store her memory full of all that she would want to know when she thought of his every moment jenny ceased to desire him she somehowit may have been by mere exhausted cessation of feelingwished only to understand his life and then never to see him again it was a kind of numbness that seized her then she awoke once again stirred by the bright light and by the luxury of her surroundings this where you sleep with passionate interest in everything that concerned him jenny looked eagerly about the cabin she now indicated a broad bunk with a beautifully white counterpane and such an eiderdown quilt as she might optimistically have dreamed about the tiny cabin was so compact and so marvellously furnished with beautiful things that it seemed to jenny a kind of suite in tabloid form she did not understand how she had done without all these luxurious necessities for fiveandtwenty years sometimes keith answered having followed her marvelling eye from beauty to beauty when theres company i sleep forward with the others he had been hurrying by with a cruet and the bread dish when her exclamation checked him is this lord a friend of yours then jenny asked sometimes keith dryly answered understand jenny frowned again at his tone no she said keith passed on jenny stood surveying the sleepingcabin a whole nest of drawers attracted her eye deep drawers that would hold innumerable things then she saw a handbasin with taps for hot and cold water impulsively she tried the hotwater tap and was both relieved and disappointed when it gasped and offered her cold water there were monogramed toilet appointments beautiful to see a leathercased carriage clock a shelf full of books that looked fascinating towels tiny rugs a light above the handbasin and another to switch on above the bunk it was wonderful and there was a lookingglass before her in which she could see her own reflection as clear as daytoo clearly for her pleasure the face she irresistibly saw in this genuine mirror looked pale and tired although upon each white cheek there was a hard scarlet flush her eyes were liquid the pupils dilated her whole appearance was one of suppressed excitement she had chagrin not only because she felt that her appearance was unattractive but because it seemed to her that her face kept no secrets had she seen it as that of another jenny would unerringly have read its painful message eh dear she said aloud you give yourself away old sport dont you now the mirrored head shook in disparaging admission of its own shortcoming jenny bent nearer meeting the eyes with a clear stare there were wretched lines about her mouth for the first time in her life she had a horrified fear of growing older it was as though when she shut her eyes she saw herself as an old woman she felt a curious stab at her heart keith returning found jenny still before the mirror engaged in this unsparing scrutiny and laughing gently he caught her elbow with his fingers in the mirror their glances met at his touch jenny thrilled and unconsciously leaned towards him from the mirrored glance she turned questioningly to meet upon his face a beaming expression of tranquil enjoyment that stimulated her to candid remark somehow it restored some of her lost ease to be able to speak so i look funny dont i she appealed to his judgment keith bent nearer as for more detailed examination retaining hold upon her elbow his face was tantalisingly close to hers and jenny involuntarily turned her head away not coquettishly but through embarrassment at a mingling of desire and timidity is that the word he asked you look all right my dear my dear she knew that the words meant more to her than they did to him so carelessly were they uttered but they sent a shock through her how jenny wished that she might indeed be dear to keith he released her and she followed him laden backwards and forwards until the table was cleared then he unscrewed the table legs and the whole thing came gently away in his hands there appeared four small brass sockets imbedded in the carpets deep pile and the centre of the room was clear by the same dexterous use of his acquaintance with the cabins mechanism keith unfastened one of the settees and wheeled it forward so that it stood under the light and in great comfort for the time when they should sit to hear his story now he said well have a breather on deck to clear your old head iii by this time the moon was silvering the river riding high above the earth serenely a thing of eternal mystery to her beholders with the passing of clouds and the deepening of the night those stars not eclipsed by the moon shone like swarmed throbbing points of silver they seemed more remote as though the clearer air had driven them farther off jenny her own face and throat illumined stared up at the moon marvelling and then she turned without speaking to the black shadows and the gliding silent water upon every hand was the chequer of contrast beautiful to the eye and haunting to the spirit a soft wind stirred her hair and made her bare her teeth in pleasure at the sweet contact keith led her to the wide wooden seat which ran by the side of the deck and they sat together there the noise of the city was dimmer the lamps were yellowed in the moons whiter light there were occasional movements upon the face of the river a long way away they heard a sharp panting as a motor boat rushed through the water sending out a great surging wave that made all other craft rise and fall and sway as the rivers agitation subsided the boat came nearer a coloured light showing and presently it hastened past a moving thing with a muffled figure at its helm and the minerva rocked gently almost until the sound of the motor boats tufftuff had been lost in the general noise of london nearer at hand above them jenny could hear the clanging of tramgongs and the clatter and slow boom of motor omnibuses but these sounds were mellowed by the evening and although they were near enough to be comforting they were too far away to interrupt this pleasant solitude with keith the two of them sat in the shadow and jenny craned to hear the chuckle of the water against the yachts sides it was a beautiful moment in her life she gave a little moan and swayed against keith her delight succeeded by deadly languor iv so for a moment they sat keiths arm around her shoulders and then jenny moved so as to free herself she was restless and unhappy again her nerves on edge the moon and the water which had soothed her were now an irritation keith heard her breath come and go quickly heavily sorry jenny he said in a tone of puzzled apology she caught his fallen hand pressing it eagerly its nothing only that minute like somebody walking on my grave youre cold well go down to the cabin again he was again cool and unembarrassed together they stood upon the deck in the moonlight while the water flowed rapidly beneath them and the nights mystery emphasised their remoteness from the rest of the world they had no part at this moment in the general life but were solitary living only to themselves keiths arm was about her as they descended but he let it drop as they stood once more in the goldenbrown cabin sit here he plumped a cushion for her and jenny sank into an enveloping softness that rose about her as water might have done so that she might have been alarmed if keith had not been there looking down with such an expression of concern im really all right she told him reassuringly miserable for a tickthats all sure he seemed genuinely alarmed scanning her face she had again turned sick and faint so that her knees were without strength was he sincere if only she could have been sure of him it meant everything in the world to her if only keith would say he loved her if only he would kiss her he had never done that the few short days of their earlier comradeship had been full of delight he had taken her arm he had even had her in his arms during a wild bluster of wind but always the inevitable kiss had been delayed had been averted and only her eager afterthoughts had made romance of their meagre acquaintance yet now when they were alone together when every nerve in her body seemed tense with desire for him he was somehow aloofnot constrained for then she would have been happy at the profoundly affecting knowledge that she had carried the day but unsympathetically and unlovingly at ease she could not read his face in his manner she read only a barren kindness that took all and gave nothing if he didnt love her she need not have come it would have been better to go on as she had been doing dreaming of him untiluntil what jenny sighed at the grey vision only hunger had driven her to his side on this eveningthe imperative hunger of her nature upon which keith had counted he had been sure she would comethat was unforgivable he had welcomed her as he might have welcomed a man but as he might also have welcomed any man or woman who would have relieved his loneliness upon the yacht not a loved friend jenny with her brain restored by the gentle breeze to its normal quickness of action seemed dartingly to seek in every direction for reassurance and she found in everything no single tone or touch to feed her insatiable greed for tokens of his love oh but she was miserable indeeddisappointed in her dearest and most secret aspirations he was perhaps afraid that she wanted to attach herself to him if that were so why couldnt he be honest and tell her so that was all she wanted from him she wanted only the truth she felt she could bear anything but this kindness this charming detached thought for her he was giving her courtesy when all she needed was that his passion should approach her own and when she should have been strong mistress of herself she was weak as water her strength was turned her selfconfidence mocked by his bearing she trembled with the recurring vehemence of her love that had been fed upon solitude upon the dreariness in which she spent her mere calendared days her eyes were sombrely glowing dark with pain and keith was leaning towards her as he might have leant towards any girl who was half fainting she could have cried but that she was too proud to cry she was not emmy who cried she was jenny blanchard who had come upon this fools trip because a force stronger than her pride had bidden her to forsake all but the impulse of her love and keith secure and confident was coolly as it were disentangling himself from the claim she had upon him by virtue of her love it seemed to jenny that he was holding her at a distance nothing could have hurt her more it shamed her to think that keith might suspect her honesty and her unselfishness when she had thought of nothing but her love and the possibility of his own she read now in this moment of descent into misery a dreadful blunder made by her own overweening eagerness she saw keith alone thinking that he would be at a loss to fill his time suddenly remembering her thinking in a rather contemptuous way of their days together and supposing that she would do as well as another for an hours talk to keep him from a stagnant evening if that were so goodbye to her dreams if she were no more to him than that there was no hope left in her life for keith might ply from port to port seeing in her only one girl for his amusement but he had spoilt her for another man no other man could escape the withering comparison with keith to jenny he was a king among men incomparable and if he did not love her then the proud jenny blanchard who unhesitatingly saw life and character with an immovable reserve was the merest trivial legend of kennington park she was like every other girl secure in her complacent belief that she could win loveuntil the years crept by and no love came and she must eagerly seek to accept whatever travesty of love sidled within the radius of her attractiveness suddenly jenny looked at keith better now she said harshly youll have to buck up with your talewont you if youre going to get it out before i have to toddle home again oh said keith in a confident tone youre here now youll stay until ive quite finished what do you mean asked jenny sharply dont talk rubbish keith held up a warning forefinger he stretched his legs and drew from his pocket a stout pipe i mean what i say he looked sideways at her dont be a fool jenny her heart was chilled at the menace of his words no less than by the hardness of his voice v i dont know what youre talking about keith but youll take me back to the steps when i say she said keith filled his pipe i suppose you think its funny to talk like that jenny looked straight in front of her and her heart was fluttering it was not her first tremor but she was deeply agitated keith with a look that was almost a smile finished loading the pipe and struck a match he then settled himself comfortably at her side dont be a juggins jenny he remarked in a dispassionate way that made her feel helpless sorry she said quickly ive got the jumps ive had awful rows tonight before coming out tell me about them keith urged get em off your chest she shook her head oh no she wanted something from him very different from such kindly sympathy only make it worse she claimed drives it in more besides i dont want to i want to hear about you oh me he made a laughing noise theres nothing to tell you said you would jenny was alarmed at his perverseness but they were not estranged now keith was smiling rather bitterly at his own thoughts it seemed i wonder why it is women want to know such a lot he said drowsily all of them she sharply countered i suppose you ought to know you look seedy still are you really feeling better jenny took no notice well yes i suppose all of them they all want to take possession of you theyre never satisfied with what theyve got perhaps they havent got anything jenny said and after a painful pause oh well i shall have to be going home she wearily moved in absolute despair perhaps even with the notion of rising though her mind was in turmoil jenny he held her wrist preventing any further movement he was looking at her with an urgent gaze then violently with a rapid motion he came nearer and forced his arm behind jennys waist drawing her close against his breast her face averted until their cheeks touched when the life seemed to go out of jennys body and she moved her head quickly in resting it on his shoulder keiths face against her hair and their two hearts beating quickly it was done in a second and they sat so closely embraced without speech still jennys hands were free as if they had been lifeless time seemed to stand still and every noise to stop during that long moment and in her heart jenny was saying over and over utterly hopeless its no good its no good its no good wretchedly she attempted to press herself free her elbow against keiths breast she could not get away but each flying instant deepened her sense of bitter failure its no use she said at last in a dreadful murmur you dont want me a bit far better let me go keith loosed his hold and she sat away from him with a little sigh that was almost a shudder her hands went as if by instinct to her hair smoothing it another instinct perhaps made her turn to him with the ghost of a reassuring smile silly weve been she said huskily ive been thinking about you all this time and this is the end of it well i was a fool to come she sat up straight away from the back of the settee but she did not look at keith she was looking at nothing only in her mind was going on the tumult of merciless selfjudgment suddenly her composure gave way and she was again in his arms not crying but straining him to her and keith was kissing her blessed kisses upon her soft lips as if he truly loved her as she had all this time hoped she clung to him in a stupor chapter viii penalties i poor old jenny keith was saying stroking her arm and holding his cheek against hers you dont want me groaned jenny yes i can tell you dont you dont mean it dyou think i cant tell keith raised a finger and lightly touched her hair he rubbed her cheek with his own so that she could feel the soft bristles of his shaven beard and he held her more closely within the circle of his arm because im clumsy he breathed you know too much jenny no i can tell its all the difference in the world well then how many others have kissed you eh keith jenny struggled a little let me go now how many keith kissed her cheek tell the whole dreadful truth if i asked you how many girls what would you say then jennys sombre eyes were steadily watching him prying into the secrets of his own he gave a flashing smile that lighted up his brown face were both jealous he told her isnt that whats the matter you dont trust me you dont want me youre only teasing with a vehement effort she recovered some of her selfcontrol pride was again active the dominant emotion so am i only teasing she concluded youre too jolly pleased with yourself how did you know i was clumsy keith asked i shall bite your old face i shall nibble it as if i was a horse and you were a bit of sugar fancy jenny going home with half a face he laughed excitedly at his forced pleasantry and the sound of his laugh was music to jennys ears he was excited he was moved quickly the melancholy pressed back upon her after this momentary surcease he was excited because she was in his armsnot because he loved her why did you send for me she suddenly said in your letter you said youd explain everything then you said youd tell me about yourself youve done nothing but tease all the time are you afraid or what keith dear you dont know what it means to me if you dont want melet me go i oughtnt to have come i was silly to come but i had to but if you only wanted somebody to tease one of the others would have done quite as well again the smile spread across keiths face brightening his eyes and making his teeth glisten i said you were jealous he murmured in her ear one of the others indeed jenny theres no othernobody like you my sweet there couldnt be do you think there could be nobody such a fool jenny said miserably whos a fool you he seemed to think for a moment and then went on well ive told you i planned the supper that was true let me go im getting cramped jenny drew away but he followed holding her less vigorously but in no way releasing her no really let me go keith shook his head i shant let you go he said make yourself comfortable i only make myself miserable jenny felt her hair which was loosened her cheeks were hot are you sorry you came yes keith pressed closer to her stifling her breath she saw his brown cheeks for an instant before she was again enveloped in his strong embrace and then she heard a single word breathed in her ear liar said keith in a moment he added sorry be poleaxed ii it was the second time in that evening that jenny had been accused of lying and when the charge had been brought by alf she had flamed with anger now however she felt no anger she felt through her unhappiness a dim motion of exulting joy half suffocated she was yet thrilled with delight in keiths strength with belief in his love because it was ardently shown strength was her god she worshipped strength as nearly all women worship it and to jenny strength determination manhood were keiths attributes she loved him for being strong she found in her own weakness the triumph of powerlessness of humiliation youre suffocating me she warned him panting dyou love me a little yes a little a lot say you love me a lot and youre glad you came jenny held his face to hers and kissed him passionately dear she fiercely whispered keith slowly released her and they both laughed breathlessly with brimming glowing eyes he took her hand still smiling and watching her face old silly keith murmured arent you an old silly eh so you say you ought to know i suppose i am but a nice old silly and a good old girl to come tonight but then you knew i should come urged jenny drily frowningly regarding him you cant forgive that can you you think i ought to have come grovelling to you its not proper to ask you to come to me to believe you might come to have everything ready in case you might come prude jenny thats what you are a prude wouldnt have come thats all you know said keith teasingly shed have comeout of curiosity but shed have made a fuss thats what prudes are thats what they do well i expect you know jenny admitted sarcastically the words wounded her more than they wounded him where keith laughed jenny quivered you dont know what it means to me she began again and checked her too unguarded tongue to come he bent towards her of course its marvellous to me was that what you meant no to think other girls she could not speak distinctly other girls keith appeared astonished do you really believe he too paused no other girls come on this yacht to see me ive known other girls ive made love to other girlswhat man hasnt you dont get to my age without without what jenny asked coolly im not pretending anything to you im thirty and a bit over a man doesnt get to my ageno man does without having been made a fool of oh i dont mind that jenny said sharply its the girls youve fooled dont you believe it jenny theyve always been wiser than me say theyve known a bit more youre different jenny shook her head sighing i bet theyve all been that she slowly said till the next one the old unhappiness had returned gripping her heart she no longer looked at him but stared away straight in front of her well what if they had all been different keith persisted supposing i were to tell you about them each one theres no time for it jenny youll have to take my word for it youll do that if you want to if you want to believe in me do you of course i do jenny blazed i cant be different if i was at home but im here and you knew id come dyou see what i mean youre not in a trap old girl said keith you can go home this minute if you think you are his colour also rose you make too much fuss you want me to tell you good fat lies to save your face dont be a juggins jenny show your spirit jenny keith still held her hand he drew it towards him and jenny was made to lean by his sudden movement he slipped his arm again round her jenny did not yield herself he was conscious of rebuff although she did not struggle you want me to trust you blindfold she said in a dreary voice its not good enough keith really it isnt when you dont trust me you sent for me and i came as soon as i was here you you were as beastly as you could be her voice trembled not really beastly keith urged and his coaxing tone and concerned expression shook her nice beastly eh you werent nice you werent jenny hesitated you didnt you werent nice i didnt want to frighten you jenny drew herself up frantically angry now whos lying she savagely cried and put her hands to disengage herself oh keith im so sick of it he held her more tightly all her efforts were unavailing against that slowly increased pressure from his strong arms listen jenny keith said i love you thats that i wanted to see you more than anything on earth i wanted to kiss you good god jen dyou think youre the easiest person in the world to manage iii the bewilderment that succeeded clove the silence jenny gasped against her will what do you mean she demanded you think im looking on you as cheap when im in an absolute funk of you keith cried ooh her exclamation was incredulity itself keith persisted warmly im not lying its all true and youre a termagant jenny thats what you are you want it all your own way anything that goes wrong is my faultnot yours you dont think theres anything thats your fault its all mine but my good girl thats ridiculous what dyou think i know about you eh nothing whatever absolutely nothing you think youre as clear as day youre not youre a dark horse im afraid of youafraid of your temper your pride you wont see that you think its my fault that keiths excitement almost convinced jenny shouting wont do any good she said deeply curious and overwhelmed by her bewilderment pull yourself together jenny he urged look at it from my side if you can try imagine ive got a side that is and now ill tell you something about myself no lies and youll have to make the best of the truth the truth laughing he kissed her and jenny puzzled but intrigued withheld her indignation in order to listen to the promised account keith began well jenny i told you i was thirty im thirtyone in a couple of months ill tell you the date and you can work me a sampler and i was born in a place youve never set eyes onand i hope you never will set eyes on it i was born in glasgow and theres a smelly old river there called the clyde where they launch big ships a bit bigger than the minerva the minerva was built in holland well my old father was a tough old chapnot a scotchman though my mother was scotchwith a big business in glasgow he was as rich aswell richer than anybody you ever met work that out and he was as tough as a glasgow business man theyre a special kind and i was his little boy he had no other little boys you interested jenny nodded sharply her breast against his so that she felt every breath he drew yes well my father was so keen that i should grow up into a glasgow business man that he nearly killed me he hated me simply because when i did anything it was always something away from the patternthe plan dyou see and hed nearly beat my head in each time yes wasnt it well when i was ten he and i had got into such a way that we were sworn enemies hed got a strong will but so had i even though i was such a kid and i wouldnti couldntdo what he told me to and when i was thirteen i ran away id always loved the river and boats and so on and i ran away from my old father and he nearly went off his headand he brought me back didnt take him long to find me that was when i began to hate him id only been afraid of him before but i was growing up well he put me to a school where they watched me all the time i sulked i worked i did every blessed thing and i grew older still and more afraid of my father and somehow less afraid of him too i got a sort of horror of him i hated him and when he said id got to go into the business i just told him id see him damned first that was when he first saw that you cant make any man a slavenot even your own sonas long as hes got enough to eat he couldnt starve me its starved men who are made slaves jenny theyve got no guts well he threw me over he thought i should starve myself and then go back to him fawning i didnt go i was eighteen and i went on a ship i had two years of it and my father died i got nothing all went to a cousin i was nobody but i was free freedoms the only thing thats worth while in this life and i was twenty or so it was then that i picked up a girl in london and tried to keep hernot honest but straight to me i looked after her for a year working down by the river but it was no good she went off with other men because i got tired of her i threw her over when i found that out i mean i told her she could stick to me or let me go she wanted both i went to sea again it was then i met templecombe i met him in south america and we got very pally then i came back to england i got engaged to a girlgot married to her when i was twentythree married cried jenny pulling herself away she had flushed deeply her heart was like lead im not lying youre hearing it all and shes dead what was her name adela she was little and fair and she was a little sport but i only married her because i was curious i didnt care for her in a couple of months i knew id made a mistake she told me herself she knew much more than i did she was older than i was and she knew a lot for her ageabout men shed been engaged to one and another since she was fifteen and in ten years you get to know a good deal i think she knew everything about menand i was a boy she died two years ago well after id been with her for a year i broke away she only wanted me to fetch and carry she took possession of me as they say i went into partnership with a man who let me in badly and adela went back to her work and i went back to sea and a year later i went to prison because a woman i was living with was a jealous cat and got the blame thrown on to me for something i knew nothing about dyou see prison never mind the details when i came out of prison i was going downhill as fast as a barrel and then i saw an advertisement of templecombes for a skipper i saw him and told him all about myself and he agreed to overlook my little time in prison if i signed on with him to look after this yacht now you see i havent got a very good record ive been in prison and ive lived with three women and ive got no prospects except that im a good sailor and know my job but i never did what i was sent to prison for and as i told you the three women all knew more than i did ive never done a girl any harm intentionally and the last of them belongs to six years ago since then ive met other girls and some of them have run after me because i was a sailorman they do you know youre the girl i love and i want you to remember that i was a kid when i got married thats the tale jenny and every word of its true and now what dyou think of it are you afraid of me now dont you think im a bit of a fool or dyou think im the sort of fellow that fools the girls there was no reply to his question for a long time until keith urged her afresh what im wondering said jenny in a slow and rather puzzled way is what youd think of me if id lived with three different men because im twentyfive you know iv it might have checked keith in midcareer his tone had certainly not been one of apology but along with a natural complacency he had the honesty that sometimes accompanies success in affairs well he said frankly i shouldnt like it jen how dyou think i like it dyou love me jenny dear i dont know i dont see why you should be different nor do i i am though i wish i wasnt can you see that have you ever wished you werent yourself of course you have so have i have you had men running after you all the time have you been free night and day with time on your hands and temptations going you havent you dont know what it is youve been at home and whats more youve been tied up becausebecause people think girls are safer if theyre tied up men do flashed jenny they like to have it all to themselves well if youd ever been on your own for days together and thinking as much about women as all young men do i wonder if i should boast of it jenny said drily to a girl i was pretending to love keith let his arm drop from her waist he withdrew it and sighed then he moved forward upon the settee half rising with his hands upon his knees ah well jenny perhaps id better be taking you ashore he said in a constrained exasperated tone you dont care if you break my heart jenny whispered its all one to you thats simply not true but its no good discussing it he had lost his temper and was full of impatience he sat frowning disliking her with resentment and momentary aversion plainly to be seen in his bearing just because i dont agree that its mighty kind of you to condescend jenny was choking you thought i should jump for joy because other women had had you i dont know what sort of girl you thought i was well i thought i thought you were fond of me keith slowly said making an effort to speak coldly that was what i thought thought id stand anything she corrected and fall on your neck into the bargain jenny old girl thats not true but i thought youd understand better than youve done i thought youd understand why i told you you think i thought i was so sure of you i wish youd try to see a bit further he leaned back again not touching her but dejectedly frowning his face pale beneath the tan his anger had passed in a deeper feeling i told you because you wanted to know about me if id been the sort of chap youre thinking i should have told a long george washington yarn pretending to be an innocent hero well i didnt im not an innocent hero im a man whos knocked about for fifteen years youve got the truth women dont like the truth they want a yarn a yappy long sugarcoated yarn and lots of protestations this is all because i havent asked you to forgive mebecause i havent sworn not to do it again if only youll forgive me you want to see yourself forgiving me on a pinnacle graciously forgiving me oh youre a beast cried jenny let me go home she rose to her feet and stood in deep thought for a moment keith remained seated then he too rose they did not look at one another but with bent heads continued to reconsider all that had been said v ive all the time been trying to show you im not a beast keith urged at last but a human being it takes a woman to be something above a human being he was sneering and the sneer chilled her if youd been thinking of somebody for months she began in a trembling tone thinking about them all the time living on it day after day just thinking about them and loving them with all your heart you dont know the way a woman does it theres nothing else for them to think about ive been thinking every minute of the dayabout how you looked and what you said and telling myselfthough i didnt believe itthat you were thinking about me just the same and ive been planning how youd look when i saw you again and what wed say and do you dont know what its meant to me youve never dreamed of it and now to come tonightwhen i ought to be at home looking after my dad and to hear you talk about about a lot of other girls as if i was to take them for granted why how do i know there havent been lots of others since you saw me because i tell you its not so he interposed because ive been thinking of you all the time how many days at the seaside was it three it was enough for me it was enough for you and now one evenings enough for both of us jenny cried sharply too much youll cry your eyes out tomorrow he warned oh tonight she assured him recklessly because you dont love me you throw all the blame on me but its your own pride thats the real trouble jenny you want to come round gradually and times too short for it remember im away again tomorrow did you forget that jenny shivered she had forgotten everything but her grievance how long will you be away she asked three months at least does it matter she reproached his bitterness by a glance jenny dear he went on when times so short is it worth while to quarrel you see what it is if you dont try and love me youll go home unhappy and we shall both be unhappy i told you im not a free man im not i want to be free i want to be free all the time and im tied youre still talking about yourself said jenny scornfully on the verge of tears vi well they had both made their unwilling attempts at reconciliation and they were still further estranged they were not loving one another they were just quarrelsome and unhappy at being able to find no safe road of compromise jenny had received a bitter shock keith with the sense that she was judging him harshly was sullen with his deeply wounded heart they both felt bruised and wretched and deeply ashamed and offended and then they looked at each other and jenny gave a smothered sob it was all that was needed for keith was beside her in an instant holding her unyielding body but murmuring gentle coaxing words into her ear in an instant more jenny was crying in real earnest buried against him and her tears were tears of relief as much as of pain chapter ix what followed i the minerva slowly and gently rocked with the motion of the current the stars grew brighter the sounds diminished upon the face of the river lights continued to twinkle catching and mottling the wavelets the cold air played with the water and flickered upon the minervas deck strong enough only to appear mischievous too soft and wayward to make its presence known to those within and in the minervas cabin set as it were in that softly rayed room of old gold and golden brown jenny was clinging to keith snatching once again at precarious happiness far off in her aspirations love was desired as synonymous with peace and contentment but in her heart jenny had no such pretence she knew that it was otherwise she knew that passive domestic enjoyment would not bring her nature peace and that such was not the love she needed keith alone could give her true love and she was in keiths arms puzzled and lethargic with something that was only not despair because she could not fathom her own feelings keith she said presently im sorry to be a fool youre not a fool old dear he assured her but im a beast yes i think you are jenny acknowledged there was a long pause she tried to wipe her eyes and at last permitted keith to do that for her flinching at contact with the handkerchief but aware all the time of some secret joy when she could speak more calmly she went on suppose we dont talk any more about beingwhat we areand forgiving and all that we dont mean it we only say it well i mean itabout being a beast keith said humbly thats because i made you cry well said jenny agreeingly you can be a beasti mean think you are one and if im miserable i shall think ive been a fool but well cut out about forgiving because i shall never really forgive you i couldnt itll always be there till im an old woman only till youre happy dear keith told her thats all that means i cant think like that i feel its in my bones but youre going away where are you going dyou know is it far were going back to the south otherwise its too cold for yachting and templecombe wants to keep out of england at the moment hes safe on the yacht he cant be got at theres some wretched predatory woman of title pursuing him here here cried jenny i cant understand if you talk pidginenglish keith well you know what ravenous means hungry and a woman of titleyou know what a lord is well and shes chasing about dropping little scented notes at every street corner for him oh they are awful cried jenny countesses always in the divorce court or something somebody ought to stop them they dont have countesses in america do they why dont we have a republic and get rid of them all if theyd got the floor to scrub they wouldnt have time to do anything wrong true said keith true dyou like scrubbing floors no but i do it and keep my hands nice too the hands were inspected and approved but then youre more free than most people keith presently remarked in a tone of envy free exclaimed jenny me in the millinery when ive got to be there every morning at nine sharp or get the sack and often busy times stick at it till eight or later for a few bob a week and never have any time to myself except when im tired out who gets the fun why its all work for people like me all work for somebody else what dyou call being free arent they free not one theyre all tied up templecombes hawk couldnt come on this yacht without a troop of friends they cant go anywhere they like unless its the thing to be done they do everything because its the right thingbecause if they do something else people will think its oddthink theyre odd and they cant stand that well but keith who is it thats free nobody he said i thought perhaps it was only poor people just because they were poor well jenny thats so but when people neednt do what theyre told they invent a system that turns them into slaves they have a religion or they run like the gadarine swine into a fine old lather and pretend that everybodys got to do the same for some reason or other they call it the herd instinct and all sorts of names but theres nobody whos really free most of them dont want to be if they were free they wouldnt know what to do if their chains were off theyd fall down and die they wouldnt be happy if there wasnt a system grinding them as much like each other as it can but why not whats the good of being alive at all if youve got to do everything whether you want to do it or not its not sense its fact though from the king to the minerall a part of a big complicated machine thats grinding us slowly to bits making us all more and more wretched but who makes it like that keith cried jenny who says its to be so keith laughed grimly dont lets talk about it he urged no good talking about it the only thing to do is to fight itget out of the machine but theres nowhere to go is there asked jenny i was thinking about it this evening theyve got every bit of the earth wherever you go theyre there with laws and police and things all ready for you youve got to give in im not going to said keith ill tell you that jenny but keith who is it that makes it so there must be somebody to start it is it god keith laughed again still more drily and grimly ii jenny was not yet satisfied she still continued to revolve the matter in her mind you said nobody was free keith but then you said you were freewhen you got married till i got married then i wasnt i fell into the machine and got badly chawed then dont you want to get married jenny asked ever again not that way keiths jaw was set ive been there and to me thats what hell is how jenny wished she could understand she did not want to get married herselfthat way but she wanted to serve she wanted keith to be her husband she wanted to make him happy and to make his home comfortable she felt that to work for the man she loved was the way to be truly happy did he not think that he could be happy in working for her she couldnt understand it was all so hard that she sometimes felt that her brain was clamped with iron bolts and chains what way dyou want to get married jenny asked i want to marry you any old way and i want to take you to the other end of the worldwhere there arent any laws and neighbours and rates and duties and politicians and imitations of life and i want to set you down on virgin soil and make a real life for you in labrador or alaska he glowed with enthusiasm jenny glowed too infected by his enthusiasm sounds fine she said keith exclaimed eagerly he was alive with joy at her welcome would you come he cried really to the end of the world jenny said rather they kissed passionately carried away by their excitement brimming with joy at their agreement in feeling and desire the cabin seemed to expand into the virgin forest and the open plain a new vision of life was opened to jenny exultingly she pictured the future bright active occupiedaway from all the old cramping things it was the life she had dreamed away from men away from stuffy rooms and endless millinery away from regular hours and tedious meals away from all that now made up her daily dullness it was splendid her quick mind was at work seeing arranging imagining as warm as life the changed days that would come in such a terrestrial paradise and then keith watching with triumph the mounting joy in her expression saw the joy subside the brilliance fade the eagerness give place to doubt and then to dismay what is it he begged jenny dear its pa jenny said i couldnt leave him not for anything is that all well take him with us cried keith jenny sorrowfully shook her head no hes paralysed she explained and sighed deeply at the faded vision iii well im not going to give up the idea for that keith resumed after a moment jenny shook her head and a wry smile stole into her face making it appear thinner than before i didnt expect you would she said quietly its me that has to give it up jenny he was astonished by her tone dyou think i meant that never well manage something something can be done when i come back ah youre going away jenny cried in agony i shant see you i shall have every day to think of day after day and you wont write and i shant see you she held him to her her breast against his desperate with the dread of being separated from him its easy for you at sea with the wind and the sun and something fresh to see and something happening all the time but mein a dark room poring over bits of straw and velvet to make hats for soppy women and then going home to old em and stew for dinner theres not much fun in it keith no i didnt mean to worry you by grizzling its too bad of me but seeing you and hearing that plan its made me remember how beastly i felt before your letter came this evening i was nearly mad with it id been mad before but never as bad as this was and then your letter cameand i wanted to come to you and i came and weve wasted such a lot of time not understanding each other even now i cant be sure you love menot sure i think you do but you only say so hows anyone ever to be sure unless they know it in their bones and ive been thinking about you every minute since we met because i never met anybody like you or loved anybody before she broke off her voice trembling her face against his breathless and exhausted iv now listen jenny said keith this is this i love you and you love me thats right isnt it well i dont care about marriagei mean a ceremony but you do so well be married when i come back in three months thats all right isnt it and when were married well either take your father with us whatever his healths like or well do something with him thatll do as well i should be ready to put him in somebodys care but you wouldnt like that i love him jenny said i couldnt leave him to somebody else for ever yes well you see theres nothing to be miserable about its all straightforward now nothingexcept that were going to be apart for three months now jen dont lets waste any more time being miserable but lets sit down and be happy for a bithows that jenny smiled and allowed him to bring her once again to the settee and to begin once more to describe their future life its cold there jenny not warm at all snow and ice and you wont see anybody for weeks and monthsanybody but just me and we shall have to do everything for ourselvesclothes housebuilding food catching and killing trim your own hats like the swiss family robinson only you wont have everything growing outside as they did and well go out in canoes if we go on the water at all and see indiansheap big man bacca sort of businessand perhaps hear wolves im not quite sure of that and go about on sledges with dogs to draw them but with all that we shall be free there wont be any bureaucrats to tyrannise over us no fashions no regulations no homemade laws to make dull boys of us just fancy jenny nobody to make us do anything nothing but our own needs and wishes i expect we shall tyranniseas you call itover each other jenny said shrewdly it seems to me thats what people do little wretch cried keith to interrupt with such a thing when i was just getting busy and eloquent i tell you therell be inconveniences youll find youll want somebody besides me to talk to and look after but then perhaps youll have somebody who asked jenny unsuspiciously not pa im sure keith held her away from him and looked into her eyes then he crushed her against him laughing it took jenny quite a minute to understand what he meant very dull arent you cried keith cant see beyond the end of your nose i shouldnt think it was hardly the sort of place for babies jenny sighed from what you say v keith roared with laughter so that the minerva seemed to shake in sympathy with his mirth youre priceless he said my bonny jenny i shouldnt think there was ever anybody like you in the world lots of girls jenny reluctantly suggested shaking a dolorous head at the ghost of a faded vanity im afraid she revived even as she spoke and encouragingly added perhaps not exactly like i dont believe it youre unique the one and only jenny redington red jennys colour flamed sounds nice she said and was then silent when were married went on keith watching her where shall we go for our honeymoon i say how would you like it if i borrowed the yacht from templecombe and ran you off somewhere in it i expect hed let me have the old minerva not a bad idea eh what when were married jenny said breathlessly very pale what dyou mean keiths eyes were so close to her own that she was forced to lower her lids when i come back from this trip templecombe says three months it may be less it may be more jenny had hardly the will to murmur her warningher distrust very unlikely unless the weathers bad im reckoning on a mild winter if its cold and stormy then of course yachtings out of the question but well be back before the winter any way and thendarling jennywell be married as soon as i can get the licence theres something for you to look forward to my sweet will you like to look forward to it jenny could feel his breath upon her face but she could not move or speak her breast was rising to quickened breathing her eyes were burning her mouth was dry when she moistened her lips she seemed to hear a cracking in her mouth it was as though fever were upon her so moved was she by the expression in keiths eyes she was neither happy nor unhappy but she was watching his face as if fascinated she could feel his arm so gently about her shoulder and his breast against hers and she loved him with all her heart she had at this time no thought of home only the thought that they loved each other and that keith would be away for three months facing dangers indeed but all the time loving her she thought of the future of that time when they both would be free when they should no longer be checked and bounded by the fear of not having enough food that was the thing jenny felt that kept poor people in dread of the consequences of their own acts and jenny felt that if they might live apart from the busy world enduring together whatever ills might come to them from their unsophisticated mode of life they would be able to be happy she thought that keith would have no temptations that she did not share no other men drawing him by imitativeness this way and that out of the true order of his own character no employer exacting in return for the weekly wage a servitude that was far from the blessed ideal of service jenny thought these things very simplyimpulsivelyand not in a form to be intelligible if set down as they occurred to her but the notions swam in her head along with her love for keith and her joy in the love which he returned she saw his dear face so close to her own and heard her own heart thumping vehemently quicker and quicker so that it sounded thunderously in her ears she could see keiths eyes so easily to be read showing out the impulses that crossed and possessed his mind love for her she was sure she read love and kindness for her and mystification and curiosity and the hot slumbering desire for her that made his breathing short and heavy in a dream she thought of these things and in a dream she felt her own love for keith rising and stifling her so that she could not speak but could only rest there in his arms watching that beloved face and storing her memory with its precious betrayals keith gently kissed her and jenny trembled a thousand temptations were whirling in her mindthoughts of his absence their marriage memory her love with an effort she raised her lips again to his kissing him in passion so that when he as passionately responded it seemed as though she fainted in his arms and lost all consciousness but that of her love and confidence in him and the eager desire of her nature to yield itself where love was given chapter x cinderella i through the darkness and into the brightness of the moons light the rolling notes of big ben were echoing and reechoing as each stroke followed and drove away the lingering waves of its predecessor and was in turn dispersed by the one that came after the sounds made the street noises sharper a mere rattle against the richness of the striking clock it was an hour that struck and the quarters were followed by twelve single notes midnight and jenny blanchard was still upon the minerva and emmy and alf had left the theatre and pa blanchard was alone in the little house in kennington park the silvered blackness of the minerva was disturbed a long streak of yellow light showed from the door leading into the cabin while yet the sounds of the clock hung above the river it became ghostly against the moonlight that bleached the deck a long greyyellow finger pointing the way to the yachts side jenny and keith made their way up the steps and to the deck and jenny shivered a little in the strong light her face was in shadow she hurried restored to sanity by the sounds and the thought of her father horror and selfblame were active in her mindnot from the fear of discovery but from shame at having for so long deserted him oh hurry jenny whispered as keith slipped over the side of the yacht into the waiting dinghy there was a silence and presently the heavy cludder of oars against the boats side jenny come along called keith from the water not now did jenny shrink from the running tide her one thought was to get home and she had no inclination to think of what lay between her and kennington park she hardly understood what keith said as he rowed to the steps she saw the bridge looming its black shadow cutting the water that sparkled so dully in the moonlight and then she saw the steps leading from the bridge to the rivers edge they were alongside she was ashore and keith was pressing her hand in parting still she could not look at him until she was at the top of the steps when she turned and raised her hand in farewell ii she knew she had to walk for a little way down the road in the direction of her home and then up a side street where she had been told that she would find the motor car awaiting her and for some seconds she could not bear the idea of speaking to the chauffeur from the sense that he must know exactly how long she had been on board the yacht the hesitation caused her to linger as the cold air had caused her to think it was as though she feared that when he was found the man would be impudent to her and leer behaving familiarly as he might have done to a common woman because she was alone and unprotected it was terrible her secret filled her with the sense of irremediable guilt already she was staled with the evenings excitement she stopped and wavered her shadow so black and small hesitating as she did could she walk home she looked at the black houses and listened to the terrifying sinister roar that continued faintly to fill the air could she go by tram if she didwhatever she didthe man might wait for her all night and keith would know how cowardly she had been it might even come to the ears of lord templecombe and disgrace keith before him to go or to stay was equally to bring acute distress upon herself the breathless shame of being thought disgraced for ever already it seemed to her that the shadows were peopled with observers ready to spy upon her to seize her to bear her away into hidden places at last her mind resolved by her fears which crowded upon her in a tumult jenny stepped fearfully forward the car was there dimly outlined a single light visible to her eye it was drawn upon at the side of the street and the chauffeur was fast asleep his head upon his arms and his arms spread upon the steeringwheel i say cried jenny in a panic her glance quickly over her shoulder at unseen dangers wake up wake up she stepped into the car and it began to quiver with life as the engine was started then as if drowned in the now familiar scent of the hanging bouquet jenny lay back once more in the soft cushions bound for home for emmy and alf and pa her evenings excursion at an end and only its sequel to endure part three morning chapter xi after the theatre i after leaving the house emmy and alf pressed along in the darkness alfs arm still surrounding and supporting emmy emmy still half jubilantly and half sorrowfully continuing to recognise her happiness and the smothered chagrin of her emotions she was not able to feel either happy or miserable but happiness was uppermost dislike of jenny had its place also for she could account for every weakness of alfs by reference to jennys baseness but indeed emmy could not think and could only passively and excitedly endure the conflicting emotions of the moment and alf did not speak but hurried her along as fast as his strong arm could secure her compliance with his own pace and they walked through the nightridden streets and full into the blaze of the theatre entrance without any words at all then when the staring vehemence of the electric lights whitened and shadowed her face emmy drew away casting down her eyes alarmed at the disclosures which the brilliance might devastatingly make she slipped from his arm and stood rather forlornly while alf fished in his pockets for the tickets with docility she followed him thrilled when he stepped aside in passing the commissionaire and took her arm together they went up the stairs the heavy carpets with their drugget covers silencing every step the gilded mirrors throwing their reflections backwards and forwards until the stairs seemed peopled with hosts of emmys and alfs as they drew near the closed doors of the circle the hush filling the staircases and vestibules of the theatre was intensified an aproned attendant seemed to emmys sensitiveness to look them up and down and superciliously to disapprove them she moved with indignation a dull murmur as of single voices disturbed the air somewhere behind the rustling attendant and when the doors were quickly opened emmy saw beyond the darkness and the intrusive flash of light caused by the opening doors a square of brilliance and a dashing figure upon the stage talking staccato those of the audience who were sitting near the doors turned angrily and with curiosity to view the newcomers and the voice that emmy had distinguished went more stridently on with a strong american accent in a flurry she found and crept into her seat trying to understand the play to touch alf to remove her hat to discipline her excitements and the staccato voice went on and on detailing a plan of some sort which she could not understand because they had missed the first five minutes of the play emmy could not tell that the actor was only pretending to be an american she could not understand why having spoken twenty words he must take six paces farther from the footlights until he had spoken thirteen more but she could and did feel most overwhelmingly exuberant at being as it were alone in that halfsilent multitude sitting beside alf their arms touching her head whirling her heart beating and a wholly exquisite warmth flushing her cheeks ii the first interval found the play well advanced a robbery had been plannedfor it was a crook playand the heroine had already received wildeyed the advances of a furcoated millionaire when the lights of the theatre popped up and members of the orchestra began once more unmercifully to tune their instruments it was possible to look round at the not especially large audience but in whichever direction emmy looked she was always brought back as by a magnet to alf who sat ruminantly beside her to alfs sidelong eye emmy was looking surprisingly lovely the tired air and the slightly peevish mouth to which he was accustomed had given place to the flush and sparkle of an excited girl alf was aware of surprise he blinked he saw the lines smoothed away from round her mouththe lines of weariness and dissatisfactionand was tempted by the softness of her cheek as he looked quickly off again he thought how full jenny would have been of comment upon the play how he would have sat grinning with precious enjoyment at her merciless gibes during the whole of the interval he had the sense of jenny as all movement as flashing and drawing him into quagmires of sensation like a willothewisp emmy was not like that she sat tremulously smiling humble before him diffident flattering she was intelligent that was it intelligent was the word not lively but restful critically he regarded her rather a nice girl emmy alf roused himself and looked around here miss he called and ssss when she did not hear him it was his way of summoning an attendant or a waitress ssss the attendant brought chocolates which alf handed rather magnificently to his companion he plunged into his pocketsin his roughandready muscular wayfor the money leaning far over the next seat which was unoccupied like some lemon he said to emmy together they inspected the box of chocolates which contained much imitationlace paper and a few sweets not half a sell grumbled alf to himself thinking of the shilling he had paid but he looked with gratification at emmys face as she enjoyingly ate the chocolates as her excitement a little strained her nervous endurance emmy began to pale under the eyes her eyes seemed to grow larger she lost the first air of sparkle but she became more pathetic poor little thing thought alf feeling masculine poor little thing shes tired poor little thing iii in the middle of this hot excitedlytalking audience they seemed to bask as in a warm pool of brilliant light the brilliants in the dome of the theatre intensified all the shadows heightened all the smiles illumined all the silken blouses and silver bangles the flashing eyes the general air of fete all right alf inquired protectively emmy looked in gratitude towards him lovely she said have another i meant you he persisted yourself i mean emmy smiled so happily that nobody could have been unmoved at the knowledge of having given such pleasure oh grand emmy said then her eyes contracted memory came to her the angry scene that had passed earlier returned to her mind hurting her and injuring her happiness alf hurried to engage her attention to distract her from thoughts that had in them such discomfort as she so quickly showed like the play i didnt quite follow what it was this old general had done to him did you hadnt he kept him from marrying emmy looked conscious for a moment marrying the right girl i didnt understand it either its only a play of course alf agreed see how that girls eyes shone when old furcoat went after her fair shone they did like lamps theyd got the limes on her you couldnt see them myermy friends the electrician here he says it drives him nearly crazy the way he has to follow her about in the third act she shes got some pluck he says the way she fights three of them singlehanded theyve all got revolvers shes got one but its not loaded lights a cigarette too with them all watching her ready to rush at her there said emmy admiringly she was thinking its only a play she gets hold of his fur coat and puts it on imitates his voice you can see its her all the time you know so could they if they looked a bit nearer however they dont i suppose there wouldnt be any play if they did emmy was not listening to him she was dreaming she was as gauche and simple in his company as a young girl would have been but her mind was different it was practical in its dreams and they had their disturbing unhappiness as well from the greater poignancy of her desire she was not a young girl to be agreeably fluttered and to pass on to the next admirer without a qualm she loved him blindly but painfully without the ease of young love but with all the sickness of first love and she had jealousy the feeling that she was not his first object to poison her feelings she could not think of jenny without tremors of anger and still for pain her thoughts went throbbing on about jenny whenever in happiness she had seen a home and alf and a baby and the other plain clear consequences of earning his loveof taking him from jenny and then the curtain rose the darkness fell and the orchestras tune slithered into nothing the play went on about the crook and the general and the millionaire and the heroine and all their curiously simpleminded friends and every moment something happened upon the stage from fights to thefts from kisses which those in the gallery not wholly absorbed by the play generously augmented to telephone calls plots speeches many speeches of irreproachable moral tone shoutings and sudden wild appeals to the delighted occupants of the gallery and emmy sat through it hardly heeding the uncommon events aware of them as she would have been aware of distant shouting her attention was preoccupied with other matters she had her own thoughts serious enough in themselves above all she was enjoying the thought that she was with alf and that their arms were touching and she was wondering if he knew that iv through another interval they sat with silent embarrassment the irreplaceable chocolates which had earlier been consumed having served their turn as a means of devouring attention alf was tempted to fly to the bar for a drink and composure but he did not like to leave emmy and he could not think of anything which could safely be said to her in the middle of this gathering of hot and radiant persons to speak in such uproar meant to shout he felt that every word he uttered would go echoing in rolls and rolls of sound out among the multitude they were not familiar enough to make that a matter of indifference to him he was in the stage of secretiveness and emmy after trying once or twice to open various small topics had fallen back upon her own thoughts and could invent nothing to talk about until the difficulties that lay between them had been removed her brow contracted she moved her shoulders or sat pressed reservedly against the back of her seat her voice whenever she did not immediately hear some word fall from alf became sharp and selfconsciousalmost managing it was a relief to both of them and in both the tension of sincere feeling had perceptibly slackened when the ignored orchestra gave way before the rising curtain again the two drew together in the darkness as all other couples were doing comforted by proximity and even by the unacknowledged mutual pleasure of it again they watched the extraordinary happenings upon the stage the fur coat was much used cigarettes were lighted and flung away with prodigal recklessness pistols were revealedone of them was even fired into the airand jumping trickling music heightened the effects of a number of strong speeches about love and incorruptibility and womanhood the climax was reached in the middle of the climax while yet the lover wooed and the villain died the audience began to rustle preparatory to going home even emmy was influenced to the extent of discovering and beginning to adjust her hat it was while she was pinning it with her elbows raised that the curtain fell both emmy and alf rose in the immediately successive reillumination of the theatre and emmy looked so pretty with her arms up and with the new hat so coquettishly askew upon her head and with a long hatpin between her teeth that alf could not resist the impulse to put his arm affectionately round her in leading the way out v and then once in the street he made no scruple about taking emmys arm within the crook of his as they moved from the staring whiteness of the theatre lamps out into the calmer moonshine it was eleven oclock the night was fine and the moon rode high above amid the twinkling stars when alf looked at emmys face it was transfigured in this beautiful light and he drew her gently from the direct way back to the little house dont lets go straight back he said stroll ull do us good very readily emmy obeyed his guidance her heart was throbbing but her brain was clear he wanted to be with her and the knowledge of that made emmy happier than she had been since early childhood its been lovely she said with real warmth of gratitude looking away from him with shyness hm growled alf in a voice of some confusion eryou dont go much to the theatre do you not much emmy agreed see theres pa he always looks to me yes alf could not add anything to that for a long time fine night he presently recorded dyou like a walk i mean im very fond of it a night like this mr blanchards all right i suppose oh yes shes there emmy could not bring herself to name jenny to him yet her mind was busy thinking of the earlier jar recomposing the details recalling the words that had passed memory brought tears into her eyes but she would not allow alf to see them and soon she recovered her selfcontrol it had to be spoken of the evening could not pass without reference to it or it would spoil everything alf would think of herhe was bound to think of heras a crying petulant jealous woman to whom he had been merely kind patronising even perhaps even the remembrance of it would prevent him from coming again to the house men like alf were so funny in that respect it took so little to displease them to drive them away altogether at last she ventured it was nice of you to take me alf fidgeted jerking his head and looking recklessly about him not at all he grumbled not tired are you emmy reassured him what i mean im very glad now look here em may as well have it out emmys heart gave a bound she walked mechanically beside him her head as stiffly held as though the muscles of her neck had been paralysed may as well erhave it out repeated alf thats how i ami like to be all shipshape from the start when i came along this evening i did mean to ask young jen to go with me that was quite as you thought i never thought youd you know care to come with me i dont know why but there it is i never meant to put it like i did in that way to have a fuss and upset anybody ive i mean shes been out with me halfadozen times and so i sort of naturally thought of her of course agreed emmy of course but i m glad you came alf said something in his honesty and the brusqueness of his rejoicing touched emmy and healed her first woundthe thought that she might have been unwelcome to him they went on a little way more at ease both ready for the next step in intimacy which was bound to be taken by one of them i thought she might have said something to youabout me not wanting to come emmy proceeded tentatively made you think i never wanted to go out alf shook his head emmy had there no opening for her resentment no he said with stubborn loyalty shes always talked very nice about you what does she say swiftly demanded emmy i forget saying you had a rough time at home saying it was rough on you that youre one of the best she said that gasped emmy its not like her to say that did she really shes so touchy about me generally sometimes the way she goes on anybodyd think i was the miserablest creature in the world and always on at her about something im not you know only she thinks it well i cant help it can i if you knew how i have to work in that house youd be surprised im always at it the way the dirt comes inyoud wonder where it all came from and see theres pa and all she doesnt take that into account she gets on all right with him but she isnt there all day like i am that makes a difference you know hes used to me shes more of a change for him alf was cordial in agreement he was seeing all the difference between the sisters in his heart there still lingered a sort of cherished enjoyment of jennys greater spirit secretly it delighted him like a forbidden joke he felt that jennyfor all that he must not at this moment mention her namekept him on the alert all the time so that he was ever in hazardous pursuit there was something fascinating in such excitement as she caused him he never knew what she would do or say next and while that disturbed and distressed him it also lacerated his vanity and provoked his admiration he admired jenny more than he could ever admire emmy but he also saw emmy as different from his old idea of her he had seen her trembling defiance early in the evening and that had moved him and made him a little afraid of her he had also seen her flushed cheeks at the theatre and emmy had grown in his eyes suddenly younger he could not have imagined her so cordial so youthful so interested in everything that met her gaze finally he found her quieter more amenable more truly wifely than her sister it was an important point in alfs eyes you had to take into accountif you were a man of common senserelative circumstances devil was all very well in courtship but mischief in a girl became contrariness in a domestic termagant that was an idea that was very much in alfs thoughts during this walk and it lingered there like acquired wisdom say shes going with a sailor he suddenly demanded so she told me ive never seen him she doesnt tell lies though i thought you said she did emmy flinched she had forgotten the words spoken in her wild anger and would have been ashamed to account for them in a moment of greater coolness i mean if she says hes a sailor thats true she told me he was on a ship i suppose she met him when she was away that time shes been very funny ever since not funnyrestless anything ive done for her shes made a fuss i give her a thorough good meal and oh theres such a fuss about it why dont we have ice creams and merangs and wine and grouse and sturgeon ph silly talk said alf in contemptuous wonder i mean to say oh well you know what flighty girls are hes probably a swankpot a steward or something of that sort i expect he has whats left over and talks big about it but shes got ideas like that in her head and she thinks shes too good for the likes of us its too much trouble to her to be pelite these days ive got the fair sick of it i can tell you and then shes always outsomebodys got to be at home just to look after pa and keep the fire in but jennyoh dear no shes no sooner home than shes out again cant rest says its stuffy indoors and off she goes i dont see her for hours well i dont know but if she doesnt quiet down a bit shell only be making trouble for herself later on she cant keep house you know she can scrub but she cant cook so very well or keep the place nice she hasnt got the patience you think shes doing the dusting and you find her groaning about what shed do if she was rich yes i tell her its all very well to do that but youd far better be doing something useful i say instead of wasting your time on idle fancies very sensible agreed alf completely absorbed in such a discourse shes trying you know you cant leave her for a minute she says im stodgy but i say its better to be practical than flighty dont you think so alf exackly said alf in a tone of the gravest assent exackly vi i mean pursued emmy you must have a little commonsense but shes been spoiltshes the youngest im a little older than she is wiser i say but she wont have it and pas always made a fuss of her really sometimes youd have thought she was a boy racing about my word such a commotion and then going out to the millinery and getting among a lot of other girls you dont know who they areif theyre ladies or not its not a good influence for her she ought to get out of it alf said to emmy it was a ghastly moment shell never give it up she hurriedly said you know its in her blood off she goes and they make a fuss of her she mimics everybody and they laugh at itthey think its funny to mimic people who cant help themselvesif they are a bit comic so she goes and when she does come home pas so glad to see a fresh face that he makes a fuss of her too and she stuffs him up with all sorts of talesthings that never happenedto keep him quiet she says it gives him something to think about well i suppose it does i expect you think im very unkind to say such things about my own sister but really i cant help seeing whats under my nose and i sometimes get soyou know worked up that i dont know how to hold myself she doesnt understand what it is to be cooped up indoors all day long like i am and it never occurs to her to say go along em you run out for a bit i have to say to her you be in for a bit jen and then she ptends shes always in and then theres a rumpus alf was altogether subdued by this account it had that degree of intimacy which when one is in a sentimental mood will always be absorbing he felt that he really was getting to the bottom of the mystery known to him as jenny blanchard the picture had verisimilitude he could see jenny as he listened he was seeing her with the close and searching eye of a sister as nearly true he thought as any vision could be once the thought i expect theres another story came sidling into his head but it was quickly drowned in further reminiscence from emmy so that it was clearly a dying desire that he left for jenny had jenny been there to fling her gage into the field alf might gapingly have followed her lost again in admiration of her more sparkling tongue and equipments but in such circumstances the arraigned party is never present if jenny had been there the tale could not have been told emmys virtuous and destructive monologue would not merely have been interrupted it would have been impossible jenny would have done all the talking the others all amaze would have listened with feelings appropriate to each though with feelings in common unpleasant to be borne i bet theres a rumpus alf agreed old jens not one to take a blow she ups and gets in the first one he couldnt help admiring jenny even yet so he hastened to pretend that he did not admire her out of a kind of tact but of course thats all very well for a bit of sport but it gets a bit wearisome after a time i know what you mean dont think ive been complaining about her emmy said i wouldnt really i wouldnt only i do think sometimes its not quite fair that she should have all the fun and me none of it i dont want a lot my tastes are very simple but when it comes to none at allwell alf what do you think its a bit thick admitted alf and thats a fact see shes always having her own way does just what she likes theres no holding her wants a man to do that ruminated alf with a half chuckle eh well said emmy a little brusquely i pity the man who tries it on vii emmy was not deliberately trying to secure from alf a proposal of marriage she was trying to show him the contrast between jenny and herself and to readjust the balances as he appeared to have been holding them she wanted to impress him she was as innocent of any other intention as any girl could have been it was jealousy that spoke not scheme and she was perfectly sincere in her depreciation of jenny she could not understand what it was that made the admiring look come into the faces of those who spoke to jenny nor why the unwilling admiration that started into her own heart should ever find a place there she was baffled by character and she was engaged in the common task of rearranging life to suit her own temperament they had been walking for some little distance now along deserted streets the moon shining upon them their steps softly echoing and emmys arm as warm as toast it was like a real lovers walk she could not help thinking half in the shadow and wholly in the stillness of the quiet streets she felt very contented and with her long account of jenny already uttered and her tough body already reanimated by the walk emmy was at leisure to let her mind wander among sweeter things there was love for example to think about and when she glanced sideways alfs shoulder seemed such a little distance from her cheek and his hand was lightly clasping her wrist a strong hand was alfs with a broad thumb and big capable fingers she could see it in the moonlight and she had suddenly an extraordinary longing to press her cheek against the back of alfs hand she did not want any silly nonsense she told herself and the tears came into her eyes and her nose seemed pinched and tickling with the cold at the mere idea of any nonsense but she could not help longing with the most intense longing to press her cheek against the back of alfs hand that was all she wanted nothing more but that desire thrilled her she felt that if it might be granted she would be content altogether happy she wanted so little and as if alf too had been thinking of somebody nearer to him than jenny he began i dont know if youve ever thought at all about me em but your saying what youve done about yourself its made me think a bit im all on my own nowhave been for years but the way i live isnt good for anyone its a fact its not i mean to say my rooms that ive got theyre not big enough to swing a cat in and the way the old girl at my place serves up the meals is a fair knockout if you notice things like i do if i think of her and then about the way you do things it gives me the hump everything you dos so nice but with herthe plates have still got bits of yesterdays mustard on them and all fluffy from the dishcloth not washed proply emmy interestedly remarked thats what that is exackly and the meats raw inside cooks it too quickly and when i have a bloater for my breakfastim partial to a bloaterits black outside as if it was done in the cinders and then insidewell i like them done all through like any other man then i cant get her to get me gammon rashers she will get these little tiddy rashers with little white bones in them why while youre cutting them out the bacon gets cold you may think im fussy fiddly with my food im not really only i like it of course you do emmy said shes not interested thats what it is she thinks anythings food and some people dont mind at all what they eat they dont notice no i do if you go to a restaurant you get it different you get more of it too well what with one thing and another ive got very fed up with madame bucks its all dirty and half baked theres great holes in the carpet of my sittingroomholes you could put your foot through and ive done that as a matter of fact put my foot through and nearly gone over should have done only for the table well i mean to say you cant help being fed up with it but she knows where i work and i know shes hard up so i dont like to go anywhere else because if anybody asked me if he should go there i couldnt honestly recommend him to and yet you see how it is i shouldnt like to leave her in the lurch if she knew i was just gone somewhere else down the street no sympathetically agreed emmy i quite see its very awkward for you though its no use being too kindhearted with these people because they dont appreciate it and if you dont say anything they just go on in the same way never troubling themselves about you they think as long as you dont say anything youre all right and its not their place to make any alteration theyre quite satisfied look at jenny and me is she satisfied asked alf with herself she is shes never satisfied with me she never tries to see it from my point of view no alf nodded his head wisely thats what it is they dont he nodded again isnt it a lovely night ventured emmy see the moon over there they looked up at the moon and the stars and the unfathomable sky it took them at once away from the streets and the subject of their talk both sighed as they stared upwards lost in the beauty before them and when at last their eyes dropped the street lamps had become so yellow and tawdry that they were like stupid spangles in contrast with the stars alf still held emmys arm so snugly within his own and her wrist was within the clasp of his fingers it was so little a thing to slide his fingers into a firm clasp of her hand and they drew closer lovely eh alf ejaculated with a further upward lift of his eyes emmy sighed again not like down here she soberly said no its different down heres all right though alf assured her dont you think it is he gave a rather nervous little half laugh dont you think it is grand emmy agreed with the slightest hint of dryness i say it was awfully good of you to come tonight said alf ive youve enjoyed it havent you he was looking sharply at her and emmys face was illumined he saw her soft cheeks her thin soft little neck he felt her warm gloved hand within his own dyou mind he asked and bent abruptly so that their faces were close together for a moment feeling so daring that his breath caught alf could not carry out his threat then roughly he pushed his face against hers kissing her quickly he released emmys arm so that his own might be more protectingly employed and they stood embraced in the moonlight viii it was only for a minute for emmy with instinctive secrecy drew away into the shadow at first alf did not understand and thought himself repelled but emmys hands were invitingly raised the first delight was broken one more sensitive might have found it hard to recapture but alf stepped quickly to her side in the shadow and they kissed again he was surprised at her passion he had not expected it and the flattery was welcome he grinned a little in the safe darkness consciously and even sheepishly but with eagerness they were both clumsy and a little trembling not very practised lovers but curious and excited emmy felt her hat knocked a little sideways upon her head it was emmy who moved first drawing herself away from him she knew not why where you going asked alf detaining her what is it too rough am i he could not see emmys shaken head and was for a moment puzzled at the ways of womanso far from his grasp no emmy said its wonderful peering closely alf could see her eyes shining dyou think youre fond enough of me emmy she demurred thats a nice thing to say as if it was for me to tell you she whispered archly back what ought i to say im not mean to say i dont know how to say things emmy youll have to put up with my rough ways give us a kiss old sport how many more you are a one emmy was not pliant enough in her voice there was the faintest touch ofsomething that was not selfconsciousness that was perhaps a sense of failure perhaps she was back again suddenly into her maturity finding it somehow ridiculous to be kissed and to kiss with such abandon alf was not baffled however as she withdrew he advanced so that his knuckle rubbed against the brick wall to which emmy had retreated i say he cried sharply heres the wall hurt yourself emmy quickly caught his hand and raised it examining the knuckle the skin might have been roughened but no blood was drawn painfully exultingly her dream realised she pressed her cheek against the back of his hand ix whats that for demanded alf nothing never you mind i wanted to do it emmys cheeks were hot as she spoke but alf marvelled at the action and at her confession of such an impulse how long had you wanted to do it mind your own business the idea dont you know better than that emmy asked it made him chuckle delightedly to have such a retort from her and it stimulated his curiosity i believe youre a bit fond of me he said i dont see why theres nothing about me to write home about i shouldnt think but there it is loves a wonderful thing is it asked emma distantly why couldnt he say he loved her too proud was he or was he shy he had only used the word love once and that was in this general senseas though there was such a thing emmy was shy of the word too but not as shy as that she was for a moment anxious because she wanted him to say the word or some equivalent if it was not said she was dependent upon his charity later and would cry sleeplessly at night for want of sureness of him dyou love me she suddenly said alf whistled he seemed for that instant to be quite taken aback by her inquiry theres no harm in me asking i suppose into emmys voice there came a thread of roughness no harm at all alf politely said not at all he continued to hesitate well emmy waited still in his arms her ears alert were engaged arent we alf muttered shamefacedly erum what sort of ring would you like i dont say youll get it and its too late to go and choose one tonight emmy flushed again he felt her tremble you are in a hurry she said too much moved for her archness to take effect yes i am alfs quick answer was reassuring enough emmys heart was eased she drew him nearer with her arms about his neck and they kissed again i wish youd say you love me she whispered mean such a lot to me no cried alf incredulously really do you ill think about it do youme yes i dont mind saying it if you will alf gave a little whistle to himself half under his breath he looked carefully to right and left and up at the housewall against which they were standing nobody seemed to be in danger of making him feel an abject fool by overhearing such a confession as he was invited to make and yet it was such a terrible matter he was confronted with a difficulty of difficulties he looked at emmy and knew that she was waiting entreating him with her shining eyes er said alf reluctantly and with misgiving er well i a suppose i do emmy gave a little cry that was half a smothered laugh of happiness at her triumph it was not bad she had made him admit it on the first evening later when she was more at ease he should be more explicit x well said alf instantly regretting his admission and inclined to bluster now i suppose youre satisfied awfully breathed emmy youre a dear good soul youre splendid alf for a few minutes more they remained in that benign unforgettable shadow and then very slowly with alfs arm about emmys waist and emmys shoulder so confidingly against his breast they began to return homewards both spoke very subduedly and tried to keep their shoes from too loudly striking the pavement as they walked and the wandering wind came upon them in glee round every corner and rustled like a busybody among all the consumptive bushes in the front gardens they passed sounds carried far a long way away they heard the tramcars grinding along the main road but here all was hush and the beating of two hearts in unison and to both of them happiness lay ahead their aims were similar in no point jarring or divergent both wanted a home and loving labour and quiet evenings of pleasant occupation to both the daily work came with regularity not as an intrusion or a wrong to manhood and womanhood it was inevitable and was regarded as inevitable neither emmy nor alf ever wondered why they should be working hard when the sun shone and the day was fine neither compared the lot accorded by station with an ideal fortune of blessed ease they were not temperamentally restless they both thought with a practical sense that is as convenient as it is generally accepted somebody must do the work may as well be me no discontent would be theirs and alf was a good worker at the bench a sober and honest man and emmy could make a pound go as far as any other woman in kennington park they had before them a faithful future of work in common of ideals workaday ideals in common and at this instant they were both marvellously content with the immediate outlook not for them to change the order of the world i feel its so suitable emmy startlingly said in a hushed tone as they walked your you know supposing you do me and me doing the same for you alf looked solemnly round at her his emmy skittish it was not what he had thought still it diverted him and he ambled in pursuit yes he darkly said what do you suppose you do for me why love you emmy hurried to explain trapping herself by speed into the use of the tabooed word didnt you know though it seems funny to say it like that its so new ive never dared to you know say it i mean were both of us quiet and reliable were not either of us flighty i mean thats why i think we suit each otherbetter than if wed been different not like we are im sure we do alf said not like some people you cant help wondering to yourself however they came to get married they seem so unlike dont they its funny ah well loves a wonderful thingas you say she turned archly to him encouragingly you seem happy remarked alf in a critical tone but he was not offended only tingled into desire for her by the strange gleam of merriment crossing her natural seriousness the jubilant note of happy consciousness that the evenings lovemaking had bred alf drew her more closely to his side increasingly sure that he had done well she was beginning to intrigue him with an emotion that startled himself as much as it delighted emmy he said thickly in her ear dyou love me like this xi they neared the road in which the blanchards lived emmy began to press forward as alf seemed inclined to loiter in the neighbourhood the church that had struck eight as they left the house began once again to record an hour by george cried alf twelve midnight they could feel the day pass they were at the corner beside the little chandlers shop which advertised to the moon its varieties of tea and alf paused once again half a tick he said no hurry is there youll come in for a bit of supper emmy urged then plumbing his hesitation she went on in a voice that had steel somewhere in its depths theyll both be gone to bed she wont be there oh i wasnt thinking of that alf declared with unconvincing nonchalance ill give you a drop of pas beer emmy said drily she took out a key and held it up for his inspection i say alf pretended to be surprised at the sight of a key quite a big girl arent i well you see there are two and pa never goes out so we have one each saves a lot of bother as she spoke emmy was unlocking the door and entering the house see you can have supper with me and then it wont seem so far to walk home and you can throw madame bucks rinds at the back of the fire youll like that and so will she alf now perfectly docile and even thrilled with pleasure at the idea of being with her for a little while longer followed emmy into the passage where the flickering gas showed too feeble a light to be of any service to them between the two walls they felt their way into the house and alf softly closed the door hang your hat and coat on the stand whispered emmy and went tiptoeing forward to the kitchen it was in darkness oo she is a monkey shes let the fire out emmy continued in the same whisper have you got a match the gas is out she opened the kitchen door wide and stood there taking off her hat while alf fumbled his way along the passage be quick she said alf pretended not to be able to find the matches so that he might give her a hearty kiss in the darkness he was laughing to himself because he had only succeeded in his random venture in kissing her chin and then when she broke away with a smothered protest and a half laugh he put his hand in his pocket again for the matchbox the first match fizzed along the box as it was struck and immediately went out oh do hurry up cried emmy in a whisper thinking he was still sporting with her dont keep on larking about alf im not indignantly answered the delinquent it wouldnt strike half a tick he moved forward in the darkness to be nearer the gas and as he took the step his foot caught against something upon the floor he exclaimed now what is it demanded emmy for answer alf struck his match and they both looked at the floor by alfs feet emmy gave a startled cry and dropped to her knees hullo said alf and with his lighted match raised he moved to the gas stepping as he did so over the body of pa blanchard which was lying at full length across the kitchen floor chapter xii consequences i in the succeeding quietness emmy fumbled at the old mans hands then quickly at his breast near the heart trembling violently she looked up at alf as if beseeching his aid he too knelt and emmy took pas lolling head into her lap as though by her caress she thought to restore colour and life to the features the two discoverers did not speak nor reason they were wholly occupied with the moments horror at last alf said almost in a whisper i think its all right hes hit his head feel his head and see if its bleeding emmy withdrew one hand a finger was faintly smeared with blood she shuddered looking in horror at the colour against her hand and alf nodded sharply at seeing his supposition verified his eye wandered from the insensible body to a chair to the open cupboard to the topmost shelf of the cupboard emmy followed his glance point by point and in conclusion they looked straight into each others eyes with perfect understanding alfs brows arched get some waterquick emmy cried sharply she drew her handkerchief from her breast as alf returned with a jugful of water and having folded it she dangled the kerchief in the jug slap it on urged alf he cant feel it you know so instructed emmy first of all turned pas head to discover the wound and saw that her skirt was already slightly stained by the oozing blood with her wetted handkerchief she gently wiped the blood from pas hair it was still quite moist and more blood flowed at the touch that fact made her realise instinctively that the accident the stages of which had been indicated by alfs wandering glances had happened within a few minutes of their arrival when alf took the jug and threw some of its contents upon the old mans grey face splashing her she made an impatient gesture of protest no no she cried its all over me been after his beer he has alf unnecessarily explained thats what it is got up on the chair and fell off it trying to get at it bad boy as she did not answer from the irritation caused by nervous apprehensiveness he soaked his own handkerchief and began to slap it across pas face until the jug was empty alf thoughtfully sprinkled the last drops from it so that they fell cascading about pa he was turning away to refill the jug when a notion occurred to him any brandy in the house he asked ought to have thought of it before pubs are all closed now see if theres any up there emmy pointed vaguely upwards she was bent over pa gently wiping the trickles of water from his ghastly face caressing with her wet handkerchief the closed eyes and the furrowed brow alf climbed upon the chair from which pa had fallen and reached his hand round to the back of the high shelf feeling for whatever was there with her face upturned emmy watched and listened she heard a very faint clink as if two small bottles had been knocked together and then a little dump as if one of them had fallen over glory said alf still in the low voice that he had used earlier believe ive got it got it is there any in it emmy at the same instant was asking alf was sniffing at the little bottle which he had withdrawn from the cupboard he then descended carefully from the chair and held the uncorked bottle under her nose for a corroborative sniff it was about half full of brandy satisfied he knelt as before now trying however to force pas teeth apart and rubbing some of the brandy upon the parted lips thisll do it alf cheerfully and reassuringly cried half a tick ill get some water to wet his head again he stumbled once more out into the scullery and the careful emmy unconsciously flinched as she heard the jug struck hard in the darkness against the tap her eye was fixed upon the jug as it was borne brimming and splashing back to her side she could not help feeling such housewifely anxiety even amid the tremors of her other acute concern as alf knelt he lavishly sprinkled some more water upon pas face and set the jug ready to emmys hand working with a quiet deftness that aroused her watchful admiration he was here neither clumsy nor rough if his methods were as primitive as the means at hand his gentle treatment of the senseless body showed him to be adaptable to an emergency how she loved him pride gleamed in emmys eyes she could see in him the eternal handyman of her delight made for husbandhood and as clearly without nonsense as any working wife could have wished pas nightshirt was blackened with great splashes of water and the soaked parts clung tightly to his breast at the neck it was already open and they both thought they could see at this moment a quick contraction of the throat an additional augury was found in the fact that alf simultaneously had succeeded in dribbling some of the brandy between pas teeth and although some of it ran out at the corners of his mouth and out on to his cheeks some also was retained and would help to revive him alf gave another quick nod this time one of satisfaction feel his heart emmy whispered he did so can you feel it its all right famous pa gave a little groan he seemed to stir emmy felt his shoulders move against her knees and she looked quickly up a faint relieved smile crossing her anxious face then as alf returned her glance his eyes became fixed and he looked beyond her and up over her head jenny stood in the doorway fully dressed but without either hat or coat her face blanched at the picture before her ii to jenny coming with every precautionary quietness into the house the sight came as the greatest shock she found the kitchen door ajar heard voices and then burst upon the three feebly illumined figures emmy still in her outofdoors coat knelt beside alf upon the floor and between them with a face terribly grey lay pa still in his old red nightshirt with one of his bare feet showing the stained shirt upon which the marks of water looking in this light perfectly black might have been those of blood filled jenny with horror it was only when she saw both emmy and alf staring mutely at her that she struggled against the deadly faintness that was thickening a veil of darkness before her eyes it was a dreadful moment hullo jen alf said look here i thought you must be in bed emmy murmured isnt it awful not a suspicion her heart felt as if somebody had sharply pinched it they did not know she had been out it made her tremble in a sudden flurry of excited relief she quickly came forward bending over pa into his cheeks there had come the faintest wash of colour his eyelids fluttered jenny stooped and took his hand quite mechanically pressing it between hers and against her heart and at that moment pas eyes opened wide and he stared up at her with alf at his side and emmy behind him supporting his head upon her lap pa could see only jenny and a twitching grin fled across his facea grin of loving recognition it was succeeded by another sign of recovery a peculiar fumbling suggestion of remembered cunning jenny my dearie whispered pa gaspingly a good boy his eyes closed again emmy looked in quick challenge at alf as if to say you see how it is she comes in last and its her luck that he should see her always the same and jenny was saying very low it looks to me as if youd been a bad boy cant be with him all the time emmy put in having reached a point of general selfdefence in the course of her mental explorations she was recovering from her shock and her first horrible fears shall we get him to bed carry him back in there jenny asked the floors soaking wet she had not to receive any rebuke emmy although shaken was reviving in happiness and in graciousness with each seconds diminution of her dread she now agreed to pas removal and they all stumbled into his bedroom and laid him upon his own bed alf went quickly back again to the kitchen for the brandy and presently a good dose of this was sending its thrilling and reviving fire through pas person emmy had busied herself in making a bandage for his wounded head and jenny had arranged him more comfortably drying his chest and laying a little towel between his body and the nightshort lest he should take cold pa was very complacently aware of these ministrations and by the time they were in full order completed he was fast asleep having expressed no sort of contrition for his naughtiness or for the alarm he had given them all reassured the party returned to the kitchen iii alf could not now wait to sit down to supper but he drank a glass of beer after getting it down for himself and rather humorously illustrating how pas designs must have been frustrated he then with a quick handshake with jenny hurried away ill let you out emmy said there were quick exchanged glances jenny was left alone in the kitchen for two or three minutes until emmy returned humming a little selfconsciously and no longer pale quite a commotion said emmy with assumed ease jenny was looking at her and jennys heart felt as though it were bursting she had never in her life known such a sensation of guiltguilt at the suppression of a vital fact yet above that sense of guilt which throbbed within all her consciousness was a more superficial concern with the happenings of the moment yes jenny said and had you been in long she asked quickly only a minute we found him like that we didnt come straight home oh said jenny significantly though her heart was thudding you didnt come straight home emmys colour rose still higher she faltered slightly and tears appeared in her eyes she could not explain some return of her jealousy some feeling of what jenny would think checked her the communication must be made by other means than words the two sisters eyed each other they were very near and emmys lids were the first to fall jenny stepped forward and put a protective arm round her and as if emmy had been waiting for that she began smiling and crying at one and the same moment looks to me as if jenny went on after this exchange im sorry i was a beast emmy said im as different as anything now youre a dear jenny assured her never mind about what you said it was an expansive moment their hearts were charged to both the evening had been the one poignant moment of their lives an evening to provide reflections for a thousand other evenings and emmy was happy for the first time for many days with the thought of happy life before her she described in detail the events of the theatre and the walk she did not give an exactly true story it was not to be expected that she would do so jenny did not expect it she gave indications of her happiness which was her main object and she gave further indications less intentional of her character as no author can avoid doing and jenny immediately discounting and in the light of her own temperament reshaping and reproportioning the form of emmys narrative was like the eternal criticapprehending only what she could personally recognise but both took pleasure in the tale and both saw forward into the future a very satisfactory ending to emmys romance and we got back just as twelve was striking emmy concluded a deep flush overspread jennys face she turned away quickly in order that it might not be seen emmy still continued busy with her thoughts it occurred to her to be surprised that jenny should be fully dressed the surprise pressed her further onward with the narrative and then of course we found pa wasnt it strange of him to do it he couldnt have been there long he must have waited for you to go up he must have listened i must find another place to keep it though hes never done such a thing before in his life he must have listened for you going up and then come creeping out here why theres his candle on the floor fancy that might have set fire to the whole house see you couldnt have been upstairs long i thought you must have been seeing the fire was black out did you go to sleep in front of it i thought you might have laid a bit of supper for us i thought you would have but if you were asleep i dont wonder i thought youd have been in bed hours did you hear anything he must have made a racket falling off the chair what made you come down again pa must have listened like anything i didnt come down jenny said in a slow passionless voice i hadnt gone to bed i was out id been out all the evening since quartertonine iv at first emmy could not understand she stood puzzled unable to collect her thoughts jenny at last she said unbelievingly accusing impulses showed in her face the softer mood just passing was replaced by one of anger well i must say its like you emmy concluded im not to have a moment out of the house i cant even leave you halfanhour after youd gone urged jenny i got a note from keith keith it was emmys sign that she had noted the name i told you hed only got the one evening in london couldnt he have come here he mustnt leave his ship i didnt know what to do at first i thought i couldnt go but the man was waiting man cried emmy what man the chauffeur emmys face changed her whole manner changed she was outraged jenny is he that sort oh i warned you theres never any good in it hell do you no good hes a captain of a little yacht hes not what you think jenny protested very pale her heart sinking under such a rebuke under such knowledge as she alone possessed still to go to him emmy was returned to that aspect of the affair and leave pa i know i know jenny cried she was no longer protective she was herself in need of comfort but i had to go youd have gone yourself she met emmys gaze steadily but without defiance no i shouldnt it was emmy who became defiant emmys jealousy was again awake however much i wanted to go i should have stayed and lost him jenny cried are you sure of him now asked emmy swiftly if hes gone again with her cheeks crimson jenny turned upon her sister yes im sure of him and i love him i love him as much as you love alf she had the impulse almost irresistible to add more but she restrained her tongue just in time that was a possibility emmy could never admit it was only that they were different but to leave pa emmys bewildered mind went back to what was the real difficulty jenny protested he was in bed i thought hed be safe he was tucked up supposing i hadnt gone supposing id gone up to bed an hour ago still hed have done the same you know he wouldnt emmy said very quietly jenny felt a wave of hysteria pass through her it died down she held herself very firmly it was true she knew that she was only defending herself i dont know she said in a false aggrieved voice how do i know you do he knew you were out he very likely woke up and felt frightened felt thirsty more like it jenny exclaimed well you did wrong emmy said however you like to put it to yourself you did wrong i always manage to dont i jennys speech still was without defiance she was humble its a funny thing but its true you always want to go your own way emmy reproved oh i dont think thats wrong hastily said jenny why should you go anybody elses way i dont know admitted emmy but its safer whose way do you go jenny had stumbled upon a question so unanswerable that she was at liberty to answer it for herself i dont know whose way you go now but i do know whose way youll go soon youll go alfs way well demanded emmy if its a good way well i go keiths way jenny answered in a fine glow and he goes mine emmy looked at her shaking her head in a kind of narrow wisdom not if he sends a chauffeur she said slowly not that sort of man v for a moment jennys heart burned with indignation then it turned cold if emmy were right supposingjust supposing savagely she thrust doubt of keith from her her trust in him was forced by dread into still warmer and louder proclamation you dont understand she cried you couldnt youve never seen him wait a minute she went quickly out of the kitchen and up to her bedroom there secretly kept from every eye was the little photograph of keith she brought it down in anxious triumph she showed it to emmy emmys three years seniority had never been of so much account there jenny said thats keith look at him emmy held the photograph under the meagre light she was astonished although she kept outwardly calm because keithbesides being obviously what is called a gentlemanlooked honest and candid she could not find fault with the face hes very goodlooking she admitted in a critical tone very not the sort of man you thought emphasised jenny keenly elated at emmys dilemma is he has he got any money never asked him noi dont think he has it wasnt his chauffeur a lords there he knows lords oh jenny emmys tone was still one of warning he wont marry you im sure he wont yes he will jenny said confidently but the excitement had shaken her and she was not the firm jenny of custom she looked imploringly at emmy say you believe it she begged emmy returned her urgent gaze and felt jennys arm round her their two faces were very close youd have done the same jenny urged something in her tone awakened a suspicion in emmys mind she tried to see what lay behind those glowing mysteries that were so close to hers her own eyes were shining as if from an inner brightness the sisters so unlike so inexpressibly contrary in every phase of their outlook in every small detail of their history had this in commonthat each in her own manner and with the consequences drawn from differences of character and aim had spent happy hours with the man she loved what was to follow remained undetermined but emmys heart was warmed with happiness she was for the first time filled only with impulses of kindness and love for jenny she would blame no more for jennys desertion it was just enough since the consequences of that desertion had been remedied to enhance emmys sense of her own superiority there remained only the journey taken by jenny she again took from her sisters hand the little photograph alfs face seemed to come between the photograph and her careful poring scrutiny more the jealous scrutiny of a mother than that of a sister hes rather thin emmy ventured dubiously what colour are his eyes blue and his hairs brown hes lovely he looks nice emmy said relenting he is nice em dear say youd have done the same emmy gave jenny a great hug kissing her as if jenny had been her little girl to emmy the moment was without alloy her own future assured all else fell into the orderly picture which made up her view of life but she was not quite calm and it even surprised her to feel so much warmth of love for jenny still holding her sister she was conscious of a quick impulse that was both exulting and pathetically shy its funny us both being happy at once isnt it she whispered all sparkling vi to herself jenny groaned a sufficient retort i dont know that im feeling so tremendously happy my own self she thought for the reaction had set in she was glad enough to bring about by various movements their longdelayed bedward journey she was beginning to feel that her head and her heart were both aching and that any more confidences from emmy would be unbearable and where emmy had grown communicativesince emmy had nothing to concealjenny had felt more and more that her happiness was staled as thought corroded it by the time they turned out the kitchen gas the clock pointed to twenty minutes past two and the darkest hour was already recorded in three more hours the sun would rise and jenny knew that long before then she would see the sky greying as though the successive veils of the transformation were to reveal the crystal grotto she preceded emmy up the stairs carrying a candle and lighting the way at the top of the staircase emmy would find her own candle and they would part they were now equally eager for the separation emmy because she wanted to think over and over again the details of her happiness and to make plans for a kind of life that was to open afresh in days that lay ahead arrived at the landing the sisters did not pause or kiss but each looked and smiled seriously as she entered her bedroom with the closing of the doors noise seemed to depart from the little house though jenny heard emmy moving in her room the house was in darkness emmy was gone pa lay asleep in the dim light his head bandaged and the water slowly soaking into the towel protectively laid upon his chest in the kitchen the ailing clock ticked away the night everything seemed at peace but jenny who when she had closed the door and set her candle down went quickly to the bed sitting upon its edge and looking straight before her with dark and sober eyes she had much to think of she would never forgive herself now for leaving pa it might have been a more serious accident that had happened during her absence she could even plead to emmy that the accident might have happened if she had not left the house at all but nothing her quick brain could urge had really satisfied jenny the stark fact remained that she had been there under promise to tend pa and that she had failed in her acknowledged trust he might have died if he had died she would have been to blame not pa he couldnt help himself he was driven by inner necessity to do things which he must not be allowed to do jenny might have pleaded the same justification she had done so before this it had been a necessity to her to go to keith as far as that went she did not question the paramount power of impulse not will but the strongest craving had led her jenny could perhaps hardly discourse learnedly upon such things she must follow the dictates of her nature but she never accused pa of responsibility he was an irresponsible she had been left to look after him she had not stayed and ill had befallen a bitter smile curved jennys lips i suppose theyd say it was a punishment she whispered theyd like to think it was after that she stayed a long time silent swaying gently while her candle flickered her head full of a kind of formless musing then she rose from the bed and took her candle so that she could see her face in the small mirror upon the dressingtable the candle flickered still more in the draught from the open window and jenny saw her breath hang like a cloud before her in the mirror her face looked deadly pale and her lips were slightly drawn as if she were about to cry dark shadows were upon her face whether real or the work of the feeble light she did not think to question she was looking straight at her own eyes black with the dilation of pupil and somehow struck with the horror which was her deepest emotion jenny was speaking to the girl in the glass i shouldnt have thought it of you she was saying you come out of a respectable home and you do things like this silly little fool you are silly little fool because you cant stand his not loving you you go and do that for a moment she stopped turning away her lip bitten her eyes veiled oh but he does love me she breathed quite as much quite as much nearly nearly as much she sighed deeply standing lone in the centre of the room her long thin shadow thrown upon the wall in front of her and to leave pa she was thinking and shaking her head that was wrong when id promised i shall always know it was wrong i shall never be able to forget it as long as i live not as long as i live and if i hadnt gone id never have seen keith againnever hed have gone off and my heart would have broken i should have got older and older and hated everybody hated pa most likely and now i just hate myself oh its so difficult she moved impatiently and at last went back to the mirror not to look into it but to remove the candle to blow it out and to leave the room in darkness this done jenny drew up the blind so that she could see the outlines of the roofs opposite it seemed to her that for a long distance there was no sound at all only there all the time far behind all houses somewhere buried in the heart of london there was the same unintermittent low growl it was always in her ears even at night like a sleepless pulse beating steadily through the silences jenny was not happy her heart was cold she continued to look from the window her face full of gravity she was hearing again keiths voice as he planned their future but she was not sanguine now it all seemed too far away and so much had happened so much had happened that seemed as though it could never be realised never be a part of memory at all so blank and sheer did it now stand pressing upon her like overwhelming darkness she thought again of the bridge and the striking hours the knock the letter the hurried ride she remembered her supper and the argument with emmy the argument with alf and her fleeting moods so many so painful during her time with keith to love to be loved that was her sole commandment of lifehow learned she knew not to love and to work she knew was the theory of emmy but how different they were how altogether unlike emmy with alf jenny with keith yes but shes got what she wants jenny whispered in the darkness thats what she wants it wouldnt do for me only in this world youve all got to have one pattern whether it suits you or not else youre not right they dont like it and im outside im a misfit eh well its no good whimpering about it what must be must as they say soberly she moved from the window and began to undress in the darkness stopping every now and then as if she were listening to that low humming far beyond the houses when the thought of unresting life made her heart beat more quickly away there upon the black running current of the river was keith on that tiny yacht so open upon the treacherous sea to every kind of danger and nothing between keith and sudden horrible death but that wooden hulk and his own seamanship she was keiths she belonged to him but he did not belong to her to keith she might she would give all as she had done but he would still be apart from her he might give his love his care but she knew that her pride and her love must be the love and pride to submitnot keiths away from him released from the spell jenny knew that she had yielded to him the freedom she so cherished as her inalienable right she had given him her freedom it was in his power for her real freedom was her innocence and her desire to do right it was not that she wanted to defy so much as that she could bear no shackles and that she had no respect for the belief that things should be done only because they were always done and for no other reason but that of tradition and she feared nothing but her own merciless judgment it was not now that she dreaded emmys powerlessness to forgive her or the opinion of anybody else in the world it was that she could not forgive herself those who are strong enough to live alone in the world so long as they are young and vigorous have this rare faculty of selfjudgment it is only when they are exhausted that they turn elsewhere for judgment and pardon jenny sat once again upon the bed oh keith my dearest she began my keith her thoughts flew swiftly to the yacht to keith with unforgettable pain she heard his voice ringing in her ears saw his clear eyes as honest as the day looking straight into her own pain mingled with love and pride and battled there within her heart making a fine tumult of sensation and jenny felt herself smiling in the darkness at such a conflict she even began very softly to laugh but as if the sound checked her and awoke the secret sadness that the tumultuous sensations were trying to hide her courage suddenly gave way keith she gently called her voice barely audible only silence was there keith was far awayunreachable jenny pressed her hands to her lips that were trembling uncontrollably she rose struggling for composure struggling to get back to the old way of looking at everything it seemed imperative that she should do so in a forlorn quivering voice she ventured what a life golly what a life but the effort to pretend that she could still make fun of the events of the evening was too great for jenny she threw herself upon the bed burying her face in the pillow keith oh keith the end
