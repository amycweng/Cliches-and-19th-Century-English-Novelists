coming of sargon king of kings chapter the first the early life of mr preemby this is the story of a certain mr preemby a retired laundryman and widower who abandoned his active interest in the limpid stream laundry in the parish of saint simon unawares near woodford wells upon the death of his wife in the year of grace some very remarkable experiences came to him the story is essentially a contemporary story it is a story of london in the age of sir arthur conan doyle broadcasting and the first labour peers the historical element in it is insignificant and partly erroneous and the future though implicitly present is substantially ignored since washing in london like the milk trade and baking and the linen drapery and various other branches of commerce is something rather specialized and hereditary and a little difficult towards outsiders it is necessary to explain that mr preemby was not a laundryman born he had little of the spirit and go of a true london laundryman he married into laundrying he met a miss hossett at sheringham in an heiress and a young lady of great decision of character he wooed and won her and married her as you will be told almost without realizing what he was doing the hossetts are big people in the laundry world and the limpid stream concern which presently fell into the capable hands of mrs preemby was only one of a series of related and sympathetic businesses in the north north east and south west districts of london mr preemby as miss hossetts family came to recognize quite frankly and explicitly at a very early stage derived from a less practical strain than his wife his father had been an artist of considerable charm and unpunctuality a photographic artist who resided at sheringham and made what were called in the eighteen eighties gem photographs of the summer visitors to that place in the eighteen eighties he was a well known sheringham figure dark and handsome and sometimes a little unkempt wearing a brown velvet jacket and a large grey soft felt hat he would fall into conversation with the visitors upon the beach and a certain air of distinction about him would bring a sufficient proportion to his studio to maintain him his wife our mr preembys mother was a patient underdeveloped personality the daughter of a farmer near diss when presently mr preemby senior passed out of his sons life he became romantically entangled with a small variety entertainment in the summer of and vanished away with it in the autumn with as little fuss as possible never to return to sheringham mrs preemby senior became the working partner in a small lodging house and died in a year or sos time leaving her furniture her interest in the lodging house and her only son to her cousin and partner mrs witcherly young albert edward preemby was then a good looking slender youth of sixteen with his fathers curliness and his mothers fair hair and eyes of horizon blue dreamy and indisposed for regular employment even as a child he had been given to reverie at school he would sit with sums or book neglected before him looking beyond them at unknown things his early experiences in business were disappointing by reason of this abstraction after a number of unsuccessful attempts to exploit his gifts at some favourable point in the complex machinery of our civilization he came to rest for several years in the office of a house agent and coal merchant in norwich to whom his mother was distantly related some ancient remembered sentimental tie helped albert edward to this appointment and shielded any imperfections in his performance from too urgent a criticism he did much better at it than anyone could have expected the calling of a house agent differs from most other callings in the fact that the necessary driving energy is supplied entirely by the clientele and there was something about the letting of the larger houses that touched the dormant imagination of young preemby he revealed a natural gift for attractive description and was duly entrusted with the work of collecting particulars from prospective lessors he had a quite useful hopefulness and even the coal proved unexpectedly interesting so soon as he found that none of it had to be carried about by him he could never believe that all the golden scales one finds in it were pyrites he cherished a secret dream of a great commercial enterprise to work cinder heaps for residual gold he told no one of this project he took no steps to realize it but it warmed his daily routines with its promise of release and wealth and when things were slack in the office in the early afternoon and he was left in charge he would go and sit on the coal counter and pick out the coal samples for the little trays and turn them over and over and view them from various angles and weigh them in his hand and lapse into the most splendid visions and if inquirers after houses came in he would receive them with a manner almost regal in norwich he became a member of the ymca but he was interested in its literary rather than its religious side and he attended any political debates available he never spoke in these debates but he sat at the back reflecting that politicians are after all no more than puppets in the hands of the silent rich men who sit behind the scenes it was in norwich too that he was able to buy his first tailor made suit of a most becoming grey when he went to stay with mrs witcherly at sheringham for his summer holiday of a fortnight she was delighted by the improvement in his appearance and much impressed by the active hopefulness that had replaced his former lethargy upon the sea front in the afternoon in his grey suit to anyone who did not know about him he might have been almost any sort of prosperous summer visitor it seems a yesterday and yet it seems ages ago that our plump and short mr preemby was that small blonde young man twirling his stick and glancing furtively but desirously at the lady bathers in their vast petticoated bathing dresses and oilskin caps as he strolled along the sheringham front that was in the days when motor cars were still rather a joke a smell and a noise and wayside repairs and flying was understood to be impossible queen victoria had had her diamond jubilee and nobody thought albert edward prince of wales would ever survive to be king the war in south africa was being arranged for that summer to last six months and employ forty thousand men and it was on the third day of his grey suit holiday at sheringham that mr preemby was run into by his future wife miss hossett riding on a bicycle and thrown against and almost run over by her friend miss meeta pinkey because incredible as it may seem to the modern reader people did succeed in those distant nineties before the coming of the more suitable automobile in knocking down and running over other people with the sluggish apparatus bicycles horse drawn vehicles and so forth then available miss meeta pinkey was an emotional blonde girl and she fell off her machine gracefully and naturally into mr preembys arms as he was hurled against her it would seem to have been the original intention of destiny to have made this the beginning of a permanent relationship but in this matter destiny had reckoned without miss hossett miss meeta pinkey was as ripe for love just then as dry gunpowder is for a bang and she was already deeply in love with mr preemby before she had been replaced securely on her feet she stood flushed and round eyed and breathless and mr preemby looked quite manly and handsome after picking up her bicycle with an air of rescue miss hossett after butting against mr preemby had swerved dismounted and stood now prepared for a dispute the collision had further loosened the already loose handlebar of the entirely untrustworthy hired machine she had been riding it was this looseness had caused the accident her attention seemed divided equally between this and the possible grievance of mr preemby i rang my bell she said she was flushed and erect she was a round faced girl with a long thin neck a good bright complexion glasses on her thin nose and a resolute thin lipped mouth i did all i could to avoid you she said awkward of me said mr preemby disarmingly i was lost in a day dream you arent hurt asked meeta startled said mr preemby especially where the wheel got me this place is full of corners idve been over said meeta if you hadnt caught me miss hossett was reassured about any possible conflict with mr preemby evidently he was going to be quite nice about the accident this handlebar was as loose as could be she said look at it you can twist it about like on a swivel they ought to be punished for letting out such machines some of these days one of emll get let in for damages then theyll be a bit more careful scandalous i call it you cant ride it at all now said mr preemby no she agreed have to take it back to them it seemed only right and proper for mr preemby to wheel the machine for her back through the town to the hiring place where miss hossett reproved the hirer refused to pay anything and secured the return of her deposit in a few well chosen words miss pinkey paid the hire of her bicycle for a first hour it seemed natural after that for the little party of three to keep together they kept together with a faint sense of adventure and mr preemby behaved as nothing less than a normal lodger at miss witcherlys establishment and summer visitor to the seaside his new found friends were londoners and he referred himself to norwich and the management of house property he was quite amusing about sheringham he said it was a dear little backward forward place that it was a real treat to come to for a breath of sea air i dont like regular smart places said mr preemby im too absent minded in after years mr preemby would often try to recall the various stages that led to his marrying miss hossett but there was always a vague sense that he missed out something though he knew not what it was nor where it ought to have come in at first things did not look in the least like his marrying miss hossett indeed they did not look like his marrying anyone and if the word marriage had been whispered in his ears as the possible consequence of this encounter he would have been terrified he perceived that he was acceptable company to these girls but it seemed to him that it was meeta who formed the link between them and himself a fourth person presently joined their company who answered to the name of wilfred and it seemed to mr preemby that the air of mutual proprietorship between wilfred and miss hossett was unchallengeable the young people wandered in a little party along the sea front until the sea front came to an end and there they found a sheltered and comparatively secluded niche in the brow of the low cliffs and gave themselves up to the delights of spooning and it was meeta who spooned with mr preemby that afternoon and wilfred who spooned with miss hossett across the gulf of a quarter of a century the memory of mr preemby was still certain that this was so the fashions of life change from age to age knowledge has spread and refinement increased and a generation of young people more restrained more sophisticated or more decisive than their predecessors has taken possession of the world this spooning was an artless clumsy dalliance in great favour in those vanished days a dalliance that was kept within the bounds of strict decorum if ever that became necessary by cries of starp it or starpit i tell you on the part of the lady they embraced they kissed and put their silly young heads together and so whiled away the long waiting time before love had its way with them the summer resorts of england were littered with young people indulging in these poor silly undignified anticipations of love mr preemby it became manifest was a natural born spooner its lovely said miss meeta the way you squeeze me mr preemby squeezed some more and ventured to kiss a hot ear go on with you said miss meeta in a voice thick with delight that little moustache of yours it tickles flushed with encouragement and preoccupied with ideas for further enterprises mr preemby did not remark that the affairs of miss hossett and her wilfred followed a more troubled and less satisfactory course wilfred was not a type that appealed to mr preemby in spite of the fact that he was much less neat in his dress than mr preemby he had grey flannel trousers an old fancy vest a tweed norfolk jacket and low brown shoes with light coloured socks he impressed mr preemby as being consciously a social superior he was young the youngest of the party and yet dominant he had large red hands and big feet much untidy hair ill regulated features that might later be handsome and a hoarse guffaw he viewed mr preemby as though he knew all about him and thought the worse of him for it but did not intend to make any positive trouble for the present about his existence he was meeta whispered a medical student at cambridge and his father was a harley street physician who had been knighted he did not spoon with any abandonment he seemed weary of spooning he had perhaps been spooning for some days and his conversation with miss hossett went on in subdued contentious tones he sat a little apart from her amidst the sand and coarse bluish grass and her face was flushed what they said was inaudible to our intertwined couple chris and wilfred dont get on together as we do meeta said in a low voice theyre sillies hes like all the men said meeta sept one perhaps want everything they do and give nothing he wont even say theyre engaged she said dodged seeing her father there was a pause for reflection and then a renewal of endearments im gorne on you said meeta i am fair gorne on you youve got the bluest eyes ive ever seen china blue they are so detachedly it was that mr preemby and his future wife passed their first afternoon together he remembered it as he remembered most actual things indistinctly in a setting of hot sand and sunshine blue grey grass and a line of poppies nodding against an intense blue sky and then across these opening memories chris hossett seemed to leap at him with flushed cheeks and glowing eyes magnified by her glasses two or three days intervened before that passionate pounce mr preemby in his character of an incidental visitor to sheringham was under no obligation to produce a social background but miss pinkey introduced him to two large kindly aunts of a sedentary sort as a young man related to miss hossett who had saved her from a nasty fall off a bicycle and he and she both went to tea with chris hossetts people old mr hossett was a very ailing man excessively fat and irritable he had never been the same whatever the same was after his only son had died and mrs hossett an energetic lean threat of what her daughter might become had to wait on mr hossett hand and foot she had spectacles instead of chriss glasses her eyes were careworn and her complexion was leaden and her neck lean there were also a married cousin and his wife a mr and mrs widgery who seemed to be under the impression that mr preemby was a relation of miss pinkeys mr widgery had a long pock marked face and the dullest brown eyes mr preemby had ever seen there was nothing difficult to eat at tea and mr preemby got on very well listening to an explanation of the precariousness of mr hossetts existence due to heart trouble from mrs hossett and of just how unsatisfactory and distressing it was to come away and leave the laundry in the hands of a manager wilfred did not come to the tea he had been asked but he did not come the next day mr preemby met wilfred on the sea front watching the girls bathing from a bathing machine afterwards all four went for a walk in search of privacy and it became evident that miss hossett declined to spoon further with wilfred it was evident that there was profound trouble between chris and wilfred they scarcely spoke as they returned towards the town and before the sea front was reached wilfred said so long quite suddenly and turned away and vanished up a road running inland thereupon wilfred passed out of mr preembys world mr preemby never knew what became of him and never wanted to know and the next day he became aware for the first time of miss hossetts magnified eyes regarding him with an interest and a challenge that made him feel almost uncomfortable miss hossett became a serious obstacle to the spooning of meeta the quartette was now reduced to a trio and mr preemby found himself the apex so to speak of a triangle the eternal triangle in an exceptionally acute form whenever meeta was on the one hand chris was on the other she called him our teddy she pressed upon him she went so far as to stroke his hair meetas endearments faded to some extent in the presence of this competition but she made no explicit objection deep in the nature of the human male is a fount of polygamous pride mr preemby in these novel circumstances was proud and disingenuous he believed himself carrying on with two girls at once and it seemed to him to be a very splendid situation but indeed it was not so much a case of carrying on as of being carried off in the american world of emotional imaginations there is an ideal called the cave man much cherished by quiet unaggressive women because its realization would involve so little trouble on their own part the cave man is supposed to seize and grip and carry off and adore in this simple love story of mr preembys miss hossett played the cave mans rle up to the carrying off point at any rate on the first occasion of their being alone together she drew him to her and kissed him on the mouth with a warmth and an intensity and thoroughness that astonished and overwhelmed mr preemby it was quite different from meetas coy achievements or anything he had ever met around norwich he had not known that there was such kissing and in the warm summer twilight mr preemby found himself being carried off to a lonely piece of beach to spoon with chris hossett the light of a rising full moon mingled with the afterglow pebbles shone out like gems and stars he carried himself bravely but he was all atremble he knew that this time the enterprises would not come from him and the spooning of chris hossett was no more like the spooning of meeta than a furnace glow is like the light of the moon i love you said chris as though that justified anything and as they stumbled homeward at an hour that mr preemby called feefully late she said youre going to marry me arent you youve got to marry me now and then we can really make love soften as we like i cant rightly say that im exactly in a position to keep a wife just at present said mr preemby i dont see that theres any necessity for me to ask a man to keep me said miss hossett youre a wonder teddy anyhow and im going to marry you its got to be and there you are but ow can i marry you asked mr preemby almost peevishly for he was really very tired one would think to hear you that no one had ever married before said chris hossett and besides after this you must mind you ive got to go back to norwich next tuesday said mr preemby you ought to have thought of that before she said but ill lose my situation naturally father will find you something better we arent poor people teddy theres no need to be scared about it in such terms was chris hossett wooed and won by mr preemby he was scared dreadfully scared but also he was tremendously roused it impressed him as being a wildly romantic affair and very terrifying and a little hard on meeta pinkey but he was bustled along too fast to think very much about meeta pinkey he was introduced over again to the hossett parents next day as their daughters affianced husband and in secret she gave him three golden sovereigns to buy her an engagement ring as a surprise mrs hossett behaved at first as though she approved of mr preemby and disapproved of the marriage and then after what was clearly a stormy scene upstairs with her daughter she behaved as though she approved highly of the marriage and thought mr preemby a very objectionable person mr hossett would not speak to mr preemby directly but he spoke of him to his wife and to imaginary auditors in mr preembys presence as a scoundrel who had got hold of his girl yet he too seemed to regard the marriage as desirable and no one made any reply to his obiter dicta it was all very puzzling and exalting to mr preemby he did little except what he was told to do he was carried over his marriage as a man might be carried over a weir he left any explanation to mrs witcherly of what was happening for some more favourable occasion he went off on tuesday with his little valise as though he was going back to norwich he wrote a simple letter of regret to the house agent and coal merchant private affairs he said of an urgent nature prevented his return to his duties mrs and miss hossett went up to london with him they all took rooms at a temperance hotel in bloomsbury and mr preemby was married by special licence at st martins by trafalgar square then he went down to the limpid stream laundry to live with his parents in law and master the duties of assistant manager canvasser and publicity agent mr hossett never spoke to him and sometimes talked rather unpleasantly about him when he was in the room making accusations that were better ignored but mrs hossett gradually became cordial again and presently mr hossett had a heart seizure and died and in the course of a few months mr preemby found himself a father when he was first confronted with his daughter and as it proved his only child he thought her an extremely ugly little red object he had never seen a baby at so early a stage before she had a lot of very fine moist dark hair which subsequently gave place to a later crop she had large indeterminate features and remarkably large feet and hands mr preemby had an absurd impression that he had seen her somewhere before and hadnt liked her then in a day or so she became a quite ordinary pink baby and wonder gave place to affection she was christened christina alberta after her mother and mr preemby in time all these experiences mellowed in mr preembys memory into a vague glorious romantic adventurous past he continued to be rather dreamy and distraught but on the whole he made a dutiful faithful husband and he got on very well with his masterful and capable wife she was he had discovered on his marriage three years his senior and she continued to be in every respect his senior to the day of her death but she treated him with proprietary affection she chose all his clothes for him she cultivated his manners and bearing and upheld him against all other people she dressed him rather more like a golf champion than he would have done himself if he had had any say in the matter she would not let him have a bicycle for many years she was a little exacting about his ways of keeping the laundry accounts she fixed his pocket money at ten shillings a week and she was disposed to restrict his opportunities for conversation with feminine members of the laundry staff but he made no marked protest against these slight deviations from the customary obedience of a wife a tendency to plumpness manifested itself and he grew considerable quantities of blonde moustache without apparent effort their home was an agreeable one the more so after mrs hossett had followed her husband to his resting place under a marble crucifix with a dove and olive branch in relievo at the intersection of the arms at woodford wells mr preemby became a great reader reading not only romantic novels he had a great distaste for realism in any form but ancient history astronomy astrology and mystical works he became deeply interested in the problem of the pyramids and in the probable history of the lost continent of atlantis mental science also attracted him and the possibility of increasing will power very greatly he would sometimes practise will power before the looking glass in his bedroom when mrs preemby was not about at nights he would sometimes will himself to sleep instead of going to sleep in the usual fashion he gave a considerable amount of attention to prophecy and eschatology he developed views of his own about the day of judgment that might have led to a breach with the established church if mrs preemby had not thought that such a breach would react unfavourably upon the laundry as time went on he accumulated a library of upwards of a thousand volumes and a very considerable vocabulary his wife viewed these intellectual preoccupations with friendly sympathy at times even with pride but she took little part in them herself the laundry was good enough for her she loved the laundry more and more loved its piled clean and starched shirts and collars and its folded and stacked sheets loved the creak of its machinery and the suddy bustle of the washing room she loved to have it all going on orderly and right to feel everything going through the tubs and washers and wringers sure and safe nothing astray nothing missing at the end when she walked about the place voices were hushed and scrubbing became respectfully assiduous and she liked making things pay on sunday afternoons and on days when the laundry had no need of his services mr preemby took long walks in fine weather he would walk into epping forest or to ongar or even into the rustic peace of the roothings but in dull weather he would go londonward after a while the trams were extended as far as the present terminus at woodford and it became possible to ride very pleasantly right into the heart of london by way of seven sisters road and camden town or with a little bit of extra walking by the lea bridge road and the angel and holborn the greatness and multitudinous activities of london stirred slumbering strands of mr preembys imagination he would go in and lunch at an arated bread shop on a scone and butter with a cup of cocoa and perhaps a jam puff and he would spend hours looking into shop windows and sometimes even making small purchases he loved charing cross road with its book shops tottenham court road holborn clerkenwell and the whitechapel road but piccadilly and bond street and regent street seemed costly and lacking in true intellectual interest and he felt his baggy tweed knickerbockers and cap a little out of tune in these smart places sometimes he would go to the british museum and look very hard at objects connected with the pyramids great public events always drew him to london if there was a great murder or a great fire or a royal wedding or a royal funeral mr preemby would be sure to be looking at it where the crowd was thickest often with a neat packet of provisions a sandwich an orange or so forth that mrs preemby had provided but he never saw illuminations and fireworks because mrs preemby liked to have him at home when the days work was over he enjoyed the great war of gravely and profoundly once he passed a man who he thought afterwards was almost certainly a german spy the thought thrilled him for days he had given him a good look anyhow he attended air raids in plenty and he saw the potters bar zeppelin shot down he was a good four years too old for compulsory military service when the time came and mrs preemby would not let him be a special constable because she thought he might catch cold mr preembys work in the counting house was not very onerous but he also gave thought and attention to the extension of the business outside he invented several attractive circulars his experience as a house agent had trained him to note the existence of large comfortable looking houses that might otherwise have escaped his observation and to ascertain whether they were occupied he would then find out whether the limpid stream laundry got the washing from such establishments and if not he would send a circular and even follow it up with a personal letter he was vaguely observant about the premises he would go sometimes and look for quite a long time at the furnaces or the delivery vans or any new piece of machinery like the new calendering machine until he got used to it but if he stood about where there were girls working mrs preemby would make some excuse to get him back into the office because as she explained she thought a man standing about affected the girls work unfavourably he took in and sometimes read the british laundryman and the dyers and cleaners gazette occasionally he had happy ideas it was his idea to paint the delivery vans bright blue and decorate them with a swastika and to paint exactly the same colour and design on the front of the laundry and put it on the bills but when he wanted to put the van drivers into swastika caps and blue the clothes baskets mrs preemby said she thought the thing had gone far enough it was also mr preemby who suggested ford cars instead of horse vans as early as this change was made in and at home with her peaceful interested father and her busy occasionally rather astringent mother christina alberta grew to girlhood and womanhood chapter the second christina alberta this story it was clearly explained in the first paragraph of the first section of the first chapter is a story about mr preemby in the later years the widower years of his life that statement has all the value of an ordinary commercial guarantee and on no account shall we ever wander far from mr preemby but the life of his daughter was so closely interwoven with his own during that time that it is necessary to tell many things about her distinctly and explicitly before we get our real story properly begun and even after it has begun and while it goes on and right up to the end christina alberta will continue to intrude intrusion was in her nature she was never what is called an engaging child but she always had a great liking for her daddy and he had the greatest affection and respect for her she had little or no tact and there was always something remote and detached something of the fairy changeling about her even her personal appearance was tactless she had a prominent nose which tended to grow larger whereas mrs preembys nose was small and bright and pinched between her glasses and her fathers delicately chiselled and like some brave little boat shooting a great cascade of moustache she was dark and both her parents were fair as she grew up the magic forces of adolescence assembled her features into a handsome effect but she was never really pretty her eyes were brown and bright and hard she had her mothers thin lipped resolute mouth and modestly determined chin and she had her mothers clear firm skin and bright colour she was a humming shouting throwing punching child with a tendency not to hear admonitions and an almost instinctive dexterity in avoiding sudden slaps she flitted about she might be up the drying ground or she might be under your bed the only thing to do was to down and look she danced neither mr preemby nor mrs preemby danced and this continual jiggeting about perplexed and worried them a piano or a distant band would set her dancing or she would dance to her own humming she danced to hymn tunes and on a sunday there was a standing offer from mr preemby of sixpence if ever she sat quiet for five minutes but it was never taken up at her first school a mixed day school in buckhurst hill she was first of all extremely unpopular and then extremely popular and then she was expelled afterwards she did fairly well at the taverners girls school at woodford where she was recognized from the first as a humorist there was always a difficulty in calling her any other name than christina alberta people tried all sorts of names but none of them stuck but christina alberta babs and baby and bertie and buss she was called at home and ally and tina and at school they tried nosey and suds and feet and preemy and prim also golliwog because of her hair at hockey these all came off again and left the original name exposed she was quick at her lessons and particularly at history geography and drawing but disrespectful to her teachers at school hockey she played forward right with marked success she could run like the wind and she never seemed blown her pinch was simply frightful she could make sudden grimaces with her nose that gave the weaker sort hysterics she was particularly disposed to do this at school prayers between her mother and herself there was a streak of animosity it was not a very broad streak but it was there her mother seemed to cherish some incommunicable grievance against her it didnt prevent mrs preemby from doing her duty by the child but it restrained any real warmth of affection between them from an early age it was daddy got the kisses and got climbed over and pulled about he returned this affection he called her my own little girl and would even say at times that she was a wonder he took her for walks with him and told her many secret things that were in his mind about the lost atlantis and the lamas of tibet and the fundamentals of astrology preserved indecipherably in the proportions of the pyramids hed often wished he said to have a good look at the pyramids sometimes one man saw things that others didnt she would listen intently although not always in quite the right spirit he would tell her of the virtue and science of atlantis they walked about in long white robes he said more like bible characters than human beings good for the laundries daddy said christina alberta all we know of astrology is just fragments of what they knew they knew the past and future pity they were all drowned she remarked without apparent irony maybe they werent all drowned he said darkly you dont mean theres atlantics about nowadays some may have escaped descendants may be nearer than you suppose why you and me christina we may have atlantic blood his manner conveyed his conviction it doesnt seem to help much she said helps more than you think hidden gifts insight things like that we arent common persons christina alberta for some moments the two of them pursued independent reveries still we dont know were atlantics said christina alberta after she had fought her way to the sixth form in the taverners school the educational outlook of christina alberta was troubled by dissensions both within the school and without the staff was divided about her her discipline was bad her class work rank or vile but she passed examinations and particularly external examinations by independent examiners with conspicuous success there was a general desire to get her out of the school but whether that was to be done by a university scholarship or a simple request to her parents to take her away was a question under dispute the games mistress was inclined to regard murder as a third possible course because of the girls utter disregard for style in games her unsportsmanlike trick of winning them in irregular and unexpected ways and her tendency to make drill and gymnastics an occasion for a low facetiousness far more suitable for the ordinary class room the english and literature mistress concurred although christina alberta would spend hours over her essays working in sentences and paragraphs from pater and ruskin and hazlitt so that they might pass as her own original constructions it was not christina albertas fault if ever and again these threads of literary gold were marked in red ink clumsy or might be better expressed or too flowery only the head mistress had a really good word for christina alberta but then the head mistress as became her position made a specialty of understanding difficult cases and christina alberta was always quietly respectful to the head mistress and could produce a better side to her nature with the most disconcerting alacrity whenever the head mistress was called in christina alberta as soon as the issue became clear to her decided for the scholarship she reformed almost obtrusively she became tidy she ceased to be humorous she lost sets of tennis to the games mistress like a little sports woman and she stopped arguing and became the sedulous ape of stevenson for the estranged english mistress but it was up hill work even in the school there was a little too much elegant surrender in her reformed tennis and a little too much parody about her english in velveteen the possibility that she would ever join that happy class of girls who go in from the suburbs to classes in london and lead the higher life beyond parental inspection and sometimes until quite late in the evening in studios laboratories and college lecture rooms seemed a very insecure one even without reckoning with the quiet but determined opposition of her mother for mrs preemby was not the woman to like a daughter educated above her parentage and station she came to lament her weakness in not bringing christina alberta into the laundry as she herself had been brought in at the age of fourteen then she would have learnt the business from the ground up and have qualified herself to help and at last succeed her mother even as mrs preemby had helped and succeeded mrs hossett but the school with its tennis and music and french and so forth had turned the girl against this clean and cleansing life she was rising seventeen now and the sooner she abandoned these things which lead straight to school teaching spinsterhood italian holidays art clothes and stuck up incapacity the better for her and every one she made a campaign against christina albertas habit of sitting about in unladylike attitudes and reading and when mr preemby took the unusual and daring course of saying that it was a bit hard on the girl and that he didnt see any harm in a book or so now and then mrs preemby took him up to christina albertas own little room to see what came of it and more particularly to see the sort of pictures shed stuck up there even when he was confronted with a large photographic reproduction of michael angelos creation of adam as the master had painted that event on the roof of the sistine chapel in rome he still made a feeble show of resistance and said that it was art youd stand anything she did i believe said mrs preemby look at it art look at these books darwins origin of species thats a nice book for a girl to be prying into very likely she doesnt see the harm of it said mr preemby her said mrs preemby compactly and look at this this was howes atlas of biology she opened it to display its large pages crowded with pictures of the detailed dissection of a frog reely my dear said mr preemby its one of her schoolbooks there reely isnt nothing what i should call improper in that its science and after all its only a frog pretty things they teach at school nowadays what with your art and your science doesnt leave much to the imagination why when i was a girl if id asked ma what was inside any animal shed have slapped me and slapped me hard and rightly theres things rightly hid from us and hid they ought to be god shows us as much as is good for us more no need to open animals and here heres a book in french hm said mr preemby yielding a little he took up the lemon yellow volume and turned it over in his hand all this reading said mrs preemby and indicated three shelves of books mr preemby assembled his courage you mustnt expect me to go against reading chris he said its a pleasure and a light theres things in books reely chris i believe youd be happier if you read a bit christina alberta is a born reader whether you like it or not she gets it from me i suppose mrs preemby started and regarded his flushed opposition the anger in her eyes was magnified through her glasses its wonderful she said after a little pause its truly wonderful how christina alberta manages to get everything she wants miss maltby neverson the head mistress of the taverners school called upon mrs preemby and shook her resolution a good deal she was obviously a lady and the school washing ran in term time to twenty pounds a week she was taken to see the scandalous picture and she said very beautiful im sure one of the really great paintings in the world pro foundly religious its the very words of the bible made into a picture what do you find in it to object to mrs preemby whereupon as if by a trick the picture ceased to be scandalous and mrs preemby was ashamed of herself she saw now there never had been anything wrong about that picture miss maltby neverson said that christina alberta was a difficult type but a thoroughly interesting personality a real personality she had a great capacity for affection i havent found that said mrs preemby it is a type i have studied said miss maltby neverson simply but conclusively she explained that christina alberta was an active type left to herself without employment to stretch her faculties she might easily get into almost any sort of mischief almost any sort not that there was anything wrong in her essentially it was just energy given good hard work and a scope for ambition she might become a very satisfactory woman indeed possibly even a distinguished woman ive no use for distinguished women said mrs preemby shortly the world has said miss maltby neverson gently im afraid im one of the old fashioned sort said mrs preemby christina alberta isnt let the man be distinguished abroad and the woman distinguished at home said mrs preemby im sorry to differ from you miss maltby neverson but one cannot help ones opinions it depends upon ourselves said miss maltby neverson im afraid i like men to rule said mrs preemby woman has her place in the world and it isnt mans but i thought mr preemby rather favoured the scholarship idea mrs preemby was baffled he did she said as though she did not see clearly what that had to do with the matter give the thing a trial said miss maltby neverson after all she may not win this scholarship but christina alberta won it with marks to spare she took no risks it was a biennial scholarship which had been established by a benefactor of advanced views it was tenable at the london school of economics as soon as christina alberta knew she had secured it she went without consulting her mother or anyone to a hairdressers and had her hair bobbed to mrs preemby this was almost a worse blow than the scholarship she surveyed her shock headed handsome nosed daughter in her short gymnastic skirts with a qualm of sincere hatred she wished she could make her daughter feel about herself as she felt about her i wish you could only see yourself she said with concentrated bitterness oh i know said christina alberta i suppose youre a judgment on me said mrs preemby but christina alberta had only studied in the london school of economics for a year she was beginning her second year when her mother obliged her to resign her scholarship christina alberta had stayed late in london one evening without telling her mother she was going to do so she had gone to a discussion of the population question at the new hope club in fitzgerald street and she had come home smelling so strongly of tobacco that her mother had repented of and revoked all her concessions to modernity there and then she had been waiting for that moment for many months this ends it she said as she let her daughter in christina alberta found there was no immediate way round or through that decision she worked her father and miss maltby neverson in vain but instead of resigning her scholarship right out as she had been told to do she played for time and explained her absence by a vague reference to family trouble mrs preemby in those days was already in very bad health but this fact was completely overshadowed in the minds of both her daughter and her husband by the far more urgent fact that she was now constantly in a very bad temper everything was conspiring to worry her except mr preemby who knew better than to do anything of the sort the closing years of the great war and still more so the opening year of the disappointing peace were years of very great difficulty for the laundry business the munitions business put laundry girls above themselves and there was no doing anything with them coal soap everything was at unheard of prices and it was impossible to get back on the customers by raising the charges people even the best sort of people were giving up cleanliness gentlemen of position would wear their dress shirts three or four times and make their undervests and under pants last a fortnight household linen was correspondingly eked out people moved about the new army officers wives came and went here to day and gone to morrow leaving unpaid bills never had mrs preemby known so many bad debts van men came back from the army so shell shocked and militarized that they embezzled out of pure nervousness and habit income tax became a nightmare outside as within mrs preembys life was a conflict she kept the limpid stream laundry paying all through that awful time because she was a wonder at management but she did it at a terrible loss of vitality she became bitterly critical of the unhelpfulness of mr preemby and her daughter when they tried to be helpful she criticized their incapacity they did more harm than good meal times were awful she would sit flushed and glowering through her glasses obviously afflicted by a passionate realization of the worlds injustice and eating very little mr preembys attempts to start a cheerful conversation were rarely successful even christina alberta was overawed things going a little better this morning mr preemby would try cant i get rest from business even at my meals the poor lady would complain or looks like pleasant weather for the derby pity you cant go there for all the help you are in the place i suppose you havent heard whats happened to van number two no said mr preemby you wouldnt hind mudguard smashed been done for weeks and nobody knows who did it one would think that that was a mans business anyhow but its left for me to find out and pay for like everything else in the place id better make inquiries i know those inquiries of yours better leave the whole thing alone now grin and bear it the silence of the meal would be restored she seemed to set a high value upon these awful silences she even complained that he ate his cheese biscuits audibly but how else can one eat cheese biscuits christina alberta was made of sterner stuff and became controversial then her mother would flare out at her insolence and declare that one or the other of us leaves the table ill read upstairs said christina albert it isnt my wish to be lunching here before the abrupt ending of christina albertas university career she was present only at breakfast and supper supper wasnt nearly as awful in quality as breakfast and breakfast could easily be bolted and got away from but after the new hope club catastrophe she was present at all the meals a sort of lightning conductor for her father and something of a restraint upon and an added exasperation to her mother she took the line of agreeing that if her university career was to end then she must go into the laundry business but she argued very stoutly that to do that with any hope of success under modern conditions meant a proper business training if she could not go to the london school of economics then she ought to go to tomlinsons commercial training school in chancery lane and learn book keeping shorthand typing business correspondence prcis commercial french and so forth and after three weeks of painful midday meals this proposal was adopted under stringent conditions and her season ticket to london was renewed she worked her way very passably through another winter with tomlinsons as her school and most of london as her playground she learnt all sorts of things she added a new set of friends and acquaintances some with bobbed hair and some without of the most various social origins and associations to the circle she had already acquired at the london school of economics when presently mrs preemby began to speak of a gnawing pain that oppressed her both her husband and daughter took it at first as a new development of her general grievance against them and felt no particular apprehension about it mr preemby said he thought she ought to take advice or see some one about it but for some days she treated the suggestion with scorn if once she got in a doctor she said theyd have to find some one else to look after the laundry doctors put you to bed and give you things to keep you there otherwise how could they get a living then suddenly she changed one morning she confessed she felt dreadful she went back to bed and mr preemby with strange premonitions that the world was coming to an end trotted off for a doctor the clinical thermometer showed a temperature mounting above one hundred and one it hurts my side hurts said mrs preemby ive had it once before but not like this christina alberta came home that evening to discover herself capable of fear remorse and tenderness she had some strange moments with her mother in between phases of weak delirium and insensibility mrs preembys face seemed to have become smaller and prettier the feverish flush in her cheeks simulated youth she was no longer hard or angry but rather pathetically friendly and christina alberta hadnt seen her in bed for years take care of your daddy said mrs preemby you owe more to him and less to him than you think i had to do all ive done take care of him hes gentle and good and easily persuaded and not to be trusted alone in the world ive never been quite all a mother should be to you but youve been difficult christina ive had a great respect for you im glad you havent my eyes glasses are a curse anxiety about the laundry occupied a large part of her thoughts that woman smithers in the washing room is a thief and id get rid of the new man baxandale i dont know why ive kept mrs smithers on so long weakness im not sure about him theres nothing positive yet but i feel hes not straight im very much afraid weve let lady badgers account run too long nowadays titles want watching ive been misled by her she promised a cheque but i doubt about you two in the laundry altogether he cant and you wont you might have done it never mind that now sell it as a going concern the widgerys might come in hes hard but hes straight straight enough they might like to come in its never entered my head i wasnt good for twenty years yet i wish the doctor wouldnt think of operating it wont do any good she repeated many of her phrases i hate the thought of being opened she said i suppose like those frogs in your book packed like a bag never get it back again loose bits washing basket or something to keep it together then her mind went off at a tangent to things beyond christina albertas understanding sneaked off and left me to it i wonder what hes doing now suppose fancy if it should be him that had to operate operate children we were she seemed to recollect herself and regarded her daughter with a hard inquiring eye some instinct in christina alberta told her to assume an incurious expression but these words struck upon her mind and stayed there and germinated like a seed children they were and he had sneaked off queer and yet according with all sorts of other imponderables mr preemby looked unusually small but unusually dignified in his full mourning christina alberta was also extremely black and shiny her skirts reached for the first time in her life to her ankles a sacrifice that she felt would be particularly acceptable to the spirit of the departed a new thing had come into christina albertas life responsibility she perceived that for unfathomable reasons she was responsible for mr preemby it was clear that the sudden death of his wife under the surgeons knife had been a very great blow to him he did not break down or weep or give way to paroxysms of grief but he was enormously still and sad his round china blue eyes and his moustache looked at the world with a mournful solemnity the undertaker had rarely met so satisfactory a widower everything of the best said mr preemby whatever she can have she must have under the circumstances the undertaker who was a friend of the family having met both mr and mrs preemby at whist drives quite frequently showed commendable moderation you cant imagine what all this means to me said mr preemby to christina alberta quite a number of times it was a pure love match he said pure romance she had nothing to gain by marrying me but neither of us thought of sordid things he was silent for a little while struggling with intractable memories he subdued them we just met he said smiling faintly and it seemed that it had to be sneaked off and left me came a faint whisper in christina albertas memory there was much to see to in those days of mourning christina alberta did her best to help watch and guide mr preemby even as her mother had desired but she was surprised to find in him certain entirely unexpected decisions that had apparently leapt into existence within a few hours of her mothers death one was a clear resolve that he and she must part company with the laundry either by selling it or letting it or if no means of disposing of it offered by burning it down or blowing it up as speedily as possible he did not discuss this he treated it as an unavoidable necessity he expressed no animosity for the laundry he made no hostile criticism of the life he had led there but every thought betrayed his fundamental aversion and also they were to go away right away from woodford wells and never return thither she had come to much the same decisions on her own account but she had not expected to find them in such quiet strength in him he became explicit about the future as they sat at supper on the evening of the funeral your mothers cousin sam widgery he said was talking to me he munched for a moment his moustache went up and down and his eyes of china blue stared out of the window at the sunset sky he wants to take it over the laundry as a going concern and he being our nearest relation so to speak id as soon he had it as anybody else other things being equal wish i knew what to ask him for it i dont want to ask him too little so i said i didnt care to discuss things at a funeral said hed better come along to morrow their place isnt doing well its got sort of embedded in walthamstow it would pay him to get out and let the land go for building he hasnt got very much money but he wants this place he reely wants this place his blue eyes were the eyes of one who sees visions i dont know if they taught you about making companies at the school of economics im a child at all that sort of thing he talks about partnership or a mortgage or something like that but what we want what we want is a limited company and what we want is something like debentures only rather more like preference shares we want it so that whatever he draws out of the business weve got to draw out more otherwise the company can cut away the security for your debentures by paying too much dividend on the ordinary shares hell have the ordinary shares him and his wife i dont say hed do such a thing deliberately but he might very easily be led into doing it hes got to be looked after we want to fix it so that if he pays more on his shares than we get on our shares wed get our interest levelled up its all very difficult and complicated christina alberta christina alberta regarded mr preemby with a new and deepening respect she had never heard him make such a speech before at meals but then he had never before been free from interruption and correction well have to have it fixed up properly by our solicitors said mr preemby we shant be badly off he continued helping himself to cheese theres a mortgage or so weve got and some houses at buckhurst hill its a curious thing but your poor dear mother had a sort of faith in my eye for house property she often let me guide her and i always had a feeling for making some sort of reserve out of the business very likely sam widgery will take over most of the furniture of this house its a bigger house than his where do you think of going to live daddy asked christina alberta i dont rightly know said mr preemby after a moment or so of introspection i keep thinking of different places london she said if i could go back to study before it is too late london he said it might be he hesitated over his next suggestion with the hesitation that had become a habit so accustomed was he to see his suggestions crumpled up and flung aside have you ever heard of boarding houses christina alberta he asked with an unreal carelessness have you ever thought it might be possible for us to go and live in boarding houses in london all over the world almost there are boarding houses you see christina alberta we might get rid of our furniture here except for my books and a few little things and we might put most of that away for a time taylors repository would take care of that for us and we might go and live sometimes in a boarding house here and sometimes in a boarding house there then you could study and neednt keep house and i could read and look at things and make memorandums about some theories ive thought of and talk to people and hear people talking all sorts of people go to boarding houses all sorts of interesting people these last nights ive been thinking no end about living in boarding houses i keep on thinking of it turning it over in my mind it would be a new life for me like beginning again lifes been so regular here all very well while your poor dear mother was alive but now i feel i want distraction i want to move about and see all sorts of things and different kinds of people i want to forget why in some of these boarding houses theres chinese and indians and russian princesses and professors and actors and all sorts of people just to hear them theres boarding houses full of students in bloomsbury every sort said mr preemby one place that attracts me said mr preemby pouring out what remained of the beer is tumbridge wells isnt that sometimes called tunbridge daddy formerly but now it is always spoken of as tumbridge wells at this tumbridge wells christina alberta there are hills with names that point directly to some connection with the ancient israelites mount ephraim and mount gilboa and so on and there are a number of curiously shaped rocks shaped in the likeness of great toads and prehistoric monsters and mystical forms and nobody knows whether they are the work of gods hand or mans i am very anxious to see these things for myself they may have a deeper and closer significance for us than is commonly supposed there are plenty of boarding houses at tumbridge wells i was told only the other day by a man i met in the assyrian room in the british museum and some of them are said to be very comfortable and reasonable indeed we might go there for the holidays said christina alberta before the london session begins outside was the summer afterglow and a dusky peace filled the room father and daughter followed divergent trains of thought mr preemby was the first to break the silence now that i shall be in mourning or half mourning for some time i have decided to give away all those harris tweed knickerbocker suits and stockings of mine some poor man might feel the comfort of them in winter i have never really liked those very baggy knickerbockers but of course while your poor dear mother was alive her taste was law to me and those caps they get over your eyes when youre hot that tweed stuff it is overrated when you ride a bicycle or anything it ravels out with the friction of the seat makes you look ridiculous and i think that quite soon i shall get myself one of those soft grey felt hats with a black band i have always wanted to see you wear one daddy said christina alberta it would count as mourning oh yes daddy mr preemby meditated pleasantly the girl had common sense her advice was worth having as for putting the swastika on your poor dear mothers tombstone perhaps you are right in thinking it is not what she herself would have chosen it may be better after all to do as you suggest and erect a simple cross after all it is her tombstone whereupon christina alberta got up from her chair and went round the table almost at a prance until she remembered things and kissed him for some obscure reason she hated the swastika almost as much as she loved her daddy for her it had become the symbol of silliness and she did not like to think of him as silly particularly now when for some obscure reason she was beginning to think of him as ill used there was much to see to before the preembys could go to tunbridge wells there had to be quite a number of interviews with mr sam widgery at woodford wells and afterwards in the dingy offices of messrs payne and punter in lincolns inn it was clear from the first to these men of affairs that mr preemby was a child at business but as they went on with him they realized that he was an extremely greedy and intractable child it was six weeks before mr and mrs sam widgery could move in sullenly and resentfully to the limpid stream premises and mr preemby and his daughter could go on after a day or so in london to select a boarding house at tunbridge wells christina alberta spent her early days as an orphan struggling against an unreasonable cheerfulness and a profound sense of release she found her father ready to accept almost any explanation of her need to run up to london for a day and even disposed to be tolerant when she came home late she had quite a little world of miscellaneous acquaintances in london fellow students and their friends fellow students from the london school of economics and fellow students at tomlinsons school and art students they knew and medical students they knew and girls from the provinces who had chucked their families and got typing jobs and so on to models and chorus girls and vaguely employed rather older young men of the intellectual class she met them in and about the class rooms and in abcs and suchlike places and in the new hope club where there were even labour politicians and men who claimed to be bolsheviks and she went to parties and duologues in studios in high remote extraordinary flats it was tremendous fun although a lot of it had to be snatched from the insistent claims and inquiries of woodford wells and people liked her they liked christina alberta laughed at her jokes they did and admired her thundering cheek and never said anything about her nose it was much more her natural world than the taverners school people had ever been nobody seemed to mind that she came out of a laundry for all they seemed to care about that sort of thing she might have come out of a gaol in between the excitements of student life she even did some reading in her first grief for her mother she tried not to feel a sense of new unstinted freedom in regard to all these adventures and experiences her daddy in his grief bless him was smoking much more than he had ever done before he was even trying cigars he had no nose for tobacco reek in his daughter or for anything of that sort he asked few questions and they were easily answered long years of exercise had made him almost constitutionally acquiescent christina alberta realized that within very wide limits indeed now she might do anything she pleased whenever she liked she realized also that there was no particular hurry to do anything at all all the others seemed to be running about in pairs like knives and forks it suited her humour to stay detached and the world had altered this break up of the old home the death of her mother the disappearance of every control except her credulous inattentive daddy had jerked her forward from childhood to maturity hitherto home had seemed an eternal indestructible thing from which you started out for adventures to which whatever happened you returned like a sea rover to rest and where you went to bed and slept as you had been wont to sleep secure unthreatened now here the two of them daddy and herself were in the open no bolting place at all for them anything might happen to them and might insist upon going on happening she could now do just anything she pleased it was true but also she realized that now she had to take the unlimited consequences so that in spite of her sense of novel unbounded freedoms christina alberta found she did not go up to london any more than she would have done during her mothers lifetime many of her most attractive friends it is true were away upon their holidays and she found her fathers company unusually interesting every time she came back to him he seemed to be slightly enlarged and of a firmer colour and consistency he reminded her of practical biology botanical section in the taverners school when you take a dried up bean out of its package and put it in a jar with water and observe it under the influence of warmth and moisture it germinates and he was germinating mother had kept him dried up for nearly twenty years but now he was germinating and nobody could tell what sort of thing he might become chapter the third in lonsdale mews after a month of deep mourning christina alberta put aside her long skirts and returned to the more kilt like garments to which she was accustomed she had not been inactive while her father had conducted his business settlement with mr sam widgery and she had worked out a scheme of living that seemed to promise quite a happy life for her father and herself she fell in with the boarding house idea and with the project of beginning at tunbridge wells she ceased to struggle with the fact that he continued to call it quietly but insistently tumbridge wells it seemed to her upon reflection that tumbridge was really the place he at any rate was going to live at that gentle departure from exactitude was quite of a piece with his general habit of living a little askew from actual things but she impressed upon him the view that since their lives were to be migratory henceforth and since there were a certain number of books unsaleable articles of furniture that mrs widgery would not take over at a valuation a number of curiosities for example a piece of shell which he believed to be a fragment of a great auks egg a rosicrucian regalia and a mummified hawk from egypt which had prophetic qualities to consider there must be a sort of permanent headquarters in london at which these objects could be stored and to which he and she could return from the various boarding houses round and about the earth and pursuant to this suggestion she made inquiries and worked out an admirable project for sharing some accommodation with two little friends of hers who practised art literature and picturesque economies in a converted mews in chelsea in fact she made arrangements with them she told mr preemby she had made these arrangements according to his instructions and after a time it did come to seem to him that he had given her the instructions upon which she acted lonsdale mews opens out of lonsdale road chelsea and there is quite a noble entrance with large stucco pillars on either side and an arch over on which is a design in relievo of neptune and sea horses and the words lonsdale mews inside there had once been stables and coach houses and over each a bedroom and a sitting room which was also in the more prolific past generally used as a bedroom and a cupboard and a landing and so forth the little home of the coachman and his wife and family attached to the genteel carriage and horses below but the advancement of science and the progress of invention have abolished gentility and so reduced the number of coachmen and carriages in the world that lonsdale mews has had to accept other tenants and being too narrow down the centre for the coming and going of automobiles without a great deal of bashing of mudguards and radiators has had to paint itself up attractively and fall back upon art and the intelligenzia christina albertas two young friends were in possession of one of these perverted coachmens homes and as they were very inadequately prepared to pay the rent it was a quite aristocratic rent they were extremely glad to welcome mr preemby and particularly christina alberta as co tenants mr preemby was to have the big room downstairs and there he was to arrange his books and his surplus furnishings and ornaments and curious objects and have a sofa that could be made into an apparent bed when he wanted to sleep in london and christina alberta was to have a little bedroom for herself behind this wherein a breezy decorative scheme of orange and bright blue more than made up for a certain absence of daylight and fresh air but when the two young friends had a party or when mr preemby was away they were to have the use of the big downstairs room and in the case of a party christina albertas room was to be a ladies cloak room the lessors were to retain the use of the upstairs rooms and in the matter of the kitchen all things therein were to be held in common none of this agreement was put into writing and many issues were left over frankly for future controversy we are to be the pigs that pay the rent said christina alberta that was the general idea much well work out said mr harold crumb much will work itself out its no good being too definite what was definite was that mr preemby was to pay the rent mr harold crumb was a red haired young man a shock headed young man with a rampant profile dressed in a blue overall frayed grey trousers and slippers he had large freckled hands and he did black and white which mr preemby had supposed to be a whisky but discovered was an art harold lived by attempting to sell drawings for advertisements and pictured jokes for the weekly papers his expression was lofty and his voice constrained and it seemed to mr preemby that he was suffered rather than met by mr crumb with christina alberta mr crumb seemed to be on terms of tacit friendship and no word passed between them he lifted his hand and twiddled his fingers at her with a kind of melancholy mrs crumb was more effusive she embraced christina alberta warmly and answered to the name of fay then she turned to mr preemby and shook hands with him quite normally she was a slender young lady with carelessly bobbed corn coloured hair pale grey eyes and an absent minded face she also was dressed in a blue overall she wore oyster coloured stockings and slippers and possibly other things and her business in life mr preemby learnt was to review books for various newspapers and write romantic fiction for bookstall magazines her right forefinger had that indelible inkiness which only the habitual use of an incontinent fountain pen can give there was a big screen in the downstairs room mr preemby was to have that mr crumb had made and mrs crumb had covered with the bright mendacious wrappers of the books she had reviewed this exercised mr preemby the more because several of the wrappers were manifestly upside down and he could not understand whether this was due to art carelessness or some serious mental lapse well have something to eat she told mr preemby and then they could settle up things but she had a surprisingly rapid articulation and it sounded like well f sum teat n then well set lup thins it took ten or twelve seconds to come through to mr preembys understanding meanwhile she had turned to christina alberta dabit f work to do she explained bres no clear dway late las ni you ber loo roun he while nolly gessomeat an ikn do p stairs fore you seet right o said christina alberta understanding perfectly mr preemby was left stunned with his lips moving slowly so long said harold and took some money out of a black wedgwood tea pot and went and fell over things in the passage and presently went out into the wide world while fay vanished upstairs shes gone upstairs said mr preemby interpreting slowly to do their rooms and hes gone to get some meat its a nice large room christina alberta and quite well lit quite i dont think ive ever been in a mew before said mr preemby approaching a group of attractive drawings on the wall in a what daddy in a mew or in a studjo i suppose these are originals christina alberta awaited his reaction to the drawings with a slight anxiety looks like a lot of fruit and human legs and things said mr preemby wonder what they mean summer night it says and thats passion in solitude dont quite see it but i suppose its symbolical or something he turned his round blue eyes to the room generally i could get a mahogany cabinet for my curiosities and have it against the wall there id like the sort with glass doors so that people could see the things and if there was some shelves put across that place it would hold most of my books therell have to be a bed somewhere christina alberta theyve got a sofa upstairs said christina alberta with an end that pulls down might go there or under the window of course theres my clothes said mr preemby i almost wish i hadnt practically promised sam widgery your mothers wardrobe rosewood it is it has a lot of room in it and it might have gone against that bit of wall there the trunk will make a sort of seat if we get the corners mended wonder how that screen would look the other way up books might go behind it these easels and things i suppose theyll take upstairs well get things settled all right christina alberta turned about with arms akimbo to follow his proposals she perceived that they threatened a considerable disturbance of the sthetic balance of the studio shed just thought of a little bed sofa affair with a bright rug over it silly of her to forget the baggage but in the end perhaps it might be possible to arrest a lot of his gear in the passage the passage was so choked already that a little more in it hardly seemed to matter he could go out and get what things he wanted when he wanted them she had a momentary anticipation of him in his shirt and braces routing in trunks of course said mr preemby when you said youd got two little friends in a studjo i thought they were two girls i didnt think they were a married couple they arent so fearfully married said christina alberta no said mr preemby and was restrained by modesty from further speech for some seconds of course he said if presently a family came along well wed have to move out christina alberta never meet families half way said christina alberta it isnt very likely anyhow you trust fay you never know said mr preemby rather weakly and showed a tendency to drift back to those ambiguous drawings about time we had a look at the upstairs rooms daddy said christina alberta and went out into the passage to call fay the answer came remotely lo read dee not yet christina alberta found her daddy back in the illustrated corner with his head on one side like an inquiring sparrow for some time nothing was said of course he remarked at last its art he turned away with his face pursed up beneath the moustache humming faintly she perceived it was just as much art as he could stand he ran his hand over the wall and turned intelligent eyes to christina alberta its just canvas he said what you pack things in with sort of dabs of gold paint i dont think ive ever seen walls that wasnt either done with paper or distemper before i suppose really one might put all sorts of things on walls cloth bed ticking tarpaulin odd how one doesnt think of things presently upstairs was read ee mrs harold crumb was free to answer questions and make explanations and mr preemby could learn more of christina albertas plans for his comfort upstairs was more various but less spacious than downstairs the beds were dressed up rather than disguised as divans and there was more vaguely improper but highly decorative art like christina alberta mrs crumb had not fully considered mr preembys possibilities in the way of luggage but she rose to the occasion very well when mr preemby spoke of the mahogany cabinet and the wardrobe she said that it would be quite easy for harold to camouflage them with very very bright coloured paint and she thought a lot might be done for mr preembys trunks and clothes by making a curtained alcove in a corner trouble with clothes said mrs crumb is when somebody starts charades or dressing up nothing is sacred last week somebody tore my only pyjamas limb from limb wed have to arrange said mr preemby a little uneasily well have to arrange somehow said mrs crumb but before anything could be arranged definitely harold returned from his shopping with a large piece of purple beefsteak in a mere loin cloth of newspaper and a lettuce and a bundle of small onions in his hand and two large bottles of beer under his arm and everybodys attention was directed to the preparation of the midday meal generally said harold we go out for a meal theres quite a decent aufschnittery and a little italian place and so forth not five minutes away in the kings road its more fun feeding out but we thought youd like to see the studio put through its paces mr preemby in the course of his life had rarely seen meals prepared somebody else had always laid a table and said dinners ready daddy or suppers ready daddy as the case might be and he had just sat down and it was with real interest that he obeyed mr crumbs invitation to come and see how we do it and assisted under direction in the operations mr crumb in a few well chosen words introduced the cooking apparatus that clustered around the gas stove the gas stove was lit explosively mr preemby handed things and held things under direction and got in the way a good deal christina alberta who seemed used to the job chopped the onions and dressed a salad at a small kitchen table close at hand and the steak got itself grilled fiercely and flaringly meanwhile mrs crumb laid a blue painted table in what was to be mr preembys room with an orange coloured cloth and a selection of plates and parts of plates yellow glazed mugs with rudely painted inscriptions in some rustic dialect heres t absent frens and the like several knives and forks a pewter mug full of cigarettes and a bunch of sunflowers in a brown glazed bowl and at this table mr preemby presently found himself seated very hot in the face and liberally splashed with fat from the grilled steak nobody said grace and the meal began there was a general assumption that mr preembys tenancy was settled though there were many points upon which he would have liked a clearer definition he was particularly anxious to exclude as tactfully as possible his garments and his specimens from promiscuous use as properties when these charades occurred but he did not know quite how to reopen the subject and he was preoccupied by a doubt whether his long nightgowns of saxony flannel if they were publicly exposed might not be considered old fashioned by these artistic young people but their talk jumped about so that it was difficult to lead up to what he had to say he was accustomed especially when company was present to clear his throat hrrmp and waggle his moustache up and down a little before he spoke and by the time he was ready to deliver what he had to say one of the others was away with something else so that he hardly said anything but an occasional hrrmp all through the meal the two young ladies did most of the talking harold seemed moody making an occasional correction or comment upon his wifes remarks and eating most of the steak with the pained expression of one who has tender teeth and is used to better food once he asked mr preemby if he really cared for good music and once if he had been to see the iberian dancers last year but neither of these inquiries led to a sustained conversation hrrmp no oh said mr preemby not exactly not particularly and in the second case no oh i didnt mrs crumb talked brightly of various newspaper jobs she had got and how she had been asked to do a childrens corner in the patriotic news and whether she would accept the offer mr preemby thought the editors and newspaper proprietors she mentioned seemed a depraved lot but mainly the talk concerned the movements and readjustments of a large circle of friends after the meal there was coffee and harold with an air of resignation went and washed up there were many little things awaiting attention at the laundry and after two or three cigarettes mr preemby decided its time for us to be going christina alberta well work it out all right said harold on their departure there were intervals of meditation as mr preemby and christina alberta returned in the train from liverpool street to woodford wells its not what ive been accustomed to said mr preemby its all very different from the way your mother used to manage things less orderly of course i could keep my clothes locked up in my trunk youll do all right theyre perfect dears she loves you tremendously already said christina alberta but before she went to sleep that night christina alberta experienced compunction she felt compunction about these arrangements she was making for her daddy she doubted whether he would be truly comfortable and happy in that studio in lonsdale mews and able to lead the life of steadfast curiosity he anticipated with so much quiet pleasure ever humming to himself about it and working his moustache and saying hrrmp when he was not otherwise engaged this story it cannot be too often reiterated is the story of mr preemby who became as we shall tell in due course sargon king of kings but christina alberta has got herself hatched into this story very much like a young cuckoo in a wagtails nest and it is impossible to ignore her she was virtually in control of him and she had the egotism of her sex and age she had also a pitiless conscience it was almost the only thing she could not manage in her life it managed her it was a large crystalline conscience with no foundations and no relationships it just flooded by itself in her being it was her gravitational centre and the rest of her could not get away from it when christina alberta went up for examination and judgment before christina alberta there was no nonsense in the proceedings a fearful frankness it was cards on the table everything in evidence no etiquette not a stitch on x rays if necessary these examinations were all the more terrible because they were done in what was practically an empty room without screens curtains standards or general beliefs of any sort it is appalling to think of the drapery and function that was absent from christina albertas court of conscience in the first place christina alberta was completely and explicitly irreligious in the next she was theoretically anti social and amoral she did not believe in respectability christian morality the institution of the family the capitalist system or the british empire she would say so with extreme plainness and considerable detail except when her parent was about prevalent winds of sentiment did not stir her she did not find the prince of wales ravishing nor punch funny she thought modern dancing tiresome though she did it very well and wimbledon tennis and tennis talk an intolerable bore she favoured bolshevism because everybody she disliked abused it and she hoped for a world wide social revolution of an entirely destructive and cleansing type what was to follow this revolution christina alberta with the happy confidence of youth did not seem to mind it is not for us to speculate here why a young woman born and bred between woodford wells and central london in the opening years of the twentieth century should confront the world with a mind so entirely swept and void of positive and restraining convictions we put the fact on record and if she had been sustained by all the beliefs in christendom and a sure and certain respect for every detail of the social code whatever that code may be she could not have confronted the world with a more cheerful confidence nor with a stronger persuasion that christina alberta had to behave in some undefined fashion well christina alberta had to be christina alberta clear and sound or the court of conscience made things plain and hard for her christina alberta the court would say you are the dirtiest filthiest little thing that ever streaked the dust of life how do you propose to get clean again or christina alberta you have been lying again youll lie to me next first it was laziness made you lie and now it is cowardice what are you going to make of yourself christina alberta there came a time when the court had to address christina alberta in this fashion your nose christina alberta is large beyond comparison it will probably go on growing all your life as noses often do yet you are setting yourself out to charm and fascinate teddy winterton you go to places where you think you will meet him you fuss and preen yourself like any female idiot you dream all sorts of things about him disgraceful things you are soppy on this young man in spite of the fact that you know he is no sort of good you like him to touch you you sit and look at him foolishly and you gloat does he gloat on you isnt it time you considered where you are going christina alberta and now the court was in full session and the charge the charge for which there was no defence was that she was going to take her absurd unprotected daddy and entrust him and his foolishness and his silly books and his ridiculous treasures and all his dreams and desires to the insecure and unsympathetic studio of the crumbs not because of any vague and general hunger for london though that was in the background but because that studio was frequented by the all too seductive teddy because there she had met him and danced wildly with him and been suddenly and astonishingly kissed by him and kissed him and then he had beguiled her to learn a dance with him and had got her to come to tea with him at his studio to meet his sister who hadnt turned up and there had been other meetings he was impudent and provocative and evasive all her being was in a state of high excitement about him coldly and exactly now the court unfolded the operations of her mind to her showed how the thought of teddy always present and never admitted had guided her decision to harbour with the crumbs only now did she come to confession and clear vision you have lied to yourself christina alberta said the court and that is the worst sort of lie what are you going to do about it i cant let the crumbs down now they count upon us you are in a mess christina alberta you are in a worse mess than we thought you were soppy you are about teddy winterton why not call things by their right names you are in love perhaps something frightful has happened to you little rabbits run about the hedges and every day is like every other day for them they waggle their little noses and wiggle their little tails and do what they like with their paws until one day there is a ping and the snare snaps on the little furry foot and everything you try to do after that is different the snare holds your movements and you must just dance round it and squeal if you like till the man comes along is that what has happened to you and for teddy teddy with that open lying face no said christina alberta i dont love him i dont love him ive been silly and soppy and adrift i am no more worthy to be called christina alberta but it hasnt got me yet and it shant get me ill pull daddy out of it and myself out of it i vow and swear hm said the court it seemed to mr preemby that the first evening he spent in his new quarters in lonsdale mews was the most eventful evening in his life impressions crowded upon each other insomnia was not among his habits but when at last he lay upon his shake up bed he was kept awake for most of what was left of the night it was the frayed piece with the bleak dawn in the middle of it trying to get these same impressions sorted out impressions about his new surroundings impressions about christina alberta impressions of new and unprecedented personalities a marmalade of impressions mr preemby and christina alberta arrived at the studio according to plan about half past three but the picton van which had started that morning with mr preembys bags and trunks and the crates of books and curiosities and the late mrs preembys roomy wardrobe which had after all been rescued from the clutches of sam widgery did not arrive until it was nearly six unfortunately the furniture dealer in brompton road from whom mr preemby had purchased a specimen cabinet and a long low walnut bookcase had delivered these articles the day before and all the animosity of the modern artist towards self assertive wood had been aroused in harold he and fay and a friend or so who had dropped in had sat up quite late painting these new pieces a deep ultramarine blue with stars and splashes of gold like the paper they put around the necks of ayala tsarist and suchlike champagnes when mr preemby saw their handiwork he could scarcely believe it was the same specimen cabinet and bookcase i suppose one could get it off again said mr preemby but see how they are assimilated by the room said harold in high expostulation i mean if we moved at any time said mr preemby i know its art and it goes with the things here very nicely but theres neighbourhoods i wouldnt like to move into not with these things as they are you dont know what peoples imaginations are like matters went a little tediously until the arrival of the picton van the sofa bed was arranged and rearranged the bed things blankets sheets and pillow cases were to be put in a bundle on the top of mr preembys flat trunk behind the book wrapper screen we shall have to find some other place for the bottled beer said harold its too hot in the kitchen and too dangerous in the passage but ive an idea we might have it in the scullery under the sink with a cloth over it and water dripping on the cloth evaporation ill see about it mr preemby was surprised by a yawn i suppose youd like to have some tea said fay suddenly and she and christina alberta prepared some harold was obviously in a strained and nervous state mr preembys patient little figure sitting about hands on knees waiting for pictons van looking at things with innocent eyes and saying hrrmp had much the same effect of nervous dislocation upon harold that the mild and patient camel has on a horse harold chafed and pranced he walked about and went upstairs and out and returned he smoked endless cigarettes and pressed endless cigarettes upon mr preemby he made recondite remarks in a strained voice all this is like something out of dostoievsky he said to mr preemby in a different scheme of colouring of course different but the same dont you think so mr preemby mr preemby nodded his head in a sympathetic humorous not too explicit manner hrrmp he said it is a bit like that things will work themselves out said harold things will work themselves out you know that poem of ruby parhams he cleared his throat it is called waiting he said it goes like this his eyes became fixed and glazed his voice gathered volume so that the words seemed more than life sized after every minute comes another minute and then rest assured another like drops from a ledge in the rain you may not want to go on but they will oh endlessly taking your life away death not final and complete but death in the midst of life particles of death death by attrition drip on old death in life slow dull implacable unendurable drip on that drip on is great but perhaps you dont like modern poetry i dont mind it said mr preemby genially of course nothing of a really destructive nature can have happened to that van said mr crumb in a pessimistic tone when pictons van arrived and the roomy wardrobe began its destructive march through the passage mr crumb called suddenly upon his maker in a loud distressful voice and vanished for the better part of an hour christina alberta was torn between a sympathetic understanding of harolds state of mind and the fear that her daddy might perceive the unfavourable reaction he produced in harold and be hurt by it she and fay became brightly helpful with the unpacking if i might have one of those blue pinafores of mr crumbs to put on said mr preemby id be glad these black things of mine show every mark mr crumbs overall reached far below mr preembys knees and somehow justified his calling it a pinafore it brought out something endearingly infantile in his appearance that appealed to the maternal instinct lurking in mrs crumb she struggled with a persuasion that he was really a little boy of nine who had been naughty and grown a big moustache and that she had to take care of him and restrain him and generally tell him not to the books were put in the bookshelves as mr preemby said just anyhow they could be sorted up later but the curiosities and specimens took longer and had to be put out more or less in the cabinet there were not only real curiosities and specimens but many little things that mr preemby had accumulated because they looked like curiosities and specimens there was for instance a piece of one of the laundry delivery van mudguards so bent by a collision as to resemble a human torso in the most striking fashion there was the almost complete skull of an unknown mammal probably a fallow deer picked up in epping forest there was a potato now rather shrivelled in which it was possible to detect thirty seven distinct human faces and specimen of an entirely different quality a large flint in which there were no less than fifty five ages ago some primordial preemby had discovered and loved that very same flint and had brought out the likenesses by chipping an eye here or a nostril there but mr preemby did not suspect the help of that remote and perhaps ancestral hand even in waking life mr preemby saw faces in everything what he would have been like with a high temperature it is impossible to imagine christina albertas anxiety about her fathers reception by the crumbs diminished as she saw his virtual conquest of fay fay treated him firmly but indulgently and they lost a good deal of time while she tried to see all the fifty five faces of the wonderful flint they had to start and start again but always they lost count about twen tee or twen tee one the question would arise whether they were counting one of the faces over again harold returned in a moody state and could be heard all too distinctly kicking mr preembys packing cases in the hall but fay went out to him with a lofty sleep walking expression in her pale eyes and the concussions ceased and presently harold came downstairs again looking almost handsome in nankeen trousers a blue jacket with big silver buttons and a voluminous black tie and was quite nice to mr preemby you wont mind my touching that wardrobe of yours up a bit he said it damps us off as it is kind of reproaches us one of us has to be altered you see it or me and either i paint it or else i get a silk hat with a deep mourning band and a gold handled umbrella which would cost no end of money whereas i have the paint if you can get the paint off again said mr preemby you see if i was to move back its all right to have all this paint in a mew but out of a mew exactly said harold my idea is to make a little pink house of it with windows and so on something very simple rather like the scenery of a russian sketch chauve souris sort of stuff conventional to the nth and we might put up placards at the corner of it according to what is going on make a bit of an institution of it so long as it makes things agreeable said mr preemby he found his hair being ruffled affectionately dear little daddy said christina alberta but now appeared a new comer and life was made uncomfortable and complicated for christina alberta again by the presence of mr teddy wintertons candid insincerity his graceful body his movements his voice stirred her senses as she hated them to be stirred his quiet impudence invaded her sense of humour he wounded her pride and she longed to be even with him she had no power over him and he behaved as if he owned her she was always letting him go just a little too far when he was about her nose cast a shadow that reached to her horizon he stood now in the doorway trousers of one pattern of tweed waistcoat of another norfolk jacket of a third extensively unbuttoned in the accepted student style and he watched mr preemby carry his collection of rocs bones found near staines across the studio on a tea tray his eyes were round with surprise and amusement his mouth said noiselessly what is it christina alberta was not going to have her daddy laughed at by any teddy winterton mr winterton she said this is my father ill just get rid of my bones said mr preemby and then ill shake hands well just finish up mr preembys things and then well all go round to poppinettis to get some dinner said fay theres hardly anything left to unpack now just one or two antediluvium bones said mr preemby teddy seized upon one this he said inspecting it is a fossil rhinoceros thigh bone from the crag its an antediluvium horse said mr preemby forgive me its a rhinoceros bone horses had rhinoceros bones in those days said mr preemby and the rhinoceroses they were incredible if i had one i shouldnt have anywhere to put it mr preemby was extracted from his overall and restored to the black coat and the grey felt hat with the black band he became one of a straggling party that went out of lonsdale mews to a little italian restaurant in the kings road three neighbours of the crumbs mixed themselves up with the party a very quiet man with silver hair and a young man and a dusky girl mr preemby was much impressed by the novelty of thus going out for dinner and expatiated on its advantages to the silver haired man who seemed to be the quiet sort of listening man that mr preemby liked to meet you see you dont have to cook the meal and you dont have to lay the table and afterwards naturally there isnt any washing up but i expect it comes more expensive the silver haired man nodded intelligently exactly he said harold crumb overheard this expensive he said it isnt no every other crime poppinetti can commit but that is barred by the circumstances of his clientele he feeds us on stolen pigeons his dinde is guinea pig his beef a lomnibus what he minces god knows what he puts into his ravioli makes even the lord god repent of his extreme creativeness but you see you dont think about his ravioli you eat em and theyre damned good there are always flowers on the table and an effect of inexpensive refinement you will see you will see mr preemby saw poppinetti was a small man but carefully modelled on caruso and he received his large party with the deference of a diplomatist and the effusion of a geyser he was particularly gracious to mr preemby bowing profoundly to him and saluting him with great richness subsequently whenever he caught his eye he seemed to mr preemby to spend the rest of their time together going to remoter and remoter parts of the restaurant in order to catch mr preembys eye and bow and smile to him from greater and greater distances mr preemby had curious doubts whether he wasnt being mistaken for somebody else signor poppinetti with an air of peculiar favour guided the party to a long unattractive table near the centre of the restaurant and took their conflicting orders with the gestures of a conductor guiding an orchestra through a difficult passage mr preemby was passive but observant he presently found himself eating macaroni and drinking a rough red wine with a name that sounded to his london tuned ears like a challenge chianti harold crumb showed great earnestness in the matter of macaroni in order to taste macaroni he assured mr preemby it is necessary to fill the mouth absolutely full good measure pressed in and running over to cut up macaroni with your fork as you are doing is as awful as to cut an oyster it it devitalizes it i like it cut up said mr preemby with unexpected firmness and he cut up some more otherwise he said in a confidential aside to the silver haired man i cant help thinking its earthworms exactly exactly said the silver haired man harold exemplified generously his rampant face riding over a squirming mouthful of macaroni was like st george and the dragon on an english sovereign he whistled as he ate long snakes of macaroni hung thoughtful for a moment and then drawn by some incomprehensible fascination fled into him teddy winterton and one of the new comers from the studio next door emulated him christina alberta and fay showed the furtive dexterity of the female but mr preemby was glad when macaroni was over even though it raised the problem of eating an egg on spinach with a fork but he was not really troubled in his mind as a younger man might have been he had the savoir faire of middle age this restaurant dinner was on the whole a bright and agreeable experience for him he liked even the corrosive taste of the chianti this chianti you drank out of quite largish tumblers because it was almost as cheap and light as beer it did not intoxicate but it warmed the mind and it cast a pleasant and convincing indistinctness over the universe so that the tunbridges all became tumbridges without any question and the secret dreams and convictions of the heart became certain knowledge presently mr preemby found himself able and willing to tell things and hint much more important things about his collections to the white haired man and also to the dark untidy girl who was sitting on his other side and who came from the other studio and about whose name he had no idea and presently to others and when the bird came it was a bird new to mr preemby and called he gathered rabbkey or turkit most of the party was talking in the loud confused explosive way these young people affected about the lost atlantis he had never spoken so freely before upon this topic at home he had always been restrained by the late mrs preembys genuine lack of interest and even now he was not prepared for positive statements or for an encounter with sceptical arguments about that great lost continent of the golden age atlantis had been the scene and substance of his secret reveries for many years he knew his knowledge of it was of a different order from common knowledge more intuitive mystical profound from the outset his manner was defensive discreet and obscure as of one willing but not permitted to speak how did he know that there had been this lost continent hrrmp he said with the faint smile of peculiar knowledge studied it for years what is the evidence asked the untidy young lady so abundant impossible to retail it convincing of various sorts plato has much about it unfinished fragment many books have been written many inscriptions in egypt what sort of people were they asked the untidy girl very wonderful people young lady said mr preemby hrrmp very wonderful people philosophy no end i suppose asked the young man from the next studio with his mouth full what we know a mere remnant said mr preemby mere remnant how did they dress hrrmp robes white robes extremely dignified blue azure when justice was administered plato tells us that much could they fly they understood it it was not made a practice of motor cars all that sort of thing if they wanted to there was less motoring more meditation we live age of transition hrrmp and then it all went phut said the young man from the next studio submerged and all that what a lesson that need not have happened said mr preemby darkly mr preemby became dimly aware of scepticism theres not an atom of evidence that there ever was a continent in the atlantic mr teddy winterton was saying to christina alberta within thirty million years of anything human the ocean troughs go right back to the mesozoic age mr preemby would have noticed this remark but the untidy girl asked him suddenly if he did not think that the swastika was a symbol derived from atlantis he said he was quite certain it was she asked what it meant exactly she had always been curious about its significance and he became guarded and mysterious she wanted moreover to know things about the costume of that lost world about its social customs about its religion were women citizens she was certainly the most intelligent about it of all the company the silver haired man seemed to be faintly amused the rest of the company wandered off into a discussion of the possibility of going to the chelsea arts ball in the character of a party from the lost atlantis many of their ideas mr preemby thought trivial and undignified leaves us unlimited scope said harold crumb we could invent weapons have wings if we liked magic carbuncles on our shields illuminated mysterious books and tablets and a sort of peculiar wailing drumming music mya mya mya he pursed up his face and made a curious mooing noise with it to convey his intention twiddling his fingers to assist the effect it was no good protesting against such imaginative ignorance but to the dark untidy girl and to the acquiescent man with silvery hair mr preemby continued to be quietly oracular and communicative from behind his moustache but how are these things known the dark girl persisted there is nothing in the british museum you forget said mr preemby hrrmp the freemasons there are inner groups traditions thank you just half a glass more oh youve filled it thank you as he talked he was aware of something going on between christina alberta and winterton at first it seemed not to matter in the slightest degree but to be just part of the general unusualness of the gathering and then it seemed to matter a great deal he saw christina albertas little fist resting on the table and suddenly wintertons hand enveloped it she snatched her hand away then something was whispered and her hand came back in another moment the hands were five inches apart and it was as if nothing had ever happened between them he would probably have forgotten the momentary invasion of his attention by christina alberta if something else had not occurred at the phase of dessert poppinettis idea of dessert was a sort of lottery of walnuts if you found a sound one you won masses of compressed and damaged dates and a few defiant apples there was a great crackling the company was littering the table with walnut shells and the green black and yellow corruption they had contained when this second incident caught mr preembys eye he saw teddy winterton run his hand very softly along christina albertas forearm and her arm was not withdrawn every one was talking just then and for a moment it seemed to mr preemby that he alone had seen and then he caught an observant expression on the face of the silver haired man it was all very confusing and this chianti though it was really not intoxicating made everything swimmy but mr preemby knew somehow that the silver haired man had also seen that furtive familiarity and that he too didnt quite approve of it ought one to take notice ought one to say anything perhaps afterwards perhaps when they were alone together he might ask her quietly are you and that young man winterton engaged a bit too much said mr preemby quietly meeting the eye of the silver haired man i dont like that sort of thing quite said the silver haired man i shall speak to her youre right there said the silver haired man warmly a very sensible fellow a great rustle and a scraping of chairs poppinetti figuring upon an accounts pad came to collect the money ill pay for us daddy said christina alberta and well settle up afterwards poppinetti bowing poppinetti on mr preembys right and on mr preembys left several poppinettis bowing a great activity of poppinettis handing hats and so forth poppinettis whichever way you turned the restaurant rotating slightly was this chianti perhaps stronger than mr preemby had been led to believe a number of poppinettis opening a number of doors and saying polite things difficult to choose a door right the first time out into the street people going by taxis no more poppinettis but a girl ought not to let a young man stroke her arm at dinner when anyone might see it happen it wasnt correct something had to be said something tactful mr preemby became aware that he was walking next to mrs crumb it was lovely to hear you talking about the new atlantis she said i wish i had been sitting nearer hrrmp said mr preemby something very nice about mrs crumb what was it not so fearfully married but married quite enough mr preemby thought they were going back for coffee and a little talk and then bed he had no idea of the immense amount of evening still before him he knew nothing as yet of the capacity for sitting up late and getting lively in the small hours possessed by this new world of young people into which christina alberta had led him and in a sort of hectic discontinuous way they were lively for hours it became vaguely evident to mr preemby that there was a periodic day set apart by mrs crumb for evening gatherings in the studio and that this evening he had chosen for his settling down was such an evening fresh people dropped in one it seemed was a portentous arrival he came in quite soon after the return from poppinettis he was very fat and broad a white faced man of forty or so rather short of breath with exceedingly intelligent eyes under a broad forehead and a rather loose peevish mouth he carried himself with the involuntary self consciousness of a man who thinks he is pointed out his name it seemed was paul lambone and he had written all sorts of things everybody treated him with a faint deference he greeted christina alberta with great warmth hows the newest van he said shaking her hand as though he liked it and speaking with a singularly small voice for so ample a person hows the last step in advance youve got to meet my father said christina alberta has it got a father i thought it just growed like topsy out of nietzsche and bernard shaw and all the rest of them hrrmp said mr preemby mr lambone turned to him what a handful a daughter is he said and bowed slightly towards christina alberta even the best of them mr preemby replied after the manner of the parents in woodford wells shes a good daughter to me sir yes but they arent like sons you have sons sir i presume only dream children ive not had your courage to realize things ive married a hundred times in theory and here i am just a sort of bachelor uncle to everybody poking in among the younger people and observing their behaviour with his intelligent eyes looked quietly over his garrulous mouth at christina alberta terror and admiration two other visitors appeared in the doorway and mr lambone turned from mr preemby to greet them as soon as fay had done her welcome a fierce looking young man with an immense head of black hair and a little lady like a china doll dressed to remind one of watteau conversation became general and mr preemby receded into the background of events he found himself side by side with his friend with the silver hair against his bookcase i didnt expect a party he said i thought so too i only got here this afternoon the vans came late and lots of my things are still to be unpacked the silver haired man nodded sympathetically often the case he murmured every one was talking loudly it was difficult to hear it was confused sort of talking and whenever two or three seemed to be interested in what they were saying fay crumb went and interrupted them as a good hostess should other people only vaguely apprehended by mr preemby got into the studio somehow there was a red haired young lady with a tremendous decolletage behind you could see almost to her waist he hrrmpd at it and thought of saying something about it something cold and quiet to the silver haired man but he didnt he couldnt think of anything sufficiently cold and quiet to say fay crumb came and asked whether he would like some whisky or beer not on the top of that nice chianti thank you said mr preemby the conversation seemed to get noisier and noisier in one corner harold crumb could be heard quoting the poems of vachel lindsay then mr lambone came up and seemed to want to talk about the lost atlantis but mr preemby was shy of talking about the lost atlantis with mr lambone getting on all right daddy said christina alberta drifting by and not waiting for any answer but an hrrmp there appeared three young people with a gramophone they explained they had just bought and fay discovered that the beer had been forgotten and sent harold out to borrow some from a neighbour these new comers made no very profound impression on mr preembys now jaded mind except that one of them the owner of the gramophone a very fair young man with a long intelligent nose was wearing the big horn of the gramophone as a headdress and that he meant to have that gramophone going whatever else might occur the music was dance music jazz for the most part and a few waltzes and it revived mr preemby considerably he sat up and beat time with the leg bones of a roc and presently two or three couples were dancing on the studio floor curious dancing mr preemby thought almost like walking jiggety walking with sudden terrific back swipes of the legs there was an interruption when harold returned with the borrowed beer bringing its lenders with it then there was a general clamour for christina alberta and teddy to do their dance teddy was quite willing but christina alberta seemed reluctant and when mr preemby saw the dance he was not surprised hrrmp he said and stroked his moustache and looked at the silver haired man it really was too familiar altogether for some moments the principals vanished upstairs and came back altered for some reason teddy had adopted a cloth cap and a red neck wrap he was in fact being an apache and the bearing of christina alberta had become very proud and spirited with her arms akimbo every one backed against the walls to clear a dancing floor at the beginning it wasnt so bad but presently this mr teddy was pitching christina alberta about throwing her over his shoulder taking hold of her bending her backward holding her almost upside down both legs in the air and her hands dragging on the ground and she was red and excited and seemed to like these violent familiarities there was a kind of undesirable suitability between them for such purposes she and teddy looked into each others eyes with a sort of intimacy and yet with a sort of fierce defiance at one point in the extraordinary dance she had to smack his face a good hard smack nicely timed she did it with a spirit that made every one applaud whereupon he smiled and took her nice little neck in his hands and strangled her with great realism then the gramophone had its death rattle and the dance was over mr preembys throat had not troubled him much since dinner but now he said hrrmp repeatedly they wanted christina alberta bright and panting and shock headed to repeat the performance but she wouldnt she had had a glimpse of the solemn dismay and perplexity upon her daddys face the people from the studio next door were the next to give a display they obliged with an imitation of a russian imitation of a peasant dance from saratoff there was a gramophone record that was not quite the proper music but it would do that dance really amused mr preemby the young man went down quite close to the floor and kicked out his feet with the greatest agility and the girl was as wooden as a doll every one clapped hands in time to the music and so did mr preemby and then came a further irruption five people in fancy dress demanding beer they impressed mr preemby as strange and bright coloured but totally uninteresting one wore a red coxcomb and was dressed as a jester in cap and bells the others just wore tights and bright things that signified nothing at all they had been at some party given by somebody or other for the young people they announced with shouts they shut down at midnight yes they shut down at midnight when the young people go to bed it was only too manifest that no lonsdale mews meant to do nothing of the sort beer mr preemby declined the last of the beer cigarettes much smoke the last of the whisky more gramophone more dancing and harold crumbs voice loose again in recitation beer or whisky had thickened it but there were countervailing noises movement a circle was cleared not more dancing no feats of strength and dexterity with chairs performed chiefly by teddy winterton the gramophone owner and harold this stunting stopped presently and the company flowed back towards the middle of the room talk mr preemby could not follow phrases he could not understand nobody taking the slightest notice of him a sense of weariness and futility and desolation came upon him how differently were the evenings of the past spent by the good wise people of the lost atlantis philosophical discourse they had the lute the lyre elevated thoughts he caught sight of mrs crumb yawning furtively suddenly stupendously he yawned and yawned again yaaw he said to paul lambone who was at his side proyawaw prolly thiswe sitting on my beawawd you live here said mr lambone come to day christina albyawawawter arranged it the devil she did said mr lambone and looked across the studio at her for some moments he seemed lost in thought very remarkable young woman that daughter of yours he said makes me feel old fashioned he looked at the wrist watch he wore half past one he said ill start the go mr preemby heard a few sentences of the parting between teddy winterton and christina alberta yes or no said teddy no said christina alberta with emphasis not a bit of it said teddy i dont want to she said but you do oh go to the devil not as if there were risks i shant come its preposterous i shall wait all the same you may wait little chrissy hesitation anything to please you it took until past two oclock for the go paul lambone had started to remove the last of the company all hands to the bedmaking cried fay it isnt always like this mr preemby confess i feel tired said mr preemby had a long day of it christina alberta regarded him with belated compunction it just happened like this she said not used to such late hours said mr preemby sitting on his bed when at last it was made and he did a yawn that almost dislocated his jaw night said fay yawning also well turn in said harold so long mr preemby the yawning seized upon harold also what a face he had goo i gawooi i the door closed upon them there was much to say to christina alberta but it was too late and mr preemby was too weary to say it now and also he had no idea what it was he ought to say a casual remark fell out i liked that man with the white hair he said did you said christina alberta absently he was intelligent he took a great interest in the lost atlantis hes stone deaf said christina alberta and hes ashamed of it poor dear oh said mr preemby all this is going to be rather noisy for you daddy she said coming to what she had in mind it is a bit ramshackle said mr preemby we ought to go to tunbridge wells quite soon and look round there to morrow said mr preemby not to morrow why not the next day said christina alberta im not quite sure about to morrow id sort of half promised to go somewhere else but it doesnt matter very much really id like to go to tumbridge wells to morrow said mr preemby why not said christina alberta as if to herself and hesitated se walked to the door and came back good night little daddy she said are we going then to morrow no yes i dont know i had planned to do something to morrow important in a kind of way well go to morrow daddy she walked away from him with her arms akimbo and stared at those queer pictures she spun round on her feet i cant go to morrow she said yes i will she contradicted oh hell she cried in a most unaccountable and unladylike way i dont know what to do mr preemby looked at her with grave and weary eyes this was a new christina alberta to him she ought not to swear she did not ought to swear shed caught it up from these people she didnt know what it meant he must talk to her to morrow about that and one or two other things but heavens how tired he was you he yawned you must take care of yourself christina alberta he said ill do that all right daddy trust me she came and sat down beside him on his little half fictitious bed we cant decide to night daddy were too tired well settle to morrow have to see what the weathers like for one thing wouldnt do to walk about tunbridge if it was wet well decide about everything to morrow when our heads are cool why you dear little daddy its just upon half past two she put her arm round his shoulders and kissed him on the top of his head and the lobe of his ear he loved her to touch him and kiss him he did not understand in the least how much he loved her to kiss him dear tired little daddy she said in her softest voice you are ever so kind to me good night she had gone for some time mr preemby sat quite motionless in a state of almost immobile thought the floor of the studio was littered with burnt matches and cigarette ends and the air smelt of stale smoke and beer on the blue painted table stood an empty beer bottle and two or three glasses containing dregs of beer and cigarette ash it was all very different from woodford wells very different indeed but it was experience mr preemby bestirred himself to undress that night shirt of saxony flannel had still to be unpacked in the morning christina alberta was still restless and quite undecided about going to tunbridge wells though the weather was perfectly fine about half past eleven she disappeared and after a light lunch with fay harold was out also it became evident to mr preemby that the visit to tunbridge wells was postponed for the day so he went to south kensington to look at the museums there he did not go into them actually he just looked at them and at the colleges and buildings generally it was a preliminary reconnaissance the museums were quite good to look at larger more extensive than the british museum probably they contained all sorts of things christina alberta reappeared in the studio about half past six looking very bright and exalted there was something about her subtly triumphant she offered no explanation of her disappearance she was full of the visit to tunbridge on the morrow they must catch a train soon after nine and have a good long day she was unusually affectionate to her daddy harold was out for the evening and fay had some reviewing to do so they had quite a quiet and domestic evening mr preemby read with a varying attention a nice deep confusing book he had found in the room upstairs called fantasia of the unconscious about the lost atlantis and similar things chapter the fourth the petunia boarding house most places in the world have sister cities and twins and parallels but tunbridge wells is tunbridge wells and there is nothing really like it upon our planet not that it is in any way strange or fantastic but because of its brightly delicate distinction it is clean and open and just pleasantly absurd it is not more than thirty miles from london as the crow flies but the north downs six miles away dismiss with a serene and gracious gesture all thoughts of london from the mind it is away from the main line out of london inconvenient for season ticket holders there is no direct route for the hurrying motorist over those saving downs to dover and kent generally he goes to the east of it and to brighton he goes to the west if he survive the hills of westerham and sevenoaks rich mens estates encircle it with accessible parks eridge bayham penshurst park knole and the like protect it from overmuch breeding of little villa residences there it lies on a rare piece of rocky soil dry underfoot airy and wholesome with its friendly common in the midst of it its spa of evil tasting beneficent waters as the stuart princesses drank them its pantiles and its pump room much as dr johnson knew the place mount sion and mount ephraim beulah road and something evangelical in the air remind the light minded visitor that london in the past was a puritan city many a serious liver has been touched and found grace at tunbridge wells many a light liver has found fresh strength there and thither came mr preemby and christina alberta seeking a boarding house and they could have sought it in no more favourable locality they set about the search in a systematic way as became a couple one of whom had been partially trained for sociological research at the london school of economics and partially trained for business at the tomlinson school mr preemby had been for beginning with a general look round just walking round and looking quietly at things for a bit but christina alberta consulted all the agents in order and bought a map and guide to the town and sat down on a seat on the common and planned the operations that led quite readily and easily to the petunia boarding house in the guide mr preemby read with approval some very promising words listen to this my dear he said hrrmp general characteristics emphasis might very well be laid on the character enjoyed by tunbridge wells as a magnet for high class residents and visitors the town is never overrun with trippers nor are its streets ever defiled by the vulgar or the inane its inhabitants are composed for the most part of well to do people who naturally create a social atmosphere tinged by culture and refinement tinged is a jolly good word for it i expect said christina alberta i think my instinct has guided me aright to this place said mr preemby the petunia boarding house looks obliquely upon the common from where petunia road runs into the quaint and pleasant high street it has not the towering magnificence of the wellington the royal mount ephraim the marlborough or their fellows which face the sun so bravely from the hill crest above the common but it is a house of dignified comfort the steps the portico the ample hall the name in letters of gold on black made mr preemby say hrrmp several times an excessively chubby maid in a very very tight black dress and a cap and apron came and looked at mr and miss preemby with a distraught evasive expression answered some preliminary questions incoherently and said she would call miss emily rewster miss margaret was out thereupon miss emily rewster who had been hovering attentively behind a bead curtain thrust it aside and came ingratiatingly into the foreground she was a little high coloured old lady with an air of genteel savoir faire she had a lace cap and wore a great deal of lace and several flounces and she had the most frankly dyed chestnut hair that christina alberta had ever seen was it just for a week or so mr preemby wanted to come or something perheps more permanent explanations were exchanged mr preemby was to be more permanent christina alberta intermittent and rather a difficulty the existence of headquarters in chelsea was revealed discreetly but not the fact that they were in a mews miss emily rewster thought christina alberta could be fitted in if she wasnt too particular about having the same room or exactly the same sort of room every time she came we have to menage said miss emily rewster so long as the window opens said christina alberta the rooms exhibited were very satisfactory hrrmp very satisfactory a glimpse of a bathroom was given you say when you want one said miss emily rewster there was a dining room with separate tables and there were flowers on every table very refined and pleasant and there was a large drawing room with a piano and a great number of arm chairs and sofas wearing flounces so like the flounces of miss emily rewster and antimacassars so like her cap and with so entirely her air of accommodating receptiveness that it seemed as though they must be at least her cousins who had joined her in the enterprise the piano wore a sort of lace bed spread and there were polished tables bearing majolica pots of aspidistra on mats and little less serious tables for use and there was a low bookcase with books in it and a great heap of illustrated papers on the top the hall expanded at the back into a rather modernish lounge where two ladies were having tea and there was also a smoking room where said miss emily rewster to christina alberta rather coyly the gentlemen smoke weve been very full this season said miss emily rewster very full weve had nearly thirty sitting at dinner but of course the season is drawing in now just at present were down to nine at breakfast and seven at dinner two gentlemen in business here but people come and people go ive had two inquiries by post to day one an invalid lady and her sister they think of drinking the waters and there are birds of passage as well as regulars just for a night or so motor families they take us en route thats where we have an advantage in being so close to the shops she beamed intimately at mr preemby often my sister or i pop out at the last moment and get in things ourselves when every one else is busy we dont mind any little trouble if it makes people comfortable weve been on the separate table system ever since the war said miss emily rewster so much more pleasant you can keep yourself quate to yourself if you wish or you can be friendly people often speak in the drawing room or in the smoking room and they bow sometimes people get quate friendly play games get up excursions together quate pleasant christina alberta asked an obvious question very pleasant people indeed said miss emily very pleasant people a retired gentleman and his wife and her stepdaughter and two retired maiden ladies and a gentleman and his lady who has been in a forest in burmah and so on christina alberta restrained a ribald impulse to ask what a retired gentleman or a retired maiden lady really meant ive always been attracted to tumbridge wells said mr preemby royal tunbridge wells if you please said miss emily radiantly the royal was added in nineteen nine you know by gracious command of his majesty i didnt know said mr preemby with profound respect and tried it over royal tumbridge wells makes it rather a mouthful said christina alberta a very pleasant mouthful for us i can assure you said miss emily loyally the petunia boarding house seemed so satisfactory to mr preemby that it was arranged that he should return the next day but one bringing with him some clothes and other luggage and that christina alberta was to come and stay with him for a few days there was a little room upstairs she could have and then she would go back to london and her studies and take her chance of coming again when there was a room for her in the train back to london mr preemby rehearsed these arrangements and made his plans i shall come down here the day after to morrow after i have put my collections in order at the mew i shall put the best things so that they can be seen through the glass of the cabinet but i think i shall lock them up and i shall bring down a few necessary books and then when i have quite settled in i shall go and have a good look at these celebrated rocks here we could come down in the morning said christina alberta and go and look at them in the afternoon not the same afternoon said mr preemby no i want my mind to be quite fresh and open when i look at the rocks i think it will be best to see them quite early after a nights sleep when there are no other visitors i think i think christina alberta that for the first time id better go to them quite alone without you sometimes you say things christina alberta you dont mean to say them of course but they put me out christina alberta reflected what do you expect to find at these rocks daddy mr preemby waved his moustache and the rest of his face slowly from side to side i go with an open mind he said perhaps all of atlantis was not lost some of it may be hidden there are legends preserved by the philosopher plato partly in cipher who knows it may be here it may be in africa a plan a sign the toad rock must be most singular in the british museum there is a toad rock from central america he mused pleasantly for a time i shall take a note book he said and several coloured pencils he continued to meditate his next remark came after an interval of three or four minutes and was a surprise for christina alberta i hope my dear said mr preemby that among all these artists and people you are not getting ram shackle i should be sorry to think you were getting ram shackle said mr preemby but daddy what makes you think i may be getting ram shackle asked christina alberta one or two little things i saw at the mew said mr preemby just one or two little things youve got to be careful christina alberta a girl has to take care of herself and your friends decidedly ram shackle dont mind my making a remark about them christina alberta just a word in season christina albertas answer came after a little interval and without her usual confident ring dont you worry about me daddy she said im all right mr preemby seemed about to change the subject then he remarked i dont like that feller teddy winterton hes too familiar i dont like him either said christina alberta he is too familiar thats all right said mr preemby i thought you didnt notice and relapsed into meditation but this sudden and unprecedented intervention in her personal affairs made christian alberta thoughtful for all the rest of the way to london ever and again she glanced furtively at her daddy he seemed to have forgotten her but it was dreadfully true teddy winterton had become altogether too familiar in all ages competent observers have noted the erratic unexpectedness of destiny and now christina alberta was to add her own small experience to this ever accumulating testimony it seemed to her that in planting him out in the wholesome quiet of royal tunbridge wells she was securing for her daddy the very best possible conditions for a happy and harmless life there had indeed been a notable change in the little man since her mothers death a release of will a new freedom of expression a disposition to comment and even form judgments upon things about him she had herself likened it to the germination of a seed brought out of a suppressing aridity into moisture and the light but she had not followed up that comparison so far as to speculate what efflorescences might arise out of this belated unfolding of his initiatives that here of all places he would meet just the stimulus that was needed for the most fantastic expansions of his imaginative life that for him tunbridge wells should prove the way out of this everyday world of ours into what was to be for him an altogether more wonderful and satisfactory existence never entered her head for three days until a fretting urgency for events carried her back to london she stayed in the petunia boarding house and for all those three days there was no intimation of the great change in his mind that impended on the whole he seemed unusually dull and quiet during those three days he liked tunbridge wells very much he said but he was greatly disappointed by the high rocks and by the toad rock when he came to examine them he even doubted whether they were not simply natural this was a terrible concession he tried hard to believe that the toad rock was like one of the big maya carvings of a toad from yucatan a cast of which he had seen in the british museum but it was evident that with all the will possible he could not manage so great an act of faith all the decoration he declared all the inscription had been obliterated and then making the great blonde moustache bristle like a clothes brush there never were any decorations or inscriptions never it was clear to christina alberta that he must have evolved very extraordinary expectations indeed to be so much cast down she found herself very interested in the riddle of what was fermenting in his mind it seemed to her as if he had regarded tunbridge wells as a sort of poste restante at which some letter of supreme importance had awaited him and there was no letter but what did you expect little daddy said christina alberta when on the afternoon of the first day he took her to the toad rock to see for herself how ordinary and insignificant a rock it was did you expect some wonderful carvings i expected something for me something significant for you yes for me and every one about life and the mysteries i had grown a sort of feeling there would be something there now i dont know where to turn but what sort of thing what significance did you expect isnt life a riddle christina alberta havent you noticed that do you think it is just nothing but studios and dances and excursions and char bancs and meal times and harvest he said obviously there is something more in it than that obviously all that is just a veil outward showing hrrmp and i dont know what is behind it and i am just a plain boarder in a boarding house and my life is passing away very difficult hrrmp almost impossible it worries me exceedingly somewhere there must be a clue but thats how we all feel daddy cried christina alberta things cant be what they seem said mr preemby waving his hand with a gesture of contemptuous dismissal towards rusthall village public house lamp posts a policeman a dog a grocers delivery van and three passing automobiles that at any rate is obvious it would be too absurd infinite space stars and so forth just for running about in between meals now who would have thought christina alberta reflected that this sort of thing was going on in his head who would have thought it either i am a reincarnation said mr preemby or i am not and if i am not then i want to know what all this business of the world is about symbolical it must be christina alberta but of what all those years at the laundry i knew that that life wasnt real a period of rest and preparation your dear mother thought differently we never discussed it hrrmp but it was so christina alberta could find no adequate comment and they went on in silence for some time when they spoke again it was to discuss how they could get round to the high rocks hotel for tea mr preemby was evidently depressed and more than a little aggrieved but he had none of the comprehensive despondency of your melancholic type concurrently he was quite actively interested in the boarding house and the fellow boarders he encountered there it was a novel experience for him to be in a boarding house during his married life he had always spent his holidays with mrs preemby in seaside apartments so that she could supervise the provisioning properly and detect expose and rectify errors and extortion they had taken drives inland during these vacations or camped on the beach while mr preemby and christina alberta had made sandcastles or pottered among rocks and mrs preemby had sat in a folding chair and pined for the laundry if the weather was bad they kept in their apartments where mr preemby and christina alberta could read books while mrs preemby could pine for the laundry almost as well as she could on the beach but deep in mr preembys heart there had always been a craving for such a collective promiscuous life as a boarding house affords they had made the acquaintance of the second miss rewster miss margaret rewster on their arrival with the luggage she was a taller more anxious and less richly belaced variation of her sister they both mr preemby discovered had a peculiar hovering quality they seemed always hovering behind bead curtains or down passages or looking over from staircase landings or peeping round doors poor dears they were dreadfully anxious not to interfere with their guests but they were equally anxious that everything should be all right at meal times they operated with the joints and dishes behind a screen and the chubby maid carried round the plates and vegetables and whenever mr preemby looked at the screen he found either miss margaret rewster peeping over the top of it at him or miss emily rewster peeping round the end it made him quite nervous with his forks and spoons when he dropped his serviette he hoped that would pass unobserved but miss emily noted it at once and sent the chubby maid to pick it up for him mr preemby and christina alberta came down to dinner as soon as miss margaret had sounded the second gong and so they were the first to be seated and could survey their fellow guests at an advantage christina alberta was quietly observant but mr preemby said hrrmp at each fresh arrival the next to appear were two birds of passage a young man in hudibrastic golfing knickerbockers and a lady presumably his wife in a bright yellow sporting jumper who were motoring about kent they made strenuous attempts to seize a table in the window which was already reserved for petunia regulars and were subdued with difficulty but perfect dignity by miss emily they then consulted loudly about wine the young man called the lady old thing and old top forms of expression new and interesting to mr preemby and she called him badger and the chubby maid produced a card of wines that could be sent out for the young man read out the names and prices of wines and made his selection almost as though he were a curate officiating in a very large cathedral his wife to follow out that comparison made the responses chablis such as we should get here might be too sweet he proclaimed it might be too sweet what of a pommard old top why not a pommard badger the beaune is a shilling cheaper and just as likely to be good or bad just as likely the chubby maid flew out of the room list in hand with her thumb on the wine he had chosen meanwhile under cover of this hubbub the two ladies mr preemby had seen at tea in the lounge on the occasion of his first visit percolated unobtrusively to a table near the window they were obviously sisters both rather slender and tall with small round bright coloured faces on stalk like necks they had sharp little noses and one of them wore tortoiseshell spectacles a gentleman with a white moustache larger and nobler even than mr preembys accompanied by a small alert looking wife was the next to appear possibly this was the gentleman who had been in a forest in burmah the small alert looking wife bowed to the slender ladies who became agitated like reeds in a wind the gentleman took no notice of them grunted as he sat down produced glasses and read the menu tomato soup again he said its usually very nice tomato soup said his wife but three times running he said it favours acidity i dont like tomato soup the table in the bow window was occupied by three people who drifted in separately first came a little thin dark lady in grey carrying a bead work bag then a little dark bald man with large side whiskers whom she addressed as father and then a plump healthy looking wife with a radiant manner who swept in and distributed greetings did you get your walk major bone she said to the gentleman from the burmese forest just to rusthall common and back said major bone speaking thickly through his moustache and soup just to rusthall common and you got a char banc to crohamhurst miss solb the two sisters answered in unison oh we had a lovely ride so picturesque said the one with spectacles so open and pleasant said the one without spectacles did you see the sea oh plainly said the one with spectacles ever so far away said the one without just as if the sky had a steel edge said the one with spectacles exactly like a leetle silver line said the one without hrrmp said mr preemby small portions of fish followed the tomato soup and were consumed in comparative silence there was a little burst of scarcely audible conversation at the window table now is this the same fish as we had yesterday asked the wife it is a very similar fish said the gentleman with whiskers the menu simply says fish said the stepdaughter hrrmp said mr preemby i think our back tyres were too tight to day old top said the man in plus fours in a very loud clear voice i felt the road dreadfully i felt the road dreadfully said the lady in the yellow jumper i must let them down a little to morrow morning it would be better to morrow morning will do i wont trouble to night much better to morrow morning badger youre tired to night after all that bumping youd make your hands dirty silence and active business with knives and forks porruck hasnt written about that said the major from the forest very likely hes busy said his wife silence hrrmp said mr preemby christina alberta searched her mind for some conversational opening that would give her father a reasonable opportunity to make an acceptable reply but she could think of nothing that was neither too disconcerting nor too dangerous she met his eye and he had the expression of one who holds out against a strain fish gave place to lamb i thought that road from sittingbourne was just awful said the motoring gentleman it was just awful responded his wife christina alberta saw her fathers face working he was going to say something hrrmp to morrow if it is fine i think we will go for a walk in the morning the knives and forks were hushed everybody was listening id love a walk to morrow daddy said christina alberta i should think there were some jolly walks about this place exactly said mr preemby very probably the guide book is very reassuring hrrmp he had the dignified expression of a man who has carried off a difficult duty resumption of activity with knives and forks hard to tell this lamb from mutton said major bone if it wasnt for the mint sauce peas are never so nice as they are from your own garden said the wife of the whiskered gentleman to her stepdaughter its late for peas said the stepdaughter the two miss solbs and the motoring gentleman began talking at the same time mrs bone expressed the idea that it was hard to get good lamb nowadays taking courage from this sudden swirl of conversation mr preemby was emboldened to remark to christina alberta that he had always been attracted to tumbridge wells he felt the air was a strong air it gave him an appetite you must be careful not to get fat said christina alberta the outburst of active human exchanges came to an end baked apple and custard were consumed in comparative silence the chubby maid came to ask mr preemby whether he would like his coffee in the lounge or the smoking room the lounge i think said mr preemby hrrmp the lounge the misses solb bearing glasses containing sugar and lemon juice flitted from the room the people from the window table followed the function of dinner was completed they found themselves alone in the lounge most of the people seemed to have drifted into the sitting room the gentleman from the forests of burmah went by towards the smoking room carrying a large cigar which had an air of also coming from the forests of burmah it did not look like a cigar that had been rolled or filled it looked like a cigar of old gnarled wood that had been hewn from a branching tree a straw came out of the end of it christina alberta stood and contemplated a vast void of time two hours it might be before she could decently go to bed oh this is the life she said extremely comfortable said mr preemby sitting down with much creaking in a basket arm chair christina alberta sat on a glass topped table and lit a cigarette she saw those two hours stretching before her and she wanted to scream the chubby maid brought coffee and seemed gently surprised at christina albertas cigarette whisperings off stage then miss emily became dimly visible through the bead curtain at the end of the passage hovering she vanished again and christina alberta finished her cigarette in peace mr preemby drank up his coffee pause christina alberta swung her legs rhythmically then she slid off the table to her feet daddy she said lets go into the sitting room and see if anything is happening there in the boarding houses of the past the common dining table was the social centre where people met and mind clashed upon and polished mind but the spirit of aloofness the separate table system has changed all that and now it is in the smoking room or the sitting room that the vestiges of social intercourse advances retreats coquettings exchanges games and jests are to be found but the company of the petunia boarding house was not in a state of social fusion the only coalescence was a conversation the wife of the gentleman from the burmese forests had secured an arm chair by the side of the fire place and she was describing in a low whisper the numerous servants she had had in burmah to the cheerful wife and the younger miss solb who was knitting the miss solb with the spectacles had fortified herself behind a table on the other side of the fire and was engaged meticulously with a very elaborate patience the gentleman with the side whiskers sat rigidly on one of the sofas behind a copy of the times while his daughter sat at a table close at hand and also threaded her way through a patience the birds of passage after inquiries about movies and music halls had gone out nobody took the slightest notice of mr preemby and christina alberta the two stood for some moments in the middle of the room and then panic came upon mr preemby a dishonourable panic so that he threw his daughter to these silent motionless wolves hrrmp he said i think my dear i will go to the smoking room i think i will go and smoke there are some illustrated papers over there on the bookcase for you if you care to look at them christina alberta walked over to the low bookcase and mr preemby departed hrrmping she stood pretending an interest in the illustrated jokes and in the portraits of actresses and society people in the sketch and tatler out of the tail of her eye she surveyed those fellow guests of hers and with a negligent ear she collected the gist of mrs bones dissertation upon the servant question in burmah they will plant the whole family upon you if they can uncles and cousins even before you know where you are of course a white woman is a little queen out there the chief fault of the cooking from my point of view was the way it upset major bone his stomach far more delicate than a womans he looks so stout and strong said miss solb in everything but that in everything but the curries they used to make she sank her voice and the heads of the younger miss solb and the pleasant mannered lady closed in upon her for the rich particulars what a lot they were christina alberta reflected and they were living beings the astonishing thing to christina alberta was that they were alive and being alive and having presumably been a cause of considerable trouble distress emotion and hope to various people before they were got alive they were now all in the most resolute way avoiding anything that with the extremest stretch of civility could be spoken of as living their hours their days were passing a few thousand days more perhaps for each of them a few score thousand hours then there would be no more chance of living for ever and instead of filling up this scanty allowance of hours and days with every possible sensation and every possible effort and accomplishment here they were gathered into a sort of magic box of atmosphere in which nothing could possibly be done by anyone christina alberta felt like a moth caught under a glass well for a day or so she had an excuse little daddy must be settled but then nothing could be done here neither joy nor sorrow nor sin nor creative effort because even miss solbs knitting was being knitted to a prescription on a dirty cutting of printed paper everything they were employed upon was an evasion everything even the whispered delicate hints of the diuretic dyspeptic infuriating and wildly aphrodisiac effects of burmah curry upon major bone in his younger days that were being handed out by his good lady to her intent hearers were just a substitution of second hand knowledge for realities and this patience would she christina alberta asked herself would she ever come to play patiences in boarding houses was it credible that some day she also would come to sit voluntarily in such an atmosphere rather sell matches in a gutter whispered christina alberta what a marvellous thing is man what ingenuities he has what powers and capabilities he invents paper and perfects printing he develops the most beautiful methods of colour printing he makes cardboard like silk and ivory out of rags and vegetable pulp and all it would seem that human beings hanging for a little while in life between the nothingness before death and the nothingness after death should fiddle away long hours in a feeble fuddled conflict with the permutations of duplicate sets of four differently coloured thirteens cards the marvel of cards all over the world millions of people drawing nearer to death and nothingness were pursuing the chances of the four thirteens bridge whist nap skat a hundred forms of it directly they could get in out of the wet and dark they sat down to that sort of thing to the cards shining under the still lamps to being endlessly surprised delighted indignant and despondent by chances that anyone who chose to sit down to it could work out and tabulate in a week getting it out dear said the younger miss solb the spades are wicked to night said the miss solb with the glasses mine is going rather well said the daughter of the gentleman with the whiskers does your daughter play miss milligan asked the younger solb sister eight eights said the comfortable wife miss milligan is too much for her well it is a beast you know said the stepdaughter you never know where you are with it patience is patience said the elder miss solb nowadays i often get it out but not when the spades come as theyve done to night both twos in the top row and no aces till the last round but one christina alberta thought it was time to change from the sketch to the tatler she tried to do this with careless ease and flopped a dozen papers on the floor oh damn said christina alberta to a great stillness she struggled to pick up and replace the disordered sheets for a time every one seemed to be regarding her then mrs bone took up her discourse again and you cant imagine their obstinacy she said they are wilfully ignorant when you show them then they wont do it i took my cook boy in hand for a time boy i call him but he was quite a middle aged man and i said to him just let me show you some plain english cookery a boiled fowl with nice white sauce a few plain potatoes and vegetables quite plain with the natural flavour left in the sort of food that builds up these brave young englishmen you see of course im not a good cook myself but anyhow i knew more of english cooking than he did but we never got further than the plain boiled fowl he expressed the most violent disapproval really violent i mean of the whole proceedings as i took hold of the things and got to work he began to behave in the most extraordinary way he tried not to follow what i was doing tried not to he said that if he cooked a fowl like that he would lose caste lose his position in the local guild of cooks be perpetually defiled and outcast why he would not say when i persisted he rushed up and down pulling at his black hair a black madman his eyes rolling frightfully i could never make out what there was in a plain boiled fowl to cause such excitement this in my kitchen he said this in my kitchen there i stood quietly boiling my fowl while all this pother went on he hovered about me he talked fortunately in his own language i even caught him pretending to be sick behind my back then he came and implored me to desist with tears in his great brown eyes he tried to say things in english the major always says that he was simply swearing but i believe the wretched man really did believe that if he was to boil a fowl in the plain wholesome simple way nice people in england do it daily he would be hung in the air and the great jays of burmah would come and peck ahem she cast a side glance at christina alberta apparently lost in the sketch and lowered her voice peck at his entrails just his insides you know for a thousand thousand years sensation you never know what ideas easterners will get into their heads said the younger miss solb east is east and west is west but now christina albertas attention was distracted by another set of phenomena she had discovered that the thin bald gentleman with side whiskers rigid behind his times was not really reading that interesting vestige of the british constitution at all his gaze was not directed to the edge of his paper but beyond it he was staring from behind that ambush and round the corner of his glasses in a strange hard eyed way without passion or admiration at the upper part of christina albertas black stockinged legs as they delivered their last challenge to human censure before disappearing beneath her all too exiguous but extremely comfortable skirt and also she was realizing that a furtive but intense scrutiny of her bobbed hair was disorganizing the patience of the whiskered gentlemans daughter very seriously and that it was also interfering with the proper laying out of a second and different sort of patience by the elder miss solb and suddenly to her extreme annoyance christina alberta found a flush of indignation mantling her cheek and a combative tingle passing down the backbone of her straight little body why the devil miss preemby asked herself why the devil shouldnt a girl cut her hair to save trouble and bother and wear clothes in which she can walk about anyhow a mop of well washed hair was ten times better than those feeble aimless interweavings of pigtails and fringes and scraps and ends and as for showing ones legs and body why shouldnt one show ones legs and body it was just a part of the universal evasion of life by these people that had got most of their bodies hidden away tied up in a sort of bundle do they ever venture to look at themselves those solb girls once upon a time they must have been jolly little girls with an amused interest in their stalky little legs before they said shush and put them away christina albertas speculative vein took charge for a time what becomes of legs that are put away and never looked at and encouraged do they get etiolated and queer dead white and funny shaped and afraid of the light and after youve really packed your body away and forgotten it nothing is left of you but a head sticking out and hands that wave about and feet with hidden and distorted toes and you go about between meal times and take trips in chars bancs to see what every one sees and feel what every one feels and you play games by rule and example according to your age and energy and become more and more addicted to patience until you are ready to cover yourself up in bed for the last time of all and die evasion and the fuss they had caused getting born the fuss the morality and marriages and everything that was necessary before these vacuous lives were begotten but it was all evasion and the life shown in these tatlers and sketches was evasion just as much just as much all these photographs of the pushful pretty the actresses for sale and the daughters who had to be sold looked at you with just your own question in their eyes is this the life the unending photographs of lady diana this and lady marjorie that and mr so and so and a friend of the duke of york or the duchess of shonts at dog shows at horse shows at race meetings at royal inaugurations and the like were inevitably suggestive of obstinate doubts that were in need of a perennial reassurance the photographs of people playing tennis and suchlike games were livelier but there too if you care to look at it were evasions evasions evasions christina alberta turned over the back numbers of the sketch without looking at the pictures before her eyes what was this life she and these people and every one by games and jokes and meetings and ceremonies and elaborate disregards and concealments were all evading what was this great thing outside this something like a huge terrible attractive and compelling black monster beyond the lights beyond the movements and appearances that called to her and challenged her to come one might evade the call of it by playing patience and games perhaps one might evade it by living by rule or custom people seemed to do so a time might come when that call to christina alberta to be christina alberta to the uttermost and fulfil her mysterious mission to that immense being beyond the lights might no longer distress her life she had thought that in a certain recklessness and violence with herself she might fight her way out to the call she had made love now anyhow she hadnt evaded that but was it going to matter as much as she had thought it would matter she and her little friends were playing desperate games with the material of love in a world where dr marie stopes and mr d h lawrence were twin stars and it was just something you went through and came out much as you had been before more restless perhaps but no further on it left you just where you had been face to face with the unsolved darkness and that mysterious distressing unanswerable call to come out of it all and really live and die she had made love queer it had been these furtive people were watching and watching her reading her thoughts perhaps penetrating her christina alberta shut her copy of the sketch with something of a snap and walked out of the drawing room with a serene expression she shut the door behind her and went downstairs to find what had happened to her father in the smoking room im leaving the best part of the talk behind me reflected christina alberta she found that her father and the gentleman from the forests of burmah after a very prolonged and brilliant hrrmping match had settled down to conversation but unhappily the conversation was unsuitable for her siam cambodia tonquin the country is full of such temples they take you there and show you them wonderful said mr preemby wonderful and you do not think the carvings you speak of some high symbolism both gentlemen became aware of christina alberta attentive and hovering symbolism said the arboreal gentleman symbolism and had complicated pharyngeal difficulties heathenish indecency difficult to discuss presence of young lady hrrmp hrrmp said mr preemby had you come down to say good night my dear we are having a rather rather technical talk sounds like it daddy said christina alberta and went round and sat on the arm of his chair for a moment good night little daddy she said reflective moment i think this tumbridge is going to suit me said mr preemby i hope it will little daddy good night christina albertas first evening at the petunia boarding house has been described with some particularity because it is a sample of all the still and uneventful evenings that seemed to lie before mr preemby there it impressed her as an unfathomable enormity of uneventfulness in which nothing harmful or disturbing could conceivably occur to him the last remote possibility of imaginative disturbance seemed to remove itself next day when mrs bone announced to the whiskered gentlemans wife that she and her husband were off to bath on the morrow they were in luck it seemed they had got the exact rooms for the winter in the exact boarding house they had always had their eyes on tunbridge seems so bleak she said after burmah the dinner was like the previous dinner the birds of passage had gone and mr preemby astonished himself christina alberta the chubby maid and the assembled company by demanding whether it was possible to send out hrrmp for a bottle or flask of chianti its an italian wine said mr preemby to inform and help the chubby maid in her inquiries but there was no chianti on the wine list supplied and after a conversation markedly reminiscent of that of the birds of passage overnight the preemby table was stocked with a bottle of australian burgundy and at christina albertas request a bottle of mineral water after this display of initiative self assertion and social derring do mr preemby did little but hrrmp throughout the rest of the meal the subsequent life of the drawing room was also vacantly similar to the previous evening christina alberta got her possibly illegal cigarette in the lounge indeed she smoked two and miss margaret rewster looked at her through the bead curtain near the office and miss emily had a sniff from the landing upstairs though nothing was said and then mr preemby followed major bone into the smoking room to gather whatever further information he could about the temple decorations and religious customs of the peoples of further india he was inclined to think major bone rather biased by evangelical prejudice but major bone was not even indignant about eastern religions that night he wanted to talk about bath and he talked about bath he told mr preemby in very great detail about a remarkable occurrence at bath he had met a gentleman named bone a gentleman much of his own age and appearance a captain bone who had also once been in burmah he detailed various extremely dramatic conversations between himself and the other bone occasionally going back and correcting himself they had made the most elaborate comparison of their genealogies and it did not appear that they were even remotely related most curious coincidence that has ever occurred to me said major bone in bath in nineteen eh nine in the drawing room patience prevailed and mrs bone was talking about bath the cheerful wife of the whiskered gentleman said deavning to christina alberta quite suddenly oh good evening said christina alberta you had a walk to day weve been to see the toad rock and the high rock and eridge park quite a nice walk said the cheerful lady and restored her attention to mrs bone christina alberta gathered she was to be noticed but not made a pet of there was nothing for it but to go through the tatlers and sketches again this time the pictures were exhausted but there were reviews of books and one or two short stories christina alberta read them all when she went to say good night to her daddy she had come to a decision daddy she said on thursday thats the day after to morrow i must go back to london there are some lectures beginning mr preemby made no effective opposition the third evening was in countenance like the second except that the bones had gone and that christina alberta was sustained by the thought that next day she would pass from the vacuities of tunbridge to the tangled riddles of london and there was a bird of passage present an untidy young man of the student type with a lot of hair imperfectly controlled by unguents whose motor bicycle had broken down just outside tunbridge wells he lived somewhere away in the north it seemed in northumberland he would have to wait in tunbridge for two or three days while some broken part of his machine was replaced from coventry he had taken refuge in the petunia boarding house and it was jolly hard luck on him he couldnt budget for a trip to london he would just have to sit down in tunbridge he was a cambridge undergraduate and a geologist he had a bag of specimens on his machine these facts he conveyed across the width of the room to mr preemby in the course of a rather one sided conversation from the first christina alberta did not like this young gentleman from cambridge he was like a younger cruder teddy winterton with impudent bad manners instead of impudent good manners and with neither bodily grace nor good looks and while he spoke to mr preemby he glanced at her but she had no inkling of the part he might play in the life of her daddy and herself when she and her daddy went into the lounge for coffee and her cigarette the young man came and placed himself at an adjacent table and initiated some more conversation was tunbridge wells an amusing place was there any chance of his getting any golf or tennis there are a number of delightful walks said mr preemby not much fun alone said the young man there are the pleasures of observation said mr preemby all this country has been pretty well worked over said the young man of science is there a museum here mr preemby did not know there ought to be a museum in every town presently the coffee and the cigarettes were finished this evening mr preemby was for the drawing room major bone had gone the smoking room had no attractions and mr preemby had exchanged a few amiable words with the gentleman with whiskers and hoped to follow them up christina alberta went with him at the sight of the old tatlers and sketches she remembered she had bought a book in the high street that day a second hand copy of rousseaus confessions she went off to get it she found the young gentleman from cambridge still sitting in the lounge smoking cigarettes pretty gloomy here he said oh i dont know said christina alberta with an open mind pausing before him nothing much doing what its not a gala night im stranded you must bear up spose you wouldnt be disposed to come out for a bit and forage around for some fun said the young man from cambridge taking his courage in both hands sorry said christina alberta conclusively and turned to go on no offence said the young man from cambridge nice of you to think of me said christina alberta who would rather have been thought utterly shameless than the least bit prudish good hunting and the young man from cambridge perceived that he was dismissed christina alberta went into the drawing room for another tremendous bout of nothingness but anyhow she had got rousseau to read and to morrow she would be in london about the rousseau she had always wanted to know how she stood towards rousseau he carried her on to ten oclock but she didnt think much of rousseau he ought to have known a few of the new hope club girls theyd have shown him for three weeks christina alberta did not return to tunbridge wells and when she returned she had passed through a variety of experiences that will have their due effect upon the course of this story this story is the story of mr preemby and we have little sympathy with that modern sort of novel which will not let a girl alone but must follow her up into the most private and intimate affairs christina alberta was perplexed and worried and would have hated the pursuit of such a searchlight suffice it that events had crowded so closely upon her that for whole days together she thought scarcely at all of her possibly quite lonely little daddy at tunbridge wells then came a letter that brought her bustling down i think it only right to tell you said the letter that very important communications indeed have been made to me of the utmost importance and that i ought to tell you about them they seem to alter all our lives i know you are immearced in your studies but these communications are so important that i want to talk them over with you soon i would come up to the studio to tell you about it all but very likely mr crumb might be in and i would much prefer to tell you here on the common amid more congenial surroundings some of it you will find almost unbeleavable communications said christina alberta re reading the letter communications she went down to tunbridge wells that afternoon chapter the fifth the scales fall from mr preembys eyes the scales said mr preemby have fallen from my eyes he had chosen a seat upon the common which commanded an extensive view of the town the town crowned by the green cupolas of the opera house and lying as though the houses had been shot out of a cart down the long incline to the pantiles beyond were the wide distances of the kentish hill country blue and remote christina alberta waited for more this experience said mr preemby speaking with an occasional hrrmp all these experiences difficult to relate naturally i think you are of a sceptical disposition taking after your dear mother she was very sceptical of psychic phenomena in particular she said it was nonsense and when your dear mother said a thing was nonsense then it was nonsense it only made things disagreeable if you argued it was anything else as for myself always the open mind no dogma either way i just refrained but daddy have you been having psychic experiences how could you have psychic experiences down here let me tell you the story in due order i want you to see it as i saw it in due order how did it begin mr preemby held up a propitiatory hand please in my own way he said christina alberta bit her lips and scrutinized the tranquil resolution of his profile there was no hurrying him he had to tell his tale as he had prepared it i do not think said mr preemby that mine is a very credulous sort of mind it is true i am not given to argument i do not say very much but i think and observe i think and observe and i have a kind of gift for judging people i do not think i am a very easy man to deceive and it is to be noted that i started the whole affair it began at my suggestion i do not know what put it into my head but i do know that it was me started the whole thing going you know after your departure our little band at the petunia boarding house was reduced to just six persons not counting the young gentleman from cambridge who was as miss rewster says a bird of passage naturally the six of us felt rather drawn together there were the two miss solbs both very intelligent young ladies and there were mr hockleby and mrs hockleby and miss hockleby and there was me we were drawn together at lunch after you had gone off it was a little showery and we had a fire in the drawing room and miss solb the one with the glasses tried to show me one of her patiences we got into quite an interesting argument about whether it was possible to will which card would turn up next i have always inclined to the view that for certain people people with the necessary gift it was possible to do so but mr hockleby showed himself extremely sceptical in the matter he said that if there was a card on the top of the pack ready to turn up and if one willed that a different card should turn up then that meant that one had really by sheer will force to re manufacture two of the cards in the pack make them over again each into the other make them blank reprint them and everything but i tried to explain to him that this is not philosophically sound because of predestination if you were predestined to will that such a card should be on the top of the pack then that card was also predestined to be there he argued but is it necessary to tell me all this daddy before we get to your psychic experience it is just to illustrate the fact that mr hockleby was an extremely sceptical person was that young man from cambridge present at the discussions no oh no he was not he had probably gone down to the garage to see if his spare part had come he was always going down to the garage to see about his spare part mr preemby hrrmped and began a new section of his narrative it was in the evening after dinner he said that things really began i went into the smoking room to smoke and afterwards i went into the drawing room and when i went into the drawing room i had no more thought of occult phenomena christina alberta than i had of flying over the moon but as i came into the drawing room i saw miss solb looking at her patience cards which she had just put out and the way she was holding her hands on the table reminded me of the way i had read that people put their hands together on the table when they were trying experiments in table turning and almost without thinking i said why miss solb the way you are holding your hands is just the way they do when they are going to do table turning i said it just like that mr hockleby was reading his paper at the time the times i think but it may have been the morning post but he put it down when he heard me say that and he looked over his glasses at me and said you dont believe in that sort of thing mr preemby surely his wife was sitting with her back to me and from the way she spoke i think she must have been eating some sort of sweet or lozenge at the time i do she said we did it at home dozens of times before i was married and i dont know what put it into my head christina alberta it seemed almost as though it was something behind myself that did it or it may have been a sort of antagonism i have always felt about that man hockleby but anyhow i said id really like to try some of this table turning the younger miss solb shes really quite a charming young lady when you get to know her and it seems she has been reading a little occult literature lately how old is she daddy asked christina alberta regarding him with a look of novel suspicion i dont think she can be very much more than thirty two or three thirty four at the outside and really quite well read quite well read well anyhow she said she would like to try it and miss hockleby evidently she had been brought up on strictly sceptical lines by her father she was curious too so to cut a long story short we tried it only mr hockleby objected and mrs hockleby overruled that she was the only one among us who had ever seen anything of the sort before and so it was she who arranged things and told us what to do we chose a very solid table the one that usually has the big aspidistra on it and while we were turning out the light but why did you do that daddy one always does that said mr preemby it makes the atmosphere more favourable we lit a candle which miss margaret rewster got for us and turned out all the electric lights and while we were doing this in came young mr charles fenton and said what did he say a peculiar expression ah yes gollys he said whats up was that the young man with the motor bicycle yes the young man from cambridge we explained what we were doing and asked him to join us he declared he knew nothing of psychic phenomena had never experimented with it at all and seemed very doubtful about taking part in the trial i dont think theres anything in it he said we shall just waste our time indeed i remember now that he did go out intending to visit a music hall and then he came back and said it was raining its very important to note that he was not at all eager to join us and that he was quite uninformed about occult things because you see as i will tell you we found out presently that he was a person of exceptional psychic gifts much greater psychic gifts than anyone else among us well we arranged ourselves about the table in the usual manner thumbs and little fingers touching and for a time nothing seemed to happen at all we found miss emily rewster was peeping in through the slightly open door and perhaps that may have had an unfavourable influence i suppose she wondered what we were doing and why we had asked her sister for a candle then mr fenton got very restive and grumbled to himself and said it was the silliest way of passing an evening he had ever tried it was a little difficult to persuade him to keep silence and persevere all right said he with a kind of resentment have it your own way and then suddenly came two violent raps raps like little pistol shots not immediately under the table it was but as if it was in the air a foot or so under the table and then the table began to move slowly at first shifting along the floor and then quite strongly twisting and pushing up against our hands it was very weird and impressive christina alberta very weird and impressive indeed it rose nearly two feet i should think and then mr hockleby broke the circle and it fell rather heavily i fancy and the leg hit his shin he uttered an exclamation and stooped to rub his leg and in the indistinct light he hit his head on the edge of the table it seemed almost a judgment on his scepticism i thought we turned up one or two of the lights to attend to him i dont like this said mr fenton this is a bit too rum for me i asked him to try just once more i dont like this table riding up like this he said its such a bad example for the chairs suppose some of them start playing cup and ball with us you might get a nasty toss from a buck jumping chair and besides its a lot too like a channel crossing for my taste i think we were all a good deal excited by what had happened and all the others even mr hockleby were eager to continue next time i shall press down he said i think he was a little suspicious that either his wife or me had something to do with the phenomena evidently spiritualism was a long standing dispute between him and his wife his wife said she had seen tables move before but none so actively as this one had done down we sat again we had hardly waited a minute before the table began rocking about in the most extraordinary fashion and then absolutely flew up so violently that the elder miss solb was thrown back over that ottoman there is there and i was bumped under my chin at the same time there was a perfect volley of cracks like somebody cracking his fingers but ever so much louder it was quite a comfort to have the lights up again and see mr hockleby holding the table down firmly in its proper place damn you he said quite loudly damn you keep down miss hockleby and her father picked up miss solb who was on the floor in a sort of hysterical fit of laughter with her feet waving about i dont like this said mr fenton it goes through one like an electric shock he spoke quite simply the only one of us who had had any experience with occult phenomena was mrs hockleby and she had not done anything of the sort since her marriage to mr hockleby five or six years before because of his scepticism she said now that it was very evident that some very strong and resolute spirit was present and was trying to communicate with us and she explained a simple and safe method of getting into communication we were to reform the circle round the table and we were to call over the alphabet and when we came to the letter the spirit wanted there would be a rap and so we should be able to arrive at something definite there is a sort of code quite well understood it seems in the spirit world in which you convey no by one rap and yes by two and so on we set to work at this said mr preemby we asked if the spirit would like to spell out anything and it answered with two very loud raps and then mr hockleby read out the letters a b c and so on when it got to s the spirit gave a rap so loud it made me jump and what did you spell out daddy a name quite unknown to me then sargon and then king of kings we asked was the spirit that was communicating with us sargon the answer came no was sargon present yes then who was our communicant oujah who was oujah wise man it was a very slow process spelling out the words in this way and by the time we had got so far we were all very tired mr fenton in particular was very tired he yawned and seemed greatly exhausted and said at last he felt so weary and muzzy that he must go to bed that was really very natural because though none of us realized it at the time he was the actual medium under oujahs control he went to bed and we tried to go on without him but the magic had departed and we could not get so much as a rap so we sat for a time talking all this over mr hockleby in particular was greatly flabbergasted and then the rest of us went to bed evidently mr fenton made the raps said christina alberta evidently his presence was necessary for the raps to be made corrected mr preemby quite unconsciously he was a mejum there was a pause go on with the story said christina alberta the next evening was wet again and as his spare part hadnt come mr fenton was able to join us once more he made some little objection at first because he said he and his people were all particular baptists and he was doubtful whether this sort of thing was not necromancy and forbidden in the bible but i persuaded him out of that and this time we spelt out a quite singular message it was awake sargon arise or be forever fallen even from the first i had had a feeling that those messages from sargon had something to do with me now suddenly conviction came upon me i asked is sargon present yes i knew it would be so is it anyone in the circle yes is it this gentleman pointing to mr hockleby a very loud no is it me yes mr hockleby i noted at the time looked annoyed as though he felt it was he who ought to be sargon then young mr fenton stood up suddenly oh i cant stand any more of this he said my head feels quite muzzy im sure this sort of thing is harmful he walked across the room and sat down suddenly with his hands hanging over the arms of the chair it was one of the big arm chairs covered in cretonne we all felt very much concerned but as for myself i was all in a daze at the thought of being this sargon and being called upon so openly to rouse myself to action i did not understand fully as yet all that it meant to me but i did realize that it meant a very great deal but what did you think it meant said christina alberta sharply and her perplexed gaze searched his profile his blue eyes stared at things far away beyond the distant hills strange things fantastic empires secret cities mystical traditions and his brows were knit in the effort to keep his story together all in good time said mr preemby let me tell my story in my own way i was telling you i think that young mr fenton said he felt heavy and strange mrs hockleby happily was quite equal to that situation she had seen the same thing before dont struggle against it she said let yourself go just lean back in your chair if you want to lie quiet do if you want to say anything do let the influence work and she turned to me and whispered trance what is a trance said mr fenton just like that what is a trance she began moving her hands in front of his face making passes i think they call it he shut his eyes gave a sort of sigh and his head lolled back we all sat round him waiting and presently he began to mutter at first it was just nonsense oojah woojer boojer words like that then more distinctly oujah the wise man sargons servant oujah comes to serve sargon to awaken him after that he seemed to wander off into sheer rubbish why is a mouse when it spins he whispered in his own voice and then that damned spare part mrs hockleby said that was quite characteristic of this sort of trance and then mr hockleby got a writing pad and a pencil to take down anything more that was said and presently when mr fenton spoke again he did not speak in his own voice but in a kind of hoarse whisper quite different from his usual voice it was the voice of this oujah speaking oujah the control with a slight accent sumerian i suppose well the things he said were very astonishing indeed i think that this oujah was anxious to secure my attention by convincing me that he knew of things intimate things that nobody else could know at the same time he did not wish the others to know too clearly what he was aiming at how did it go what can i remember mr hockleby has a lot of it written down but so far i have not had time to make a copy child of the sea and the desert he said the blue waters and the desert sand is it too fanciful to find an allusion to sheringham in that cascades and great waters and a thing like a wheel on a blue shield that is more puzzling but cascades and great waters set me thinking of our big washers and you remember the swastika on our blue delivery vans christina alberta is not that oddly suggestive of a thing like a wheel on a blue shield the norse peoples called the swastika the fire wheel armies with their white garments fluttering the long lines drawn out armies of delivery that again is queer one is reminded of armies and also dont think me absurd of the drying ground and the vans it is like one thing becoming transparent and your seeing the other behind it are you sure of the exact phrases daddy mr hockleby has them written down if i have not got them quite right you will be able to read his notes the swastika may be a coincidence said christina alberta or you may have been drawing it on the edges of the newspaper you do sometimes and he may have seen it that does not account for the blue ground he laid great stress on the blue ground and there were other things matters known only to me and your dear mother i could not tell you them without telling you everything and small things entirely private to me the name of my late grandfather at diss munday his name was it is sometimes difficult to argue about things although one may be absolutely convinced and all this was mixed up with broken sentences about a great city and the two daughters of the western king and the wise man and also he called me belshazzar belshazzar seemed to drift in and out of his thoughts come again to a world that has fallen into disorder these are remarkable words and then beware of women they take the sceptre out of the hands of the king but do they know how to rule ask tutankhamen ask the ruins in the desert pah said christina alberta as though women have ever had a fair chance well anyhow mr hockleby has that written down and it seemed to me that this too applied to me for because of my great fondness for your mother i had let so many years of my life slip away he said many other things christina alberta richly suggestive things but i have told you enough for you to understand what has happened in the end mr fenton came to quite suddenly much more suddenly than is usual in such cases mrs hockleby said he sat up and yawned and rubbed his eyes oh lord he said what nonsense all this is im going to bed we asked him if he felt exhausted he said he was absolutely fed up were his actual words we asked him if that was the end of his message what message he said he had absolutely no memory of his communications at all have i been talking he asked this isnt the sort of thing one ought to get up to what sort of things have i been saying nothing objectionable i hope if so i apologize i mustnt do any more of this sort of thing mrs hockleby told him she had never met anyone with such a promise of great psychic power as he had before he said he was really very sorry to hear it she said he owed it to himself to cultivate so rare and strange a gift but he said that wouldnt do for his people at all the rain had stopped and he said he thought he would take a walk down to the pantiles and back before turning in perfectly simple and natural he was from first to last and rather unwilling and he really did look tired out didnt he laugh once asked christina alberta why should he he seemed a little afraid of what he had transmitted the next day his spare part came mrs hockleby did her utmost to try to get him once more in the afternoon and develop his communication but he would not do so he was full of questions about the ferry at tilbury and the time of high tide he would not even give us his name and address when i spoke of sending mr hocklebys notes to the occult review he was suddenly quite alarmed he said that if his name appeared in connection with them it might mean a very serious row with his family he would not even allow us to put a mr f from cambridge put quite another name he said quite a different name put anything you like that does not point to me a mr walker say from london or something of that sort of course there was nothing for us to do but agree and that was the whole of your communication daddy it was only the beginning because after that i began to remember i began to remember more and more remember things from my other lives memories stored up this young mr fenton was so to speak no more than the first cut in the curtain of forgetfulness that hung between this present life and all my previous existences now it was rent and torn open so that i could see things through it at a dozen points now i begin to realize what i really was and what i can really be you know christina alberta i have never actually believed i was myself not even as a schoolboy and now it is interesting i know and understand clearly that i am somebody else i have always been somebody else but who do you believe you are daddy so far as i can gather i was first a chief called porg in a city called kleb in the very beginning of the world ons and ons ago and i tamed my people and taught them many things then afterwards i was this sargon sargon the king of kings there is very little about him here in the public library in the encyclopdia britannica an upstart who took his name my name three thousand years later an assyrian fellow is the sargon they tell about he got mixed up with the jews and he besieged samaria but i was the original sargon long before there were jews or anything of the sort long before abraham and isaac and jacob and afterwards i was belshazzar the last crown prince of the babylonians but that is not very clear that remains obscure only one part of the record is lit as yet and possibly i have been other people but the figure that stands out in my memory now is sargon it is his memories have been returning to me it is he who has returned in me but daddy you dont really believe all this believe i know long before this communication came to me i had had those intimations that assurance that i was somebody else now i see clearly i can remember days in akkadia now just as clearly as i can remember days in woodford wells i could almost doubt whether i have ever lived at woodford wells it seems so far away now it was when i was in bed the night after mr fenton had gone that these memories began to come i was in bed and then suddenly i was not in bed i was reclining on a couch under a canopy a canopy of pure white wool very finely woven and embroidered with emblems and symbols and suchlike things in golden thread and i was upon my state barge upon the euphrates two kings daughters sisters with slender necks not unlike the two miss solbs except that they were fairer and decidedly younger much younger and clad rather more in accordance with the requirements of a warm climate chiefly in woven gold sat and fanned me with fans of eagles feathers dyed a royal purple and at my feet sat my councillor prewm who was oddly enough extremely like mr hockleby just the same iron grey whiskers and with the same little tufts of hair over his ears he was wearing an extremely tall cap of some black woollen substance and he was making memoranda with a wooden style on a tablet of wet clay it was like writing on a mud pie and beyond him were the officers of the boat on a kind of bridge they were wearing leather helmets studded with brass and then one saw the rowers below chained to their oars and then on either side spread the broad brown river just crinkled by the breeze the little boats fled to make way for us they had coarse square sails and they lowered them and turned them about all in precisely the same way at precisely the same time it was very pretty to see along the banks were little villages of mud brick houses and clumps and lines of palm trees and everywhere there were primitive contrivances great bent poles of wood like giant fishing rods for raising water out of the river for the cultivation of the land and the people were all crowded along the waters edge and bowing with their hands and foreheads in the water and crying sargon the conqueror sargon king of kings but daddy this was a dream how could i dream of things i had never seen nor heard of before one does one does not he replied with a quiet invincible obstinacy i remember i was coming back from the south where i had given peace to a multitude of warring tribes elamites and perrizites and jebusites and people of that sort and i was returning to my capital i remember distinctly many details of the campaign and i know that with an effort i could recall more in the proper order in dreams absurd things happen dreams when you think them over afterwards are all at sixes and sevens but this is all sane and orderly one might think christina alberta that i had never dreamt dreams and that all these memories of that previous existence which crowd upon me now were a deception of my imagination but i can go right back as if it was yesterday and i am surer by far that i am sargon than that i am albert edward preemby your father the former is my true self the latter is just a very simple unpretending wrapping that for some purpose at present inexplicable to me has hidden me from the world he waved his hand with a bolder gesture than was habitual to him he sat with his eyes wide open looking at unseen things the girl regarded him for some seconds in silence she was trying to grasp the full import of this amazing speech and this was your communication she said at last you have to know he said you have to serve and help me help him how could she help him or herself how far was this thing going what was she to do have you told anyone else of this daddy she asked abruptly have you told anyone else he turned his solemn little face towards her ah there he said we have to be very discreet and careful very careful indeed here and now is not the time to proclaim that sargon king of kings has come back to the civilization he did so much to found one has to be careful christina alberta there is a spirit of opposition for instance i have told something of my first vision dream you may call it if you like to mr hockleby i described the resemblance between himself and prewm he was by no means pleased his is a seditious insubordinate nature and besides since then i have recalled what happened on the advice of oujah to prewm and i have realized since then that though one may be convinced oneself it does not follow that one will convince other people it is true that miss hockleby and the two miss solbs have asked me to tell them more of my dreams they too call them dreams but their manner was curious rather than respectful and i have been extremely reserved with them thats my wise daddy said christina alberta you have to think of your dignity i have to think of my dignity certainly nevertheless his hands went out in a new amplitude of gesture here i am and this is my world my world i nursed it in its infancy i taught it law and obedience here i am the most ancient of monarchs rameses and nebuchadnezzar greece and rome the kingdoms and empires things of yesterday interludes while i have been sleeping and clearly i have been sleeping and clearly i have not been sent back to the world without a mission this is a great and crowded world now christina alberta but it is in a sad state of disorder even the newspapers remark upon it people are not happy now they are not happy as they were under my rule in sumeria thousands of years ago in the sunshine and abundance of sumeria but what can you do daddy dear princess my child that i have to think out nothing hastily nothing rashly no said christina alberta there came a pause one person only seems to have any belief in me the younger miss solb did you say anything dear no go on i have asked her if she too has had any dreams any vague memories of a previous existence she seems to have had something confirmatory in a shadowy sort of way very vague intimations she tells them timidly when her sister is not about but she is under a misapprehension that her relationship to me was a particularly close and special one she was not my queen there she is wrong it is perhaps natural for her to think so but i remember quite distinctly how it was she was one of the twenty principal concubines who carried the eagle fans have you told her that not yet said mr preemby not yet one has to go discreetly in all these things another pause followed christina alberta looked at her wrist watch my word she cried we shall be late for lunch she noted as they walked back towards the petunia boarding house that his bearing and manner had undergone a subtle change he seemed larger and taller and his face was serener and he held his head higher he did not hrrmp once he seemed to expect people and things to get out of his way and it was as if the path was a carpet that was being unrolled before his advance had she been able to see herself she would have remarked an equal change in her own carriage the dance had gone out of her paces she walked like one upon whose shoulders the responsibilities of life might easily become overwhelming they were late for lunch and all the other boarders were in their places beginning every one turned to look at mr preembys face as they came in and then they glanced at one another so youve come back to us said mrs hockleby to christina alberta meeting her eye its jolly to be back said christina alberta chapter the sixth christina alberta consults a wise man christina alberta and paul lambone had been great friends for nearly a year he liked her and admired her and as became his literary line of work he studied her and she liked him and trusted him and showed off a good lot when she was with him paul lambone wrote novels and short stories and books of good advice and he was particularly celebrated for the pervading wisdom of his novels and the excellence of his advice it was his pervading wisdom that had picked him up out of the general poverty of writers and placed him in a position of comparative prosperity not that his conduct of his affairs was wise but that the quality of his wisdom was extremely saleable some writers prosper by reason of their distinctive passion some by reason of their austerity and truth some by their excellent invention and some even by simple good writing but paul lambone prospered because of his kindness and wisdom when you read the stories you always felt that he was really sorry for the misfortunes and misbehaviour of his characters and anxious to help them as much as he could and when they blundered or sinned he would as often as not tell you what was the better course they might have chosen his book of advice and particularly his book of everyday wisdom and his what to do on a hundred and one occasions sold largely and continually but like that james king of england to whom the bible was dedicated paul lambone was far wiser in his thoughts and counsels than in his acts in small matters and most of the time his proceedings were foolish or selfish or indecisive or all of those things his wisdom did not reach below the level of his eyes and his face and body and arms and legs were given over to the unhappiest tendencies which were restrained by his general indolence rather than by any real self control he was very well off chiefly because he was lazy he asked the highest possible prices for everything he wrote because that was just as easy as asking the lowest and there was always a chance that the bargain would not come off and then he would be saved the trouble of correcting his proofs he accumulated money because he was too unenterprising to buy things or incur the responsibility of possessions and so he just let a trust invest it for him his literary reputation was high because a literary reputation in england and america depends almost entirely upon apparent reluctance of output the terse beauty of his style was mainly due to his sedulous indisposition to write two words where one would suffice and in the comfort and leisure his indolence accumulated for him he sat about and talked and was genially wise and got fatter than was becoming he tried to eat less as a preferable alternative to taking exercise but in the presence of drink and nourishment his indolence flagged and failed him he went about a good deal and was always eager for new things because they saved him from boredom the malign parent of much needless activity he had an expensive little cottage near rye in kent to which he could motor without needless trouble whenever london bored him and directly his cottage bored him he would come back to london and he visited peoples houses a lot because it was too troublesome to resist invitations there were it must be admitted limits to the wisdom of paul lambone it is often more difficult to see what is near us than what is far away many a stout fellow who looks with a clear discerning eye upon the universe sees little of his toes and ignores the intervening difficulty and something sub conscious in paul lambones mind obstinately refused to recognize the defective nature of many of his private acts he knew he was indolent but he would not allow himself to admit that his indolence was fundamental and vicious he thought there was a paul lambone in reserve of very great energy he liked to think of himself as a man of swift and accurate decisions who once aroused was capable of demoniac energy he had spent many an hour in arm chairs on garden seats and on downland turf thinking out his course of action on various possible occasions of war business criminal attempt or domestic crisis his favourite heroes in real life were napoleon julius csar lord kitchener lord northcliffe mr ford and suchlike heroic ants he liked christina alberta because of her tremendous go she was always up to something she preferred standing to sitting and she kicked her legs about while she talked to you he idealized her go he attributed to her much more go than she really had he was secretly persuaded that her blood must be like a birds a degree or so above normal he felt that in imagination she had much in common with him he called her the last thing the van the ultimate modern girl and the life force he openly professed pity for the unaided single handed man who would in accordance with our social laws presently have to marry her and go her pace and try to keep her in order she had been to tea with him once or twice she perceived his admiration and suspected a certain affection and she basked in admiration and affection she liked his books and thought he was very like what he thought he was himself she told him all sorts of things about herself just to lift his eyebrows and he was wise all over her and round and about her tremendously wise it was quite interesting to be rung up by christina alberta and asked if she might come for tea and advice come along now he said im probably all alone for tea and as he replaced the instrument he said now i wonder what the young woman has been up to and what she wants me to do for her he went back to his sitting room and spread himself on his very nice persian hearthrug and regarded the pretty silver kettle that swung over his spirit lamp it wont be money he considered she isnt the sort that tries to get money shes barked her shins on something girls nowadays are a lot too plucky theyre a lot too plucky altogether i hope its nothing serious shes just a kid christina alberta appeared in due course erect as ever but nevertheless looking a little dashed and subdued uncle she said for that was her theory of their relationship im in trouble youve got to give me all sorts of advice take off that brigands cloak he said and sit down there and make me some tea ive been watching your love affair out of the corner of my eye for some time im not surprised christina alberta paused with her cloak in her hand and stared at him thats nothing she said i can manage that little affair all right such as it is dont you worry about me in that respect dont imagine things but there is something something different she threw the cloak over a chair back and came and stood by the silver tea tray you know my daddy she said arms akimbo i never saw a more dissimilar parent well she considered how she should put it hes behaving queerly so that people may think people who dont know him that hes going out of his mind mr lambone reflected was it ever such a very serious mind to go out of oh dont make jokes his mind was good enough to keep him out of trouble and now somethings happened and it isnt people will think some of them think already he is mad they may take him away and theres just him and me its serious uncle and i dont know what i ought to do i dont know enough to know im scared ive got no friends that i can talk to about it none youd think id have women friends i havent i dont get on with older women they want to boss me or i think they do and i irritate them they know they feel the proper ones that i dont oh respect their standards and the other sort just hate me because im young the girls i know no good for what i want just now but isnt there a man said lambone on whom you have a sort of claim you know who it is i suppose he was frank things rather show if you know him she left the sentence unfinished i know the young man only very incidentally he said i go to teddy said christina alberta without any further reservations i went to him as a matter of fact before i telephoned to you he hardly listened to what i had to say he didnt bother she winced suddenly tears stood in her eyes he was just loafing about in his studio he kissed me and tried to excite me he would hardly listen to what i had to tell him that i suppose is what one gets from a lover so its got to that paul lambone reflected with hidden dismay and then remarked a little belatedly not every lover mine anyhow and you came away well what do you think hm said lambone you have barked your shins christina alberta more than i thought oh hell take teddy said christina alberta putting it on a bit and helping herself by being noisy what does that matter now ive done with teddy i was a fool never mind that the thing is my daddy what am i to do about my daddy well first youve got to tell me all about it said lambone because at present you know ive hardly got the hang of the trouble and before you do that you sit down in that easy chair and i make the tea no not you your nerves are on edge and youll upset something youve been having your first dose of adult worry sit down there and dont say anything for a minute im glad you came along to me very glad i liked that daddy of yours really little innocent eyed man he was blue eyes and he was talking what nonsense was he talking about the lost atlantis but it was quite nice nonsense no dont interrupt just let me recall my own impression of him until youve had your tea when the tea was made and christina alberta had sipped a cup and looked more comfortable lambone who felt he was managing things beautifully told her she might begin hes getting queer in his mind but you know that he isnt really going out of his mind said lambone thats it isnt it that is it said christina alberta you see she paused lambone sat down in a second arm chair and sipped his tea in a leisurely manner its a little difficult he said you see said christina alberta knitting her brows at the fire hes a person of peculiar imaginativeness he always has been always hes always lived half in a dream weve been very much together ever since i was born almost and from the earliest times i remember his talks rambling talks about the lost atlantis and about the secrets of the pyramids and yogis and the lamas of tibet and astrology all such wonderful impossible far off things the further off the better why he almost got me into a dream too i was a princess of far atlantis lost in the world i used to play at that and sometimes my play came very near to believing i could princess it for a whole afternoon lots of children day dream like that i did said lambone for days together i would be a great indian chief sentenced to death again and again disguised as a small preparatory schoolboy the incongruity didnt matter a rap everybody does it more or less for a time but hes gone on doing it all his life and hes doing it now more than ever hes lost the last trace of any sense that it is a dream and some one played a trick upon him at tunbridge wells not realizing what it might mean for him they seem to have muddled about with spiritualism in the evenings while i was in london table rapping and so forth and a man who had nothing better to do pretended to have a trance he told daddy he was sargon the first sargon king of kings he called him who was lord of akkadia and sumeria you know ages ago before babylon was born or thought of the man who did it couldnt have hit on anything more mischievous so far as daddy was concerned you see he was exactly ready for it leaving woodford wells where he had spent half his life in one routine had cut him off even more than he was usually cut off from reality he was uprooted already before this idea came to him and now its just swamping him it suited him exactly it fixed him always before one could get him back by talking about my mother or the laundry vans or something familiar like that but now i cant get him back i cant hes sargon incognito come back as lord of the world and he believes that just as firmly as i believe that i am his daughter christina alberta preemby talking to you now its a reverie no longer hes got his evidence and he believes and what does he want to do about it all sorts of things he wants to declare himself lord of the world he says things are in a bad way and he wants to save them they are in a bad way said lambone people dont begin to know half how bad they are still i suppose having a delusion about who one is isnt insanity does he want to make some sort of fuss im afraid yes soon thats what worries me you see she went on im afraid hes going to strike most people as queer hes back at lonsdale mews we had to come up from tunbridge wells yesterday on a few hours notice its that has upset me for a couple of days things went on all right practically we were turned out of the boarding house there was a frightfully disagreeable man there a mr hockleby and he seemed to take a violent dislike to daddy you know those unreasonable dislikes people take at times a very disagreeable side of human nature i know why people have taken dislikes to me but go on he and his daughter got upset about daddys queerness they frightened the miss rewsters the sisters who run the place they said he might break out at any moment and either he would have to leave or they would there they were all whispering on the stairs and talking of sending for a policeman and having him taken away what could i do we had to clear out you see daddy had a sort of idea that when he was sargon mr hockleby had been alive too and had had to be impaled for seditious behaviour and instead of letting bygones be bygones as one ought to do in such cases he said something about it to him and mr hockleby construed it as a threat its all so difficult you see he didnt try to impale him over again or anything no he doesnt do things like that its only his imagination that is doing tremendous things he isnt and now hes in london he has a sort of idea hes overlord of the king and he wants to go to the king at buckingham palace and tell him about it he says the king is a thoroughly good man thoroughly good and directly he hears how things are he will acknowledge daddy as his feudal superior and place him on the throne of course if he tries to do anything of that sort he will be locked up for a certainty and hes written letters to the prime minister and the lord chancellor and the president of the united states and lenin and so forth directing them to wait upon him for his instructions but ive persuaded him not to post them till he can have a proper seal made rather like muhammads letters to the potentates said lambone hes thinking too of a banner or something of that sort but all thats quite vague hes just got the phrase raise my banner i dont think that matters much yet but the buckingham palace idea something may come of that this is no end interesting said lambone and walked across his room and back and then half sat on the arm of his easy chair with his hands deep in his pockets tell me is he distraught to look at not a bit of it untidy in his dress neat as ever i remember when i saw him how neat he was is he at all incoherent or does it all hold together absolutely hes perfectly logical and coherent he talks i think rather better and more clearly than usual its just one simple delusion he has no delusions about having great physical strength or beauty or anything of that sort none hes not a bit crazy hes just possessed by this one grand impossible idea hes not throwing away money or anything of that sort not a bit of it hes always been careful with money and he is now yes lets hope that lasts i dont see that a man is insane because he believes he is a king or an emperor if some one tells him he is after all george v has no other grounds for imagining he is a king the only difference is that rather more people have told him so fancying yourself a king isnt lunacy and behaving in accordance with that idea isnt lunacy either it may be some day but it isnt so yet no but im afraid that people will think that it is you see its only in the last few days ive realized how fond i am of my father and how horrible it would be for me if anyone attempted to take him away im afraid of asylums restraint for those who can least understand restraint he particularly would go mad in a week really mad if he got into one that mr hockleby has frightened me hes frightened me he was so intent and cruel he was evil about daddy malignant a nasty man yes i know said lambone hate yes she said hate she jumped to her feet and took possession of the hearthrug looking with her bobbed hair and short skirts and manly pose and serious face the most ridiculous and attractive mixture of fresh youth and mature responsibility conceivable you see i dont know what they can do with him whether they can take him away from me ive never been much afraid of what might happen before but i am now i dont know how to take hold of all this i thought life was just a lark and people were fools to be afraid of doing anything but now i see lifes dangerous ive never been much afraid of what happened to myself but this is different hes walking about in a dream of glory with absolute wretchedness hanging over him think of it people getting hold of him perhaps hitting him an asylum about the law on these matters i know very little lambone reflected i doubt if they can do very much to him without your consent but i agree about asylums from their very nature they must be horrible places haunted places most of the attendants hardened even if they start well every day at it too much for anyone i dont know how a lunatic is made a legal lunatic i mean or who has a right to take him somebody i think two doctors have to certify him or something of that sort but anyhow i dont think your father is a lunatic nor i but that may not save him something else may hes as you say an imaginative a super imaginative man possessed by a fantastic idea well isnt that a case perhaps for a psycho analyst possibly whod talk him back to something like he used to be yes if such a man as wilfred devizes for example could talk to him i dont know much about these people ive read some freud of course and a little jung i know devizes slightly we talked at lunch and i liked his wife and if perhaps you could get your father away into a country cottage by the by have you got any money hes got the cheque book but he makes me an allowance so far theres been no money trouble he signs his cheques all right but he may not presently oh of course at any time he may begin putting a swastika or a royal cipher in the place of his signature and then the fat would be in the fire i shouldnt know where to turn i hadnt thought of that no said lambone for some seconds it seemed quite a long time to christina alberta he said nothing more he sat half leaning upon the arm of his chair and looked past her at the fire she had said what she wanted to say and now stood waiting for him to speak his wisdom told him that things had to be done in this matter very soon his temperament inclined him just to stay in that pleasant room and say things meanwhile she looked about the room and realized how comfortable a wise man could be it was the best furnished room she had ever been in the chairs were jolly there were bound books in the bookcase a delightful old chinese horse on the top of it all his tea things were silver or fine china there was a great writing desk with silver candlesticks the windows that gave on half moon street were curtained with a rich subtly folding material very pleasing to the eye her eyes came back to his big fat face and his peevish mouth and fine meditative eyes something he said and sighed ought to be done at once it isnt a matter to leave about he might commit some indiscretion and get into trouble im afraid of that exactly hes safe where you left him theres somebody with him who wont let anything happen yes so far good but what am i to do what are you to do he echoed and said no more for some seconds well she said what in fact are we to do i ought to see him decidedly yes i ought to see him then come and see him i ought to come and see him now then lets he nodded he seemed to be making an intense internal effort why not he asked well and then then we can broach a visit to wilfred devizes generally fix that up then our subsequent action will be determined by what wilfred devizes says the sooner he sees devizes the better its a question whether it wouldnt be better for you or both of us to see devizes first no father first then when im properly instructed as a lawyer would say devizes a great tranquillity descended upon him she could not restrain a faint exclamation of impatience he looked up as if he awakened from profound meditation ill come along now he said to lonsdale mews ill have a talk to your father and then ill try to get at devizes and fix up some sort of a meeting between them thats what i ought to do ill go along with you now at once right o said christina alberta come along she threw on her cloak and clapped her hat upon her head in a dozen seconds and stood waiting im ready she said ill just change this jacket said lambone and kept her waiting a full ten minutes the taxi dropped them at the entrance of the mews i suppose it wont matter our arriving together said lambone he wont think its something preconcerted he doesnt have suspicions of that sort but when they reached the studio a little surprise awaited them fay crumb opened the door to them and her eyes looked paler and her neck longer and her face more absent minded than ever im so glad youve come at last she said in a flat distraught voice you see hes gone gone completely hes been away since three he went out alone but fay you promised i know i could see he was restless and i kept telling him youd be back soon it wasnt so easy keeping him he walked up and down and talked i must go out to my people he said i feel they need me i must be about my proper business i didnt know what to do i just hid his hat i never dreamt hed go out without his hat prim as he is i just went upstairs for a moment to get something i forget what now but anyhow it wasnt there and i may have spent five minutes looking for it and meanwhile he slipped out he left the door open and i never heard him go as soon as i knew hed gone i ran up the mews right up into lonsdale road and stood about there hed vanished ive been hoping hed come back every moment since before you returned but he hasnt come back her conviction was all too manifest that he would never come back id have done anything she said christina alberta and paul lambone looked at one another this rather puts the lid on said christina alberta what are we going to do now lambone followed christina alberta into the studio and sat down at once on the simple couch that became mr preembys bed at night the couch squeaked and submitted he stared at the floor and reflected ive got no engagements this evening he said none it wont be much good waiting here for him said christina alberta i feel in my bones he wont head back here for hours and hours he said and meanwhile he may be up to anything said christina alberta any old lark said lambone anything said christina alberta three said lambone and consulted his watch its now nearly five do you think there is any particular place christina alberta more than any other place where we might go and look for him where in fact we ought to look for him but will you come and look for him im at your service it wasnt in the bond i want to if you wont walk too fast i feel i ought to christina alberta stood before him with her arms akimbo i would bet five to one she said slowly that he heads for buckingham palace and demands an audience no that isnt how he puts it offers to give an audience to his vassal the king he was full of that this morning and then then i suppose they will lock him up and have an inquiry into his mental condition hm said lambone and then rising to the occasion lets go to buckingham palace well go there at once he said and moved slowly doorward well get a taxi they found a taxi in the kings road christina alberta did not belong to the taxi ing class and she was impressed by a sudden realization that lambone had all these thousands of taxi cabs upon the streets alert to do his bidding the taxi dropped them according to instructions at the foot of the victoria memorial which gesticulates in front of buckingham palace and they stood side by side surveying that building it looks much as usual said lambone you didnt expect him to bend it said christina alberta if he made a disturbance theyve cleared him up very completely that flag i suppose means g r is at home i wonder what do we do next he was rather at a loss the emotional atmosphere of this wide open place was quite different from the emotional atmosphere of his flat or the lonsdale mews in the flat and in the mews the appeal had been for him to act the appeal here was not to make himself conspicuous he was a man of decorous instincts a car passed a beautiful big shining napier and he thought the occupants looked at him as though they recognized him lots of people knew him nowadays and might recognize him in his flat in the studio at lonsdale mews he could foregather with christina alberta without compunction but now in this very conspicuous place this most conspicuous place he had a momentary realization that he and she didnt exactly match he with his finished effect of being a man about town a large distinguished mature man about town and she with her air of excessive youthfulness her very short skirts and her hat like the calyptra of a black mushroom pulled over her bobbed hair people might think them an incongruous couple people might wonder what had brought them together and what he was up to with her i suppose we ought to ask some one she said who oh one of those sentinels may one speak to the sentinels at the gate frankly im afraid of those tremendous chaps in the busbies id as soon speak to the horse guard in whitehall hed probably look right over our heads and say nothing and we should just dither away from beneath him i couldnt stand that but what are we to do nothing rash we must ask some one away there on the left towards victoria theres what looks like the real business way in theres two policemen im not afraid of policemen no and of course that man at the corner is a plain clothes man then lets ask him lambone made no move suppose he hasnt come here at all i know he meant to do so i suppose if he hasnt come said lambone we ought to wait about here on the chance of his coming he felt extremely like flight at that instant there ought to be seats here come along he said with a sudden return to manly decision lets ask one of those bobbies at the far gate the policeman at the gate to whom they addressed themselves listened gravely to their inquiries making no instant reply he belonged to that great majority of english speakers who are engaged upon the improvement of the word yes his particular idea was to make it long and purry yurrss he said breaking presently into speech yurrss there was a small gentleman without a at on yurrss he ad blue eyes and a moustache yurrss come to think of it there was a moustache a rather considerable moustache well e said he wanted to speak to king george on a rather urgent matter it always is a rather urgent matter never quite always rather we replied according to formula ed ave to write forn pointment perhaps e says you dont know who i am they all say that i guess its something important i says not the ormighty by any chance i says but e was ere last week and e wouldn go away and they ad to take im off in a taxi cab you know there was a chap ere sir thursday last or friday i forget which with a long white beard and air all down is back very like im i should think well anyow this sort of dashed your gentleman he kind of mumbled a name not sargon asked christina alberta it might ave been anyow there is no exceptions i says not even if you was a close relation we got no option here were just machines he stood sort of looking baffled for a time all this must be altered he said in a sort of low earnest voice its the duty of every king to give audience to every one every day i says very likely it is sir but we policemen arent in any position to elp it i says much less alter it so off e goes i kind of tipped the wink to the detective at the corner and e watched im go along the front and then cross over to the monument and stand looking up at the windows and then e shrugged is shoulders and took imself off and thats the last i see of im lambone asked a superfluous question it might be piccadilly way said the policeman it might be down towards trafalgar square fact is sir i didnt notice it was clear that the conversation was drawing to an end so thats that said lambone so far good hes still at large he expressed his thanks to the policeman and now he said with an air of bringing out the solution of a difficult problem very successfully all we have to do is to find him but where thats the essence of the problem he led the way back to the victoria memorial and stood side by side with christina alberta beneath that perfect symbol of the british empire the statue of queen victoria they stared down the mall to the distant admiralty arch and for a moment neither of them said a word it was a warm and serene october afternoon the cupolas of whitehall and westminsters two towers and a brown pile of mansions were just visible over the trees on the right transfigured to beauty by the afternoon glow the two tall columns of the duke of york and nelson rose over the trees and buildings to the left it was in the pause before the dinner and theatre traffic begins and only a few taxi cabs and a car or so emphasized the breadth of the processional roadway half a dozen windows in the admiralty had taken fire already from the sinking sun i suppose said lambone hes gone down there christina alberta stood with her arms akimbo and her feet a little apart i suppose he has the wide road ran straight to the distant admiralty arch and through that remote little opening was trafalgar square and charing cross and a radiating tangle of roads and streets spreading out and beyond and further into the twilight blue what will he make for now heaven knows im bankrupt i havent an idea neither spoke for a little while hes gone she said just gone and that simple and desolating thought filled her mind but the thoughts of paul lambone were more complex and intricate he perceived that a serious adventure was happening to him and that he was called upon to exert himself he had suddenly been called away from his tea and hot tea cake to hunt a slightly demented comparative stranger about london he wanted to do it and he wanted to do it properly and in a way to impress christina alberta and his intelligence told him that the best thing he could do would be to follow upon the probable track of his quarry and come up with him before he got into mischief or while he was getting into mischief and interfere and carry him off and meanwhile his more exercised lower nature was exhorting him to leave christina alberta to do the pursuing alone and go back as straightly as possible to his ample arm chair and sit down and think things out and then go to his best club to dinner and in fact quietly and neatly get out of this unexpected and tiresome business altogether and then he looked at christina alberta and realized that he could do nothing of the sort he couldnt leave her he looked at her profile the profile of a grave child and an almost maternal emotion was aroused in him she looked with anxious and perplexed eyes at the blue and limitless city that had swallowed up her daddy the scene was still warm with the evening sun glow but the blue twilight gathered in the lower eastern sky here and there a yellow pin point showed that london was beginning to light itself up she couldnt go down that road alone absurdly preposterously they were linked the impulse to disentangle himself was the impulse of a selfish discretion that was rapidly taking all the happiness out of his life and leaving security and luxuries in its place this was a call to that latent paul lambone to act even supposing she was a common queer little flapper that his imagination had made into a friend and heroine was that any reason whatever why he shouldnt see her through this trouble that had come upon her he made his decision he wont go back for ages he said following up the problem nobody would on an evening like this no she said but i dont see that that gives me any hint of what i ought to do next we can keep together and go down towards trafalgar square we might look along the embankment when we are tired we can get some dinner somewhere you can get a sort of dinner almost anywhere i suppose we shall want our dinner perhaps its not so hopeless a job as it seems at first a big job but not a hopeless one there are limitations to what he may do limitations in himself i mean i dont think hell go into uninteresting streets his feeling is spectacular hes much more likely to keep to open spaces and near conspicuous buildings that cuts out a lot of streets and he wont go far east in another hour the city will be shutting up and going home and putting out its lights hell turn back out of that westward you can spare the time ive no engagements at all to night it was to have been an off night and this business attracts me it is interesting to see just how far we can infer and guess his proceedings its a curious mental exercise do you know i think we shall find him she stood quite still for some moments its awfully good of you to come with me she said i come on one condition that you dont walk too fast weve never walked much together christina alberta but ive seen enough of you to know that you walk abominably fast every one knows the caf neptune near piccadilly circus and the various crowd that assembles there there you see artists and painters that are scarcely artists poets and mere writers artists models and drug fiends undergraduates in arts and medicine who are no better than they should be publishers and gay lawyers bolsheviks and white refugees american visitors who come to scoff and remain a prey stray students from the far east and jews and jews and jews and jewesses and hither at about half past nine that night came a stout large and wearily distinguished looking man accompanied by an attractive young lady in short skirts and bobbed hair who carried a large and shapely nose high and sternly and they threaded their way among the tables through the smoky atmosphere seeking a congenial place out of the garrulous confusing mirk arose a young man with a mop of red hair and protruded a rampant face and asked in a large whisper have you found him not a trace said paul lambone fay crumbs face looked up from the table through a haze of cigarette smoke nor we weve been looking too as well here as anywhere said the stout man where have you looked here said harold and hereabouts it seemed a suitable rendezvous weve ranged far and wide said lambone weve done miles oh endless miles and christina alberta has refused all nourishment for me as well as for herself at last i said either i sit down and eat or i drop down and die may we take these chairs you have that one christina alberta waiter it is a case of extreme fatigue no neither munchner nor pilsener i must have champagne bollinger will do and it must be iced rather over iced and with it sandwiches a very considerable number of sandwiches of smoked salmon yes a dozen ah he dropped his wrists on the table when i have had some drink i will talk he wheezed and became silent when did you leave the mews christina alberta asked fay half past eight not a sign of him have you been far harold asked lambone far said lambone and for a time was incapable of more his voice seemed to recede in perspective asking policemen for a small hatless man over great areas of london on and on from one policeman to another shes a most determined young woman god help the man who wins her love not a soul had seen him but i cant talk yet harold clawed his chin softly with long artistic fingers it is just possible he said slowly that he went in somewhere and bought a hat of course he must have got a hat said fay it never occurred to either of us that he would do anything so sane we never thought of asking in the hatters shops said christina alberta happily said lambone and turned to welcome his refreshment that would have been the last straw for a long time we were on the trail of another hatless man said christina alberta we ran him down in the essex road after tracking him all up pentonville but he was just a vegetarian in sandals and a beard and there was a report of a hatless man near the britannia but that came to nothing he seemed just to have come out of his house somewhere to buy fried fish off a barrow in the camden town high street extraordinary how a crowd collects when you ask the simplest questions said lambone with his mouth full of sandwich and how urgently helpful it can be they almost forced us up a staircase after that fried fish man who struck me as an extremely pugnacious suspicious looking fellow the crowd would have it we wanted him and he didnt seem to want in the very least to be wanted if i hadnt had an inspiration something very disagreeable might have happened i just said no its not this gentleman its another of the same name but what did he say you better he said but anyhow it satisfied the crowd and afterwards we got away quite easily on an omnibus that took us down to portland road station the champagne arrived in its ice pail hardly cold sir yet said the waiter feeling the bottle its not a time for fastidiousness said lambone and took a third sandwich youre not eating christina alberta and i insist upon your having at least one glass of this christina alberta drank a little and ate mechanically i wonder if we shall ever see him again said harold london is so vast so vast but i always feel that when i see anyone go out anywhere there is a tremendous courage in going out london must be full of lost people i used to be afraid of london until i discovered the tubes and the underground i felt i might be sucked up side streets to god knows where and keep on going round corners into longer and longer streets for ever i used to dream of the last street of all endless but whenever i get nervous i just ask for the nearest tube station and there i am he may be back at the studio now said fay paul lambone reached his fourth sandwich and his third glass of champagne with great rapidity he became more leisurely in his refreshment i am disappointed he said that i didnt think of the possibility of his buying a hat it has disorganized all my inductions you see i was so concentrated on what was going on inside his head that i never troubled about what might be going on outside it but a man of his neat and proper habits acquired through a lifetime of orderly living would get himself a hat almost mechanically we may have passed quite close to him in that i should have known him said christina alberta but until that pentonville man drew a red herring across the trail i am convinced we were close on his footsteps you see christina alberta insisted upon my asking every policeman we saw even men overworked irritable snappy rude men controlling the traffic but at any rate i chose the route i inferred the route you see my dear watson he smiled faintly in weary self approval at crumb the essential thing in a case like this is to put yourself in your mans place to think his thoughts instead of your own that is what i tried so far as being out of breath would allow it to impress on christina alberta its fairly straightforward here you have a man convinced beautifully and enviably convinced that he is the supreme lord of the world unknown unrecognized as yet but on the eve of his proclamation will such a man go along any street just as easily as any other not at all he will be elated expansive ascendant very well he will go up hill and not down he will choose wide highways and not narrow ones and tend towards the middle of the street he hasnt been run over cried christina alberta sharply no no he would avoid traffic because that would hustle him and impair his dignity open spaces would attract him high buildings bright lights the intimations of any assembly would draw him powerfully so he certainly crossed trafalgar square from the admiralty arch in a diagonal direction towards the conspicuous invitation of the coliseum you see my method he did not wait for crumb to answer but the more i think over our missing friend he went on the more i admire and envy him what crawling things we are content to be subjects units items pawns drops of water and grains of sand in the multitudinous unmeaning muddle of human affairs he soars above it he soars above it now he rejects his commonness and inferiority in one magnificent gesture his world the grandeur of it wherever he is to night and whatever fate overtake him he is a happy man and we sit here we sit here and drink i am ordering another bottle of that wine harold and i expect you and mrs crumb to abandon that warm and sticky beer and join me waiter yes another please we sit here in this crowded smoky gathering look at em while he plans the salvation of the world that we let slide and lifts his kingly will to god glorious exaltation suppose that all of us could be touched christina alberta interrupted i think we ought to telephone to the hospitals i didnt think before of the possibility of his being run over always he has been a little careless at crossings paul lambone lifted a deprecating hand and searched in his mind for some excuse for rest a little later he said after a slight pause the hospital staffs will be more at leisure it is their rush hour now ten to eleven yes the rush hour teddy winterton appeared wading through obstructive seated people his eye was fixed on christina alberta hullo said lambone in not too cordial greeting and glanced at christina alberta and back at the new comer teddy struggled for an unoccupied chair over which some lady had thrown a sealskin coat and captured it with profuse apologies to the owner of the cloak and squeezed it in at the end of the table between harold and fay who barred his way to christina alberta have pity on a lonely man he said genially and tried to catch the eye of christina alberta you shall have one glass of champagne said lambone with a slightly forced welcome in his tone how do christina alberta said teddy forcing her attention christina alberta turned to fay will you come back with me now she said to her back to the flat i must do that telephoning to the hospitals now or it wont be done fay looked at her curiously its serious said christina albertas eyes and fay stood up and struggled with her coat teddy leaped to his feet to assist her christina alberta had not removed her cloak and was ready i say christina alberta said teddy i want a word with you go on fay said christina alberta giving her friend a little dig in the back and pretending not to hear him teddy followed them out to the piccadilly pavement just a word he said fay was for standing a little way off but christina alberta would not let that happen i dont want a word she said but i might help you you might have done but its too late i never want to see you again give a fellow a chance youve had your chance and tried to take it you might at least keep up appearances said teddy damn appearances said christina alberta oh come on fay she gripped her friends arm teddy was left hovering he hesitated and then went back into the caf to rejoin crumb and lambone the two young women went on in silence for a little while anything up fay ventured everythings up said christina alberta i wonder if theres a ghost of a chance of finding daddy at the studio they made their way to chelsea without much further conversation fay had never before seen christina alberta looking tired when fay opened the door christina alberta pushed in past her daddy she cried in the dark passage daddy fay clicked on the light no said christina alberta of course hes not here hes gone fay what am i to do fays pale blue eyes became rounder christina alberta the valiant the modern was in tears theres the hospitals said fay doing her best to be brisk and cheerful book the second the world rejects sargon king of kings chapter the first incognito mr preemby had disappeared from christina albertas world for a time he must disappear almost as completely from this story mr preemby fades out taking over his outward likeness we have now to tell of another and greater person sargon the first the magnificent one king of all kings the inheritor of the earth it is no doubt a very wonderful and glorious thing to discover that instead of being the rather obscure widower of a laundry proprietor with no particular purpose in the world one is lord of the whole world but it is also to a conscientious man anxious to do right an extremely disturbing and oppressive discovery and at first it is natural that there should be something a little confusing to the mind in this vast and glittering idea it was an idea that carried with it an effect of release and enlargement for purposes as yet obscure he had been caught like a caged creature in that limited and uninteresting preemby life his imagination had rebelled against its finality some deep instinct had warned him that his life was an illusion in moments of reverie and sometimes between sleeping and waking there had been intimations of a light and purpose beyond the apparent reality now abruptly as though a portal swung open as though a curtain was drawn that light poured upon him dazzlingly his was no single life that begins and ends and is done with like an empty song his existence was like a thread that shone and vanished and returned in the unending fabric of being that was woven into a purpose in the past he had been porg in the city of kleb and he had been sargon and belshazzar many others had he been but those memories still slumbered under the dark waters of forgetfulness but the memory of sargon shone bright it was his sargon self that had returned and no other of his selves for some reason that was still obscure the power that ruled his life needed him to be sargon once again in this great distressful world of to day sargon had begun life humbly as an outcast babe and had risen to restore and rule and extend a mightier empire than the old world had ever seen before certain qualities hrrmp had been displayed by sargon and because of these qualities the power had called upon him again a whole series of memories was unfolding in his mind with an extraordinary convincingness he recalled his youth memories of those distant days in sumeria where the power had set him on high they were so bright and so pleasing that already they were thrusting his recollections of sheringham and woodford wells into the background making a fading phantom of his preemby existence he had never cherished these latter experiences never turned them over in his mind with any pleasure but his newly restored memories were memories to dwell upon there were pictures of his early life when he was a foundling a mysterious foundling at the court of his predecessor that predecessors name still escaped him young sargon was a fair and blue eyed youth a thing rare in brown sumeria and he had been found floating down the great river in a little cradle boat of rushes and bitumen and he had been taken and adopted by the ruler of the land and already as a lad he was pointed out as having an exceptional wisdom as being able to do what other men could not do he had the genius of the ruler it was not that he had great cleverness nor great skill nor strength many of those about him excelled him in these minor things in cleverness and memory work in particular prewm the son of the grand vizier excelled him but he had the true the kingly wisdom beyond them all the true the kingly wisdom said mr preemby sargon aloud and came into sharp collision with a tall dark gentleman hurrying from st jamess park towards st jamess palace sorry cried mr preemby sargon my fault said the tall dark gentleman late for an appointment and swept on odd where had mr preemby or sargon seen that face before could it be something connected it vaguely with sheringham and sunlit sand and then sumeria came uppermost and the tall dark gentleman became the chieftain of a desert tribe a desert tribe amidst the sands the ruffled surface became calm again and that boyhood in sumeria resumed possession of the mirror where were we even in those early days men had marked a gravity in the lad beyond his years he had avoided puerile games in all his lives he had avoided puerile games no cricketer even at sheringham modestly but firmly this youth had raised his voice in the council chamber and his words were seen to be wisdom the old men had sat around marvelling he sayeth sooth they said in their antique sumerian way a soothsayer he was also called the young pathfinder before sargon was fifteen the old childless ruler beset by enemies threatened with plots had marked him this boy might save the state then while yet only a few days over eighteen he was given charge of an expedition to pacify the mountain folk of the north and persuade them not to ally themselves with the enemy of the north he did more than he was told to do he went through the mountain land into the plains beyond and gave battle to the enemy of the north and defeated him and smote him severely after that all men perceived that he must be the new lord and master of sumeria the successor of his aged patron all applauded with sincerity except prewm the clever already adorned with precocious sprouting whiskers and he applauded with envy in his eyes and then came the days of the succession and the inauguration of the harem beautiful days and after that the birth of the princess royal his only child and that great expedition into the deserts of the south and more expeditions and great law makings wise laws and wiser and crowds of applauding grateful people and happy villages life became happy universally prewm plotted and rebelled and was dealt with after the simple custom of the time that was a regrettable necessity a thing not to be dwelt upon the frontiers spread and the great peace spread russia turkey in europe persia india ancient egypt somaliland and so on and so forth were conquered and made happy america and australia and the remains of atlantis still not completely submerged were discovered they were forgotten again afterwards but they were really discovered then and paid tribute a league of nations was established all the world told of the goodness of sargon and lived golden days for sargon ruled by the light of justice in his heart he mitigated the sacrifices in the temples and introduced a kind of protestantism into the creeds and services the people made songs praising him passing men and women would run to kiss his hand nor did he deny himself to his people that confidence was his end came alas the assassins knife the black assassin a madman a stranger it was wonderful he could remember his people mourning after he was dead the white glove of a policeman against mr preemby sargons chest just saved him from stepping in front of a motor bus he recoiled dexterously he was in trafalgar square a great meeting place a confluence here in the warm light of the october afternoon was a crowd even greater than the sumerian crowds here he would observe them they were dark crowds anxious faced crowds his coming back had to do with them there had been a great war much devastation the world was wounded and unable to recover the poor rulers and politicians of this age had no wisdom had no instinct for the fundamentally right thing once more a leader and a saviour was required one who had the wisdom that counts it was sargon that walked under the noses of nelsons lions and made his way past the statue of george the fourth to the balustrading that commands the square he took up his position there for a long survey he looked down whitehall to the great tower of the houses of parliament and whitehall was full of a golden haze set with a glitter of traffic the stream of omnibuses cars and motor vans poured up to mingle with the streams that came out of northumberland avenue and the strand and the joint flow sundered again to the left of him and to the right away to pall mall across the square there no street lamps were lit as yet but in the rounded bluffs of building to the left a few windows were warm with lights below across the square thin streams of pedestrians flowed like ants from one point to another and the squat little station of the tube railway perpetually swallowed up dots and clumps of individuals some sort of meeting was going on at the foot of the nelson column a mere knot of people without evident enthusiasm men with white and red placards about unemployment were distributing white handbills and shaking collecting boxes immediately underneath a few poorly dressed children ran about and played and squabbled just a little patch this was in one of his cities for you see by the lapse of time and the development of his ancient empire he was the rightful owner and ruler of this city and of every other city in the world and he had come back to heal the swarming worlds disorders and reinstate the deep peace of old sumeria once again but how to set about this task that was the difficulty there must be no half advent he must take hold swiftly and decisively he realized and from the balustrading in front of the national gallery it looked a large loose scattering sort of world to take hold of it might refuse to be taken hold of if he began now if he began to shout from this place it was more than likely that no one would heed him he must watch warily for his opportunity and make no mistakes it did not become the lord and restorer of the whole earth to make mistakes now for example that had nearly been a mistake at buckingham palace it had blown over all right but it might have had serious consequences people did not know the master yet had no inkling they might said sargon lapsing into a preemby homeliness have run me in and a pretty fool i should have looked then there must be no more hasty action of that sort no indeed it became him rather to wait for guidance the power that had brought him back into the world and awakened him to a sense of his true identity and his mission might be trusted presently to send him an enlightened supporter or so who would recognize him because of course he must resemble the monarch he had been even as hockleby had been recognizably like prewm as he weighed this thought his hand sought his moustache and he twisted it thoughtfully it was in effect a disguise meanwhile meanwhile he must see what he could determine the mood of the people and learn their particular needs and distresses he could go among his people unsuspected like haroun al raschid but for a wiser purpose haroun al raschid whispered sargon and looked up to lord nelson and nodded to him in a friendly way haroun al raschid would that my pocket was full of pieces of gold but of that to morrow that man what was his name preemby had a bank somewhere he felt for his breast pocket the cheque book was still there one signed the cheques a e preemby queer but one did this a e preemby had played the part of a chrysalis his hoard remained in the strand his majesty caught a glimpse of his reflection in a shop window his hair was a little disordered and he disliked to have his hair disordered he went into a hat shop that presented itself conveniently and bought himself a hat he took out his little note case to pay a reassuring thing to do for in it were no less than seven pound notes he counted them with satisfaction after paying up at tunbridge he had drawn again on his bank he hesitated whether he should give largesse to the shopman and did not do so it was not another grey felt hat with a black ribbon he bought it was an exceptional felt hat with a large brim such as an artist or a literary personage might have chosen it was not the hat that albert edward preemby the restrained the hesitating would have bought it was much more sargons sort of hat yet not pure sargonesque there was a touch of disguise about it still a more manifest disguise the brim came down over ones brow one could see ever and again in shop windows and incidental mirrors that now a shadow of mystery lay upon those brooding blue eyes he made his way eastward towards aldwych and so into kingsway looking now at the shops now scanning the faces of the people to day he was the unknown scarce a soul that gave him a second glance but soon would come discovery and then all this careless jostling crowd would be magnetized as he passed would turn with one accord to him they would salute and whisper and wonder and he must be ready for them ready to guide their destinies forthwith it would not do to stand at a loss and say er to stand collecting his thoughts and clear his throat hrrmp terrible the responsibility that lay upon him but he would not shirk it what should be his opening words to them when the moment of revelation came first let there be peace better words than that one could not imagine he muttered to himself peace and not war among the nations peace and not war among individuals peace in the street in the workroom in the shop peace love and peace i sargon the magnificent command it i sargon have come back after many ages to give peace to the whole world a shop window drew him it was a map shop and prominently displayed in the window was a map of europe after the treaty of versailles two and sixpence he stood looking at that it would all have to be altered again that was just part of his task then he surveyed the rest of the window behind the map of europe there hung a wall map of the world he would need such a map of the world you cannot rule the world without a map of it or you may forget large portions or would a globe be better maps are all to be seen at once and besides they are more portable furthermore the shop did not seem to sell globes and he did not know where globes were to be bought he went in and bought the world map and emerged again on kingsway after an interval with a roll four feet long under his arm he was also carrying an ingenious flat paper planisphere which had caught his fancy as he stood at the counter it might be useful he felt for astrological purposes he began to think vaguely of his possible destination whither was he going he was seeking quarters he was seeking indeed some lonely hermitage he had slipped away from the princess royal who also had come back rather needlessly he thought into this modern world because it was necessary for him to be absolutely alone for a time he had to spend some days or weeks in spiritual struggle and meditation and mental purification before his revelation came even she might not minister to him during that period she was devoted but she hampered him indeed she hampered him greatly she did not fully understand her remarks and questions were generally disconcerting and sometimes downright annoying it was quite probable that the metamorphosis might never occur with her about and besides always in the history of great visitants and marvellous returns there had been this opening phase of withdrawal and self communion buddha muhammad they had all done it perhaps he would fast perhaps fasting would be necessary perhaps there would be celestial visitants he wished he knew more of the technique of fasting did one just stop having meals or were there ceremonies and precautions but of that later first he had to find that quiet room his secret place of final preparation presently he found himself in the grey squares of bloomsbury and every house he passed displayed in its window a genteel card offering apartments or bed and breakfast here also were private hotels and even a plain boarding house well here no doubt it had to be a simple room amidst his unsuspecting people a simple simply furnished room but through all bloomsbury to judge by the dark green and silver cards in its ground floor windows was offering shelter and sustenance to the homeless and the stranger the new lord of the world found it no easy matter to secure that simple room he needed for his own use for more than an hour he was visiting one grey house after another knocking standing on doorsteps entering passages laid with immemorial oilcloth and demanding a sight of the accommodation offered inspecting it asking prices and it became more and more evident arousing suspicion the people stared at his rolled up map and his planisphere and seemed to dislike them instinctively he had not expected such blunt demands for information his vague mysteriousness was swept aside he found himself difficult to explain they wanted to know how he was occupied and when he would like to move in none of them seemed prepared for him to just sit down in his room there and then they expected him to go out and fetch his luggage it undermined his confidence that behind him there was no luggage all these people he realized more and more distinctly would expect him to produce luggage and might behave unreasonably if he did not do so a mere readiness to pay in advance he gathered was not enough for them he had counted upon finding kind and simple people behind these lodging house doors people who would accept him and look up to him from the first and wonder about him and his planisphere speculate about its significance and gradually realize the marvellous visitant that had come to them but the people he saw were not simple people mostly they were dingy sophisticated people they came up out of basements in a mood of sceptical scrutiny men in shirt sleeves morose for the most part and generally ill shaven extremely knowing and anything but virginal young women grimy looking older women hungrily lean or unwholesomely fat one had a goitre like growth and always there was something defensive in their manner and the rooms he saw were even less simple than the people his consciousness was invaded by a sense of the vast moral changes that had happened to the world since he had ruled the white robed honesty of his sumerian irrigators then a room would have a table a seat or two a shelf with a few phials an image or suchlike religious object a clay tablet and a writing style perhaps if the occupant was educated but these rooms were encumbered with contradictions they had windows to let in the light and dark curtains to keep it out sargons hidden second youth in the laundry had made him very sensitive to dirtiness and the cotton lace curtains of those places were generally very dirty indeed electric light was still rare in apartments mostly they were lit from gas brackets that descended from the centre of the ceiling and carried globes of frosted and cut glass always there was a considerable table in the centre and two uneasy arm chairs and there were lumpish sideboards of shiny liver coloured wood and comfortless sofas and incredible ornaments sometimes the rooms and particularly the bedrooms had a meretricious smartness and gaiety with mezzotints of ladies in the natural state trying to pass themselves off as allegorical figures or of the baths in the congested harems of wealthy rather than refined orientals the over mantels were extraordinary affairs and much loaded with crockery ornaments little jars small gilt winged angels red devils or encouraging looking ladies in bathing dresses that were too tight for them a common form of decoration was to fasten up plates on the wall much as one sees vermin nailed up on a barn a considerable number of these homes for hire were as shabby as roadside tramps one stood out in his memory as faded and dusty and grey and threadbare beyond the possibility of reality his self absorption was penetrated by the wonder of who could live and who could have lived in such quarters all his life had been amongst clean and bright surroundings it was rare that he had any glimpses of that worn and weary stratum of english town life in which things are patched indeed but in which it is rare for anything to be mended or cleaned and incredible that anything should be replaced even the air in these rooms seemed long out of date and the glass over the rusty engravings of the monarch of the glen and the stag at bay spotted by remote ancestral flies does anyone ever stay here asked sargon of the shattered looking lady in charge he did not realize the cruelty of his question until he had asked it my last gentleman stayed here fifteen years said the shattered lady he was a copying clerk he died in hospital this june dropsy he always found this very satisfactory very satisfactory i never knew him complain he was a very good friend to me a great desire for fresh air came upon sargon how much are these rooms he asked i must think it over think it over and let you know she asked her price the usual price in that street but as she led the way down to the door she said if its too much if you made an offer sir despair looked out of her grime rimmed eyes i must think about it said sargon and was once more at large why did people get so dirty and dismal and broken down surely in sumeria there were never lives like that it would have to be altered all this would have to be altered when the kingdom came then as the twilight deepened sargon discovered just the peaceful room he desired it announced itself hopefully not by the usual printed card but by a hand written tablet saying a room to let in a window that had no lace curtains but little purple ones enhancing rather than concealing a bare looking white room lit pleasantly by the flickering of a fire there were one or two pictures real coloured pictures hanging on the white wall rather wearily sargon lifted the knocker and supplemented its appeal by pressing the electric bell there was no immediate answer and he knocked a second time before the door opened a slender young man appeared holding a small girl perched on his shoulder she regarded sargon gravely with very dark grey blue eyes everybody seems to have gone out said the slender young man in a very pleasant voice what can i do for you you have a room to let said sargon there is a room to let here yes said the slender young man and his appreciative dark eyes took in the details of the figure in front of him could i see it i suppose he might see it susan the young man hesitated of course the gems got to see it said the small girl if mrs richman was here shed show it him fast enough old stoopid and she pulled the slender young mans hair affectionately but very very hard you see the young man explained the landlady is out dont susan and the landladys lady assistant is out too every one is out and were sort of unofficially left in charge somehow properly i ought not to have answered the door but i told you to silly said the little girl the young man made no definite move instead he asked a question is that a map sir you are carrying he asked it is a map of the world said sargon very helpful i should think sir and so you found your way here well the rooms upstairs if youd come up hold tight susan and try not to strangle me and he led the way up the staircase it was just the usual staircase and hall with oilcloth and wall paper to imitate some exceptionally bilious coarse grained wood as they ascended the young lady ran great risks in her resolution never to take her eyes off sargon and his map she twisted round a complete circle and forced her bearer to stop on the first landing and readjust her if you pull my hair once more said the slender young man i shall put you down and never never never give you a ride again its on the next floor sir if youd go first the room appeared delightfully free from unnecessary furnishings there was a little plain bed a table under the window and a gas stove and the walls were papered in brown paper adorned with commonplace but refreshing japanese colour prints there was a recess one side of the fire place with three empty shelves painted like the mantelpiece a deep blue the young man had clicked on an electric light which was pleasantly shaded its rather plain said the young man i like it said sargon i have no use for superfluities it used to be my room said the young man but now i share the dining room floor with the people downstairs and ive given this up its rather on my conscience people downstairs what people downstairs there arent no people downstairs its daddy and mummy he means said the young lady its rather on my conscience said the young man that i persuaded mrs richman to alter the furniture it isnt to everybodys taste may i ask said sargon how much the room might be thirty shillings i believe said the young man with breakfasts sargon put down his map and the planisphere upon the table he felt that he must secure this room or be for ever defeated i am willing he said to take the room i would pay for it in advance and take up my quarters at once but i must warn you my position in the world is peculiar i give no reference i bring no luggage except of course these charts said the young man havent you for instance a toothbrush sargon thought no i must get myself a toothbrush i think it would look better said the young man if necessary said sargon i will pay for two weeks in advance and i will get myself all necessary things the young man regarded him with an affectionate expression if it was my room i should let you have it like a shot he said but mrs richman is the landlady and in many respects shes different from me have you travelled far sir in space said sargon no but in time perhaps in time yes but i would rather not enter into explanations at present the young mans interest and amusement deepened he put susan down on her feet might i look at your map he asked willingly said sargon he unrolled the map on the table and put his finger on london we are here he said exactly said the young man helping to hold the map on the table from which it seemed likely to slip it is still the most convenient centre in the world said sargon for almost any purpose said the young man for mine yes said sargon and that star thing that must be a great help it is said sargon i suppose you would work in the room it would be just yourself there would be no coming and going of people none while i was here no one would know me afterwards perhaps but that does not concern us here i should remain incognito incognito the young man repeated as though he considered the word of course naturally by the by sir might i ask your name if you hit me again susan i shall do something cruel and dreadful to you wed have to know your name for the time i think mr mr sargon of course said the young man for the time sargon wasnt that an assyrian king or does my memory betray me it is not the assyrian sargon in this case it is the sumerian sargon his predecessor not a word more sir i understand you must be fatigued after your long journey and i should love i should dearly love to let you the room wow susan you go downstairs pinching i cant stand come along you go down to your own proper room and lets have no nonsense about it come susan backed to the wall and prepared to resist tooth and nail i didnt mean to pinch bobby she said i didnt mean to pinch troof and really i was just feelin your trousis oh dont take me down bobby dont take me down i will be good ill be awful good ill just stay here and look at the funny geman if you take me down bobby now is this a real reformation susan a conversion a change of heart will you be a jeune femme range and all that if i forgive you ill be anyfing bobby dear flet me stay well cease to exist then for all practical purposes and ill forgive you what can the nice gentleman think of you susan and you more than five bah we were saying mr sargon yes of course i was saying that you ought to take the room payment in advance will be accepted but there is that toothbrush and other small what shall i say realistic touches i shouldnt mind personally but im only an agent so to speak properly i am a sort of writer properly i ought to be writing a novel now but as you see mrs richman has left the house on my hands and my friends downstairs have left this charming young lady on my hands put that tongue back at once susan unladylike child and here we are but as im saying mrs richman is the principal she has her fancies about lodgers it is useless to dispute about them she will want a show of luggage she will insist but that is really not an insurmountable difficulty this you will remember the name is nine midgard street if you go out from here and turn to the left take the third to the right and go straight on you will come to a main thoroughfare full of buses and trams and traffic and light and noise and at the corner you will find a shop where they sell second hand trunks and bags now if you bought an old battered largish bag and then went across the road to a chemists shop and got those washing things you need oh and a reserve collar or so at the outfitters next door you must get such things you see the idea sargon stood in front of the unlit gas stove this seems to be acting a falsehood but you must have clean collars sometimes protested the young man i admit that said sargon and then you can settle down here and tell me about that business of yours otherwise you know youll just wander about your suggestion is really quite a helpful one said sargon getting the thing into focus i shall adopt it you wont lose the way back why should i nine midgard street i shall remember queer world it is said the young man isnt it how did you leave the old folks in sumeria my people were happy said sargon exactly ive been there since quite recently but the weather wasnt good and i got knocked about by a shell and had a nasty time as a wounded prisoner hot crowded no shelter nothing cool to drink but in your time it was different very said sargon and now by jove that kettle is boiling over all by this time susan come down to my room such as it is and have a cup of tea sir and then you can go out and make those little arrangements of yours and dig yourself in so to speak before mrs richman comes back this by the by is your gas meter you get gas by the shilling in the slot arrangement you are being very very helpful to me said sargon it shall not be forgotten when my time comes nothing it just happened you came into my hands so to speak no susan we dont you walk downstairs pinching is forgiven but not forgotten you can leave your map sir and that star thing as visible signs of your occupation no susan on foot the young mans room was bookish and rather untidy and susan had been killing toys on the carpet a china headed doll and something or other of yellow painted wood appeared to be the chief victims the doll had bled sawdust profusely dark curtains were drawn and a green shaded electric light threw all the apartment into darkness except the floor there was a gas fire with a gas ring on which a boiling kettle steamed like an excited volcano there was a deal table on which was a big pile of letters address to aunt suzannah co editor of wilkins weekly and there was a large untidy desk on which was another litter of letters evidently receiving attention and in the midst of the desk a writing pad on which reposed a squeezable tube of liquid glue and a half mended toy the glue oozed upon the face sheet of the writing pad beneath these words written in a beautifully neat handwriting ups and downs a pedestrian novel by robert roothing chapter the first which introduces our hero beyond that the novel did not seem to have progressed with the dexterity of long established usage bobby made tea and produced plum bread and butter meanwhile he kept a wary eye on susan who had sat down by the waste paper basket and was tearing up paper and attended to the remarks and attitudes of his remarkable visitor sargon already liked this young man enormously it was extremely reassuring and encouraging to meet such kindly acceptance and understanding after the chill and doubt and ugliness of the previous hours experiences and it was nice and refreshing to have tea a sort of grey insecurity a threat of suppression that had come over his mind vanished in this genial atmosphere the shrivelled incognito expanded the hidden mystery beneath it grew rich and full once more this young man he seemed ready to believe anything sargon walked up and down with his hands behind his back as if in the profoundest meditation he would have muttered a few phrases in sumerian but for some reason he had quite forgotten that forgotten tongue and so you write books he said regally not books bobby answered over his shoulder he was now toasting a circle of plum bread not books yet but it is ridiculous isnt it i am a bit of a poet and all that sort of thing and a journalist of sorts just answers to correspondents laborious but a living he indicated the piles of letters on the deal table as for books i have as a matter of fact started a novel its on that desk but thats only in the last few days and its so difficult to get a lot of time to oneself to really let oneself go with it inspiration said sargon understandingly well one must let oneself go a bit i suppose particularly at first but theres always something one must do cropping up to prevent it with me also no doubt that is why said sargon i am withdrawing into this solitude to collect my forces in sumeria it was always the practice before any great undertaking to go out into the wilderness for a certain tale of days if i go out into the wilderness i get so lonely in the evenings said bobby ssh that was the front door he went out upon the staircase and stood listening mrs richman sargon heard him call sme said a ladys voice heres a lodger for the second floor front i bin to the pictures said the voice outside mary and doug a fair treat a corpulent lady in a black bonnet appeared breathing heavily she panted a few obvious questions and bobby hovered helpfully at sargons elbow to prevent him making any mistakes hell pay in advance said bobby thats awright said mrs richman when will he move in hes getting his luggage right away said bobby i suppose its all right said mrs richman i know his people at least i know about them ive been in his part of the country you can be quite sure hes all right said bobby well if you say so said mrs richman ope youll be comfortable mr mr sargon mr sargon and after a few rather vague comments on the weather mrs richman withdrew and now said bobby ill just unload susan on her and come with you for that bag its extraordinary how people lose their way in london at times ive let the second floor front to a lunatic said bobby breaking the news to his ground floor friends mr and mrs malmesbury oh bobby and with susan about cried mrs malmesbury reproachfully but hes a quite harmless lunatic tessy and he had to be taken in somewhere but a lunatic said mrs malmesbury i only said that for effect said bobby hes really morbidly sane i wouldnt have let him go for anything some day when i really get to work on that novel ill put him in i must have material tessy and hes wonderful he was preparing supper for the malmesburys and himself he was frying some sausages and potatoes over a gas ring previously bobby had done most of the putting of susan to bed and he had sat and told her stories according to custom until she was fast asleep tessy malmesbury was out of sorts she had a neuralgic headache billy malmesbury had taken her for a walk in regents park and she had come home exhausted things would have gone to pieces badly if bobby had not taken them in hand tessy was never very well nowadays she was a slight and fragile little thing and susan had been a violent and aggressive child long before she was born in the long lost days before the war when bobby had seen tessy first she had been the lightest daintiest most perfect thing imaginable he had compared her to a white petal drifting down through sunlight and almost written a poem about her he had loved her tremendously but it had seemed to him impossible to make love to so exquisite a being and billy malmesbury who was less scrupulous had slipped in front of him and married her she had not appreciated the delicacy of not making love to her and then came the war and wounds and here they all were again fagged and near the thirties in a world where their small annuities brought them far less than they had promised to do billy was the junior partner of an architect and much encumbered with drawing boards he was a large framed young man with a big round good looking slightly astonished face pleasantly dappled with freckles he had a great protective affection for bobby he sat now and designed a new sort of labour saving pantry and with a sense of infinite protection let bobby get the meal and now i can tell you said bobby when at last all three of them were sitting at table its a little dear of a lunatic he said if its a lunatic at all i hope it isnt said tessy hes quite tidy in his person and he hangs together mentally he hangs together and his eyes arent in the least wild a leetle too bright and open perhaps but he does think the world belongs to him well susan does that said billy and so does billy said tessy but not quite with the same air of magnificent responsibility you see he thinks hes a certain mesopotamian monarch called sargon ive heard of him because we had a little dust up with the turks round and about his stamping ground he thinks hes this sargon come again and come somehow that bits a little difficult into the empire of the whole earth it was sargon you know who started all these british lions and imperial eagles in the world and so he proposes to take possession of the planet which is in such a frightful mess hear hear said billy and put it in order what more simple cried tessy exactly why havent we all thought of that said billy but where does he come from asked tessy not a sign he might be a suburban nurseryman or a small draper or something of that sort i cant place him one or two phrases he used suggested a house agent but he may have picked them up from advertisements and his first proceeding perfectly rational was to buy a map of the world naturally if you are going to rule the world you ought to have a map of it handy has he any money enough to pay his way hes got a small note case that seems to be all right after wed got a bag for him he hadnt any luggage and i thought hed better buy a bag to satisfy mrs richman we sat down upstairs and had a simple straightforward talk about the world and what had to be done with it most instructive bobby helped himself to some more fried potatoes and what is going to be done with it let me see said bobby its quite an attractive little programme rather i think on the lines of the labour programme only simpler and more thorough the distinction of rich and poor is to be abolished altogether women are to be freed from all disadvantages there is to be no more war he gets at the roots of things every time if those are the roots said billy but isnt the real question how to do it asked tessy arent we all agreed about those things in theory in theory yes said bobby but not in reality if every one really wanted to abolish the difference of rich and poor it would be as easy as pie to find a way theres always a way to everything if you want to do it enough but nobody really wants to do these things not as we want meals all sorts of other things people want but wanting to have no rich and poor any more isnt real wanting it is just a matter of pious sentiment and so it is about war we dont want to be poor and we dont want to be hurt or worried by war but thats not wanting to end those things he wants to end them but hows he going to set about it said billy that is still a little vague i think there is to be a sort of proclamation hes thinking that out upstairs now he seems to think that he has to call up some sort of disciples then i think he will go down to westminster and take the speakers place on the woolsack or something of that sort it is the speaker sits on the woolsack isnt it or is it the lord chancellor anyhow there are to be demonstrations on a large and dignified scale the people have forgotten the ancient simple laws he says he himself had forgotten them but he has remembered them now they have come back to him and presently every one will remember them all the great old things justice faith obedience mutual service as it was in ancient sumeria dreamland ancient sumeria you know the dear old golden age he has come to remind people of the true things in life which every one has forgotten and when he has reminded them every one will remember and be good and there you are tessy i hope it will affect susan but i dont feel at all sure i have a sort of feeling that susan could stash up any golden age they started in about five minutes but then perhaps im a bit prejudiced about her its rather wonderful all the same said billy he is rather wonderful he sits up there and looks at you with his little round innocent face and tells you all these things and assuming hes lord of the world theyre perfectly right and proper he sits with the map of the world unrolled on the table i ventured to suggest that he would require a lot of subordinate rulers and directors they will come he said no office no duty shall be done henceforth except by the proper people that has been neglected too long let every man do that he is best fitted to do then everything will be well and whens all this to begin asked billy any time i dont think bobbys expression became profoundly judicial i dont think hell do anything for a day or so i pointed out to him that he ought to consider his demonstrations very carefully before he makes them and he seemed inclined to agree some mistake he says has occurred already i couldnt find out what apparently to morrow he is just going to look at london quietly but firmly from the monument and from the dome of saint pauls and also he wants to observe the manners of his subjects in the streets and railway stations and wherever there is a concourse of people the scales have fallen from his eyes he explains and now that he knows that he is lord of the world he realizes how distressed and unsatisfactory everybodys life is even when they dont know its unsatisfactory his own life was terribly unsatisfactory he says unreal and frustrated until he awoke and realized the greatness of his destiny and what was that life of his asked tessy i tried to get that and he caught the eager note in my voice i suppose and shut up like an oyster the drapers shop perhaps or a milk round i wonder but bobby cried billy in the expostulatory tone of one who remonstrates with wild unreason he must come from somewhere exactly said bobby and somewhere must be looking for him but you cant always hurry these things and meanwhile i take it its our bounden duty to keep an eye on him and see that he doesnt bump himself too hard or fall into the wrong hands until some one comes along dont you get up tessy youre tired and bobby jumped to his feet and proceeded to change the plates and dishes while billy fell into a profound meditation upon the problem of the new neighbour upstairs presently he smiled and shook his head in kindly disapproval this will suit bobby all right he said to tessy whenever he ought to be upstairs in his own room getting on with that novel of his he will be up on the second floor talking to what is it sargon accumulating material corrected bobby from the welsh dresser where he was turning a tin of peaches out into a glass dish accumulating evidence not even a spider could spin a yarn out of an empty stomach tessy have you just simply lost the cream or have you put it away in a new place very carefully for me to guess oh right o ive got it let us be frank about it sargon had his doubts not always there were times when his fantasy was bravely alive and carried him high above any shadow of uncertainty and he was all that he could have ever wished to be then mr preemby was almost forgotten but there were moments there were phases when he became aware of a cold undertow of conviction that he was after all just mr preemby mr preemby formerly of the limpid stream laundry making believe carrying it off and perhaps presently failing to carry it off this chill flow of doubt could even oblige him to reason with himself force him into a definite reassurance of himself he would debate the whole question candidly fairly surely there was no deception could have been no deception about that sance told me things no one but i could have known he would repeat i pin my faith to that he knew that christina alberta had not really believed it was just because of her revealing scepticism that he had fled from her she had asked questions tearing rending questions and she had said um it is not proper to say um to world emperors if presently he fasted or went into a trance he felt sure that she would come and stand about beside him and say um and spoil everything well anyhow he was away from that for a bit but to be away from doubt was not enough the great discovery threatened to evaporate he wanted the comfort of the disciple he wanted help and reassurance bobby had comforted him greatly while sargon had been going from one suspicious lodging house keeper to another the faith of the new saviour of mankind had weakened dreadfully but bobby from the first had had something deferential in his manner had seemed to understand his questions had grown more and more intelligent perhaps he was to be the first of the reawakened adherents perhaps presently he would be recognizable as some faithful servant in that still so largely forgotten past a trusted general perhaps or some intimate court official yet even when sargon doubted he believed it is a very comprehensible paradox he knew clearly that to be sargon was to be real was to signify and make all the world signify was to go back into the past and reach right out into the future was to escape altogether from the shrivelled insignificance of the preemby life to be sargon was to achieve not only greatness but goodness sargon could give and sargon could dare sargon could face lions and die for his people but preemby could go round three fields had been known to go round three fields to evade the hostility of a barking terrier preembys world was dust and dirt a mud speck in infinite space and there was no life on it but abjection preemby was death sargon was rebirth into a world of spacious things not very clearly did sargon achieve these realizations but he felt them throughout his being something had happened to him of inestimable value and truth he had to cling to this gift and hold it and keep it or be for ever fallen christina alberta notwithstanding the whole world notwithstanding so he walked up and down his little upper room in midgard street and elaborated his conception of his new rle as lord and protector of the whole world twilight gave place to night but he did not turn on the light he liked the friendly darkness all visible things are limiting things but the darkness goes out and beyond everything to god i must look he said i must watch and observe but not for too long there is action action gives life that fellow preemby poor soul he could look at things but dared he lift a finger no everywhere suffering everywhere injustice and disorder the desert and the wilderness breaking back in on us and he did nothing if one does not call and call aloud how can one expect an answer in this world vast terrible strikes hoardings adulteration profiteers nevertheless men who once lived bravely and did their duty who may do it again once they hear the call awake remember the high path simple honour sargon calls you hrrmp he came to a halt at his uncurtained window and looked out on the plain flat face of the opposite houses pierced here and there by a lit window most had the blinds drawn but just opposite a woman worked by lamp light at a table sewing something her needle hand flew out perpetually and the book and one hand and the cuff of a reader came also into the picture the rest of him hidden behind the curtain at a bedroom window there was a looking glass and a girl tried on a hat and looked at it this way and that then suddenly she vanished and after a little interval the light went out all their scattered lives said sargon holding out his arms with a benevolent gesture knitted drawn together by wisdom and love a rudder put on the drifting world came a knock at the door come in said sargon bobby appeared getting on all right sir he said in his engaging subaltern manner he clicked on the electric light and came into the room cadaverous and pleasant face he had surely one would remember presently what he had been wondered if you were eating anything to night he asked i quite forgot eating said sargon quite my mind troubled by many grave matters i have much to think of much to plan the hour grows late the time is near i wonder if the serving woman here only breakfasts said bobby here we are on bed and breakfast terms strictly the rest is with ourselves for an emergency like this there is nothing so good as the rubicon restaurant the grill room keeps open quite late they will do you a chop or a cutlet or ham and eggs very good ham and eggs crisp ham you go out from here turn to the left at the second corner and go right down hampshire street until you come to it youll have no difficulty in finding it the word crisp had settled it i will avail myself said sargon and its equally easy to find your way back said bobby with a faint flavour of anxiety in his voice have no fear young man said sargon in a tone of jolly reassurance have no fear ive found my way in many climes and under many conditions the wild mountains the trackless desert time and space of course said bobby i forgot that still london is different said bobby the next day at about half past four in the afternoon a small but heavily moustached figure with eyes full of blue determination emerged from saint pauls cathedral and stood at the top of the steps before the great doors surveying the jostling traffic of ludgate hill and the churchyard there was a sort of valiant uncertainty in the figures pose as though it was equally resolved to be up to something and uncertain about what it meant to do london had been looked at from the top of the monument and from the cathedral dome on a crystal clear october day and it had betrayed an unusual loveliness and greatness under the golden sunshine but it had shown itself too as a vast dreamy multitudinousness in which none but those who are resolute and powerful in action can hope to escape being swallowed up it had stretched away to wide sunlit stretches that seemed to be the horizon and then up in the leaden blue other stretches had been visible of houses of shipping of distant hills the vans and carts in the shadowed streets below had looked like toys the people were hats and hurrying legs and feet curiously proportioned and over all an immense dome of kindly cloud flecked sky he had walked round the little gallery under the ball muttering a wilderness a city that has forgotten how fair it might be how great it might be how fair and great it shall be and now he had come down again from these high places and the time had come for him to gather together his disciples and ministers and inaugurate the new world he had to call them followers would not come to him unless he called them they would wait for him to act not know even of what awaited them until he called them but when he called them they would surely come it was with an extraordinary sense of power over mens destinies that he stood now upon saint pauls steps and reflected that even now men and women might be passing by among these busy men thronging the pavement among the people in omnibuses among the girls clattering away at their typewriters behind the upstairs windows over whose busy petty undistinguished lives hung the challenge of his summons yonder perhaps was his abu bekr his right hand man his peter let them wait a little longer he waved the traffic onward with a gesture of kindly encouragement soon now he said very soon go on while ye may even now the sorting of the lots begins yet a moment more he stood still and silent a statuette of destiny and now he whispered and now and first he was no longer troubled by his oblivion of the sumerian tongue in the night he had recovered the gift of tongues he had muttered strange words in the darkness and understood hrrmp he said a word common to many tongues clearing the way after five thousand years for the return of the forgotten sounds to a renewed use in the world of men dadendo fizzoggo grandioso magnificendodidodo yes he whispered the unveiling of the countenance the first revelation then perhaps they will see and slowly he descended the steps his eyes searching the convergent frontages of the churchyard for some intimations of a barbers shop chapter the second the calling of the disciples there are already wide differences of statement and opinion about the order and the details of the calling of the followers of sargon happily we are in a position to give the circumstances with all the exactitude that may be necessary and with an authority that will anticipate vexatious criticism it was about half past six that sargon appeared in cheapside and the days traffic was already ebbing in that busy city thoroughfare his countenance was transformed and shone with that kind of luminosity that only the most thorough and exhaustive shaving can give a youthful smoothness had been restored to it the facial mane the vast moustache that had veiled it for so many years from mankind was abandoned a mess of clippings and lather now in a barbers basin now the face was as bare as the young alexander a fresh complexioned sincere and innocent countenance speaking clearly with an unfiltered voice it was flushed with a natural excitement as it went along cheapside scrutinizing the faces of the foot passengers on a momentous and mystical search the blue eyes beneath the brim of the distinguished looking hat were alight was it to be this man was it to be this the first to be called was a young man of leytonstone named godley a young man with a large and excessively grave grey face and a deliberation of utterance amounting to an impediment he was carrying a microscope in a wooden box he was a student of biology with a cytological bias naturally very polite and temperamentally disposed to be precise and deliberate in all he said and did he was making his way from liverpool street station to the birkbeck institute by a circuitous route because he had nearly an hour in hand before his class began he stood poised on the pavement edge at a street corner waiting for two vans to pass when his call came to him he found a very earnest barefaced little man beside him whose blue eyes searched his countenance swiftly and who then gripped his arm i think said sargon that it is you mr godley who was not without a sense of humour attempted to reply that it certainly was him but that impediment of his partly natural but greatly developed by affectation arrested him about the word certainly and he was still sawing the air with his profile when sargon spoke again i have need of your help said sargon the great task is beginning mr godley went through the preliminary convulsions of explaining that he had the better part of an hour to spare and that he was willing to give help in any reasonable matter provided it was first explained to him clearly just exactly what the matter was but he could only give help for a limited time his engagement with his class at the birkbeck was imperative sargon paid little heed to the significance of the various sounds that mr godley was biting off and swallowing he led his captive by the arm and explained with helpful gestures of his free hand the full significance of this call you are i perceive a young man of scientific qualifications they will be needed i do not know if you recognize me your memory may still be imperfect but i recall your face chief among the wise men of our ancient court yes indeed chief among our wise men n no no not as as assure that i follow you aw ow ow quite said the young man my my my aw ow ow work issferrll aw ow ow known as yet i know it said sargon boldly i know it i have been seeking you do not be deceived by my plain incognito believe me i have tremendous powers behind me in a little while all men will understand the age of confusion draws near its end a new age begins we are the first two particles the very first in a great crystallization where aaare we g g g oing agg aggs aggs exactly asked the young man trust me said sargon bravely keep with me the young man struggled with some complex question but now three fresh individuals came under the magic attraction of the call and the young mans question fell in unheeded chunks these new adherents were a little group of men standing at the kerb about a small almost inaudible hurdy gurdy on which was a placard stating we want work not charity but there is no work for us in this so called civilized state they were clad in faded khaki and were all youths of less than five and twenty now look at that said sargon is it not time the new age began he addressed himself to the man on the right of the organ grinder all this is to be altered here and now he said i have work for you to do oh said the ex soldier in the accent of a fairly well educated man what sort of work were straight said the organ grinder well take it if its work we can do we aint fakers wot work is it shillin an hour said the third more than that much more than that and very great and responsible work a harvest a splendid harvest you shall be leaders of men follow after me far asked the man who had spoken first sargon made a gesture that effectually concealed his own lack of a definite plan and led the way lead on macbeth said the organ grinder and swung his hurdy gurdy into its carrying position on his back the two other ex soldiers exchanged views that it was all right and that anyhow theyd see what was offered them mr godley keeping abreast of his leader began an immense and ultimately futile struggle with a fresh question the next disciple was not so much called as fell into the gathering body of sargonites he was a tall gentleman of a rich brown colour with frizzy black hair and a vast disarming smile he was dressed in an almost luminous grey frock suit a pink tie buttoned shoes with bright yellow uppers and a hat as distinguished as sargons own he carried a grey alpaca umbrella he held out a sheet of paper in a big mahogany hand and emitted in a rich abundant voice the word escuse the paper had printed on it at the head the words lean and mackay leadenhall street ec and below written in ink mr kama mobamba sargon regarded his interlocutor for a moment and then recognized him the elamite king he said non spik english said the black gentleman portugaish no said sargon with a gesture that explained his intention providence follow after me the coloured gentleman fell in trustfully look here protested one of the ex soldiers there aint going to be coloured labor on this job peace said sargon very soon everything will be shown to you i dont think you have any ub ub business to mislead ap ap people said mr godley who was becoming more and more interested in and perplexed by sargons proceedings sargon quickened his pace this this gentleman s s s simply wa wa wanted tu tu tu tu to go to that address said mr godley in his eagerness to get the idea home to sargon he became a little disregardful of his microscope box which inflicted a sudden sharp blow on the knee of a passing gentleman a business man in a silk hat the victim cursed aloud with extraordinary vehemence and stood hopping on the pavement with his hand to his knee then he succumbed to a passionate impulse to tell mr godley exactly what he thought of his conduct his upbringing and his type of human being he joined the followers of sargon at a brisk limp occasionally saying hi in a breathless voice a rather intoxicated man in deep mourning had witnessed the incident he came hurrying with a certain margin of error to the side of the angry gentleman in the silk hat sgraceful salt he said sgraceful fwant a witness im your man his general intention was to go forward at the side of the gentleman in the silk hat but there were chemically emancipated factors in his being that drove him sideways the resultant was a sinuous course that presently involved him with a display of oranges in a barrow at the pavement edge it was not a serious nor a prolonged contact but it involved a certain scattering of oranges in the gutter and added a new ingredient a very angry costermongers assistant with a remonstrance and a claim for damages to the gathering body of sargons followers the moral of a proverb depends entirely upon the image chosen and though a rolling stone gathers no moss a rolling snowball grows by what it rolls upon a small hurrying group of people in a london street is a moving body of the snowball type its physical pull is considerable it appeals to curiosity and the increasing gregariousness of mankind sargon blue eyed and exalted with mr godley intent and eloquent upon his left hand and mr kama mobamba tall silent smiling with a shining confidence upon his ebony face that soon he would be led into the presence of messrs lean and mackay formed the spearhead of the procession behind came the three out of work ex soldiers who were now involved in obscure protests and explanations with the gentleman in the silk hat and a smart but rather incomprehensible young newspaper reporter who had acquired his native tongue in oldham and had just come up to london to push his fortunes and was anxious for something called a scoop he seemed to think that sargon might be the scoop he sought two ambiguous looking individuals in caps and neck wraps had also fallen in possibly for nefarious purposes a vague faced young woman of the streets in a weather worn magenta hat was asking what was up and the intoxicated man in mourning was explaining as wittily and obscurely as possible there was also a fringe of skirmishing juveniles and an eton boy he was very very young and fresh faced a scion of one of the oldest and best families in england and a convinced and fierce communist he had been on his way with a bosom friend to the celebrated model engine shop in holborn when sargon had swept past him and the inscription on the organ had caught his eye he was a boy of swift initiatives and with a highly developed dramatic sense sorry old fellow he said to his friend but i feel the time has come unless im very much mistaken that little bunch is the beginning of the social revolution and i must do my duty oo i say rabbit said the friend come and buy that steam launch first anyhow whats a model steam launch said rabbit scornfully and turned to follow sargon he would have liked to have had a swift strong hand clasp first but you cant do that sort of thing with a chap who will always keep both hands in his trouser pockets he darted off and his friend followed discreetly in a state between amusement and dismay and at such a distance as seemed to him to exonerate him from any personal complicity with the social revolution where are we going asked the young etonian as he came up with the hindmost of the out of work ex soldiers he knows said the out of work ex soldier indicating sargon but that was exactly what our dear sargon did not know by this time he was no longer a convinced and complete sargon a scared and doubting and protesting preemby was struggling back into his being up to the beginning of the calling of the disciples sargon had ruled in his own soul assured and unchallenged but he had expected his disciples to respond to his call to recognize and remember to be immediately understanding and helpful the calling was to have been like the lighting of a lamp in their minds and the world about them he had expected not only his own clear and unquestioning conviction but accession and reinforcement for it and so leaping from soul to soul the restoration of humanity the empire of sargon would have spread for disciples who made conditions for disciples who followed gesticulating strangely and spluttering and bubbling and stammering injurious criticisms for disciples who asked for a minimum wage and for disciples who came limping after one calling hi as though one was a cab sargon was totally unprepared had he called these disciples rashly had he been premature again had he made another mistake these were unpleasantly urgent questions for a master to solve while he was going briskly to nowhere in particular about four miles an hour along holborn with his following gathering at his heels perhaps all leadership is a kind of flight in every leader of men perhaps the fugitive has been latent in sargon now it was more than latent it was awake and stirring and its name was preemby since first mankind in its slow ascent from mere animalism became susceptible to prophets and great teachers and leaders there must always have been something of this internal conflict between the greatness of the mission and something discreetly less and there must also have been always something of this clash of the disciples quality and motive with the teachers expectations the very calling of disciples seems to admit a sense of weakness on the prophets part their calling puts him in pledge he puts himself in pledge to them they will he knows hold him to it when he falters deep gregarious instincts assure him he will not desert his declaration to them even when he might desert himself they desert him inevitably in the whole record of the world there is only one unvarying faithful disciple abu bekr all other disciples failed and crippled their masters and misled them they deserted or they drove the prophet whither he would not go great things and little things of the same kind follow the same laws at the head of that small wedge of commotion driving along lamp lit holborn in the october twilight went sargon the lord and protector of mankind the restorer of faith and justice the magnificent one and though he was already aware of an error made and dangers incurred he was still resolved to pull a great occasion by some stupendous gesture out of the jaws of disaster and closer than his shadow was preemby scared nearly out of his wits ready for a desperate headlong bolt down any side turning a bolt from explanation a bolt from effort a bolt back to preembyism and infinite nothingness suddenly there came to sargon a reassuring voice the voice of one who had at least seemed to believe and accept there had been a slight altercation with billy before bobby came hurrying across the road there he goes said bobby that isnt him said billy wheres his moustache he was pretty nearly all moustache shaved said bobby id swear to him anywhere a sort of prance in his walk its our prophet billy and hes heading for trouble looks more like a welsher said billy whered he get that ecstatic nigger its too rummy for me altogether bobby you keep out of it theres a policeman tacking on now bobby hesitated cant let him go like that he said and dodged across the road just as four racing omnibuses blotted out the sargonites from billys eyes forgive me but where are you going said bobby stooping to sargons grateful ear in spite of a considerable push from mr godley i have declared myself said sargon and straightway reassurance came this was the first of the disciples and he had found his way to his master quite clearly now did sargon see what he had to do these first followers had to be instructed the teaching had to begin to do that it was necessary to lead them apart out of the hurry and tumult of the street a vision came to sargon of a long brightly lit table and an array of disciples asking questions and of memorable answers and great sayings and straight ahead glowing bursting with light already a friend there towered up the inviting mass of the rubicon restaurant pioneer in the great enterprise of supplying dinners de luxe at popular prices yonder said sargon with a sweeping gesture of the hand we will rest and sit at meat and i will talk and all things shall be explained the bright vision of a discourse to a gathering of disciples at a table had so restored the gloriousness of sargon that by the time he reached the entrance of the rubicon restaurant which bulges invitingly at a corner he had called two further disciples one of these acquisitions was a matchbox holding beggar of venerable appearance and the other a highly intelligent looking man of perhaps fifty lean and thinly bearded carrying a book on the doukhobors and wearing mittens and a tall black felt hat a hat of an unusual shape rather like the steam dome of a railway engine this last acquisition was made at the very door of the restaurant come in here said sargon seizing his arm and take meat with me i have things to tell you that will change your whole life this is very suddan said the intelligent looking man speaking in the high neighing protesting accent of an english scholar and gentleman as he yielded himself to sargons grip the actual invasion of the rubicon restaurant was a confused and swift affair sargons mind was clear and simple now he had to make that vision of a long white table with his disciples grouped about him a reality or incur a great defeat his following was animated by a mixture of unequal and incompatible motives as all followings are and it was now swollen to something near thirty the exact number is uncertain because it passed marginally into mere onlookers and passers by by the action of the least worthy of the three out of work ex soldiers who had been uttering these magic words a free feed ever since the rubicon restaurant had been in sight the attention of that challenging individual the outside porter had happened to be distracted by the arrival of guests in a motor car when the sargonites came along they therefore swept through the outer entrance without encountering any obstacle other than the rotating door which chopped the little crowd into ones and twos before it reached the entrance hall perhaps twenty got into the entrance hall that space of marble and mahogany and hovering cloak room attendants before the mechanical incompetence of the man in deep mourning and his subsequent extraction by the politely indignant outer porter the costermongers assistant intervening unhelpfully jammed the apparatus the man with the bruised shin seems to have fallen out before the restaurant was reached and the vague faced young woman in the magenta had drifted away at some unnoted moment in the spacious glittering and observant outer hall a tendency to dispersal manifested itself the out of work ex soldier with the organ seized by a sudden shyness made for the gentlemans cloak room to deposit his instrument and became involved in an argument with his colleagues the two ambiguous young men in caps and neck wraps seem to have hesitated about the correctness of their costume but sargon held the newly caught gentleman tight and the venerable match seller did not mean to be separated from his patron in this bright luxurious dangerous place mr kama mobamba tall and smiling and shining handed hat and umbrella to an attendant and followed closely upon the master serene in his assurance that these were the lordly portals of the long sought firm of african traders lean and mackay and mr godley with his natural passion for explicitness would not leave sargon until he had made it perfectly clear to him why he did not feel bound to accompany him further he came next after the others into the large restaurant making noises like a cuckoo clock that has lost control of itself the reporter from oldham was also holding on though in considerable doubt now what sort of story he would have to write the eton boy more than half aware now of his error and so disposed to be a little detached also came into the restaurant after depositing hat and umbrella without bobby never came through he was overtaken and held up in the entrance hall by billy this isnt your affair bobby said billy this really isnt your affair i cant make out what hes up to said bobby hes bound to get into trouble never mind but i do mind the managements scared said billy theyre sending for the police theres a crowd gathered outside look at the faces looking in see that chap peering through the hole in the glass nice thing for tessy and susan if we get into some police court scrape but we cant leave him to get into a mess here but how can we help him within the restaurant sargon made his supreme and final effort and encountered swift and overwhelming defeat but at any rate he did not run away he made a frontal attack on the world he had set out to subdue as sargon as sargon invincibly sargon he met disaster things had not begun to be very brisk yet in the rubicon restaurant but indeed it is never so brisk in the rubicon of an evening as it is at lunch time it is too far from the west pre eminently a luncheon place and the hour even for such briskness as is customary had not yet come the neat lines of the little white tables each with its lamp and flowers were only broken here and there by occupants a family group going to a circus a little knot of people going to a meeting in the kingsway hall three or four couples of theatre goers in evening dress three or four of those odd couples of a rather inexperienced looking middle aged business man and an extremely inexperienced looking young woman in imperfectly conceived dinner dress who are to be seen everywhere in london and a group of three business men from the north dressed in a canny grey and dining with a resolute completeness from cocktail to liqueur was all the company yet assembled in the body of the restaurant there were one or two occupants in the lower gallery dimly seen the upper gallery was unlit the atmosphere was still timorous and chilly even the three men from the north exacted their tale of london luxury in a subdued and even furtive manner the staff was still largely unemployed the head waiters wine waiters and table waiters fidgeted serviettes and glasses or stood about with that expression of self astonishment and melancholy upon their faces habitual to waiters a slight hubbub in the entrance hall and the sound of the smashing of the glass in the rotating door by the last effort of the man in mourning preceded the entry of sargon every one looked up the guests forgot their food and their company manners the waiters forgot their secret sorrows sargon appeared an inconspicuous figure a little white almost luminous face round bright eyes with one hand he still gripped his last disciple with the other he waved aside the gobbets of speech which mr godley proffered him a tall expectant negro face rose like a shield of ebony and ivory above him behind were the match seller and other followers less clearly apprehended a head waiter faced him behind hovered a manager and a little further off an assistant manager fiddled with the fruit on the buffet sargon released his latest catch and stood forward set a table here he said with a fine gesture set a table here for a great company i have called a following and must needs discourse with them table sir said the head waiter for ow many sir a great company well sir said the head waiter with an appealing glance at the manager wed like to ave an idea ow many the manager came up to take control and the assistant manager deserted his piles of fruit and came up behind helpfully sargon perceived he was against opposition and gathered all the forces within him it is a great company he said it must sit at meat with me here and i must discourse to it these people yonder may join set all the tables one to another the day of separate tables and separate lives is at an end let even the tables manifest the brotherhood of man under our rule set them together at the words brotherhood of man one of the three business men from the north was smitten with understanding its a blood stained bolshevik he said or words to that effect shovin in here of all places oughtnt to be allowed said his friend arent we to have no peace from them the first business man expressed a general antipathy for incarmined bolsheviks and went on eating bread in a hurried fussed irritated manner whens that fricassee of chicken coming he said they must have dropped it or something but the managers intelligence had been even quicker than the business mans a swift signal had been given at the very beginning of sargons speech the waiter sent to summon the police had already sped past billy and bobby and the rest of the uncertain crowd in the entrance hall draughty now and uneasy because of the broken glass in the rotating door that the man in mourning had broken but sargon heeded nothing of this byplay he held on to the only course that he could see before him which was to overwhelm the opposition that gathered against him we dont have banquets in this room sir said the manager playing for time banquets you can have in the syrian hall or in the elysian chamber or in the great masonic or little masonic hall given due notice and after proper arrangements but this is the general public restaurant you cant suddenly give a banquet to an unknown company or society or something here we dont cater for that it isnt done it will be done to night said sargon with a glance and intonation and gesture that would have bent all dream sumeria to its knees but the managers of european restaurants are made of sterner stuff it seems than were the old sumerians im afraid not sir he said and stood blandly obstructive do you know cried sargon who it is with whom you have to deal not one of our regular customers sir said the manager with the apologetic air of one who scores a point perforce listen said sargon this day is an epoch this is the end and the beginning of an age men will count this banquet i shall hold here the sunrise moment of a new world i am sargon sargon the great sargon the restorer come to proclaim myself this multitude of my followers must be fed and instructed here fed bodily and fed spiritually see to it that your share is done he made a gesture behind him when he spoke of his followers but indeed there was no following behind him now save that one faithful but deluded african and that perplexed but persistent oldham reporter the eton boy had detached himself completely now he was sitting at a table afar off where he had been joined by his friend and they conversed in undertones and watched even mr godley with his microscope and the gentleman with the book about the doukhobors had faded out of this story by this time and were going along holborn exchanging and interrupting each others explanations and surmises about this singular affair that had so unexpectedly deflected their high and reasonable progress through life i can only sus sas sas suppose that the fellow was mad said mr godley while sargons retinue had melted the managers had gathered behind him now stood an array of waiters of every description three dozen perhaps of various and yet uniform waiters tall waiters and short ones fat and thin hairy and bald young and old waiters in aprons and one in shirt sleeves im afraid youre creating a disturbance here said the manager im afraid i must ask you to go sir should he go never oh generation of blind and deaf he cried lifting his voice in an attempt to reach the scattered diners beyond this lowering crowd of waiting men do you not recognize me have you neither memories nor vision do you not see the light that offers itself to you can you not hear the call that thrills throughout the world the hour for awakening has come it is to day it is now you may cease to be things of habit and servitude and you may become masters of a world reborn now this moment will the change with me and the change is upon you sargon calls you sargon the ancient and the eternal the wise ruler and the bold one calls you to light to nobility to freedom fraid we cant let you make speeches here said the manager with hand extended lets chuck im out now said a short thick set waiter chuck him out said the anti bolshevik business man standing up and speaking in a voice replete with indignation and gathering volume as he went on and then bring us our fricassee of chicken we have been waiting ten minutes for that fricassee of chicken and then a voice could be heard saying wots it all about and suddenly a policeman stood beside sargon and overshadowed him a wave of horror went through his soul a wave of horror that was entirely preemby throughout his whole virtuous life he had never once been in antagonism to the police oh lord oh lord cried this horror in his soul what have i done now im going to be run in the blue eyes grew rounder and he gasped for air but no one there perceived how close he came to ignominious collapse preemby shivered and passed sargon choked and then spoke stoutly what is this officer he said would you lay hands on the master of the world my duty sir if he makes a disturbance said the policeman master or no master very rapidly did sargon adjust himself to this new phase in his affairs he was defeated he was to be led away yes but he was still sargon the power that ruled him had thrust him into defeat but that could only be to try him he had not expected this of the power but since the power willed it so it had to be you understand officer what it is you are doing he said magnificently and gently quite sir i ope you dont intend to give us any trouble a captive not thus had he foreseen the revelation of the master he gave one last look at the rich decorations of the great restaurant in which the opening banquet was to have taken place not here then but in some squalid police court it was that the new empire of justice and brotherhood had to be proclaimed he turned in silence and went out at the policemans side quietly deep in thought so ended sargons first effort to enter into his empire unless we count the visit to buckingham palace as his first attempt but before we go on to tell of the unexpected and dreadful experience that now came upon him we must record one or two minor incidents of his capture one is the behaviour of mr kama mobamba he watched the closing incidents in the restaurant with a growing amazement upon his great bronze face had this little blue eyed man been after all leading him wrong when at last sargon was led away mr mobamba moved at first as though still half inclined to follow him then he stood still frowned reflectingly and fumbled at his ticket pocket with some effort he produced the sheet of paper that seemed to be his one intelligible link with london it was now in a rather crumpled condition smoothing it out with his great hands he advanced upon the manager with it extended whats this said the manager the black gentleman bowed with infinite suavity still tending his paper non spik english said the black gentleman portugaish lean a kay lemonallstree he was difficult to direct meanwhile in the entrance hall bobby tacitly denied all knowledge of sargon he was still hovering there with billy held by a curious half maternal solicitude the ex soldiers had mizzled to use the expressive word of the man with the organ at the appearance of policemen the man in mourning and his troubles had been cleared up but there were still quite a number of people hanging about in a state of vague anticipation and the young reporter was trying to find some one who understood the rare and obscure language of oldham in order to verify his facts and there were several policemen one evidently a superior officer a very good looking man in a peaked cap and a frogged coat here he comes said billy and sargon was led out there was a silence as he passed through the hall to the rotating door and upon sargon it seemed to bobby there rested a hitherto unnoted dignity he looked neither to the right nor the left and his eyes were exceedingly mournful but what will they do with him asked bobby you dont happen to know him sir asked the superior officer abruptly not a bit said billy taking the answer out of bobbys mouth never seen him before we just came in here to see what was up and by his silence bobby acquiesced ive got no power to move you on here said the police officer and smiled a suggestion of inopportuneness to billy and motioned to his satellites that the business there was at an end wed better go home said billy interpreting the smile the three friends sat round a fire in the white room with the purple curtains and bobby poured out his regret that he had denied sargon theyve taken him off tessy he said for the third time and i do not know what they will do with him discharge him with a caution said billy with a drawing board on his knee he hadnt committed very much of an offence that i can see and then said bobby and meditated on the fire i shall go round to the police court and try to pick him up again afterwards if they let him go he said presently better leave it all alone said billy but tessy sat in her arm chair between billy and the fire and looked at bobbys preoccupied profile rather sweetly out of the warm shadow and nobody in the world saw her theyll warn him and hell come back here of his own accord bobby said tessy comfortingly of course hell come back said billy very likely tessy said bobby but suppose they dont he got up and stood by the fire i suppose i ought to go upstairs and do some work i suppose you had said billy how is the novel getting on asked tessy not much done yet said bobby the prophet has disorganized the actual writing but ive learnt a lot of things that will tell some day and of course i have to do all my aunt suzannah stuff aunt suzannah gets more and more popular you cant imagine the things they ask me its all material in the long run still it takes time i suppose theyve locked him in a beastly little cell somewhere and hes wondering why they dont see that hes truly the great sargon come again to this world billy the worlds a dangerous place a dangerous unkind place why couldnt they let him rip a bit and his poor little map of the whole world upstairs he always called it the whole world and his little paper star machine and his poor little empty room and his poor little empty bed i protest said billy putting his drawing board aside bobby you are a case of morbid overgrowth of the sympathies you are a new disease you are the type case of bobbyism its bad enough that you should sympathize openly with that little devil susan when i have spanked her and so undo all my teaching its bad enough that you should do about a third of mrs richmans work because she needs light and air i can even understand something of your emotional relationships with various stray cats and pigeons but when it comes to your being sorry for a poor little empty lodging house bed i draw the line absolutely bobby i draw the line poor little empty bed its its morbid bobby but of course he was thinking of sargon said tessy youll go to the police court to morrow bobby ill go in spite of billy i dont care if it is a disease im worried about that little man im afraid hes too round eyed for this cruel world and next morning bobby went he went to lemon square court and sat through a frowsty morning and waited for sargon who never appeared he heard all the morning drunks and suchlike come up for judgment a case about stolen soda water syphons two matrimonial differences and all about the wilful smashing of a plate glass window with intent to rob but nothing about sargon the magistrate vanished and the court began to disperse he asked questions of a policeman who had never heard of sargon and the little trouble at the rubicon restaurant had he come to the right court the policeman asked bobby hurried headlong to minton street minton street too it seemed had never heard of sargon it did not occur to bobby to ask in either police station he retired baffled he tried to find something about sargon in the evening newspapers there was not a line about the rubicon or him perhaps he had not been charged he hurried back and rushed upstairs full of a vain surmise the room was desolate the window open the map of the world on the floor had sargon been spirited out of existence next day brought neither sargon nor news of sargon bobby lay awake of nights after three full days billy who had been watching his friend furtively remarked in a casual manner why dont you go and see the head panjandrum at the lemon square police station about it hed be sure to know if anyone does shown in to inspector mullins bobby found himself confronted by the same good looking officer he had seen in the entrance hall of the rubicon restaurant youre the young man who didnt happen to know anything about him three nights ago said inspector mullins not answering bobbys questions bobby explained the situation candidly doesnt help much now said the inspector still its all in order we took him in the exercise of our discretion to the workhouse infirmary for observation as to his mental state three clear days they keep them there then theyre either certified or let go or charged certified asked bobby as a lunatic said inspector mullins and what happened to him usual thing i suppose he was a pretty clear case by this time hes a certified lunatic i suppose and either at cummerdown hill or on his way there or if thats full somewhere else phew said bobby pretty quick he sat disconcerted can i go and see him at cummerdown hill he asked probably not said inspector mullins seeing youre not a relation im interested in him it isnt your business exactly but i like him and i dont think hes exactly mad seems odd of his people do you know anything about his people i might go and talk to them about him thats possible said the inspector i dont know who they are you might find out at the workhouse infirmary or they might tell you from cummerdown i dont know very likely they dont know who his relations are theres all sorts of such stragglers in the world possibly he hasnt any relations the sort of relations i mean who would want to bother about him my impression is that once a man or woman is certified and put away its rather hard for an outsider to get through but as you say you can but try sorry i cant tell you any more i never saw him myself at all except as he went past me not my affair yes our usual procedure in such a case oh no trouble good morning left sitting squarely an embodiment of implacable and indifferent law and rule chapter the third the journey of sargon underneath the world it has been said in an earlier chapter that mr preemby after his wifes death was like some seed which germinates and thrusts out bold and unexpected things a new phase in that belated germination began as he walked through the london streets beside his captor policeman if the thing had happened to mr preemby while he was still mr preemby it would have been merely a dreadful shameful horror it would have been an insupportable experience a thing to regret a thing to get through and conceal and if possible obliterate from record and memory if again it had happened in the early days of sargons dreams it would have been an occasion for an immense dramatic improvisation he would have thought of the effect upon the spectators and passers by he would have posed and gesticulated and said profound memorable words but some power of growth had taken possession of him now and he did none of these things he posed now neither to the world without nor to himself within for the first time in his life almost he was looking directly at himself and at what he had done and what had befallen him and so full of wonder was he at this ultimate discovery of reality that he forgot all the vast fabric of make believe imaginative response and deliberate self delusion up which he had clambered to this new phase of vision he walked so quietly through the lit streets that only the most observant noted he was in charge and that the policeman was on duty to the rest he might have been any casual companion of a home going policeman one determination had been released in this renascent mind with an extraordinary strength and clearness that he was not and never would again be that albert edward preemby who had launched him into existence he was a being called it mattered not what in reality but for his present purposes sargon sargon the magnificent king the first concrete visions of sumeria and his ancient glories had passed now into the background of his mind he had not lost his belief in them at all but they were now ancient history to him and even the revelation at the boarding house seemed very far away his ideas had travelled long distances and gathered much in the past week the expectation of an immediate sensational splendour had been rudely shattered the power that had called him had surprised him exceedingly but had not overwhelmed him he knew quite clearly that he had to be sargon who lived not for himself but for the whole world and that to relinquish or deny that was to perish utterly it had not seemed to be necessary to him that his own faith should be tried but manifestly the power had determined that it should be tried and manifestly he was to be put through some austere process of preparation before he entered into his empire he was to know what prison was and to stand a trial he would be asked to deny himself what should he say to them i am not he i am not him which was it i am not him you suppose i am he muttered it to himself whassay said the policeman nothing is it much further asked sargon it was just round the corner sargon found himself in a little austere room with half a dozen quite amiable but slightly disrespectful men in uniform he was asked his name and address by one who sat at a table sargon he said sargon the first no christian name pre christian said sargon no given name i mean said the questioner no and the address none at present just anywhere sargon did not answer case for gifford street said a voice behind him memory case or something said the man at the table anyhow its gifford street sargon reflected whats gifford street he asked ospital where theyll give you a bit of a rest and quiet but i want to meet a magistrate in open court i have a message i am in no need of rest or quiet theyll tell you all about that at gifford street buxton will you take im round but i am perfectly well why should i go to hospital routine i suppose said the seated policeman and gave his mind to other things queer why should it be a hospital the way the power was treating him was a strange way he had to submit to the power he had to maintain himself sargon still he could have wished for more explicitness he was so turned inward now that he went along beside constable buxton not noting the streets nor the traffic nor the passers by presently they were at a door in a high wall within which there were buildings then they were in a little office and a large grey faced porter looked at him and exchanged muttered explanations with the constable then they were going across a wide yard and through large doors into a corridor where there was an unoccupied stretcher and two or three nurses in uniform they came to a little glazed in office and sargon was asked to sit down on a bench against a wall while there was telephoning constable buxton hovered down the corridor as though the task was nearly done a small bright eyed man in a grey suit came and looked at sargon for some moments they regarded each other in silence well said the man in the grey suit my name is sargon i do not know why i have been brought here is this a hospital i understand it is i am not ill you may be ill without knowing it no we just want to have you here for a bit to have a look at you sargon shrugged his shoulders a very big man with exaggerated shoulders and a large clean shaven intensely self satisfied looking face appeared he had a wide thin lipped mouth protruding grey eyes and highly oiled and entirely subjugated sandy hair with an army quif on the forehead busy evening he said this is number three pretty full then said the small man in grey too full said mr jordan you dont know where you are this im he asked and indicated sargon by creasing his thick neck and depressing the corner of his mouth towards him this said the little man in grey to sargon is mr jordan hes going to show you just where you have to go and just what you have to do immediately instinctively sargon disliked mr jordan but he stood up obediently because his idea of submission to the power seemed in some way to overlap and include this new coercion mr jordan produced a voice of flat oily insincere amiability you come along old chap with me he said well make you comfortable all right fyou dont give no trouble they went round a corner and up a cheerless stone staircase that turned back on itself they came to a landing and double doors with glass panes in them that opened upon a very long dark passage lit by a single very remote light and suddenly it appeared to sargon that behind him and already distant lay that outer world of freedom the streets and the lights the coming and going of people and things the endless chance encounters the events and the spectacle of life to which the power had sent him and before him were dark and narrow and dreadful experiences why should he turn his back thus voluntarily on the great outer world he had come to save was this again only another mistake he was making he took a step or so away from jordan and faced him no he said i do not want to go further into this place i do not wish it let me return i have disciples to call and many things to do the full moon of jordans face displayed incredulous astonishment that passed into fierceness wot he said he left a tremendous pause after wot and then spoke very rapidly none of your tricks ere you thundering old bastard with a swift movement his huge raw red hand gripped sargon by the upper arm his thin lips were retracted to show his teeth his eyes seemed popping out he gripped not to hold but to pinch and compress and injure and he dug his fingers in between muscle and bone so that sargon stared at him with dilated eyes and uttered a sharp involuntary cry of pain the grip relaxed from the acutely painful to the merely uncomfortable and the big face came down close to sargons it was manifest that mr jordan had been regaling himself on cheese and cocoa dont you try it on you old fool dont you blooming well try it on whatever it is dont you try it on ere youre right enough to understand what i say see you do exactly wot youre told ere you do exactly wot youre told you do your best to avoid givin trouble and ill do my best ditto but if you start doin tricks gawd elp you see and he crushed the arm again understan the blue eyes seemed to assent down that passage blast you said mr jordan a distressed and wondering and yet not absolutely abject sargon was taken to a wet and untidy bathroom in which a broken chair pools of water great splashings on the wall and some crumpled towels in the corner suggested a recent struggle there he was made to undress and take a tepid bath dried with a towel that had already been in action put into a grey nightgown that was doubtfully clean a grey shoddy dressing gown that certainly wasnt and a pair of down at heel slippers two sizes too big and so garbed was led by mr jordan a little propitiated now by alert obedience into the ward in which he was to pass the night a rufous man with very light eyelashes appeared ere e is mr iggs said mr jordan ive got his bed ready said mr higgs ow many more of em perfec shower of em said mr jordan three said mr higgs well said mr jordan so long so long said mr higgs neither of them addressed the lord of the whole world directly he might have been a parcel passed from hand to hand when sargon entered the observation ward of the gifford street infirmary his sense of having left life ordinary current life far away behind him beyond these grey passages and corridors and staircases and glass offices and high walls and little doors was enormously reinforced never had he seen anything so emptily bleak and cheerless as this place a heartless great dingy room it was with green grey distempered walls discoloured in patches lit by a few bare lights that gave neither high lights nor shadows black night and a greasily lit brick wall stared in through uncurtained windows half way down the length of the place projecting pieces of wall suggested that two former rooms had been thrown into one the floor was of polished bare boards far off was a table set against the wall with two or three torn and crumpled magazines thereon and at the end an empty fire place in the near half on either side there were iron bedsteads in rows twenty or thirty perhaps altogether there was a foul smell in the air faint and yet indescribably offensive a fcal smell mixed with a heavy soapy odour even had it been unoccupied this cold large evil smelling room would have seemed a strange inhospitable place to sargon for it had always been the lot of mr preemby even in the days of his early poverty to live snug to have carpets even if they were shabby carpets under his feet and an encumbrance of furniture and silly human pictures and brackets and things about him on the walls here in this harsh plainness it was as though the fussy accumulative home making imagination of man had never been but the strange soulless atmosphere of the place was but the first instant impression of sargon it was followed by a far more vivid and terrible realization that this place was inhabited by beings who were only at the first glance men then as one looked again it became clear that they were not exactly men they did not look up at his entry as men should or they showed their awareness of him by queer unnatural movements several were in bed others were dressed in shabby and untidy clothes and either sat on their beds or were seated in chairs about the lower part of the room one individual only was in motion a grave faced young man who was walking with an appearance of concentrated method to and fro in a restricted circle in the far corner of the ward another sat and seemed to remove a perpetually recurrent cobweb from his face by a perpetually repeated gesture two men were jammed behind the table against the wall and one a fleshy lout with a shining pink skin and curling red hair on his bare chest was making violent gestures hammering the table with a freckled fist talking in a voice that rose and sank and occasionally broke into curses while the other a sallow complexioned cadaverous individual seemed to be sunken in profound despair in one of the beds close at hand a young man with a shock of black hair and an expression of fatuous satisfaction that changed with dramatic suddenness to triumphant fierceness or insinuating lucidity sat up and gesticulated and composed and recited an interminable poem something in the manner of browning it was running in this fashion god shall smite them and blight them they may prevail but god will requite them light em burn em to ashes and burn em to atoms atoms burning atoms exactly like stars see stars in the void and all over the place atoms galore and god cant show his face triumphant discovery he hasnt a face thats it thats it my boys atheists wrong and theology wrong plainly and simply heres every one wrong and i have to tell em theres a god item one but he hasnt a face so he cant show his face thats the kink of it naturally every one thinks hes non est but hes there as i know to my cost for im lost but ive shown how it is all the same no face what a game i found god in the void unmasked and a little annoyed quod erat demonstrandum xl theres your bed said mr higgs at sargons elbow shoving him slightly sargon moved a little unwillingly his puzzled eyes still on the talker youll hear enough of him before youre done old chap said mr higgs hop into bed now impelled partly by the arm of mr higgs and partly by his natural disposition to please sargon got into bed mr higgs assisted him in a rough brotherly fashion but before sargon could pull up the clothes about him mr higgs glancing over his shoulder became aware of something that was happening down the room sargon could not see what in an instant the genial authoritativeness of mr higgs gave way to rage yaaps you dirty old devil said mr higgs youre at it again he quitted sargon and ran down the room very swiftly sargon sat up in bed to see what was happening three or four of the other patients did the same a very dirty old man with a face of extreme misery who was sitting in a chair was seized upon and bumped up and down and hit several times with great vigour by mr higgs then mr higgs departed and returned still uttering admonitions with a pail and a rag for mr higgs was not only an attendant on the mentally afflicted but also on account of economy the floor scrubber and general cleaner of the ward he had been trained in the navy to ideals of a speckless brightness and he scrubbed better than he attended lie down there cried mr higgs returning up the ward with his pail it aint nothing to do with you the lord of the world lay down it was an extremely uninteresting ceiling to look at except for a streak of yellowish stains but it was better to look at the ceiling for a time than to look too much at these distressing people around him they were distressing and distracting and sargon knew that it was urgently necessary not to be distracted but to think over his position very carefully before anything further happened to him all this rush of consequences had been so unexpected preposterous and violent since a few hours ago he had surveyed london from the dome of saint pauls and decided that the moment had come to take hold of his lordship of the world that he perceived he might very conceivably be overwhelmed how serene and distant now was that spectacle of london spread out under the amber sunshine between its far blue hills and its shining river with its dense clusters of shipping and the black ant currents of folk below from that he had come swiftly inevitably to this echoing prison for prison he saw it was he knew quite well that these men around him were demented men and that he had been seized upon as a lunatic but he thought that the workhouse observation ward in which he was was a lunatic asylum already in his wildest imaginations he had never imagined the power over all things could treat him thus the possibility of a brief interlude in prison of a severe but very public and triumphant trial had entered his mind but not that he might be hustled away out of the possibility of any such appeal he had to think his position out anew to discover what all this monstrous experience was intended to show and to teach him and what he had to do to meet this strange occasion and it was very difficult to do this with a raucous voice down the room uttering foul threats about the ward attendant and a great fist beating the table in sudden storms and with that smooth fluctuating unending recitation nearer at hand that cosmic poem now almost inaudible so that one strained to catch the words and now in high pitched delight for long stretches it was just incoherent jumble and sargon would hold it almost completely out of his attention while he pursued his own perplexities and then it would rush together into something that challenged its way to mingle with his inmost thoughts filthy old nature she drives us amain one goad is lust and the other goad pain and so we get back to old nowhere again nowhere to start from and nowhere again want and be hurt want and be hurt out of the dirt you came back to the dirt hunger for dirt and dirty regretting dirty our feeding and dirty begetting smear yourself paint yourself wear a fine shirt put a brave face on it yah you are dirt now is that true asked sargon of himself is that true dirt what is dirt but no he must not wander off after this mad raving what was it he had been thinking about he had been asking why had the power thrust him into this dreadful place why had the power brought him to this place if only the man would stop that improvisation of his for a little while it might be possible to think that out why had he been given over to the commands of jordan and higgs to live among the madmen and sudden fantastic side question why had they if only that poem would cease if only that voice would fade to silence it was now mere rubble and rubbish as though thought had been broken up with a pickaxe and loaded in carts and shot down a slope dont listen to it sargon dont listen to it concentrate in his endeavour to concentrate sargon forgot even higgs he sat up in bed and drew his knees nearly to his chin and thought he was sargon that was the great issue he had to remain sargon he was probably in this place of trouble and torment because of the conflict between his being sargon and the possibility of his relapsing into preemby the power had called him to be sargon and to serve and suffer for and at last to rule the whole world but manifestly it was not a simple direct call there was something working in opposition to this destiny an anti power opposed to the power which was trying to put him back to preemby and preembyism to being little and insignificant to living obscurely and to no purpose and so at last to dying and becoming utterly and finally dead that anti power it was that had been permitted to bring him here to frighten and torment him to din mad rhymes into his ears to urge upon him in a monotonous persistent voice that he was dirt and that god was without a face and a multitude of suchlike blasphemies but they were not true the anti power might talk and talk would god there could be a respite from his talking but the truth was outside this place and greater than this place and altogether comprehended it he was one sargon was one from the beginning in sumeria in many lands and now here the same spirit the ruler who serves he was one just as london was one when it was seen from on high up above there endlessly multitudinous yet drawn together into a single personality and so was the whole world one to be preemby was to be like a wretched little back street house down below there swallowed up in the general effect never more could he be preemby even if he would that was what he had to keep hold of he could only be sargon by denying preemby even though he had to face the pains of death yet all the while the anti power was insulting life and himself through that disordered poet and his recitation the man had now fallen under the spell of a fascinating but detestable word if one may call such a thing a word tra la la tra la la tra la la that is the note of it get the full gloat of it tra la la tra la la all times and places happy derision for gods without faces tra la la sunshine or tra la la rain eat drink and kiss em and at it again tra la la tra la la kiss em and kiss em and at it again at it again tra la la he varied his recitation with a loud explosive noise made by his lips on the back of his hand pray dont think me cynical he said to sargon it is just pure joy de vive sargon could not stand it any longer this was damnable teaching to fling out before the very regenerator of mankind he suddenly thrust out a pointing finger you are wrong he said loudly and sharply the poet stared for a minute and with a gesture of salutation said tra la la la i tell you life is real cried sargon life is immense life is full of meaning and order i have come to tell you and all men so the poet interrupted smilingly and politely with tra la la tra la la life is a hiccup and life is a sneeze a smell from a dunghill borne on the breeze a thing of no moment so do as you please tra la la tra la la he was going on but sargon would not hear him he lifted his voice to drown his antagonist i tell you you poor soul you are utterly wrong and blind he said for the light has come to me and understanding is mine you are not the lost thing you deem you are or at least you need not be no i too was a lost thing such as you are a little while ago i too thought i was a grain a fragment a thing of no account but the call has come to me and i have been called to call others to take part with me in a new awakening i have had a vision and i have seen the world like one who awakens from a long sleep all things are joined together and work together and continue for ever the poet wrinkled up his nose and waved his hand at sargon as who should wave aside some object of offence tra la la he shouted all things i tell you are joined together and work together tra la la louder i tell you much louder shuddup there cried the loud and wrathful voice of sanity embodied in mr higgs youll have the whole ward jabbering in a minute said mr higgs approaching and addressing sargon in tones of earnest expostulation shud dup and after a brief pause of reflection the lord of the whole world obeyed with a gesture of extreme dignity he indicated to higgs that his crude demands were conceded thats o right said higgs you can hold in if you want to so you better he cant the poet went on in a soft insinuating undertone reviling and mocking sargons faith to a refrain of tra la la tra la la sargon sat up in bed motionless now except that his head turned slowly to look at the people about him and silent his recent outbreak had in some way assuaged the exasperation of that endless recitation it continued now crazily persuasive now strident and vehement now a mere babble of words it flowed past him and over him it was now manifestly directed at him but he was able to disregard it he sat up and looked at the people about him and contemplated the vast dreadful hours that plainly lay before him he did not look beyond the coming night that alone he foresaw as an eternity he knew that this harsh naked electric light which prized up his eyelids however tightly he closed them would be glaring all night he knew that because he had noted a glance that higgs had directed at the violent man with red hair instantly he knew that higgs was afraid of that red haired man with the shining pink skin and would never dare to have the ward in darkness never dare to have even shade in it whatever the custom or the regulations might be and also he understood why ever and again higgs went out of the room at the upper end he went out to assure himself of the presence of jordan or some such other helper within call yes this light would certainly keep on all night and the poet seemed as likely to keep on and there would be occasional outbreaks of table hammering and shouting from the red haired man and from another man who uttered a sudden flat shout ever and again and there would be misadventures of various sorts noises and comings and goings so he might just as well sit up and think as lie down and make hopeless attempts to slumber one could always think of course if one was too tired one would cease thinking onward one would just think round and round but it would be impossible not to go on waking and thinking there was no sleeping in this place eyes ears nose were all too much offended did anyone ever sleep here mad or sane there was nothing for him to do therefore but to sit up and think sit up and think doze perhaps and think into a dream until some unexpected jolt or jar brought him back to his thinking the longest night must end at last then suddenly sargon between sleeping and waking saw something horrible at least it struck upon his nerves as horrible two beds away from him there lay an extremely emaciated young man and his head was lifted up it was not supported by pillows it was six inches above the pillow it was held up in an attitude that it was painful to realize the young mans face expressed a serenely proud satisfaction at this fantastic rigidity it was incredible was there such a thing as an invisible pillow or was this a delusion of sargons eyes a waking dream in the bed beyond another man was lying down with his wakeful face towards sargon his eyes met sargons neither man said a word nor made a gesture but to each came infinite comfort for the eyes each encountered were as sane as his own and each gave support to the other it is so they said it is strange but your eyes are not deceiving you that is the form of that young mans affliction sargon nodded the other sane man nodded in reply and then turned over in his bed as a reassured child might do to sleep but could he sleep sargons gaze went round the ward with a new discovery yes several of these others might be sane sane as he was and caught like himself there was another man across the corridor with a little beard a very very mournful man but he also had sane eyes to morrow sargon must go and talk to these others and tell them about himself and discuss this dreadful situation but not now because higgs would certainly interfere many things had already conspired to annoy higgs it was plain he could be easily irritated and it would be well not to annoy him further for the present one must just sit and think what were the mad and what did madness mean why had he been lifted up by the supreme power out of the common acts and imaginations of his daily life to a knowledge of his immortal being why had he been shown his endless destinies and a vision of the whole world as his sphere merely to be cast out of life and light and freedom forthwith into this grey underworld of the demented it could not be that this was for nothing it must signify and then the wind of a second question blew across his mind the power that had called him and called him it would seem only to bring him into this place had also brought all these others to this same dreadfulness why for him it might be a trial but what was it for these others whose souls had indeed dissolved and gone what was the power doing with them the whole scheme of things in sargons mind began to shudder and dissolve if the power had not done this then it must be the anti power had done it there must be an anti power as strong almost as the power then able to snatch men out of life into confusion indignity and death for ever or else there was nothing he sat quite still with his chin on his knuckles and eyes staring blankly at the last black possibility was the whole of this call and this mission of his a deception and a delusion had he been cheated at tunbridge wells when the call first came to him to arise and awake were those memories of sumeria no more than dreams was he indeed just albert edward preemby gone crazy in a crazy pointless universe of commonplace inanities if so he was indeed the most foolish of living men he had left his comfort and securities sound though insignificant he had run away from his dear christina alberta to obey a power that was nothing more than his own imagination and to follow a phantom end for days he had been shutting christina alberta out of his thoughts she was a sceptic an ally of the anti power now she came back over valiant and rash but just a girl he had left her to shift for herself left her beyond reach of his reproofs and cautions what was she doing what evil and danger might not be overtaking her even now it had not occurred to him before that his disappearance might distress and endanger her now he saw plainly that it must have done so the enemy came and argued frankly with him you have been a fool albert edward preemby said the enemy you have got yourself into a position of great danger and discomfort you have deserted your own proper life for a horror of nothingness go back go back while there is still a chance of going back but could he go back yes that could be done so easily he could say plainly that now he remembered his proper name he could ask to see the doctor or the director or whoever it was presided over jordan and higgs and their colleagues he could give his name and the address of the studio and his bankers address and the address of the laundry and so forth speaking very plainly and quietly he could admit that he had behaved strangely but that the fit was over and so he would pass out of these grim shadows back into the world it would rejoice the heart of christina alberta he thought of that alert kind slightly antagonistic figure if only he could see it now coming down the long ward to him to rescue to release then he would be just preemby again for the rest of his days comfortably preemby preemby the bystander preemby the onlooker the ineffective speechless man in the background of the noisy studio but certain things would be at an end he would never go to any museums again or browse in the dark shadows of book shops over dusty forgotten books about vanished cities and enigmatical symbols he would think no more of the wonder and mystery of atlantis and of the measurements of the pyramids and of all the high riddles of the past and the future there would be no more wonder in his life at all for he had sought to enter into wonder and had found it delusion those things would be old tales and fancies of things that would never arrive past and future would be dead for him the days would be dull and empty as they had never been before the bladder of his life would be pricked and the other way lay pain indignity rough treatment vile food filthy circumstances trials that might break him but with the power still beckoning he thought of the things that belonged to sargon of the power of cities that were like great single persons of the whole world of the mystical promise of the stars of all these things he must renounce now and be preemby preemby plain and sensible to the end of his days if he would go out of this place he sat at it seemed to him for an immense time still and brooding though his answer was already definite in his mind and at last he spoke no he said in a hoarse voice that was almost a shout i am sargon sargon the servant of god and the whole world is mine long after midnight sargon was still sitting up in that bleak greasy glare amidst the noises and disorder about him he had lost all count of time his watch had been taken from him somewhen in the small hours he was praying and at times he wept a little he prayed sometimes he made sentences and whispered them to himself and sometimes the sentences never got to words but passed through his mind like serpents that are seen through deep dark water great is the task thou hast put upon me i see now i am not worthy o master to do the least thing that is required of me i am not worthy i am a petty man and a foolish man and all i have done so far is folly but thou hast called me knowing my folly forgive thou my folly and help thou my faith silent and still he sat with tears upon his cheeks any punishment and any trial he whispered at last only that thou shouldst not desert me and vanish out of my world he prayed that the power would yet make him the servant of the world and added falteringly and feebly even as it was in the ancient days for had there even been those ancient days sumeria was now very far away from him and the white towns and the blue river and the river galleys had faded and the worshipping crowds were just a faint smear upon his mind no stranger than the fading memory of a dream he said nothing for a time and then in a very loud whisper he said help thou my unbelief sometimes he prayed in a whisper and sometimes he prayed silently and sometimes he sat quite still higgs came and looked at him once or twice but did not interfere with him the poem in the adjacent bed still went on but it had now become a mere rhyming stream of blasphemous obscenities for a time after he had made an end to his praying sargon must have slept he must have slept because he was awakened by the dawn it did not come gradually he awoke to it a cold shadowless light filled the ward and the electric lamps that had seemed so bright were just luminous orange yellow threads and higgs was standing in the doorway peering intently at the red haired man who was lying with his head on the table as though he were asleep but perhaps only pretending to be asleep it was on the afternoon of the following day that two strangers came to see sargon he was taken to them and they talked a little with him and then chiefly with each other higgs was off duty but jordan hovered in the background neither of these gentlemen explained their business with sargon to him one of them was a short man in a black coat he wore a gold watch chain and a rich looking tie with a jewelled pin he had a gold pince nez a little pointed nose a fat clean shaven white face and a mouth like an oblique spade thrust in a lump of dough he spoke with something between a sniff and a lisp and he was evidently rather in a hurry and annoyed at having been called in to see sargon the other was large and grey and worn looking he impressed sargon in some indefinable way as being a medical man who had private troubles he seemed to consider himself in charge of the conversation and would occasionally refer upon some point of fact to the hovering jordan understand said the pasty faced man you wanted to give some sort of dinner party to all sorts of people eh at the rubicon i suppose it came on you sort of sudden like eh i wished to confer with certain people said sargon it may have been a mistake on my part no doubt it was a mistake mr mr wont ave a mister to it said jordan from the background calls isself sargon the doctor became very acute in his manner now isnt that some sort of historical name he asked with a sideways searching look it is said sargon but it isnt your name you know possibly not i mean it is my only name thats a bit of an answer that is said the pasty faced man my word what is your real name asked the doctor persuasively sargon not mr a e preemby sargon started and stared possibly with a certain wildness in his eyes with gods help no he said was it ever mr preemby asked the doctor that does not matter now that is of no importance now it may be of some importance said the pasty faced man and now youre a king or a lord or something and you own the world said the doctor sargon made no answer he felt he was in a net the doctor turned to jordan and beckoned him in a whisper only one sentence came to sargons ears iggs eard it said mr jordan arent you called sargon the magnificent asked the doctor sargon bent his head in sorrow better were it to call me sargon the unworthy for in many things i have failed the pasty faced man looked at the doctor havent we had about enough of this my conclusions are clear said the doctor in fact i have the certificate ready if youre satisfied dr manningtree i am if im to see those other fellers ive got all the papers in my room said the doctor right o said the pasty faced man its very good of you to come to day i wouldnt have bothered you until to morrow but we are really getting overcrowded here one chaps decidedly dangerous the attendants here dont like the look of him you need only just see him for a moment or any of them all clear cases for summary reception orders they spoke now as if sargon were not present or as if he were an inanimate object and indeed for them he had become so he had passed for them already out of the comity of mankind why have you been talking to me asked sargon suddenly with a vague fear of what had been said and done developing in his mind the doctors manner altered he spoke to sargon as one might speak to a small child youll be going back to bed now he said jordan but i want to know go with mr jordan what are these papers you speak about the doctor turned his back on sargon without an answer and the man with the pasty face opened the door to depart sargon made a step towards them but jordan laid hold of his arm and while sargon was being steered back to bed firmly rather than gently in the grip of jordan the justice and the doctor filled in and signed the forms that were necessary to deprive him of nearly every right he possessed as a human being for there is no trial by jury and no writ of habeas corpus in britain for the unfortunate charged with insanity he may not plead in public and there is no one to whom he may appeal he may write complaints but they will be neglected his most urgent expostulations will be disregarded in favour of any dull attendants asseverations he is handed over to the nearly autocratic control of under educated ill paid ill fed and overworked attendants every night and every day seems endless to him at first and then the nights and days fall into a sort of routine and become unimportant and pass away more and more rapidly he is almost always kept in a state of bodily discomfort always rather ill from the ill prepared and sometimes tainted food and much incommoded by clumsy drugging and particularly by the administration of violent purgatives in croton oil alone are our asylums truly generous he has excellent reason for fearing many of his fellow inmates and for a servile obedience to the attendants in charge of him a medical superintendent hovers in the background a medical staff with no special training in mental science they pass through the wards at the appointed times avoiding trouble seeing as little as possible and after all what can they do they cannot raise the expenditure upon food or increase the number or salaries of the attendants they are appointed to save and not to spend the ratepayers money the attendants work together and protect each other they must hang together many of them go in fear of the violent cases occasionally after due notice a visiting magistrate will pay a formal visit to the asylum everything is put in order for the occasion the inmate with a grievance dares not accost him or does not know how to accost him nor how to frame his complaint the attendants are at hand to interrupt embarrass and explain so with no possibility of redress the poor half lunatic will be roughly handled badly fed and coarsely clothed and night and day he will have no other familiar company than the insane it is bad enough for the sane to be afflicted by the vagaries the violence the exasperating mechanisms the incoherences of the truly demented but what must it be for those upon whom the penumbra of that same shadow has fallen they have no privacy no escape from those others no peace our world herds these discards together out of sight walls them up spends so little upon them that they are neither properly fed nor properly looked after and does its brave hopeful best to forget all about them and our sargon who even in the outer world of usage and freedom was sometimes a little at a loss must now go on into this dark underworld for two days more he will be kept in the gifford street observation ward awaiting the convenience of the authorities then in the company of four other prisoners he will be sent to a still bleaker and more desolate and hopeless confinement within the clustering buildings and walls and railings of cummerdown hill so he passes now for a time out of sight of everyday mankind and so also for a time he shall pass out of this story it would be insufferable to tell with any fulness his daily tale of discomfort and indignity book the third the resurrection of sargon king of kings chapter the first christina alberta in search of a father hitherto christina alberta had faced life with a bold disdainful and successful gesture the discretions and scruples of others were not for her she had seen no reason for their prudent hesitations their conventions and restraints now for the first time she knew dismay her daddy had vanished into a world that she suddenly realized could be immensely cruel teddy was rotten so plainly rotten that only a fool wrapped up in her own sensations would have touched him she lay awake for most of the night after her daddy had vanished biting her hands and damning teddy lambone the great friend was lazy incompetent and futile harold and fay seemed already a little tired of her misfortune and vaguely disposed to blame her for bringing her daddy to london she had no one else to whom she could turn no one remained to her except christina alberta herself feeling a little soiled now and more than a little afraid but what am i to do she asked the night again and again in her stuffy but artistic little bedroom among the other disadvantages of her position she had less than a pound of ready money it has to be recorded that for two whole days christina alberta did not even take the obvious step of going to the police she had a queer instinctive knowledge of the danger of bringing the police and the social system generally to bear upon her odd little daddy she had an innate distrust of official human beings it was paul lambone who induced her to go to the police he had the grace to be ashamed of his unhelpfulness and after an interval of two clear days he came round to the lonsdale mews to offer his generous but sluggish help once more he caught her having tea with fay christina alberta he said looking a very large comfortable figure of sorrow ive been worrying and worrying about you all the time i didnt help enough i thought hed come back of his own accord and that all the fuss was a little premature have you heard anything christina alberta was torn between the desire to snap his head off and the realization that he was after his fashion quite sincerely friendly to her and could be very useful say it said lambone youll be better my dear after youve said it and then we can talk matters over he got the reassurance of a smile he brightened visibly he was the sort of man who would hate to feel hated even by a cockroach i wont sit in that chair thanks he said to fay its too comfortable and at any moment we may think of something and i may have to leap up and act spartan he said sitting down eh said fay spartan my doctor tells me to say it before every meal and especially before tea i dont know why magic or cou or something are these things cocoanut cakes i thought so good they are and what are we going to do about it christina alberta he became sane and helpful and more and more like the man who wrote what to do on a hundred and one occasions he made christina alberta admit to bankruptcy and made it clear to her that it was her duty to accept a loan of twenty five pounds from him he then dealt with the point about reporting the disappearance to the police and convinced christina alberta upon that if mr preemby had fallen into bad hands the sooner the police looked for him the better but he did not think that likely he was much more inclined to the idea that preemby had made a disturbance and been taken up he guessed he would be dealt with as a mental case he had consulted those useful books the justice of the peace and the encyclopdia britannica and displayed the excellence of his mental digestion christina alberta perceived that he had in him the makings of a competent barrister he carried off christina alberta in a taxi to scotland yard either theyll tell us there or tell us where we shall be told he said fay was impressed by the originality of that now if it was a lost umbrella she said i could understand it but id never have thought of going to scotland yard for a lost father by six mr preemby had been traced to gifford street but there was no seeing him at gifford street he had been certified as a lunatic and he was bound the attendant thought but wasnt quite sure for cummerdown hill paul lambone tried to be dignified and important and to prevail over the attendant and extract further information but not very successfully in the end he and christina alberta departed with little more than one immense discouraging fact they would not be able to see mr preemby nor to learn anything very material about his condition until the next visiting day whenever that might be at cummerdown hill then if he was fit to be visited they might go and see him the attendant was rigid in his statements and had the air of disliking both lambone and christina alberta extremely as they came away from gifford street christina alberta observed that lambone was angry she had never seen him angry before it was a very transitory phase there was an unusual depth of pink in his cheeks dog in office he said just there to annoy people anxious people one would think man in my position certain standing some attention any other country but this man of letters has respect christina alberta agreed mutely manners in a public official primary he was detestable said christina alberta not at the end of my resources said lambone christina alberta waited ought to have gone to devizes in the first place knows more about mental cases and lunacy law than any other man in london wonderful fellow ill go back to my flat and ill ring him up and make an appointment then hell put us wise about the whole business and i want you to meet him anyhow youll appreciate devizes come to think of it youre remarkably like him how got the life force and all that and physically like him very the same nose much the same profile its a nose more suitable for a man said christina alberta i suppose he carries it off all right its a damned good nose christina alberta said lambone its a valiant nose dont you break down to any modesty about it it was your nose attracted me first to you youll spike a husband with it yet and hell adore it and follow it even as you do nowadays women have to be free and individualized they have got to have features and distinction the days of the wanton curl and the swan neck and complexion have gone not that you havent the clearest skin ive ever set eyes upon christina alberta tell me some more about dr devizes said christina alberta but it wasnt the next day that christina alberta met devizes she put that off for a day and fled down to woodford wells in response to a remarkable communication from mr sam widgery the widgerys had never been correspondents of the preembys except in so far as the payment of the dividends upon mr preembys interest in the limpid stream laundry necessitated letters there had been a certain amount of friction in the flotation of the company and mr widgery had remained resentful and sought to show as much by a studied curtness in his communications but now came this letter addressed to miss chrissie preemby my dear chrissie the letter began this is a shocking business about your poor father i cant tell you how shocked i am i went up post haste to the workhouse where you had put him as soon as they wrote to me and got his watch and cheque book it is fortunate they found my address in his pocket or i suppose i should have been kept in the dark as per usual about all this he did not know me and denied his own name but afterwards he said he knew me for a filching commercial wrogue and would have my ears cut off and threatened me i was to be unpailed whatever that may be i have been thinking over all this business and since you are not yet of age i suppose i am a sort of guardian to you and have to look into your interests at the laundry which is not paying nearly so well as your father led me to believe i think he was already queer at the time and didnt fully understand what he was doing and i doubt if all that of his about preference shares which i never held with really but did to humour him ought to stand luckily there is no hurry about this has you wont have to pay anything for him where he is mr punter says so long as you leave well alone and we can see about these other things when you have got over the first shock of your fathers breakdown my wife sends her love and kind sympathy you must keep calm and not let these things disturb you too much because very often it is hereriterary and one cannot be too careful so leave everything to me and believe me to remain your affectionate cousin sam widgery rather said christina alberta and telephoned forthwith to put off paul lambone and wilfred devizes and hurried off with a combatant light in her eye to the underground and liverpool street station when christina alberta got down to woodford wells it seemed to her that the laundry was just a little smaller than it used to be and that a slight tarnish had fallen upon the bright blue delivery vans the swastika upon them had been covered over by paper bills in red lettering saying under entirely new management address all communications to the managing director samuel widgery esq by order she went up the garden path to the door that had been home to her for nearly all her life and it was opened to her by sam widgery himself who had seen her coming so you came down he said and seemed to hesitate about admitting her he was a tallish stooping man with a large bare pock marked face a dropping nether lip a large nose that snored occasionally when he breathed and furtive very small brown eyes he was clad in dark grey ill fitting garments with a frayed collar and a very worn made up black satin tie his waistcoat was mainly unbuttoned and he fidgeted with his hands he looked at christina alberta as though he found her more formidable than he had thought her did you see daddy said christina alberta coming straight to the point he compressed his mouth and shook his head from side to side as though he recalled painful things was he bad was he queer or dreadful not too loud my dear he said in his husky whispering voice we dont want every one to hear about your trouble come in here where we can talk properly he led the way into the little living room in which her father had so recently planned the conditions for the conversion of the laundry into a limited company the familiar furniture had been rearranged rather amazingly and a large dark bureau had been placed under the window with discreet gestures sam widgery closed the door and came towards her sit down chrissie he said and dont get excited i was afraid you might come rushing down here but of course i was bound to write to you did you see him she repeated mad as a hatter he said they say he made a riot at the rubicon restaurant wanted to give a great banquet there to all the beggars in london did you see him was he well was he unhappy what have they done with him you mustnt pelt me with questions chrissie you mustnt let your mind go on at such a pace i told you in my letter i went up and saw him they called him out and he came to me in a little room where was it where was this workhouse there you go again just sit down and take things quietly my girl i cant answer all these questions at once where was it you saw him was it at gifford street yes where else could it be they was waiting to remove him where some asylum i suppose cummerdown hill come to think of it it was cummerdown hill yes they said cummerdown hill he came out he looked much as usual but more vacant perhaps until he set eyes on me and then he gave a sort of start and said dont know you he said like that well that wasnt mad did he look mad i suppose he didnt want to talk to you after all the disagreeable things that have been said very likely anyow i said to him what dont know me i said not know old sam widgery what you planted your laundry on just like that joking at him like quite kindly but humorous i dont know you he says and tried to go hold hard i said and took him by the arm youre a base complaining scoundrel he says to me and sort of tried to push me away youd rewin any laundry he says him to me what was in the laundry business a dozen years before he married your poor mother any ow i havent your complaint i says mr albert edward preemby he sort of stiffened sargum he says if you please sargon christina alberta corrected maybe it sounded like sargum and sargum he would have it mad as a hatter on that i tried to talk but what was the good of talking i couldnt get anything plain or straight out of him at all started threatening me with the bastinado whatever that may be i asked him to be decent with his language ive ad enough i says to the attendant at last and the attendant took him away and so were quit of him chrissie quit of him quit of him what can anyone do everything did he look very unhappy did he look frightened or ill treated why should he theyre taking proper care of him and hes out of harms way youre sure he looked serene bit jaded perhaps thats his own internal workings i expect but hes where he ought to be chrissie i feel that what weve got to do from what mr punter says is to let well alone there he is with everything he wants living on the ratepayers money weve got ourselves to consider weve got to think of that crazy preference share idea hes saddled the laundry with thats urgent its a charge of nearly five hundred a year as things are nearly ten pound a week there isnt a laundry in london could stand it i shall have to see my daddy said christina alberta i dont believe he is so comfortable ive heard horrid stories of asylums anyhow i ought to go right away and see him cant do that chrissie said mr widgery shaking his large grey face slowly from side to side and watching her as he spoke they dont have visitors running in and out of these mad houses just whenever they want to wouldnt do you know the poor creatures have to be kept quiet and not excited i daresay i could give you a letter for next visiting day you give me a letter mr widgery shrugged his shoulders it would help you to get in but you wont make anything of him chrissie even if you see him and youll have to wait for a visiting day you must do that i want to see him very likely but regulations are regulations meanwhile theres all this business muddle we got to put straight while hes in that asylum i think what i ought to do is to give you n allowance five pounds a week say and keep back the rest until were able to get something settled up or four or perhaps as you want it not a definite sum i dont know i havent thought it out yet you cant possibly want to do with all that ten pounds a week with him off your hands then well be able to see where we stand and everything will be all right again he paused and scratched his cheek and watched her with his little sidelong eyes see he said as if to stimulate her to speech christina alberta looked at him in a silence that became painful then she stood up and regarded him her arms akimbo and her face alight i see now she said you damned old rascal mr widgery had nice old fashioned ideas about young ladies and ladylike language he was taken aback now he said now always i should think said christina alberta you mustnt say things like that chrissie you mustnt use words like that you mustnt get wrong ideas about all this what dyou mean old rascal something old rascal why im only doing what i got to do you arent really of age yet youre just a mere child legally speaking and it falls to me naturally me his nearest relative so to speak to make such arrangements as have to be made about his affairs thats all you mustnt get wrong ideas about it all and you mustnt get excited see i called you said christina alberta a damned old rascal he did not meet her eye he spoke as if he appealed to the bureau and does it do you any good to use such horrible expressions and does it do me any harm and does it alter the fact that whether i like it or not ive got to look after his property now and see about it and see you dont get into any trouble or mischief all me and your aunt have been thinking about is just whats right and proper to be done for you and then you turn on me like a serpent and use language words failed mr widgery and still seeking sympathy from the bureau he shrugged his shoulders and threw out his hands youre no relation of his said christina alberta i guessed when i read your letter that this was the sort of thing youd be up to youre glad to have him out of the way because he was such a one for punctual payments you think im all alone you think im just a girl and that you can do what you like now with me youve made a mistake ill make you pay up every penny thats due on the laundry and ill see you do it more punctually than ever and why didnt you do something to get him out as soon as you heard theyd taken him now dont you go getting excited chrissie said mr widgery even if i aint a blood relation of his i am of yours im your next of kin and your best friend and i got to think whats got to be done about you i got to act for you in spite of bad language and everything i tell you hes right and safe where he is and im not going to have anything done to disturb him nothing at all there he is and there hes going to stay and im going to act as mr punter advised me to act im going to keep back his dividends as they fall due and pay you what i think proper to pay you for your keep and so on and charge it to him and im going to see you live an orderly sort of life in future now too same as my poor cousin christina would have wanted you to do youve been knocking about the world in a perfectly scandalous way and learning to curse and swear it cant go on thats how things are chrissie and the sooner you see them the right way round the better the young woman stood speechless while mr widgery unfolded his intentions wheres mrs widgery she said at last with an effect of stupendous self control up in the laundry seeing to things no need to bother her we been talking about all this over and over and were quite of one mind in the matter its our right to look after you and its our responsibility to look after you and we mean to do our duty by you chrissie whether you like it or not unpleasant doubts assailed christina alberta she was still two months short of one and twenty and it was quite conceivable that the law gave this ugly oily creature all sorts of preposterous powers of interference with her still it was her style to carry off things with a brave face all this is just nonsense she said im not going to have my daddy put away like this without a word from me and im not going to let you muddle about with his property everybody in the family knows youre a crooked muddler mother used to say so im going to see about him myself and im going to have him sent off to some special sort of mental nursing place where he can have proper attention and thats what i came to tell you mr widgerys little eyes seemed to weigh and judge her youre giving yourself high and mighty airs chrissie he said after a little pause youll do this and youll do that youve got a sort of wrong idea of what you can do in the world you havent got any money and you havent got any authority and the sooner you get that into your head the better that scared feeling was gaining upon christina alberta in order to counteract it she deliberately lost her temper ill jolly soon show you what i can do and what you cant she said with a flaming face now dont yew go getting excited said mr widgery you of all people shouldnt get excited excited said christina alberta rallying for a repartee and then struck by an ugly thought she stopped short and stared at the little bright brown eyes in the pock marked face mutely they answered her mute amazed question this was the third or fourth time he had used the word excited and now she knew what he was aiming at suddenly she realized the train of ideas that her daddys extinction had set going in his head he also had been studying the lunacy laws and dreaming dreams exactly said mr widgery youve always been a queerish sort of girl chrissie and the rackety life you lead and now this affair has been a strain on you must have been youve got no quiet friends but your aunt and me and no quiet place to come to but here dont you go flaring out at me chrissie i mean well by you im not going to go paying you money to keep you up there in london why you might go gettings drugs or anything call me a something rascal if you like swear at me as though you were out of your senses it wont alter what i mean to do i want you to come down here and rest your mind and nerves for a time and let me get in some one to see you see what ought to be done about you youll thank me for it some day his big grey face seemed to expand and swim about before her eyes and the room grew small and dark its my duty to see after you he said it cant hurt you or anyone for us to have advice in the train from liverpool street she had told herself she had intended to wipe the floor with mr sam widgery but things hardly seemed to be happening like that bah she cried dyou think id come back here better than being lost in london chrissie he said better than being lost in london we cant have you wandering off in london same as your father did she felt that the time had come for her to go but for a second or so she could not move to do so she could not move because she feared he might do something to detain her and if he did she did not know what she would do then she pulled herself up by the feet well she said with a step past him doorward that turned him on his heel ive told you what i think of you id better be getting back to london in his eyes she saw the thought of obstructing her flash into being and die wont you stay and have something he said before you go back eat here she cried and got to the door her hand trembled so that it was difficult to turn the handle he stood motionless staring at her with his lower lip dropping and an expression of doubt upon his face it was as if he was not quite sure of himself nor of the course he meant to pursue the course he wanted to pursue was appallingly plain she walked with dignity out of the open front door and down the garden path she did not look back but she knew his face came up close to the window and watched her never in her whole life had panic come so near to her she would have liked to run after the train had started she felt a little safer how the devil can he get at me she said aloud to the empty compartment but she wasnt at all sure that she couldnt be got at and she found herself trying to estimate just how much support and friendship she might find in her london friends could she for instance count upon mr paul lambone if supplies were cut off could she get some sort of job and keep herself for a time until she could extract her silly daddy from the net into which he had fallen how would harold and fay perennially hard up behave if supplies ran out and meanwhile there was daddy wondering why no help came to him puzzled by what had happened to him and no doubt getting sillier and sillier christina alberta was growing up fast now beneath all her radicalism and rebellion there had always hitherto been a belief tacit sub conscious in the rightness and security and sustaining energy of the social framework there is under most youthful rebellion she had assumed without thinking very much about it that hospitals were places of comfort and luxury doctors in full possession and use of all existing science prisons clean and exemplary places that though laws might still be unjust that the administration of the law was untouched by knavery or weakness she had had the same confidence in the ultimate integrity of social life that a little child has in the invincible safeness of nursery and home but now she was awakening to the fact that the whole world was insecure it was not that it was a wicked or malignant world but that it was an inattentive and casual world it dreaded bothers it would do the meanest most dangerous and cruellest things to escape the pressure of bothers and it would refuse to be bothered by any sufferings or evil it could possibly contrive to ignore it was a dangerous world a world of bothered people in which one might be lost and forgotten while one was still alive and suffering it was a world in which it is not good to be alone and she was beginning to feel herself very dangerously alone she had never she reflected thought very much of her family but now she perceived a family may dissolve away too soon she wanted a wall to put her back against if after all sam widgery screwed up his courage to be aggressive she wanted some one who would be her very own a safe ally some one she could count upon some one closer than law or custom some one who would go about and find out exactly what had happened to her if she fell into disaster who would refuse to accept her downfall some one who would care for her more than he cared for himself and not be lightly turned away himself not herself in fact a lover damn teddy cried christina alberta and knocked a puff of dust out of the railway cushion with her fist he messes it up and i knew what he was i knew all the time exactly what he was ive got to stick it alone said christina alberta and besides whod have cared for me anyhow with a nose like mine even if there were such things in the world as lovers who loved like that but its a world of people who dont care its a world of people who havent the guts to care its a dust heap of a world said christina alberta her thoughts began to flow into a new region after all wasnt there something too disagreeably justifiable in the suggestion that she was how to put it queer hitherto christina alberta had always regarded herself as a model of sanity and mental directness with no fault indeed except possibly her nose now the word queer stuck in her mind like a thorn that has gone right home she could not get it out again she had always she knew been different she had always had a style of her own most of the people she had met in the world had impressed her as being colourless weak in speech and action evasive that was the word evasive they evaded the use of all sorts of blunt words they didnt know why christina alberta was all for saying damn and guts and so forth until some one convinced her of some better reason for avoiding them than merely that they werent used by nice people these others were always not saying things because they werent said and not doing things because they werent done and for what was said and what was done however manifestly preposterous it was they had a sort of terrified imitativeness they just ran about being as far as possible somebody else until they died why exist at all then why not get out of it and leave some one else in possession but anyhow they got through life they didnt get into trouble they supported one another and on the other hand if you didnt evade you puzzled other people you left the track you were like a train leaving the rails and trying to take a cross country short cut you hit against everything was this evasive life she had always despised really the sane life was ceasing to evade ceasing to be sane sheep she had read had a disease called gid then they wandered alone and died was all this originality and thinking for oneself and not going with the crowd and so forth that had been her pride and glory just the way out from the sane life originality eccentricity queerness craziness madness was that merely a quantitative scale was not her daddys queerness this that after years of the extremest evasion he had at last tried to break away to something real and strange and had she after her fashion been attempting anything else was she too lop sided lop sided in a different direction perhaps but lop sided none the less an inherited lop sidedness her mind went off at a tangent on the question whether she had really inherited anything whatever from her daddy was his queerness her sort of queerness at all it ought to be seeing that they were father and daughter how different they were for a father and daughter how amazingly different they were but were they father and daughter a much repressed fantasy came back to her a fantasy based on the flimsiest foundations on chance phrases her mother had used on moments of intuition once or twice a reverie had arisen out of these lurking particles of memory and had taken her by surprise only to be thrust aside again with contempt blup blup blup there came a familiar variation to the familiar sounds of the train christina alberta was running into liverpool street station and her perplexities were all unsolved the old fantasy lost heart and faded away what was the good of such dreams there she was christina albertas meeting next day with wilfred devizes turned out to be a much more exciting affair than she or he had expected it to be acting on the advice of paul lambone she had brought photographs and a letter or so in her daddys handwriting with her and she had thought out what she judged would be significant things to tell about him she went in a taxi with paul lambone to devizes house just off cavendish square and they were shown up at once past a waiting room and a consulting room to a dignified little sitting room with an open fire and a table with tea things and a great array of bookcases devizes came in to them forthwith she was a little shocked to think that this lank dark shock headed man could be recognizably like her he was younger than she had expected him to be younger she thought than her daddy or mr lambone and he wore a long unbuttoned morning coat he carried the nose all right he was indeed very good looking hullo paul he said cheerfully is this the young lady whose fathers been stolen well have some tea its miss miss preemby said paul lambone but every one calls her christina alberta devizes turned an eye that was by habit and disposition a scrutinizing eye upon her he betrayed a faint momentary surprise and came and shook hands tell me all about it he said you dont think hes really mad but only rather exceptional and odd thats it isnt it lambone tells me he is sane its quite possible id better go over the state of his mind first and then we can discuss the question of the asylum afterwards i gather you want to get him under your own care outside that isnt by any means simple well have to study the obstacles meanwhile tea ive been disentangling the delusions of a perfectly terrible old lady and im rather deflated just tell me all about it in your own way tell him said paul settling his shoulders into his arm chair and preparing to interrupt christina alberta began to unfold her premeditated discourse every now and then devizes would interrupt her with a question he kept his eyes on her and it seemed to her even from the beginning that they betrayed something more than attention to what she was saying he looked at her as though he had seen her before and couldnt quite remember where she described her daddys talks to her when she was a girl about the pyramids and the lost atlantis and so forth and the odd spirit of release and renewed growth that had followed the death of her mother she told of the spiritualistic sance and the coming of sargon devizes was very keen on various aspects of the sargon story it was odd that the suggestion fell in so aptly with preembys mental disposition what was that young man up to i dont quite understand him i dont know i think he just hit by chance on the stuff he talked it was just bad luck that it fitted undergraduate idea of fun undergraduate fun it might have been tut an ka man but it happened to be sargon he may have been reading some ancient history he didnt i suppose know anything about your father couldnt have done i suppose he thought my my daddy looked a little small and absurd and i suppose it appealed to his sense of humour to single him out from the others and make him a great king id like to have a few minutes straight talk with that young man this you see isnt a delusion devizes its a deception said paul lambone is he generally coherent asked devizes granted his thesis hes amazingly coherent she said he doesnt sometimes become some one else god or a millionaire or anything of that sort no he believes in reincarnation and hints at having lived other lives but thats all thousands of people do that said lambone and nobody is persecuting him nobody makes noises to trouble him or gets at him with x rays or anything of that sort not a shadow of that sort of thing the mans sane unless he went mad when he walked out of your friends studio im for his sanity right out said lambone i wish id had a chance to talk to him theres something everybodys chattering now about an inferiority complex well isnt it common for people who have been rather put upon and deceived and so forth and who dont want to face the facts of life to take refuge in an assumed personality and putting the reveries the spiritualist sance and so forth all together doesnt it work out on those lines he knows he is really au fond preemby devizes asked it annoyed him to tell him so said christina alberta i think one reason why he went away was because i and my friend mrs crumb that is at the studio where we live would try to make him be sensible about that it drove him away he knows he is really preemby and he hates it he knows this is all a make believe paul lambone took up the discourse i do so sympathize with that so far from that being insane its perfectly rational becoming somebody else greater than oneself is part of half the religions of the world all the mithraists used to become mithra the serapists if i remember rightly used to become osiris we all want to be born again really every one with any sense and humility does into something greater who will deliver me from the body of this death thats why christina albertas daddy is so tremendously interesting hes got imagination hes got originality he may be a feeble little chap but he has that having an exceptional mind isnt insanity said devizes or else we should put all our poets and artists in asylums few would come up to that standard said lambone i wish they did devizes reflected i think ive got things clear hes coherent hes neat in his dress he isnt persecuted hes unselfish in his thoughts almost romantically so and hes not fattish and lumpish and hes never had any sort of fit theres no insane type a properly qualified doctor could class him under but then most doctors are altogether unqualified for mental practice a stupid doctor might mistake his imaginations for the splendour of paranoia or take his abstraction in reverie for dementia prcox or think he was a masked epileptic but all these are cases of mental disease and your father is probably not diseased at all hes mentally disturbed but thats all the difference between him and a real lunatic is the difference between a basketful of fruit thats been overturned and a basketful thats gone rotten overturned fruit gets bruised and rots very easily but being overturned isnt being rotten what sort of man is he to look at shes got photographs said lambone id like to see them he said and was given a recent one of mr preemby as laundryman too much moustache by a long way he said is there anything with some at least of his face uncovered theres nothing here but his eyes i thought youd feel that said lambone theres one of mr preemby as a young man taken soon after his wedding with mrs preemby have you got it christina alberta here we are thats mrs preemby in the chair the moustache in bulk has yet to come he married young devizes asked christina alberta he must have done she said i dont know his exact age my mother never told me devizes scrutinized the photograph queer he said and seemed to be searching his memory something familiar ive met people like this they were both london people i suppose he said looking hard at christina alberta woodford wells said christina alberta my father was born at sheringham she added as an afterthought sheringham thats queer with a manifestly deepened interest he looked at the couple posed against one of those rustic backgrounds dear to victorian photographers chrissy he repeated to himself chrissy christina alberta it cant be for some moments dr devizes ceased to attend to his consultants and they remained intently observing him he tried to fix his attention on the young mans face in the picture but it was the young woman who sat on the rustic style that absorbed his interest amazing how completely he had forgotten her face and how she came back now incredibly unlike and yet like his memory of her he remembered the glasses and the neck and shoulders and a sort of stiff defiance when were your mother and father married he asked how long ago eighteen ninety nine she answered and then you were born straight away he asked the question with an affectation of ease there was a decent interval said christina alberta with a clumsy levity i was born in nineteen hundred a little fair blue eyed chap with rather an absent minded manner i seem to see him devizes said and resumed his examination of the photograph nobody spoke for the better part of a minute good lord whispered lambone to himself devizes drank a cup of tea absent mindedly extraordinary he ejaculated i never dreamt of it what is his answer went off at a tangent christina albertas resemblance to my mother its amazing its been worrying me ever since i came into the room its been distracting my attention ive got a little picture he jumped up and went out of the room christina alberta puzzled excited turned instantly on lambone he knew my father and mother she said apparently said lambone with something defensive in his voice apparently she echoed but he knew them he knew them well and whats he thinking of devizes reappeared holding out a small gold framed picture look at that he said and handed it to paul lambone it might be christina alberta dont you see how like it is allowing for that preposterous hair piled upon her head and the way her dress goes up round her neck he handed the picture to christina alberta and looked at lambone in amazed interrogation it might be me in fancy dress christina alberta agreed with the picture in her hands there came a long pause she looked up and saw the expression of his face her mind gave a fantastic leap so fantastic that it instantly leapt back to the point of departure it was like a flash of lightning in a night as dark as pitch she made a great effort to pull the conversation together to behave as though her mind had never leapt at all but what has all this to do with my daddys case she asked nothing directly your resemblance to my mother is a pure coincidence pure but its a curious coincidence just for the moment it pulled my attention aside forgive me ive a belief that where theres resemblance of this sort theres a blood relationship i suppose your mothers people what did you say they were called hoskin did i say i dont remember i didnt say i didnt her name was hossett ah yes hossett i suppose that two or three generations back the hossetts and devizes intermarried and there we are cousins at we dont know what remove but types go under in a family and then bob up again it sort of links us christina alberta doesnt it it gives me a special interest i dont feel now that youre just any old patient or rather just pauls friend i feel linked well thats that lets come back to your father who married your mother just when they were starting the old south african war hes always been a dreamy unobservant type as we were saying even from the beginning he stopped short always said christina alberta after a long pause weve been into all that said devizes and paused and was for a minute entirely at a loss for words yes he said at last her heart was beating fast and there was a flush of excitement on her cheeks her quick wits had filled in all the gaps she understood now and then again it vanished she would have liked to have gone away and thought it all over at once but that wouldnt do she must disregard the questions that surged up within her her mind went forward like an obstinate traveller caught in a whirlwind her mother for example she was trying to recall something about her mother that had long been stifled in her mind went away and left me to it was it went off and left me to it her mother lying in bed and wandering who had left her to what that standing perplexity that suspicion that dream but attend to him now christina alberta attend to him she was observing him with all her being and yet she seemed deaf to what he said he was saying that now that he agreed with them that preemby was sane he could see his way to the real business before them it was the old old story of making lunatics out of sane people which they encountered in preembys case it was the old old story of making lunatics out of sane people which they encountered in preembys case he repeated his sentence word for word without apparently realizing he had said it twice all exceptional people were in danger of being misunderstood but such a type as preemby original and yet incapable of abstract expression or philosophical method which sought fantastic expression for its feelings and impulses was particularly liable to give offence awaken suspicion and dread and hostility it was just these borderland cases he was always trying to save from asylums and just such cases that were always going there and they were the last people to bring into contact with real insanity to go back to my metaphor the basketful of fruit isnt rotten is scarcely speckled with decay but it is disordered and overturned a mind is a delicate thing to knock about it will rot very easily and a mind like your fathers particularly will rot very easily under asylum conditions after all this rigmarole i come to just the conclusion youve already reached that we have to get preemby out of cummerdown hill and away under restful conditions as soon as possible when well comb out his particular complex and get him into working relations with the world again im quite sure we can do that somehow make his incognito permanent make him an emperor in exile restore his proper name organize a common daily round for him and get him back more and more to be a chastened and released preemby he paused thats it said lambone roused from a profound contemplation of the two interesting faces before him it isnt easy even to get at him isnt easy there will be delays a careless magistrate and a silly doctor can make a lunatic in five minutes it takes no end of time to unmake one thats what i want to set about doing said christina alberta naturally said devizes and im with you he explained one or two points in lunacy law began sketching a scheme of operations considered the people to whom she ought to write and the people to whom he ought to write and how soon it would be possible to see preemby and give him a word of encouragement already devizes had had several brushes with lunacy organization he was considered a troublesome but dangerous man for a medical superintendent to be up against that might arouse either hostile obstruction or the propitiatory spirit they must go carefully lambone scarcely interrupted now at all he had ceased to be acutely interested in preemby immured away there in cummerdown he was lost in admiration of the self control his astonishing friends displayed he tried to imagine what an undertow of strange excitement of queer thoughts and confused emotions there must be beneath their highly intelligent discussion of the case of mr preemby they wasted very little attention upon the onlooker christina albertas face was faintly flushed and her eyes glowed devizes was rather less of a conversationalist than usual and rather more like a university tutor with an exceptionally interesting student the subject was exhausted at last and the time came to depart devizes came to the door with them dont forget that im always round the corner so to speak he said im in the telephone directory and dont forget christina alberta dont forget im your long lost cousin very much at your service i wont forget that said christina alberta meeting his eye a little pause and then rather stiffly they shook hands am i mad said christina alberta as soon as she and paul lambone were in the street together am i dreaming lambone was clumsy mad dreaming how oh dont pretend not to understand that hes my real father dont pretend or please dont pretend is he or is he not lambone did not reply for a moment you flash at things like a lizard how could it have happened then you did think my dear christina alberta he didnt know you existed until he set eyes on you im sure of that but then wasnt it plain he knew them both devizes said lambone is ten years younger than i am hes barely forty he must have been not more than eighteen nineteen at most its a little difficult that makes it easier you never knew mother if they were both young its just possible said lambone there is some other explanation but what cant imagine i suppose he was at sheringham perhaps for a holiday and met her but it must have been something casual a kind of accident mother used to have flashes i never quite understood her she used to suppress me and perhaps she was suppressing herself and at the end she said something someone had left her to it do you know at times ive had fancies suspicions it seemed as though she guessed that i was guessing now i know i was its incredible and yet it explains a hundred things he certainly never knew of you hes amazed and whats going to happen next legally youre preembys daughter nothing can alter that all the resemblances and coincidences in the world wont alter that and all the law in the world wont alter the facts and she turned on lambone with a flushed face do you realize what it means to think you are the daughter of a certified lunatic and then find you are not all last night i was awake with that unendurable thought all night at your age it seemed all night last night i tried to imagine that something of this sort had happened tried and couldnt tried to bring back all those old fancies and here it is i might have known i did know and wouldnt know tell me about this real father of mine i dont know a thing about him is he a good man is he a bad man has he a wife he adored his wife and so did i she was one of the loveliest and cleverest young women ive ever known she was strong and jolly and the beastly influenza and pneumonia got her in a week it cut him to ribbons theyd had no children theyd had only four years together hes attractive to women but i dont think therell be a second mrs devizes for a long time i cant imagine it any other woman why all that house its full of her presence yes said christina alberta and thought for a time they were detached for a time in crossing bond street and the pavement was too crowded and piccadilly was too congested for them to talk again until they went in st james street daddy said christina alberta seems ten thousand miles away but when im over the amazement of this i expect ill get back to him all right but just for a time he must wait youll come in for a bit said lambone at the corner of half moon street i could give you some dinner no thanks ill walk all the way to chelsea said christina alberta i want to think this out by myself i want to get alone with this spinning head of mine and try to slow it down my lifes gone topsy turvy or its been topsy turvy and its suddenly come right side up i dont know which oh i dont know anything ive got to begin all over again she shook hands and paused lambone waited for manifestly she had something to say she got it out at last do you think he liked me he liked you all right christina alberta dont you worry about that it was a little more than two days before christina alberta to use her own expression got back to her lost daddy those two days were full of an immense excitement devizes was the most wonderful fact in the world she exploded into love for him she had the most vivid impression of him dark and tall rather grave watchful and amazingly understandable yet vivid as her impression was she doubted every detail of it and wanted to go back to him and verify it all over again it was their quality of mutual understanding that was at once the most delightful and the most incredible aspect of the whole affair their brains no doubt were unlike as every two individual brains must be yet their unlikeness was not a mere accumulation of accidental difference but the unlikeness of two variations of one theme she could feel his intentions beneath his words her mind had jumped with his realizations and there must be kinks and turns in her brain kinks and turns that just made her difficult and queer for most people which would find the completest parallels in his she didnt believe there was a thing in her thoughts and acts that she would be surprised at his knowing and comprehending she had never before thought of parentage with any enthusiasm she had viewed it rather in the spirit of samuel butler and bernard shaw and conceived of parents generally in relation to their children as embarrassed hypocrites with an instinctive disposition towards restraint and suppression she had made an exception of her own particular pair daddy had been a great friend anyhow though mother for the most part had been a concentrated incarnate dont but she had never realized there might be something rather intimately interesting in consanguinity and then suddenly a door had opened a man had come in and sat down and talked to her and discovered himself the nearest thing in life to her and she to him she wanted to go to him again she wanted to see more of him be with him but he made no sign and she could think of no decent excuse for a call upon him the very intensity of her desire made her unable to go to him easily she wrote the various letters they had agreed she should write and then decided to master mental science and lunacy generally that and the case of her daddy she perceived to be her formal link with devizes she set out for the reading room of the british museum for which she had a students ticket and she tried to concentrate her mind upon the book she had requisitioned instead of letting it wander off into the strangest reveries about this miraculously discovered blood relation in the afternoon she rang up lambone to be given tea with the intention of learning everything that the wise man could tell her about devizes and generally turning him over conversationally but lambone was out the next day the craving for devizes was overpowering she rang him up may i have some tea she asked ive got nothing much to say but i want to see you delighted said devizes when she got to him she found herself shy and him as shy as herself for a little while they made polite conversation it might almost have been the conversation of two people at a formal call in a country town he called her christina alberta but she called him doctor devizes and he asked her if she played or danced and whether she had ever been abroad she sat in an arm chair and he stood over her on the hearthrug it was clear that the only way to intimacy lay in a frank treatment of her daddy she felt that if this sort of talk went on for another minute she would have to scream or throw her tea cup in the fire so she plunged when did you first know my mother devizes attitude stiffened and he smiled faintly at her boldness i was a cambridge undergraduate reading for the natural science tripos and i went down to sheringham to read we we picked each other up on the beach we made love in a scared furtive desperate ignorant sort of way people were primitive in those days compared with what they are now daddy wasnt there he came in afterwards devizes considered for a moment he decided that it wasnt fair to oblige her to go on questioning him my father he said was a pretty considerable old bully he was sir george devizes the man who invented the devizes biscuit and cured old alphonso and he was celebrated for being rude to his patients he would smack their stomachs and tell them they ought to be scooped out he helped make unter magenbad he suspected me of being a bit of a soft though as a matter of fact i wasnt and he generally had the effect of laying up for a quarrel with me he kept me pretty short he wasnt particularly nice to my mother he used to get at my mother through me i didnt dare to have a scrape of any sort i was really afraid of him if i saw a scrape blowing up my habit and disposition was to run away i see devizes considered the implications of that i see not that i ran away from any definite scrape that i knew of at sheringham he said very carefully what was my mother like in those days a sort of subdued fierceness a flushed warm face she was pretty you know and very upright in her carriage and she had a swift decision beneath her stiffness her wishes would suddenly crystallize out and after that there was no bending her i know i suppose you do she wore glasses then oh yes was she fresh then was she happy a little too fierce to be happy did you ever love her it is a long time ago christina alberta there was seaside love making why do you cross examine me like this i want to know why christina alberta had a momentary terror at her own boldness why didnt you marry her devizes made no pretence of surprise at the question there was no reason manifest why i should have married her none at all i cant conceive what my father would have done if i had come back from sheringham engaged to a chance acquaintance and anyhow why should i have done anything of the sort his eyes defied hers i left her my address he added she could have written to me she never did did a letter go astray said christina alberta and added hastily my imagination is running away with me she hesitated and trembled at the next words she had resolved to say but she said them with a forced offhandedness you see i might have fancied you as a father it produced no catastrophe he looked her in the face and then smiled after that smile she felt that they understood each other completely and it was very pleasant to think that instead of which you have to adopt me as a cousin he said deliberately cousins it is christina alberta its the best we can do we have to put our heads together and think of your daddy hes our common concern im interested in that little man hes defended himself against many things by those dreams of his very wilful dreams they may have been who knows necessary protective dreams christina alberta did not speak for a little time she nodded she was glad at their manifest understanding and yet she was disappointed though she could not have told herself what else she had expected this man a yard away was the nearest thing in the world to her and always there might be this invisible barrier between them they were linked by an invisible tie and they were separated by an unfathomable necessity never before in her life had she known what love could be she wanted to be free to love him she wanted him to love her she realized that she was standing quite still and that devizes was standing just as still upon his hearthrug watching her face his mouth and eyes were quiet and serene but she imagined he must be gripping his hands together behind him she had to obey him there was nothing for her to do but follow his lead daddys our common concern she said i suppose i shall begin to hear from some of those people to morrow christina alberta got back to her daddy in a dream it was a queer dream she was going about the world with devizes and they were locked together in such a way that she and he could never look at each other but were always side by side but also with the sublime incoherence of dreams they were at the same time great ebony images and they sat stiffly side by side like a pharaoh and his consort and they looked over a great space they were very big effigies indeed and their profiles were alike all through the dream she thought of devizes and herself as black the space before them was sometimes a sandy desert and sometimes a grey cloudy expanse then suddenly something round and white came bounding into the midst of this arena and became a little man a familiar little blue eyed man tied up into a ball with ropes and sorely maimed who rolled about and panted and struggled to be free oh but he struggled pitifully christina albertas heart went out to him and yet impelled by some tremendous force within her she rose and devizes rose beside her and they marched stiffly forward she could not help herself she could not control the rigid movements of her hands and feet they stepped high and forcibly she was voiceless she tried to cry out we shall trample upon him we shall trample upon him but there was no more than a hoarse inarticulate sound of horror in her throat they were upon him she felt the body of her daddy writhe under her he was like a bladder his soft ineffectual body with her feet upon him bent and bulged about she forgot there was anything else but her daddy and herself why had she treated him like this devizes disappeared her daddy was clinging to her knees and now a crowd of vile figures had appeared and sought to drag him away save me christina alberta he was pleading though she heard no sound save me save me every day they torture me but they dragged him away and she could not put out her arms to him because she was made of ebony and all of one piece with devizes then some one a bird or a sphinx with the face and voice of lambone came into the dream listen to your daddy he said do not despise him or simply pity him he has much to teach you the world will never learn anything until it will learn from ridiculous people all people are ridiculous i am i am ridiculous we learn in suffering what we teach in song she saw that her daddy was now sheltering between the paws of the sphinx and that the evil men had vanished she became intensely aware of a revealing absurdity in her dream no previous incompatibility had shocked her at all and she had never thought that she was dreaming up to this point but now she became intensely oppressed by the idea that the sphinx was an ancient egyptian and classical figure and that sargon was a still more ancient sumerian the dream was going wrong the periods the cultures were mixed she conveyed this to sphinx lambone and he turned his head to answer her and immediately the evil figures were back and taking advantage of lambones inattention were dragging her daddy away she tried to call lambones attention to that but he said there would be plenty of time to recover her daddy when the point about the sphinx was settled he wasnt a sphinx he explained but a winged bull he never had been a sphinx or why should he be wearing a long curly stone beard she wanted to argue that it was a false beard and that he had only just put it on and anyhow it was just like him to start an inopportune discussion meanwhile her daddy was receding into wretchedness she became aware of this rapidly and painfully it was her daddy still but his body was different it was not a human body any more but a basket of fruit overturned unless she did something at once it would go rotten and be bad for ever she tried to cry out words of comfort and reassurance to the poor tragic little figure before the dream came to an end for now she knew surely that it was a dream of course he was suffering intolerably why had she not written to him or telegraphed to him surely they would give him a letter or a telegram a profound self detestation for her incompetence and negligence and a great horror of pain and cruelty came upon her and she awoke completely to black night and infinite dismay in her little hard bed in her stuffy little bedroom in lonsdale mews but the impression of her daddy desolate and broken hearted and in danger remained with her terribly vivid it clung to her she got up in the morning anxious and depressed by it i am not doing enough for him she said i am letting days slip by and for him they must be days of despair sure th sylums nt so ba s at said fay sure yr overrating it but to live among lunatics and be classed as a lunatic theyve bans play them foxhill sylum theres buful ban ntainments nors sorts treats said fay christina alberta refrained from bad language you getting ill ove all this said fay you doing no good n lun youffar ber come dow shorem thes thouse spoilin in this las bit of fine wr for the october weather was holding out that year quite wonderfully a succession of calm golden days and the crumbs had been offered the loan of a bungalow on the beach at shoreham by a friend who had used it throughout the summer they wanted to go down to it before the weather broke but going down to it meant leaving christina alberta all alone in the studio and they did not want to do that but they meant to go to shoreham christina alberta now that she had discovered devizes could not endure the thought of getting out of telephone range of him london she argued was manifestly her proper centre she could get down to cummerdown hill in an hour she could keep in touch with everything the crumbs might go but she must stay fay would not understand she pestered about eleven oclock christina alberta went to the post office telephone booth and rang up devizes cant something be done to hurry things up she asked ive got daddy on my nerves i cant bear to think of him there day after day ive been dreaming of him worrying is no good we ive got some bad news for you so put all your controls on he paused christina alberta for all her love of devizes had to restrain her violent desire to snap oh what is it visiting day was yesterday he had one visitor i suppose thats the agreeable relation you described what was his name wiggles mr widgery but your daddy cant be seen again by the outer world for a week not until next tuesday oh damn said christina alberta exactly ill do what i can to arrange some sort of special access i got on to the medical superintendent himself but hes queer hes evidently quite friendly and well disposed but he fences about he cant say either yes or no odd im free to day in the afternoon but im tied up to morrow i was for going down to see him the superintendent i mean for a talk after lunch better in a day or so he says hope theres nothing wrong that hes keeping back afterwards he promised me to ring me up later and then abruptly he switched off so hold yourself ready there whats your telephone number havent got one you must telegraph or ill chase round in a taxi and pick you up sorry to hold you up like this christina alberta i dont mind anything so long as its getting towards daddy right o and the voice was cut off the telegram came after an interval of two hours two hours which had been devoted to a rambling dispute with fay about the shoreham difficulty the message ran as follows has your father turned up he escaped at dawn this morning in slippers and dressing gown and nothing seen of him since if not appeared meet me victoria two seven for cummerdown telephone gerrard if there but mr preemby did not turn up anywhere he just vanished christina alberta in a state of incredulous astonishment at this fresh disappearance went down with devizes to cummerdown they found a medical superintendent by no means so amazed as they were sargon had been missing at breakfast time everything seemed to point to his just walking out of the asylum that sort of thing had happened before it showed a certain sleepy negligence on the part of one or two attendants and they would be reprimanded but as for wonder the medical superintendent refused to wonder lunatics often stray or escape and unless they are dangerous the authorities made no great commotion about it they kept it out of the newspapers as far as it was possible to do so this place isnt portland said the medical superintendent they get back all right i give him a day hes probably coming back now he may be hiding up a mile away im chiefly anxious about his catching cold pneumonia is the standard death of a lunatic but its wonderfully warm for the time of year ive never known such an october he was much more desirous to talk to devizes about lunacy reform and convince him that he was a highly progressive and able medical superintendent than to discuss the special case of mr preemby we do what we can he said but were fixed by the extreme economy we have to practise low grade attendants and not enough even of them the public indifference to lunatics is monstrous everybody even the people with insane relations wants to forget all about them but how could preemby have got out of the grounds asked devizes arent there walls all round like everything else about lunacy law the back is not as good as the front said the superintendent but here we have got at least a complete wall of sorts all round the original building used to be a private mansion with a walled park for a time in the eighteenth century it was a boys school he showed them from his window over the roofs of a clump of outbuildings the limits of the garden and farm at the back dropping towards a streamlet and defined by a roadside wall and old thorn and oak trees for my own part said the medical superintendent i admit the urgency of very drastic reforms i wonder if cousin widgery can throw any light on this said devizes widgery that was his visitor yesterday was it said the medical superintendent and reflected and went to his desk as if to look for a paper i thought it was a different sort of name rather more like goodchild perhaps ive mixed up the names mr sam widgery said christina alberta would be the last person whod want daddy to get out he probably came to make sure that he wouldnt he may have come just for the pleasure of gloating over him uncle sams not a pretty soul he may have wanted to make sure the wall went all the way round the medical superintendent forgot his doubt about the name and the paper and turned with a fresh idea to them you dont think there was any animus you dont think he may have made for mr widgery where does this mr widgery live but neither devizes nor christina alberta thought there was any great possibility of mr preemby beating back to woodford wells hes much more likely to go to canterbury or windsor or start straight off for rome said christina alberta or mesopotamia or the british museum said devizes or anywhere said christina alberta with a note of despair they returned to london completely baffled christina alberta was for a visit to the cummerdown police station and for a search in the villages round about but devizes explained that this might do more harm than good until now christina alberta had never heard of that one kindly weakness in the british lunacy laws the release of the fourteen days freedom if the lunatic can get away from the asylum and remain at large for that period he or she becomes legally sane again and cannot be touched without a fresh examination and a new certificate to set the whole countryside hunting for preemby might merely lead to his recapture by the asylum authorities and whatever happened the mystery must not get into the papers but while we do nothing he may be lying dead in some out of the way ditch said christina alberta if hes dead he wont mind a little delay in finding him said devizes no the only thing was to wait at lonsdale mews against the chance of his returning thither the crumbs went off to shoreham and christina alberta was left alone in the studio but after one endless day of it paul lambone thought of a convenient agency called universal aunts and a suitable lady was sent to relieve her from a continuous vigil one two three days passed there came no sign from sargon no news of any fresh calling of disciples or visits to the king he had evaporated a vision of a little crumpled up body in a ditch replaced the tormented figure in the cell in the distressed imagination of christina alberta but the mind refuses to go on with a painful fancy that leads to nothing and christina albertas imagination presently ceased further dealings with her daddy until fresh material came to hand he will turn up somewhere she repeated feebly and became a great consumer of evening papers he will turn up somehow her chief anxiety was that he should not turn up with too tremendous head lines she began to adjust herself like an early christian for the second coming the riddle of her daddys disappearance became a habit of mind became as it were a frame a proscenium arch to her current activities beneath it she returned to the urgent and extraordinary problem of herself and her relationship to devizes it was manifest that he was almost as excited as she was at their mutual discovery the possible proceedings of sargon fantastic as they might prove to be when they came to light remained for him as for her a matter of urgent importance but the thought of this strange relationship completely overshadowed it each had a reciprocal desire to get at the other to discover what magic of sympathy and understanding might not be latent in their consanguinity the evening after the universal aunt was installed he took christina alberta out to dine with him at a pleasant little italian restaurant in the corner of sloane square and afterwards he came back to the studio with her and talked until nearly one in the morning he showed himself shyly anxious to find out her aims and purposes in life and what she was doing and what might be done to let out her possibilities he was evidently disposed to shoulder just as much parental responsibility as he could subject to the preservation of appearances and a proper care for the self respect of the vanished sargon she attracted him and he liked her her feelings for him were more tumultuous and abundant and indefinite she didnt particularly want help or support from him the idea of being dependent upon him for anything repelled rather than attracted her but she wanted to get hold of him to please and satisfy him to be better than he had expected and interesting in fresh ways she wanted him to like her to care for her more than mere liking she wanted that anxiously and tremendously she liked a sort of ease and confidence he had with waiters and cabmen and the common services of life he seemed to know just what people would do and they seemed to know just what he would do there was no tension in these matters no nervous hrrmping these common attributes of habitual prosperity were so little in her experience that they seemed a distinction of his and they threw a flavour of knowing what he was about and being serenely in control over most of the conversation when indeed he was as curious and experimental and emotionally stirred almost as she was the eyes that met hers when she talked were steady friendly interested intimate eyes and her heart went out to them over the dinner he talked at first about music he had had no music in his education and now he was discovering it a friend of his had been taking him to concerts and he had got a pianola so as to spell it out at home first but christina albertas education had missed out music too and she hadnt as yet discovered it so that topic died out presently he tried her about pictures but there again she wasnt particularly interested they had a little silence he looked across at her and smiled id like to ask you all sorts of questions christina alberta if i dared he said she blushed absurdly any questions you like she said immense questions he said for example generally what do you think you are up to she understood what he meant at once but she was so unprepared with an answer that she became evasive up to she said playing for time i suppose im looking for my lost daddy but what are you up to generally what are you doing with your life where are you going im at sea she said at last lots of my generation are i think the girls especially you are older than i am im only beginning i dont want to seem cheeky but arent you better able to say what you are up to suppose her slightly scared gravity broke into an impudent smile that devizes found very congenial suppose you play first he considered that perfectly fair he said i will have another olive im glad you like olives i do too nobodys called me to account for a long time what is my game its a fair question but not an easy one evidently i suppose one ought to begin right back at ones philosophy he said a long story but i started the idea christina alberta was greatly elated at her successful repulse of his projected cross examination instead of making a display herself she could watch him she watched him over the flowers on the table and had to be nudged by the waiter when he brought the pheasant to her elbow how should one begin he plunged she had heard of pragmatism yes she was probably better read in that sort of thing than he was he was he considered a sort of pragmatist most modern minded intelligent people he held were pragmatists as he understood it pragmatist as he understood it he met her eye and explained in this sense he meant it we none of us had a clear vision of reality nobody perhaps would ever do more than approach reality what we perceived was just that much of reality that got through to us through our very defective powers of interpretation theyve done this pheasant en casserole very well he broke off three minutes truce we ought to give it do you find im talking comprehensibly i doubt it im hanging on said christina alberta perhaps im beginning rather too far off pheasant to come back to my confession of faith he said presently mind you christina alberta youve got to say your bit afterwards it wont be as definite as yours she said some of yours i shall steal but go on telling me well keep hold christina alberta i feel im going to be at once hesitating and condensed and im not sure of what you know or dont know if i say im an agnostic about the nature of the universe and how it began and where it ends does that convey anything to you just what i think said christina alberta well he started afresh and got into parenthetical difficulties the pche melba came to interrupt and permit a fresh start he unfolded a psychologists vision of the world for her inspection a curious and yet attractive vision to her he expressed himself in terms of mind and understanding she was used to hearing everything expressed in terms of labour and material necessity life he said was one continuous thing all life was connected he tried to illustrate that the conscious life of most lower animals was intensely individual a lizard for example was just itself just its instincts and appetites it received no teaching and no tradition it handed on nothing to its kind but the higher animals were taught when they were young learnt and taught others and communicated with each other men far more than any animal he had developed picture writing speech oral tradition scientific record there was now a common mind of the race a great growing body of knowledge and interpretations people like ourselves are just cross sections of that flow individually we receive it react to it change it a little and pass away we are just passing phases of that increasing mind which may be for all we can certainly say an immortal mind does this sound like greek or nonsense to you no she said i think i get the drift of it she looked at his intent face he wasnt in the least talking down to her he was simply trying to express himself as well as he possibly could to her he was treating her like an equal like an equal that was his general philosophy he was coming to the question of himself now he said he became very earnest over the coffee cups and ash tray on the swept tablecloth he spread elucidatory hands before her he was conscientiously explicit he saw in himself two phases or rather two levels of existence roughly speaking two they had links and intermediate stages of course but they could be ignored when one just wanted to express the idea first of all he was the old instinctive individual fearful greedy lustful jealous self assertive that was the primary self he had to attend to that primary self because it carried all the rest of him as a rider must see that his horse gets oats deeper lay social instincts and dispositions arising out of family life that was the second self the social self man he threw out is a creature that has become more and more consciously social in the last two or three hundred thousand years he has been lengthening his life keeping his children with him longer and longer enlarging his community from family herds into clans and tribes and nations the deep lying continuity of life was becoming more apparent and finding more and more definite expression with this socialization of man to educate anyone in the proper sense of the word was to make him more and more aware of this continuity the importance of the passionate feverish self was then reduced true education was self subordination to a greater life to the social self the natural instincts and limitations of the primary self were in conflict with this wider underflow education good education tended to correct them here am i said devizes as we all are a creature in a state of internal conflict quicker fiercer mortal instincts at issue with a deeper calmer less brightly lit but finally stronger drive towards immortal purposes and i am how shall i put it i personally am to the best of my ability on the side of the deeper things my aptitudes and temperament and opportunities have brought me to psychology as a profession i work to add to the accumulation of human knowledge and understanding about the mind i work for illumination my particular work is to study and cure troubled and tangled minds i try to straighten them out and simplify them and illuminate them and above all i try to learn from them i seek the mental or physical cause of their distresses i try to set down as clearly and accessibly as possible all i observe and learn thats my job thats my aim it gives me a general direction for my life all the stuff of my mere individual existence i try to subordinate to that end not always my monkey individual gets loose at times and gibbers on the roof and at other times its rather good company as a relief from overwork vanity and self indulgence have their uses but never mind the monkey now i do not want to be a brilliant person i want to be a vital part thats my essential creed i want to be the sort of wheel in the machinery they call a mental expert as good a wheel as i can be thats what im up to in general terms christina alberta thats what i think i am yes said christina alberta reflecting profoundly of course i cant produce a statement like that youve got your system complete and finished said devizes youve got to tell your story in your own way at your age you ought to be with loose ends to all your convictions i wonder if i can tell you any story youve got to try your best now its only fair play yes there was a little silence its wonderful to talk to you like this said christina alberta its wonderful to talk to anyone like this i feel that you and i have to understand each other she met his grave eyes for a moment there was a wave of emotion within her she could not speak she reached out her hand to touch his and for a moment their hands were together christina alberta only got to her confession of faith in the studio after they had returned thither and relieved the universal aunt even then they didnt settle down to the business all at once devizes walked about and looked for drawings by harold he deduced harold from his drawings to a quite remarkable extent christina alberta thought he was curious about fay whats mrs crumb like he asked show me something of hers something that seems to give her it pleased christina alberta very much to think that he was shy with her she felt that this was a recognition of her equality he was respecting her and she was very eager that she should be respected by him he got to an anchorage at last in the gaily painted seat by the gas fire and christina alberta after flitting about the room for a time came and stood before it shapely legs wide apart and hands behind her back in an attitude that would have shocked all her feminine ancestors for many generations but it did not shock devizes he found her more and more interesting to watch and he sat at his ease and regarded her with a lively admiration most of us get used to our daughters so gradually they grow up and we carry the wonder of them as milo carried his ox it isnt common for a man to get an unexpected daughter abruptly at the age of twenty one she said she hadnt much in the way of metaphysics she was a materialist no prayers at mothers knee religion of mother and daddy school prayers and teaching church or chapel it all washed out and faded out i think as they laid it on no fear of hell most of my generation went through the fear of hell not a trace of it said the new age but a desire for god in the night christina alberta paused for a little while i have that she said it comes sometimes i dont know whether its very important or not important at all its part said devizes slowly of something that has to do with wanting to be more than a miserable worm and disliking meanness and so forth yes do you know more about it rather oddly he didnt answer that and how do you see yourself in relation to mankind and the animals and the stars what sense of obligation have you what do you think the road is along which you have to go hm said christina alberta she considered she was a communist she said though she didnt belong to the party but she knew some other young people who did she produced some of the phrases of the movement the materialist conception of history and so forth he said he failed to understand and asked rather irritating questions she thought controversially she didnt realize at first how widely apart was their phraseology as they talked this became apparent he seemed to have nothing too good to say for the communist idea for wasnt it just his own idea of being a part of a greater being of life but he seemed to have nothing too bad for practical communism marxist communism he said wasnt a constructive movement at all it was merely a solvent it had no idea no plan christina alberta was put on the defensive enthusiasm for an ideal communist state isnt nearly so important as the question of immediate communist tactics in a decaying society she recited in an almost official tone that was how her young friends in the party talked but when she talked like this to him it didnt seem so effective he wouldnt leave her phrases alone he wanted to know what she meant by decay in a society whether there had ever been a society not actively in decay and not also actively in growth what good tactics were except in relation to general strategy and whether there could be any strategy without a clear war end she countered more vigorously than effectively and their manner became controversial he pressed the difference in their opinions communism for him meant a new spirit a spirit of science reorganizing the world upon scientific collective lines but the whole temper of party communism was contemporary it was saturated with the feelings and ideas of existing social classes with the natural resentment of the dispossessed it had the angry dogmatism of desperate people not sure of their grip it needed more of the passion of creative self forgetfulness many communists he said were simply reversed capitalists egotists without capital they wanted revenge and expropriation and when they were through with that they would be left with nothing but social ruins and everything to begin all over again and they were suspicious and intolerant because of their want of internal assurance they distrusted their best friends their proper leaders scientific men like keynes and soddy keynes a communist cried christina alberta in derision he doesnt accept the first scientific fact of the class war it isnt much of a fact certainly not a first scientific fact he replied keynes builds up slowly a conception of a scientifically organized exchange system most of your friends in russia dont seem capable even of realizing that such a thing is necessary but they do have they shown it what do you know of the russian bolsheviks what do you you just look at the labels on people nothing genuine without the red label and everything genuine with she said he saw things from his bourgeois standpoint and he laughed cheerfully at her social classifications there was no bourgeoisie in england he said she attempted some of the stock cynicisms and sarcasms of the movement but with an unusual lack of conviction it was easy for him to criticize she said living as he did on invested capital it would make it easier he smiled but really i live on my fees you have invested capital some i dont live on it they had exhausted the dispute for a time after all she reflected she hadnt put up such a bad fight considering her age and standing the momentary glow of controversial exasperation faded again they drifted to the more immediate question in which they were interested the question of what she was to do with her life we progress christina alberta said devizes but its still generally the rule that a womans life is determined very largely by the character and occupations of the leading man in the play have you by any chance been in love yet she wanted to tell him all the truth about herself but some things are untellable she hesitated and blushed hotly nowadays she said and stopped ive some imagination ive run about london ive perhaps imagined things his eyes were very searching for a moment but none the less kindly ive been in love in a kind of way she admitted he nodded with a dreadful effect of complete comprehension i dont want to run my life in relation to any man she extended clever girls never do any more than clever young men want to spend their lives adoring a goddess in any case i dont see myself becoming a child producing housekeeper she said even if you married no i doubt whether you are that type but if you are going to reject that easy way and it is an easy way in spite of what people say if you are going to be a citizen on your own as a man is then youve got to do a mans work christina alberta theres to be none of the pretty fanny business you know well am i asked christina alberta no i dont think you are and in that case i guess you want some more education youre clever but youre a bit patchy im good enough to get a job and then learn learn he said thats enough to take you all your time id rather we agreed its got to be a student for two or three years more you need have no anxiety about ways and means you and i are of the same clan a clan of two practically and i am the head ill see you through just as though you were a son and now what sort of work is it to be law medicine a general education for journalism or affairs doors open to women now fresh doors every day to that christina alberta could speak a little more fully she had been thinking out some of these things she wanted to know about life and the world as a whole could she have a good year at physical science biology and geology chiefly and anthropology would that be possible and then if she was any good at medical work another year at mental science or politics and public health it sounds ambitious i know she said ambitious its an encyclopdia in a year but i want to know about all these things naturally could i have longer than that youd have to have longer than that it seems to be asking for so much it wouldnt be if you were in trousers weve agreed to unsex you to that extent why shouldnt you be ambitious you think i might do work scientific work at last as you do why not a girl youre the sort of stuff i am christina alberta do you think some day i might even come to work to work with you kindred minds may follow kindred courses he said with the completest recognition of their relationship why not she stood and looked at him with a dark excitement in her eyes and he had a momentary intimation of all that he might be to her gallant she was and fine and ambitious a wonderful life to come out of nothingness into his own and she meant this relationship to grow as well it might grow into something very great and deep for both of them he went off at a tangent to talk of the contrast of men and women students and of men and women as workers youll never run parallel with men you free women so dont expect it youve got to work out a way that is similar perhaps but different different down to the roots he argued that probably the whole fabric of a man had its qualities that a womans did not possess and vice versa down even to a muscular fibre or a nerve tendril a time might come when we should be able to put a drop of blood or a scrap of skin under the microscope or apply some subtle reagent to it and tell its sex a man resists he said a man is intractable he has greater inertia physical and mental that keeps him to his course men compared with women are steadier and stupider women compared with men are quicker and sillier bludgeons and bodkins he talked of his student days when women medical students were still rather novel intrusions and from that he passed to his fathers prejudices to his fathers treatment of his mother and his boyish days presently they were exchanging experiences of childish delusions and fancies she forgot how much older and more experienced he was in the ease of his talk he told her about himself because he recognized her right to know about him he listened with a friendly eagerness to all she chose to tell him of her daddy and herself and about her impressions and her few adventures in encounter as a suburban student in london they shared their delight in paul lambones kindly absurdity presently it occurred to her to offer him drink the crumbs had left a bottle of beer and a syphon but devizes asked her to make tea and helped her with the kettle meanwhile the mutual exploration went on their friendliness grew richer and deeper as they talked she had never before met so intimate and delightful a curiosity as his she had had friends before but no such friendliness she had had a lover but never such intimacy it was one oclock before he went away the talk had ebbed he sat thoughtful for a moment i must go he said and stood up they faced each other a little at a loss for parting words its been wonderful to talk to you she said its a great thing to have discovered you another pause its a great thing for me she said lamely well talk many times he said he wanted to call her my dear and an absurd shyness prevented him and she was aware of that suppression she stood up straight before him in the passage with a flush on her cheeks and her eyes alight and he wondered he had not thought her beautiful from the beginning good bye for the time he said and smiled at her gravely and took and held her hand for a moment good night she said and hesitated and then opened the green door for him and stood and watched him go up the mews at the top he turned and waved his hand to her before he disappeared good night she whispered and started and looked about her as if she feared that her unspoken thoughts had been audible father her father so real fathers leave one aglow like this he had left her tense as a violin string on which the bow rests motionless now daddy who wasnt her father she would just have hugged and kissed chapter the second how bobby stole a lunatic a man may be a mental expert and yet fail to take the most obvious hints in a detective investigation the medical superintendent at cummerdown hill had doubted for a moment whether widgery was the name of sargons visitor he had thought it was more like goodchild but since there was no known goodchild in the world of christina alberta neither she nor devizes had troubled to scrutinize this momentary uncertainty nor had she and devizes asked themselves why widgery should have made a second visit to his cousin indeed he had not done so it was a much younger man who had visited sargon that tuesday he had falsely represented himself as sargons nephew and given the name of robin goodchild his real name was robert roothing and he had come for the sole purpose of getting sargon out of the asylum as soon as possible because he could not endure the thought of his staying there circumstances had conspired with a natural predisposition to give bobby a great horror of all restraint his mother a gentle dark creature the wife of a large blond negligent landowner had died when bobby was twelve and he had been entrusted to the care of a harsh old fashioned aunt to whom the cupboard seemed a proper place for discipline when she discovered that he was really distressed by it she sought to break his cowardice by giving him quite liberal doses of it even when he had committed no offence he went to a school where discipline was maintained by keeping in the war eliminated his father who died suddenly of over excitement while in command of an anti aircraft gun during an air raid and it led bobby through some tiresome campaigning in mesopotamia and the beleaguerment of kut to an extremely unsympathetic turkish prison in any case he would probably have been a free going easy creature but now he had so passionate a hatred of cages that he wanted to release even canaries he disliked the iron fences round the public parks and squares with a propagandist passion he wrote articles about them in wilkins weekly and elsewhere clamouring for their liberation and he never went by train if he could help it because of the claustrophobia that assailed him in the compartment he would ride a push bike except for long distances and then he would borrow billys motor bicycle he did his best to prevent his craving for the large and open from becoming too conspicuous or a nuisance to other people but tessy and billy understood about it and did their best to make things easy for him it was not only claustrophobia that bobby had to fight against he carried on a secret internal conflict with a disinclination to act upon most occasions that he believed had developed in him as a result of war experiences sometimes it seemed to him to be just indolence sometimes fastidiousness sometimes sheer funk and cowardice he could not tell he had a rankling memory of a case of cruelty he had witnessed in the prisoners camp when he had stood by and done nothing he would wake up sometimes at three oclock in the morning and say to himself aloud i stood by and i did nothing oh god oh god oh god and at times he would walk up and down his study repeating act you vegetable you hiding cur out and act meanwhile he obeyed routines and did whatever came to his hand as aunt suzannah he was excellent indefatigably considerate lucid really helpful wilkins weekly was proud of him he was the backbone of the paper and now this affair of sargons had twisted him up very badly between his desire to free the little man who had taken an extraordinary hold upon his imagination and sympathy and his sense of the immense forces against which he would have to pit himself if he tried to give him any help it was only after a considerable struggle with himself that he had called at the police station and the gifford street workhouse he was afraid of awkward questions afraid above all of being detained the workhouse was a detestable place with high walls and a paved court and a general effect of sinister seclusion from the grubby street outside for the best part of a day after his gifford street visit he hesitated whether he should do anything more bobbys got a grouch susan told tessy hes stoopid just sits and says e as to fink sumpfink over whats he fink fings over for said i was to come downstairs again there was a good girl meant it said so pussd me way i do o nt fink i lo o o ove bobby nymore great distress a storm of tears tessy was deeply sympathetic but after tea bobby was brighter and drew susan her good night picture and came down and sat on her bed and talked her to sleep the same as usual and tessy perceived that the worst of bobbys trouble was over at supper bobby unfolded his plans i mean to go to cummerdown hill to morrow he said compactly to see sargon said tessy understandingly if i can but it wont be visiting day thats tuesday i want to look round billy raised his eyebrows and helped himself to butter but said tessy and stopped short yes said bobby you wont be able to see him you dont know the name hes under theyll call him mr sargon said billy his names preemby hes a laundryman they told me at the workhouse his people want him to be there i cant stand the thought of it said bobby after a brief silence dont follow said billy that nice little thing being made into a lunatic like a little blue eyed bird he was high walls great louting warders sargon king of kings ive got to do something about it or i shall burst he looked at once weak and desperate tessy reflected youd better go she said but what good will that do said billy and was quelled by a glance from tessy if you can lend me the old motor bike and the side car youre not using it this week end you can take off the side car said billy i may want it said bobby you dont mean said billy bobby came as near to an explosion as he ever did oh never mind what i mean i tell you im going down to cummerdown to have a look at the place no doubt im a futile ass billy but i just cant help myself going the poor little beggars got no friends his own familys helped to put him away families do its an infernal world ive got to do something if its only to shake em up if i stay here another day i shall start smacking susan somebody ought to said billy if he can only keep away for fourteen days clear hes free said tessy he has to be certified all over again anyhow said bobby bobby discovered that the village of cummerdown lies nearly two miles away from the asylum and does its best very successfully to have as little to do with it as possible it nestles among trees just off the high road to ashford and hastings and has one cramped little inn that gave him a bleak bedroom and accommodated his machine and side car in an open outhouse crowded with two carts and a ford and populous with hens the day was still young and after he had deposited the elderly rucksac in which he had brought his things upstairs he set out with a walking stick and an air of detached interest to reconnoitre the asylum and develop his plans for the rescue of sargon that golden autumn was still holding out the pleasant lane he followed to the high road was patterned with green and yellow chestnut leaves and the trees overhead were full of sunshine it was a reassuring day it encouraged him it took him with a kindly seriousness and made him feel that rescuing people from lunatic asylums was the sort of work the sun could shine upon and nature welcome it had needed a great effort to get down from london he had felt then like a midget setting out to attack an embattled universe amidst the croydon traffic he had been half minded to go back but he had felt that he could not face tessy until he had been at least definitely defeated it was delightful to note an increased assurance within himself as he drew nearer to his enterprise he felt much more on the scale of the powers he attacked after all what were laws and regulations but just things patched up by men like himself what were prison walls but the slow work of shirking bricklayers and evasive contractors the attendants and custodians the superintendents and so forth he was setting out to circumvent were all as fallible as himself and the thing was urgent and outrageous this seizure of a harmless little fantastic this frightful imprisonment it had to be fought the world would be intolerable unless such things were fought queer world it was such beauty on these tree stems such a glow and the delightfulness of rustling ones feet through these leaves but all that was by the way the real business of life was to fight evil things he came out from between the trees and saw the wide downs opening out before him and the blocked masses of the asylum with its broad bare grounds and walls an eyesore this was his objective in that place somewhere was sargon and he had to be released he seated himself on a convenient stile and inspected that heavy architecture and tried to frame a plan that white building in the centre looked like a gaunt georgian private house that was probably the nucleus of the whole place two men were visible in front of it mowing the grass patients perhaps the wall and railings along the road looked implacable two stern looking lodges there were no doubt with a testy janitor lurking within and there were iron gates one open a van was coming out a furniture dealers van for a time bobbys mind ran on the possibility of becoming a tradesman with parcels or a crate to deliver many difficulties that way but why a frontal attack said bobby with an effect of discovery the place fell away behind down hill he would inspect the rear if he worked round by the open down to the right he would probably get on to slopes commanding a view of the asylum grounds an hour later bobby was sitting on a heap of flints by the side of a minor road which ran over the rising ground behind the asylum he found the rear of the place much more hopeful and much more interesting than the front there were fields with a number of men working in them and at one place near the buildings a row of men seemed to be digging a trench under the supervision of an attendant there was quite a lot of movement closer to the buildings under a sort of open shed half a dozen men seemed to be taking exercise by walking up and down it vexed bobby to think that any one of these figures might be his sargon if only he had the elementary common sense to bring a field glass he reproached himself he might have been able to make out his little friends features no clearness of thought he whispered no decision a lot of these people seemed to be going about very freely carrying gardening implements and so forth one he noted walking about and gesticulating as if he talked to himself he was manifestly a patient and quite unattended the wall bounding the asylum on this side had none of the austerity of the front wall it seemed to be an old estate wall in several places it was covered with ivy and here and there it was overhung with trees the ground dropped away to his right there was a little stream which ran out of the asylum grounds at the lowest corner the corner was shaded by trees and seemed to be left to the trees and undergrowth the stream ran under a low arch in the wall and went on down a widening valley towards london the seclusion and shade of this corner appealed to bobby very strongly it seemed to him exactly the point at which sargon ought to be got out of the place he decided that presently he would stroll down and examine its possibilities as precisely as possible if one could get sargon to come down there he found the details difficult he meant to have a plan worked out in every detail and to communicate it to sargon on the next visiting day but it was very hard to fit this plan together he did not know when it would be most convenient for sargon to attempt to slip away whether this was to be a daylight or a night affair he saw before him a great vista of inquiries to be made and suspicious people to be faced damn said bobby and for a time he was again for abandoning the attempt why couldnt one go in at these gates boldly and overwhelmingly and say there is a sane man here and i have come to set him free a superman might do that or an archangel how splendid it would be to be a sort of archangel knight errant a great flaming presence of light and winged power righting wrongs reproving oppressors liberating every kind of captive creature then one might do things bobby lapsed into a childish day dream presently he roused himself stood up and went down towards the exit of the stream the wall struck him as quite climbable even by a little old gentleman the stream came out meandering among pebbles through a short tunnel one could have got into the asylum grounds or out of them quite easily over the wall by the ivy or through the culvert he resolved to come again at twilight and just to satisfy himself about his own pluck among other things get into the asylum premises and walk about a little yes he would do that he tried to imagine himself assisting sargon over the wall one could get on the top of the wall and reach down to his hands a cripple could do it the motor bicycle would have to be waiting up there in the lane and then where would he take him this was a new consideration for a time bobbys mind was appalled and paralyzed by the complexities of his enterprise he had not thought of taking him anywhere in particular the days that intervened before visiting day seemed at once interminable and frightfully swift he had been to dymchurch in the summer with the malmesburys and liked the landlady of his lodgings very much he wired to her can i come with a relation not ill but overworked for week or so you will remember me last summer roothing the feathers cummerdown and had got a reply glad to see you any time so that was all right but the rest of the plan failed very largely to materialize he made his nocturnal visit to the asylum grounds without misadventure the morning of visiting day found him with half a dozen plans and they all had gaps and none seemed much better or worse than the others and he had walked round the asylum grounds at various discreet distances by night and day just twenty three times not counting loops returns and visits to particular points of interest fortunately asylums are much preoccupied with their internal affairs and do not keep look out men upon the battlements they do not reckon with rescuers from outside bobby made his final decision among these conflicting projects over his breakfast bacon with a resolute sang froid and his nerves all a tingle he set out for the asylum to see sargon and begin the work of rescue as he had thought it out first he had to find out what freedom of movement was permitted sargon when it might be possible for him to get away to the corner by the culvert and he had to arrange a time for that meeting then he would have to provide also for alternative times if sargon failed to keep his first appointment bobby would be waiting under the wall and the motor bicycle and side car would be hidden among the bushes up by the road in a trice sargon would be over the wall after that they could laugh at pursuit off they would go to dymchurch and there safe and untrackable sargon would keep indoors until the fifteen days needed to make him legally a sane man again had passed and then bobby could find out those relations of his and talk the matter over with them and get things on a proper footing so bobby planned it out just at the lodge gates he decided upon an assumed name he wasnt quite clear why he didnt give his own name but an assumed name seemed to him to be more in the spirit of the adventure when sargon was informed that he was to be visited by mr robin goodchild he was in a depressed mood he betrayed no surprise at the name it seemed to him to be as good as any other name it might be the name of some intelligent inquirer or possibly even some precursor of the release he still hoped for his spirits rose he submitted cheerfully to a searching examination of his personal tidiness and he nodded acquiescently to a warning not to talk about every blessed thing hed seen his spirits rose still more when he saw the dark kindliness of bobbys face it was the one disciple who had ever seemed to believe he held out both his hands in a little storm of emotion whatever sort of muddler bobby might be to himself to sargon in that moment at least he was strength and hope the meeting occurred in the reception room downstairs for no one from the outside world may ever penetrate to the wards and the bleak realities of everyday asylum life the reception room had a baize covered table in the middle a black horsehair sofa and numerous chairs it was totally devoid of small movables there was an a b c time table and one or two illustrated weeklies on the table and the walls bore brown spotted steel engravings of prince albert and queen victoria in the highlands and of windsor castle from the thames there were three or four groups each of two or three people with their heads together conversing in tactful undertones there were several women and one little girl a tearful lady in profound mourning sat apart by the empty fire place and no doubt awaited a patient two attendants tried hard not to look as though they were listening as intently as possible to the conversations going on about them the patients present were all in the sanest phase fit to be visited there was no madness visible at most only a little nervous oddity bobby had been watching these other groups while he waited and he had been impressed by a certain quality of furtiveness in their behaviour the furtiveness he connected with the alertness of the attendants one affected to look out of the window the other half sat at a table holding an old graphic and ever and again there would be a quick glance at this patient or that it had not occurred to bobby that his talk to sargon would be semi public it was a disconcerting interference that would greatly hamper him in giving his instructions bobby saw at once that sargon was very much thinner than when he had taken his room in midgard street he looked ill and worn an effect that was emphasized by the fact that he was badly shaven and wearing ill fitting clothes his eyes seemed larger and sunken under his brows and his forehead more definitely lined yet if he looked unhappier he also looked more intelligent he seemed more aware of the things about him less a man in a dream i have come to see if i can be of service to you said bobby holding out his hands your friends and disciples are anxious for your welfare you have come to see me he said and glanced sideways at the listening attendant and dropped his voice me sargon bobby understood that note of doubt and it grieved him you sargon the king out of the past they would have me deny it whispered sargon bobby raised his eyebrows and nodded his head as who should say theyd do anything the little mans manner changed how is one to know he said how is one to know he sighed nothing seems certain any more can we sit down and talk together said bobby there is much to be said between us sargon glanced round there were two chairs in a corner and in that corner they might be a little beyond the eavesdroppers range i cannot understand this madness said sargon as they sat down i cannot understand this riddle that has been set me why does the power why does god permit men to be mad when they are mad they are beyond good and evil what are they men still what becomes of justice what becomes of righteousness when men go mad his voice sank his eyes became furtive dreadful things happen here he whispered dreadful things quite dreadful things he ceased for a little while neither he nor bobby said a word i want to get you out of this said bobby are my friends doing anything asked sargon what is christina alberta doing is she well she is splendid he said haphazard no doubt she was one of this beastly family of sargons that was content to leave him here i want you to listen to me he said but sargon had things to tell everyone in this place is always thinking about what their friends outside are doing for them the poor souls come and talk to me they know i am different from what they are they write letters petitions i tell them that when god releases me i will bear them all in mind some mock at me they have delusions they think they are kings or emperors or rich men or great discoverers and that the world has plotted against them some are suspicious and cruel darkened souls some have dreadful habits you cannot help but see some are badly sunken degraded indescribably it is very painful very painful the blue eyes stared blankly at unpleasant memories there can be no doubt that i am sargon he said abruptly and looked sharply at bobby i call you by no other name said bobby the momentary acuteness faded again that man preemby was unawakened he was asleep scarcely dreaming of life but i have seen i have looked at the world from high places and from dark places too sargon sargon is a different person but it is difficult he became silent bobby felt that they were getting nowhere in his anticipations of this conversation he had talked and sargon had listened and there had been no one to overhear but this was all unexpected anyhow the plan had to be told sargon had to be instructed in his part he glanced warily at the people nearest to them there are those among us he said quietly and quickly who would set you free i want to tell you on the spur of the moment he attempted a code when i speak of a city in central asia it will mean this place the asylum do you understand this place central asia if i am sargon everything is possibly something else but we are still in england nevertheless in reality but i want to explain to you yes yes explain i shall speak of great discoveries in central asia that will mean this did he understand rescue whispered bobby in sargons ear and glanced at the attendant and met his eye and was discomposed tell me about the discoveries said sargon after a little pause as though he had not heard that whispered word it is a symbol for this place said bobby sargon looked puzzled the attendant was watching their faces now perhaps he suspected already bobby flushed hotly and plunged abruptly into an account of the discoveries of an amazing russian he called bobinsky bobinsky had found a walled city with no way out yes said sargon interested the attendant was now looking away like this place said bobby and more explicitly i mean this place there was a river ran through the city the city of confinement and went out by the lower part there it was the helper waited the rescuers that was the place for them to wait did he understand at that point where the trees grew and the river went out through the wall they they waited there they would wait until the captive king came to them it is a curious story said sargon what captive king do you mean it is meant for you the river you speak of may be the euphrates said sargon i dream of the euphrates he had missed it all he was out upon some woolgathering of his own euphrates what had the euphrates to do with central asia or the asylum bother said bobby i say it is a smaller river i mean a streamlet in the grounds here dont you understand a tall sharp faced woman in a hat of hard black straw came near them and sat down bobby as he talked observed her out of the corner of his eye was she the friend of a patient or what was she doing here i speak in symbols said bobby still watching and thinking about this woman this city is your prison he caught the woman exchanging a glance of intelligence with the male attendant who had moved a couple of yards up the room they knew each other then she must be another observer i want no other prison than this said sargon evidently quite at cross purposes one prison is enough i dont mean that said bobby can you walk about here pretty freely not freely said sargon no if you could come out into the grounds to morrow the woman turned her long sharp foxy nose towards him and stared at him with rather stupid green blue eyes bobbys nerve was going to pieces altogether he was always more afraid of women than men this prim sharp nosed figure so manifestly listening and listening with a faint hostility to all he said completed his discomfiture he tried to improvise a story of lost and recovered cities that would be crystal clear to sargon and yet incomprehensible to the listener but his invention faltered at the difficult task where the river ran out of the city he repeated he harped upon that idea where there were trees and ivy there the faithful waited when was the propitious hour for the master to steal away to them everything was prepared when could it be when might it be fragmentally and mixed with many irrelevancies bobby tried to get the import of these suggestions over to his hearer now he would be explicit now as the fear of the listener returned vague and misleading he did convey a sense of mystery and intention to sargon that was plain but he felt he conveyed nothing more the time was slipping by bobby could have throttled that infernal woman more and more did she become audience to his floundering efforts he maundered back to his starting point about bobinsky there is no such person as bobinsky he threw in then how could he explore cities asked sargon manifestly more and more perplexed at bobbys rigmarole he is dead said bobby he was just a mask some men are dont mind about bobinsky could you slip away to that corner no no shes looking dont answer now answer i dont understand said sargon bobby felt that he was only puzzling sargon but what else was to be done he could have kicked himself for not having brought a brief statement of his plan written plainly on a little piece of paper that he could have slipped into sargons hand or pocket it would have been so simple he could have made a map and a drawing too late to do that now despair came upon bobby everything had gone wrong he got up to go and then sat down again to make another attempt he felt murderous towards that woman towards himself even towards slow witted little sargon it was very good of you to come and see me said sargon why did you come do you think anything will be done about me you will see christina alberta when i saw you first i thought you had things to tell me important things one lives on such hopes here here when there are no visitors nothing happens nothing pleasant and one is distressed i am interested to hear of those cities in central asia of course but it is a little puzzling did you come specially about them or just to see me you will come again even to come down here to this sitting room is an event then in a swift whisper the food is frightful so badly cooked it disagrees with me that woman said bobby as he went she has spoilt everything i cant stand her that woman said sargon and followed the direction of bobbys eyes poor soul he said shes a deaf mute she comes to see her brother the whole family is defective or insane a maddened bobby returned towards his little inn should he chuck the whole thing intolerable thought he must make fresh plans fresh plans altogether he must begin all over again the little man was evidently wretched but it was going to be harder to get hold of him than bobby had thought bobby had no sleep that night in the night just before daybreak suddenly sargon woke up and understood he understood quite clearly what the young man had been saying to him he had said rescue of course he had meant to say escape that city in central asia was only a parable he had said as much he had been describing a corner of the asylum grounds that corner where the stream ran out beyond the work fields and the shrubbery where the patients were supposed not to go he had been telling of friends who would wait outside he had been trying to arrange an hour when these friends would come there and sargon had failed to understand he sat up in bed very still it was perfectly clear but through a sort of dulness that came upon him at times he had not grasped the drift of it at the time the young man had shown irritation naturally enough what would he do now would he try again were the friends still waiting who was this young man his name was unknown or forgotten but he believed he had said i call you by no other name sargon and there were these friends he spoke of who waited outside for the king they must know how could they know if there was nothing to be known after all perhaps it was no dream perhaps the world was awakening but he had failed them he had not understood they waited without how still everything was a strange unusual stillness it was rare for this place to be so bereft of noise it was dark and yet not altogether dark the ward was dimly lit by a blue shaded light the three nearer beds were unoccupied and beyond the man who tossed and muttered almost incessantly lay for a little while at peace the man who raved had died three days ago the man who gave sudden loud shouts had been taken away to another ward through the open door one could see across the landing into the little yellow lit room where brand the ward attendant sat with his arms crossed and chin on his chest and slept his patience cards spread out before him he seemed to be alone and yet he could sleep like that where could the other man be the new attendant whose name sargon did not know and yet he felt some one had just gone out the uncurtained windows showed the night outside a darkness that became translucent a streak of very black cloud and five pale stars across the lower edge of that oblong picture one could see indistinctly a tracery of tree branches and the lumpish head of a young oak still bearing its leaves the trees along the first hedge these outlines grew distincter as he watched it was like the slow development of a photographic plate in the dark room the stars dissolved had there been five there were three the other two had dissolved into the pale invading light dared one venture on to the landing if brand awoke he could make some natural excuse he stood well with brand but the other fellow there was not a trace of him where had he gone do it now wisest of maxims very swiftly sargon slipped out of bed and put on his dressing gown and slippers hush what was that only some one snoring nothing more he went out and stood on the landing brand slept on like a log the stone staircase was lit and empty and from the open door to the left downstairs came the harsh breathing of a sleeper all the world seemed asleep for once except sargon and those friendly watchers outside the walls far away there were sounds of bawling and raving but these were stifled by distance and an intervening door they merely made the nearer silence more perceptible something stirred a little clicking sound that sent sargons heart racing then a resonant blow a second blow it was nothing it was the clock downstairs striking six very quietly but very resolutely he walked downstairs an intuition an instinct impelled him he felt and peered at the door and behold it was ajar unbolted unlocked brands colleague was abroad upon some errand of his own the cold air of freedom blew upon sargons face the door opened and closed softly and sargon stood upon the doorstep of the left wing of the asylum facing the dim world of a november dawn it was dark but it was clear a world of ebony outlines and colourless forms everything looked as if it had just been wiped over with a wet rag it was cold but it was cold without any of the hate and bitterness of wind he crossed the gravel drive and came to a stop and stood looking about him the heavy building of the left wing rose above him a vast bulk that went up into the paler darkness of the sky it receded in perspective and the central block beyond looked like the ghost of a house here and there were orange lit windows and others fainter lit by some remote reflected light in the lodge to the left of the gates there was also a light for where there is madness there is never perfect sleep but the asylum was as near complete silence that morning as an asylum can ever be he looked and listened not a footfall it would not do to be found here by that other attendant but the man was snugly away somewhere no one would loiter here in this chill air what was it sargon had to remember the friends and believers were waiting for him they were waiting now where the river ran out of the city wall that was to say where the little streamlet ran out of the grounds that would be this way to the left where the fields dropped down hill he stepped on to the grass for his feet made loud sounds on the gravel the grass hissed crisply it was heavy with white frost and his footmarks made black blots in the wet silvery grey he walked past and away from the ponderous dark mass of the asylum into the open colder air of freedom he unlatched and went through the small iron gate in the iron fencing that separated the trim grass plots of the front from the cabbage field it complained a little on its hinge and he opened and closed it very carefully he struck across the field the path ran before him into a mist it came out of the mist to his feet and vanished behind him it was as if it went past him while he marked time he could not remember whither the path ran nor how it lay with regard to the corner he sought but every moment things grew clearer every moment things grew clearer there had been something dark and brooding in the sky that hung over him and seemed to watch him he had done his best to ignore the vague presence because he was afraid of his own imagination but suddenly he saw plainly that it was just the tops of trees showing above the mist that must be the line of trees along the hedge parallel to the asylum front he must go through these if he wanted to go down hill he left the path and made his way slowly along a frozen ridge of dug earth he skirted long rows of stalky cabbages black and shrivelled and unkempt they looked like cossack sentinels afoot they all leant towards him as though they listened to the sound of him as he drew near the hedge and the trees he heard a sound like the feet of an army of midgets it was the drip drip of moisture from the trees far away behind him and quite invisible to him a motor car scurried along the high road he had some difficulty in finding a way through the hedge and a bramble scratched his ankle he told himself there was no hurry the friends waited beyond the hedge the ground went down hill and the mist grew whiter and thicker the daylight was strong enough now to show the mist dead white it veiled the stream altogether he walked slowly he had no sense of being pursued brand would not go into the ward for an hour yet he might not miss him for a long time what a wonderful thing thought sargon is daybreak and how little one sees of it every day begins with this miraculous drama and we sleep through it as though it did not concern us and rouse ourselves only for the trite day a little while ago the world had been an inky monochrome and now it was touched with colour the sky was blue all the stars had gone but no not all one still shone a large pale star the star of sargon and the sky about it was flushed with a faint increasing pinkiness that must be the east and that star must be the morning star hanging above the outhouse chimneys those chimneys were very distinct the butt end of the asylum which had been a black and shapeless monster a little while ago had now become a dark purple shape outlined with an exquisite clearness eaves and ridges and chimneys and creasings and window frames four windows shone a fading orange and two of them suddenly blinked and vanished would anyone look out of a window there and see him it did not matter he would go on down towards the stream this friendly mist would hide him it was wonderful to be in this white mist and yet not in it it was always a little way from him and nevertheless it wetted him how crisp the frosted ground was but if one kicked through the surface it was soft overhead the blueness increased and there was now a rippled patch of pink cloud he went deeper and deeper into the soft mist presently he was walking on long wet shrivelled grass when he turned presently to look back at the asylum it had altogether disappeared what was that was it something talking or was it the beating heart of some busy elfin machine listen peer think it was the stream now everything was plain and easy he walked beside the stream near at hand trees became visible attendant trees with mist about their waists white clad sentinel trees the dry grass was ranker here and what was this like a denser lower mist within the mist this was the wall beyond that wall almost within shouting distance now the friends and believers would be waiting how discreet they were not a murmur not a footfall for a long time sargon stood motionless beside the culvert beneath the wall at last he roused himself and by a great effort and with the help of the ivy he scrambled to the top of the wall no one waited some dim four footed thing bolted from the frost bitten weeds below and then there was silence there was no sign of watchers nor helpers no matter if it was gods will they would come he sat very still he did not feel deserted nor alone he was not in the least dismayed he felt that the power who had called him into being was all about him slowly steadily the light grew brighter a little cloud like a floating feather caught fire very suddenly and then another a great beam of light like the beam of a searchlight only very much broader appeared slanting to the north then above a whaleback of distant downland came a knife edge of dazzling light an effulgence like a curved knife like a cap like a dome a quivering blazing fire birth and then torn clear of the hill and round and red the november sun had risen it was full daylight and the mist had dissolved away the roofs of the asylum buildings were now visible over the crest divested of all magic bleak and commonplace from some point in that direction a dog was barking it was strange that there should be no one here that young man whose name he had never known had made it very plain that there were friends in waiting here perhaps they had gone away and would come back presently still it did not matter now very much at any rate he had seen a sunrise of almost incredible beauty how good a thing the sun was the thing of all visible things that was most like god perhaps there were no helpers here at all perhaps he had misunderstood he was stupid he knew he misunderstood more and more perhaps presently keepers would come in search of him and take him back to the asylum it might be so that things were decreed he would not let it distress him life was full of trials and disappointments he was feeling now very cold throughout his substance and tired so that all his energy was gone with a start he became aware that there was a man standing up the slope that overlooked the asylum grounds he felt a thrill of renewed vitality this man was standing quite still looking down at the asylum it might be one of the staff looking for him or one of the promised helpers one of the promised helpers sargon was not so calm and apathetic as he had supposed he was atremble from head to foot he was not shivering with cold but trembling with excitement he felt he must end this doubt one way or the other could he catch this mans eye he waved a hand then he drew a dirty little pocket handkerchief from his dressing gown pocket and began to wave it now now it seemed the man was looking straight down at sargon he was moving towards sargon slowly as if incredulous then he was signalling and running sargon sat quite still he knew all along they would come for him it was bobby close at hand now and crying out sargon it is you sargon sargon did not wait for him he turned about and scrambled and dropped off the wall they clasped hands you have come to fetch me i was in despair i didnt dream you understood me im all amazed let me think what are we to do this is splendid my motor bicycle is in the inn nuisance that yes come along i must hide you somewhere and fetch it then we will get away i didnt think youd have no clothes clothes wont show much cold may be cold ill get a rug theres a rug in the side car he led the way back up the slope glancing ever and again at the asylum fields sargon trotted beside him calmly confident in god and bobby with the limitless docility of one who trusts his servant bobbys mind was fresh and bright that morning he had wandered out to the asylum simply because he could lie in bed in a fever of regrets no longer his extreme luck in encountering sargon had restored all his confidence in himself and in the propitiousness of things he made his plans quickly and with decision it would be impossible to take sargon back to the inn and give him coffee so soon as he was missed they would surely go to the village and every one would note this queer little figure with its dressing gown and slippers and scarred ankles he must get the little man into hiding somewhere close at hand in that small beech wood just over the next crest pity he was so scantily clad then the motor bicycle must be fetched as quickly as possible sargon was absolutely trustful and obedient it is cold i know said bobby but unavoidable i wish there were not so many wet dead leaves only be quick and fetch help said sargon dont stir from here said bobby it was not the most perfect hiding place in the world a ditch a clump of holly on the edge of a bare beech wood but it was all that downland was likely to provide so long said bobby and set off at a smart trot for the inn and the motor bicycle he arrived flushed dishevelled and out of breath and found the inn suspicious and reluctant when he announced that he wanted his bill instantly refused any breakfast but a cup of tea and a chunk of bread and butter and set about packing his little roll there seemed endless things to do taking an interminable time to cap a score of irritating delays the inn was short of change and had to send out to the village shop billys motor bicycle always a temperamental creature gave great trouble with its kick starter and meanwhile sargon was shivering amidst the mud and dead leaves under the dripping trees or worse being recaptured and led back into captivity it was nearly eight before bobby came back along the cart track into sight of the little beech wood and his heart jumped when he saw two heavy looking men advancing towards him he knew them for asylum men at once they had the unmistakable flavour of subaltern authority that distinguishes prison warders ex policemen time keepers and the keepers of the insane as he throbbed near them they came into the middle of the road and made signs for him to stop hell said bobby and pulled up they came alongside and without evident hostility excuse me sir said one and bobby felt better that large place you see there sir is cummerdown asylum perhaps you know it sir no which is the asylum all of it bobby felt he was being really clever and his spirits rose yesir damn great place said bobby weve got one of our inmates astray this morning harmless little man he is and we ventured to stop you and ask you if youve seen him bobby had an inspiration i believe i have was he in a sort of brown robe and slippers with nothing on his head thats im sir where did you see him bobby turned round and pointed in the direction from which he had come he was making off along the edge of a field he said i saw him not oh not five minutes ago mile or a bit more away from here running he was along a hedge to the right left i mean near a chestnut plantation thats im all right jim where did you say sir bobbys brilliance increased if one of you will sit behind me and the other get into this contraption bit of a load but we can manage it ill run you back to the very place right away and without more ado he set about turning round thats a real help sir said jim dont mention it said bobby bobby was now at the top of his form he loaded them in with helpful words even the smaller of the two was a tight fit for the side car and the other sat like a sack on the luggage carrier he took them back a mile and a half until he found the suitable hedge by the chestnut tree he unloaded them carefully received their hearty but hasty thanks with a generous gesture and sent them off at a smart trot across the fields he cant have a miles start he said and he wasnt going particularly fast sort of limping thats im said jim bobby kissed his hand to their retreating backs thats you said bobby god help you both and cleanse your hearts and now for sargon he buzzed back to the place where he had left sargon turned his machine round again and then looked towards the corner of the wood by the holly clump where the little man ought to have been waiting but there was no sign of a peeping head queer said bobby and ran up to the place where he had left sargon crouching in the ditch not a sign was there of him bobby looked about him baffled and frightened after all after everything could things go wrong now sargon he called and then louder sargon not a sound not a rustle came in reply hes hidden can he have crawled away and fainted exhausted perhaps fear touched bobby with a chilly finger had he mistaken the place perhaps had sargon strayed away in spite of his promise or crept back numbed and wretched to the warmth and shelter of the asylum bobby followed the ditch down to the corner of the wood and beyond the corner in the ditch to the right he suddenly beheld a little old woman a little old woman sitting bunched in a heap on a litter of dry straw and fast asleep she was wearing a battered black straw hat adorned with a broken black feather a small black jacket bodice a sack was drawn over her feet and a second sack thrown shawlwise over her shoulders she was so crumpled up her face was hidden all except one bright red ear and behind her on the bank lay two large stakes tied in the form of a cross to bobby she was the most astonishing of apparitions it was disconcerting enough to discover sargon gone it was still more amazing to find him so oddly replaced bobby stood hesitating for the better part of a minute should he wake the old thing up and ask her about sargon or should he steal away nothing he decided would be lost by asking he went close up to her and coughed excuse me madam he said the sleeper did not awake bobby rustled among the leaves coughed louder and asked to be excused again the sleeper muttered a choking snore woke with a start looked up and revealed the face of sargon he stared at bobby without recognition for a moment and then gave way to an enormous yawn while he yawned his blue eyes gathered intelligence and understanding i was so cold he said i took these things from the scarecrow and the straw was nice and dry to sit on shall we put it all back oh glorious idea cried bobby with all his spirits restored it makes an honest woman of you can you walk in that sack no we havent time to put it back shake it down off your legs and bring it with you the side car isnt two hundred yards away youll be able to put it on again then this is magnificent this is wonderful certainly we wont put it back off well go and when weve a good ten miles between us and the asylum well stop and get some hot coffee and something to eat hot coffee said sargon brightening visibly and bacon and eggs hot coffee and bacon and eggs said bobby the coffee there is beastly said sargon bobby helped sargon into the side car and raised the hood over him erected the wind screen and so packed him away he became a quite passable aunt dimly seen and in another minute bobby had kicked the engine into an impatient fuss and was in the saddle he felt himself now the cleverest fellow that ever stole a lunatic not that it wasnt the easiest thing in the world to get a lunatic away if you knew how they quivered and jolted along the little minor road and so on to the smooth main highway to ashford and folkestone the accelerator was urged to do its best good bye cummerdown sang bobby cummerdown hill good bye the little old motor bike was going beautifully they got their breakfast at an inn near a post office a mile or so beyond offham bobby left sargon dozing in the side car and went to send a telegram to dymchurch announcing his coming there was some delay in the post office as the post mistress had mislaid her spectacles bobby returned to find the breakfast nearly ready and to assist sargon out of his sack and into the little room of the inn the landlord was a short stout man with a grave observant face he watched this emergence of sargon and his progress to a chair behind the little white tablecloth with silent wonder then for a time he hid then he came back into the little room where the table was set for some moments he stood regarding sargon umph he said at last and turned about and went slowly into his kitchen where some sort of wife seemed to be cooking things es a rummun bobby heard him remark and so was prepared for discussion the ham and eggs and coffee were served and received with eagerness the landlord stood over them scrutinizing their reception of his provisions haint ad no breakfast then he said having it now said bobby helping himself to mustard come far said the landlord after a thoughtful pause fairly said bobby with judgment going far the landlord tried so so said bobby the landlord rallied his forces for a great effort we get some rummy customers here at times he said you must attract them said bobby the landlord could make nothing of that he turned about and said umph meaningly umph said bobby just saturating it with meaning the landlord made a cunning attempt as they were departing hope you enjoyed your breakfast he said i dont know rightly whether its a lady or a gentleman you got with you still bobbys mercurial temperament was far too high just then its hermaphrodite he said in a confidential whisper and left the landlord with that but when they had gone a few miles further he told sargon he had decided to buy him some socks and a jacket and trousers at the next shop they saw as it is he said you are ambiguous and then well put that hat and jacket and the sacking by the wayside for anyone who wants to use them and ill have to send another telegram i made a mistake bobbys mental state became more febrile as the day wore on he developed a wonderfully circumstantial lie about a cottage and a fire and how his friend had only escaped with just a few articles of clothing hastily put on everything else said bobby practically incinerated they were going down to take refuge with a variable relation a brother an uncle a maiden aunt as the day progressed the circumstances of the fire became richer and more remarkable and the particulars of the escape more definitely thrilling bobby told such lies with great sincerity and gravity they were a form of freedom from reality sargon himself said very little for him this adventure was a severer endurance test than bobby realized at the time for the most part he was either cramped up and boxed in under the hood and wind screen and being jolted and jumped along the hard high road or he was hastily changing some garment by the roadside or he was sitting still in the side car taking refreshment and being lucidly but perplexingly and usually quite unnecessarily explained mrs plumer of maresett cottage dymchurch was an anxious widow woman she had a kind serviceable heart but it was troubled about many things she saved and eked out almost too much she let most of her rooms in the summer and some even in the winter but she hated to think of the things careless lodgers might do to her furniture she liked everything to be in order and lodgers better looking and better behaved than mrs pringles lodgers or mrs mackinders lodgers she had taken a fancy to bobby because he had fitted in nicely when she had had only one room to spare and because he had shaved in cold water instead of calling down as every other man lodger did there was no bell in that room for hot also he talked agreeably when he came in and out and didnt want more at meals she was very pleased when he wrote to take her downstairs living room and two bedrooms for himself and a friend for a fortnight there were few people in dymchurch who got lets in november they might come any time after tuesday she told mrs pringle and mrs mackinder that she was expecting two young gentlemen and left them to suppose that her guests might stay on indefinitely on wednesday she was excited and rather perplexed by a series of telegrams from bobby the first said plainly and distinctly arriving with aunt about four roothing that disappointed her she would have infinitely preferred two gentlemen but within an hour came another wire and this said error in telegram not aunt uncle sorry roothing now what was one to make of that presently the child from the post office was back again uncle catching cold fire hot water bottles whisky the next sensational telegram announced a delay tyre trouble not so soon later roothing then came sixish almost certain good fire please roothing its very good of him said mrs plumer to keep me informed like this but i hope the old gentleman wont be fussy the fire in the downstairs sitting room was burning brightly at six there was a kettle on the hob there were not only tea things but whisky sugar glasses and a lemon on the table and a hot water bottle in both the beds upstairs when the fugitives arrived mrs plumers first feelings at the sight of sargon were feelings of disappointment she had allowed her mind to run away with the idea of a warm comfortable uncle with at most a whisky drinking cold an uncle who would be if not absolutely golden at least gilt edged she had if anything exaggerated her memories of mr roothings geniality so soon as she held open her door at the roar and toot of the motor bicycle she saw that her anticipations would have to be modified again things were rather indistinct in the deepening twilight but she could see that bobby wasnt wearing the full and proper leather costume with gauntlets and goggles complete that a real young gentleman would have worn on such an occasion and which mrs pringle and mrs mackinder would have respected and that the shape he was extracting from the side car was not the shape of a properly expanded uncle it looked much more like a large hen taken out of a small basket on market day as sargon came into the light of the living room mrs plumers disillusionment deepened and decreased she had rarely seen so strange and weather beaten an outcast his blue eyes stared pitifully out of a pale face his hair beneath an unsuitable black felt hat was greatly disordered he was clad chiefly in an excessive pair of trousers which he clutched nervously to keep up very full they were with his dressing gown tails his too ample white socks fell like gaiters over his old felt slippers and betrayed his distressful ankles he looked afraid he stared at her almost as though he anticipated an unfriendly reaction and bobby too standing beside him looked rough and travel worn and eventful and not at all the self effacing young gentleman she had remembered when bobby saw the swift play of mrs plumers expression he realized that their foothold in this pleasant restful firelit apartment was precarious happily a reserve lie he had thought of but not hitherto used came aptly to his mind isnt it a shame he said they went off with his clothes even his socks they seem to have said mrs plumer whoever they were pure hold up this side of ashford my big bag too and where did the gentleman get the clothes hes wearing she asked her tone was unpleasantly sceptical they exchanged id gone back along the road to see if i could see anything of the tyre pump id dropped never thinking anything of the sort was possible on an english high road come and sit by the fire uncle and when i came back theyd gone and there he was as you see him imagine my astonishment and you never sent a telegram about it said mrs plumer too near home id have got here first anyhow well weve had adventures enough to day anyhow ive never known such a journey thank heaven weve had our tea i think the best place for uncle is bed until we can arrange some clothes for him what do you think mrs plumer after hes had a good wash said mrs plumer she was still doubtful but a sort of kindliness was struggling to the surface werent you afraid when they jumped out on you sir she asked sargon directly his blue eyes sought bobbys for instructions it was a great shock to him said bobby a great shock hes hardly got over it yet hardly got over it yet said sargon in confirmation took all your clothes off they did its shameful said mrs plumer and you with a cold coming on well get him to bed of course if youve got anything for us to eat we might have it first here perhaps just a bit of toasted cheese or welsh rarebit or something of that sort and a good hot grog eh uncle dont want much to eat said sargon no i havent forgotten that welsh rarebit you made for me mrs plumer after i got caught in the rain on the way from hythe well i daresay i could get you a welsh rarebit said mrs plumer softening visibly famous said bobby make a new man of him and meanwhile ill run the old bike round to the shed if i may put it in the shed youll be all right here uncle its safe every ones safe with mrs plumer said bobby and held the door open for her to precede him out of the room ill tell you about him to morrow morning he said to her confidentially in the passage hes a wonderful man hes all right asked mrs plumer right as can be he looks that distraught hes a poet said bobby besides playing on the violin and so satisfied her completely but he did not feel that he had brought the wonderful day to a completely successful end until he had got sargon washed and brushed and tucked up cosily in mrs plumers bright little best bedroom now were anchored he said he went into his own room and sat down for a time to invent things about his uncle in case mrs plumer was desirous of more explicit information when he went downstairs he decided to say hes eccentric in an impressive elucidatory way and very shy his uncle he would explain was suffering from overwork due to writing an heroic poem about the prince of wales journey round the world he wanted a complete rest and sea air the more he stayed in bed and indoors the better he filled in a few useful details of this story sat for a little while twiddling the toes of his boots and then got up and went downstairs he felt sure he could carry it off all right with mrs plumer he found her waiting for him the chief difficulty he encountered was her conviction that the police ought to be told of the highway robbery this side of ashford at once hm said bobby and for a moment he was at a loss then he decided ive done that already he said but when i telephoned from an automobile association box to the ashford police it will be in their district you know not in romney marsh sharp fellows the ashford police i had to describe the lost clothes and everything they dont let much get by them she took it beautifully after that everything was easy the next morning found sargon developing an evil cold in his throat and chest his chest was painful and he was feverish red cheeked bright eyed and short of breath bobby did not care to consult a doctor he believed that all doctors constituted a league for the re incarceration of escaped lunatics he imagined secret notices about escapes being circulated throughout the profession he motored to hythe and got ammoniated quinine several sorts of voice jujube two iodine preparations for the chest and suchlike trifles that the chemist recommended when he returned about midday the patient looked better and seemed in less pain after bobby had administered quinine and rubbed his chest and made a generally curative fuss he was able and disposed to talk the pillow all right said bobby perfect you ought to doze for a bit now yes sargon thought i shall not have to go back to that place again i hope not the flushed face became very earnest promise me not promise me not i couldnt endure it no need to be anxious said bobby here you are quite safe and there will be no need to get into that side car again none never no it bumped horribly where is christina alberta bobby did not answer for a moment or so perhaps i ought to explain i do not know who christina alberta is i took you out of the asylum because i do not believe you are mad but i know nothing of your family i know nothing about your circumstances at all i just couldnt bear the thought of you in an asylum sargon lay in silence for a little while with his blue eyes on bobbys face you were sorry for me i liked you from the very first moment i saw you in midgard street liked me but you believed i was sargon king of kings practically said bobby you didnt neither i suppose did i the vague blue eyes left bobbys face and stared out of the window at the sky i have been very much confused in my mind said sargon even now i am not clear but i realize i am confused christina alberta is my daughter the princess royal i called her in sumeria she is a very dear bold girl she is all i have i left her and came away from her and i must have distressed her greatly then she may not know where you have been she may be looking for me where is she i have been trying to remember it was in a studio somewhere with peculiar pictures i never liked those pictures a studio in a mew it had a name but i cannot remember its name it is stupid of me probably christina alberta is there with her friends still wondering what has become of me at the at the place they told me your name was preemby albert edward preemby i wonder he lay reflecting for a time i remember that for a long time i thought i was albert edward preemby a small creature a little man living a mean life in a laundry a laundry with large blue vans the swastika you cannot imagine what a small insignificant life it was that this preemby led and then suddenly i thought i could not possibly be preemby and also an immortal soul either there was no preemby i thought or there was no god there could not possibly be both it perplexed and worried me very much because there i was preemby i am not good at thinking all my thinking goes off into a kind of dreaming and then when there came evidence that seemed satisfactory perhaps i jumped at what i was told but sargon must have been a great king a very great king and i am small and weak and not very intelligent when the keepers and attendants bullied me and ill treated me i did not behave as a great king should have behaved and when i saw them doing evil things to other other patients i did not interfere yet all the time i think i am something different from the albert edward preemby i used to be something more and something better but it leaves me confused to think who i am and i am very tired perhaps when i have rested a day or two i may be better able to think about these things the faded voice died away the blue eyes remained staring tranquilly at the sky bobby said nothing for a little while then he remarked i have seen men ill treated and then and i am not so slight as you are he said no more it did not seem as though sargon had heard him bobby stood up you must rest you are perfectly safe here if we can remain unnoted here for two weeks then it will be impossible ever to send you back to that place again are you comfortable it is a beautiful bed said sargon but beautiful though the bed was it was not sufficient to arrest the trouble in sargons aching chest he seemed very exhausted that evening in the night he began coughing he coughed so distressingly that bobby went in to him in the morning he was spiritless and did not want to eat bobby sat in the room downstairs working at the pile of aunt suzannah correspondence that billy had sent on to him he was half minded to appeal to tessy to come down and help with the nursing but there was no bedroom available for her mrs plumer pressed for a doctor and he put her off finally on her own responsibility she brought in a young man who was just starting a practice in the place bobby had a terrifying interview but the young doctor betrayed no suspicions on the whole he was reassuring there was congestion of the lungs but nothing worse sargon must keep very warm and take this and that no urgent need for a nurse keep him warm and give him his medicine late in the evening bobby went up to say good night and found sargon better and more talkative i have been thinking of christina alberta and i should like to see her i would like to see her and tell her things i have been thinking about her i have been thinking out all sorts of curious things perhaps i am not so much to her as she may think but chiefly i want to talk to her about a young man i dislike what was he called when i was last at lonsdale mews she danced with him lonsdale mews yes yes of course i had forgotten eight lonsdale mews lonsdale road chelsea but my mind is very confused and i do not know what i should say to her even if she came bobby wrote down the address forthwith and this christina alberta is all you have he asked all i have twenty quite a child really i ought never to have left her but there came a sort of wonder upon me as though the world was opening it made everything else seem very trivial there came a sort of wonder upon me as though the world was opening bobby wrote that down also and he sat very late before the fire in the ground floor room thinking that over and thinking over the message he would have to send to christina alberta in the morning to morrow he would have to explain himself and his extraordinary intervention in preemby affairs it was by no means plain to himself as yet and to morrow he would have to make plain to a probably very indignant young lady why her father had so caught his sympathies and fascinated his imagination as to tempt him to this escapade he found himself thrown back on self analysis he found himself scrutinizing his own motives and his own scheme of existence he knew and understood that feeling as though the world was opening so well still better did he know that feeling of dead emptiness in life out of which it arose in his own case he had thought this habitual discontent with the daily round this urgency towards something strange and grandiose was due to the dislocation of all his expectations of life by the great war that it was a subjective aspect of nervous instability but in the case of this little laundryman it could not have been the war that had sent him out a sort of emigrant from himself to find a fantastic universal kingdom it must be something more fundamental than the war accident it must be a normal disposition in men towards detachment from safety and comfort he glanced towards the pile of his aunt suzannah correspondence on the table and the next sheet of copy for wilkins weekly he had distilled therefrom he rose from his arm chair and went back to his work with his wisdom refreshed he wrote so soon as mans elementary needs are satisfied and he is sure of food clothing and shelter he comes under the sway of a greater imperative he goes out to look for trouble so that i would not discourage croydons desire to become a missionary in west africa in spite of his religious doubts and his peculiar feeling about black people such a region as sherborough island will probably supply him with a good sustained sustaining and ennobling system of troubles a white man who has once challenged the hostility of a west african secret society will have little leisure for morbid introspection he will hardly have a dull moment he stopped writing reads a little ironical he said and not quite aunt suzannah enough he reflected my mind scampers off from me at times not in the vein to day the one thing they must never feel about aunt suzannah was that she could be ironical no it wouldnt do he ran his pen through the six sentences he had just written and pushed the sheet away from him he drew another sheet towards him on which he had been composing with great difficulty a telegram to be sent next morning to preemby lonsdale mews chelsea he read over various drafts the current form ran as follows your father safe but with severe chest cold care of roothing maresett cottage dymchurch desires see you discretion very necessary return confinement fatal results best station hythe and cab could meet you hythe if wire in time but do not know you personally am tallish slender dark roothing properly considered it was all right he tried to imagine what sort of girl this christina alberta preemby would be she would be blue eyed of course and probably very fair a little taller and rounder than her father soft voiced and rather dreamy she would be timid and affectionate very kind and gentle and a little incompetent perhaps it would be well to meet her at hythe so soon as he knew which train she was coming by the cab business might be a strain on her he would have to tell her what to do to a considerable extent now he had made himself responsible for the fortunes of both these people and he liked to think that he liked to think that perhaps these might become his own people more of his own people than the malmesburys because to be frank about it with himself he was a little bit of an interpolation in the malmesbury household they liked him they were perfect dears to him but they could do without him even that little devil susan managed without him she liked him and tyrannized over him but he knew he wasnt indispensable to her here at last might be two people who couldnt do without him who might to an extraordinary extent become his people of course he would have to put on a little more appearance of strength and determination than was actually his quality he owed it to them to keep up their confidence in him so that he might be able to direct them in their difficulties he would say to her what would he say to her i have been hasty i know but i know something of the strain that is put upon the sane patient in an asylum i thought that the first thing to do was to get your father out of it it didnt occur to me that for a time he might have forgotten your address perhaps i ought to have come to you before i acted but then how was i to know there was a you until he told me of your existence in so many cases in these asylums the relatives are hostile to release it is dreadful to admit it but it is so then rather humorously and quite modestly he would describe the escape he was already forgetting the uncertainties of the visiting day conversation and the numerous accidental factors in the meeting by the culvert but all history has this knack of eliminating unnecessary detail so he would make his statement it did not occur to him that christina alberta might be the sort of person who interrupts speeches with elucidatory questions he lit a cigarette strolled about the room and came to rest standing before the fire and looking down on the glowing coals he was sure now that christina alberta was blue eyed fragile shy with a deep sweet vein of humorous fantasy hidden away in her very probably she concealed a gift for writing it would be for him perhaps to discover that and cultivate it and bring it out together they would protect sargon already more than half recovered from the intoxication of his dream they would have to soften the humiliations of his complete awakening how fortunate and as it were providential it was that he had been impelled to rescue the little man for otherwise he would never have met christina alberta never won her timid wealth of love eh but this is all damned nonsense said bobby violently and threw his cigarette into the fire this is just fancy i havent even seen the girl he lit his candle put out mrs plumers oil lamp with all the devices and precautions proper to this dangerous survival from the dark ages and went up to bed he stopped and listened outside sargons door the patient was asleep and breathing rather noisily ever and again choking with a little cough i wish the weather had kept warmer said bobby when he opened his own bedroom door the flame of his candle writhed and flared horizontally the curtains streamed into the room and a sheet of paper flapped on the dressing table he put down the candle and went to shut the window the wind was rising and there was a little patter of raindrops on the pane chapter the third the last phase it was part of the general unsatisfactoriness of bobbys make up that he was acutely responsive to meteorological conditions that late indian summer was over now and the heavens and the earth and the air between began to push hustle wet chill darken distress and bully him jumbled grey clouds came hurrying across dymchurch from dungeness and the atlantic torn angular outstretched clouds with malicious expressions like witches and warlocks emitting fierce squirts of rain under their skirts came the waves in long rolling regiments threatening from afar breaking into premature handfuls of foam gathering force at last towering up for a last culminating thud against the sea wall and spouting heavenward in white fountains of suddy water face it man said bobby face it its only nature brace up to it think of this poor girl he forced himself to do a mornings walk along the top of the sea wall with his wet trousers flapping against his legs like flags against their staves glorious wind he told sargon when he went in to see him but i wish there was a gleam of sun have you any news from christina alberta asked sargon theres hardly time yet for a reply to my wire but shell surely come said bobby and went downstairs to dry his legs at the fire he did not expect a summons to hythe to meet the young lady very much before half past twelve meanwhile he went out to the shed and assured himself that the motor bicycle and side car were in perfect order for a hasty journey half past twelve came one half past one he had some lunch he became very restless and rose and looked out of the window frequently to see if the messenger girl was coming with christina albertas telegram about two a large silent luxurious looking hired daimler car appeared outside and stopped at mrs plumers gate a hatless bobbed head appeared at the window and exchanged remarks with the driver who descended and opened the door the car emitted a handsome and determined young woman of advanced appearance hatless and short skirted and a lean dark prosperous looking man of thirty eight or forty in blue serge and a grey felt hat the man opened the gate for the girl and she surveyed the house as she advanced bobby realized that christina alberta had not kept her promise to be blue eyed and fragile she had betrayed him yet for all her treachery he had built up a sense of personal relationship with her that gripped him still he watched her approach with an excitement he found difficult to control he wondered who the devil the dark man was a cousin perhaps she discovered bobby watching her from the window and their eyes met bobby with an instinct that is given to young people for such occasions perceived that he interested christina alberta extremely he parleyed with her and devizes in mrs plumers little downstairs room he spoke chiefly to her devizes he treated as a secondary figure a voice at her elbow hes got a nasty cold on his chest he said hes been asking for miss preemby christina alberta said christina alberta christina alberta a lot but it was only last night i could get the address out of him hed forgotten it before weve been here over a day he caught the cold coming here how did you come here devizes threw in motor bicycle said bobby but there was a lot of waiting about before we could get away and it was a cold raw morning and he had just his nightgown and dressing gown and slippers so hard to foresee everything but how did you come to be rescuing him bobby smiled at devizes somebody had to be rescuing him he turned to christina alberta again couldnt bear the thought of his being under lock and key he took a room you see in the place where i lodged and there was something innocent and delightful about him ive a weakness a sympathy perhaps with absurdity you ought to go up to him and see him yes wed better look at him said devizes who the devil was this fellow bobby asserted himself christina alberta first i think he took christina alberta up to her daddy and closed the door on a warm embrace and now mr de vezes or whatever you are he said to himself on the staircase where do you come in he descended and found devizes standing very irritatingly upon his hearthrug before his fire as he stood there a remote resemblance to christina alberta was perceptible bobby had an incoherent recognition of the fact that in some obscure way devizes was responsible for christina albertas failure to produce blue eyes he was a little slow in saying what he intended to say and devizes was able to take the initiative forgive my blunt impertinence he said but may i ask who you are im a writer said bobby refraining from any glance at the accumulation of aunt suzannah material upon the side table youve finished lunch asked devizes in a disregarded parenthesis may i ask the same question of you said bobby and how it is you come to be connected with the preembys im a blood relation said devizes considering it on the mothers side a sort of cousin and i happen to be a nervous and mental specialist thats why ive been brought in to day i see said bobby youve got no intention of putting him back none at all were not antagonists mr roothing were on the same side you did well to get him out we were trying to do the same thing by less original methods were very grateful to you the lunacy laws are rather a clumsy and indiscriminating machine but as you probably know if he keeps clear of them for fourteen days theyll have to begin with him all over again he renews his sanity were allies in that weve got to know each other better your intervention most surprising strikes me as being at once eccentric and courageous i wish youd tell me more about it how you met him how they got hold of him and what set you thinking of an escape hm said bobby and came and asserted his right to half the hearthrug he had thought of the way in which he could tell this story to christina alberta the original christina alberta with the blue eyes he felt that that version needed considerable revision indeed possibly even a complete rearrangement for the present hearer he was by no means sure he wanted to tell it to the present hearer the man was a doctor and a mental specialist and a distant relation and he was for keeping sargon out of an asylum and that was all to the good but it still lingered in bobbys mind that he was an interloper nevertheless he made way for bobby quite civilly on the hearthrug and his manner was attentive and respectful bobby embarked upon a description of sargons first appearance in midgard street devizes showed himself alert and intelligent he grasped the significance of sargons projected visit to the dome of saint pauls at once ive no doubt he did it said devizes neither have i said bobby though ive not asked him about it yet they pieced together the probable story of the calling of the disciples before billy and bobby had come upon the procession its touching said devizes and immense bobby approved these words you see how he got me said bobby a distinct flavour of friendliness for devizes crept by imperceptible degrees into bobbys mind difficulties that had seemed to threaten his explanation vanished this man he perceived could understand anything a fellow did devizes made him feel that the extraction of sargon from cummerdown by a perfect stranger was the most simple and natural thing to do imaginable bobby warmed to his story his sense of humour took heart of grace and he became frank and amusing about his difficulties on the visiting day as he was telling of the foxy faced deaf mute christina alberta came back again into the downstairs room he takes me as a matter of course she said he seems weak and drowsy and his chest is bad she spoke more definitely to devizes i think you ought to overhaul him there is a doctor in attendance he asked bobby bobby explained devizes considered was sargon dozing yes then let him doze for a bit bobby working now a little more consciously for effect went on with his story christina alberta regarded him with manifest approval by tea time bobby had adjusted his mind to the existence of devizes and the unexpectedness of christina alberta all that carried over from his state of expectation was the idea that his relations with christina alberta were to be very profound and intimate he still believed that hidden away in her somewhere there must be a blue eyed yielding really feminine person but it was very deeply hidden meanwhile the superimposed disguise struck him as agreeable alert humorous and friendly devizes too he saw more and more as a strong capable understanding personality he had seen devizes examining sargon and it was clever confidence provoking doctoring sargons lungs he said were badly congested especially on the left side he was on the edge of pneumonia and without much vitality to fight it he ought to be kept in a warmer less draughty room with a night nurse available mrs plumer had no room for a nurse and not an hour away by automobile was paul lambones excessively comfortable week end cottage at udimore a little masterly telephoning and telegraphing and the cottage was available fires were alight in the best bedroom a trained nurse was on her way to it and it was all settled for sargon warmly wrapped up and fortified with hot water bottles to go thither bobby found himself a mere accessory in this new system of things he was to follow next day to udimore on his motor bicycle for there would be room for all of them in paul lambones cottage apparently paul lambones conception of a simple cottage in the wilderness involved a housekeeper several servants and four or five visitors rooms this fellow devizes carried out all his arrangements with a smooth competence that gave bobby no scope for self assertion sargon and christina alberta and devizes would depart at five and get to udimore by six by which time the nurse would be installed then devizes would go back to london and get there in time to dress for a dinner he had to attend on saturday morning he would be busy in london and then he would come back to udimore and see if sargon was recovered enough for the beginnings of his mental treatment perhaps the unknown paul lambone would be there too he was a lazy person bobby gathered hed have to be brought down by devizes bobby was to stay at udimore for some days he made modest protestations no youre in it now said devizes cheerfully and glanced at christina alberta youre in for sargon like the rest of us bring your work with you yes do come said christina alberta the only reason bobby had for resisting the invitation was that it attracted him so much this cottage at udimore which struck bobby as being a really very pretty and comfortable modern house and these three people christina alberta devizes and paul lambone who now grouped themselves round sargon exercised his mind in a quite extraordinary way they struck him as being novel and definite to a degree hed never met in anyone before and even the house was fresh and decisive in its broad white grace like no house that had ever before held his attention it made most of the other houses he had ever observed seem accidental and aggregatory and second hand and wandering in their purpose but this house was the work of a clever young architect who had considered paul lambone intelligently and its white rough cast walls sat comfortably on the hill side and looked with an honest entirely detached admiration at rye and across the marsh to winchelsea and the remote blue sea and it had seats and arbours and a gazebo for sitting about in and up hill was a walled garden with broad paths up which you looked from the back of the house through lead paned windows you could watch the sunset from a number of excellent points of view but it did not shine upon any room to weary and blind you there was a kind wall to shelter hollyhocks and delphiniums from the south west wind and to bear a plum or so and a pear and a fig tree downstairs was mainly one great rambling room with a dining recess in one corner and the power of opening itself out into a loggia and with conversational centres about fire places or windows as the season might require but there were several little studies about the house in which one could be shut off and write bookshelves grew in convenient corners and the house was everywhere mysteriously warm from unseen and scarce suspected radiators the house was so like paul lambone and paul lambone so much a part of his house that he seemed to be really no more than its voice and its eyes paul lambone was the first successful writer bobby had ever met bobby knew various needy young writers tadpole writers insecure writers but this was the first completely grown up and established and massively adult writer he had ever known the man struck bobby as being stupendously secure and free and prosperous and the remarkable thing was that he was in no way a great writer no dickens nor scott nor hardy his work wasnt after all in bobbys opinion anything so very remotely above bobbys own efforts a certain terseness he had at times a certain penetration those were the chief differences in bobbys imagination the literary and artistic life had hitherto had an unavoidable flavour of casual adventure glorious achievements maddening difficulties wild delights and tragic unhappinesses swift savage goldsmith the carlyles balzac dumas edgar allan poe these had been his types but this new bright house was as sound and comfortable as any country house and lambone sat in it with as safe a dignity as though he was a provincial banker or a mine owner or the senior member of some widespread firm of solicitors no fears of losing his job or writing himself out oppressed him he said and did exactly what he thought proper and the policeman saluted him as he passed if this sort of thing could spring from the book of everyday wisdom and pauls amiable novels what hitherto unsuspected possibilities of accumulation and ease and security and helpfulness might there not be in aunt suzannahs kindly responsiveness it had never before seemed credible to bobby that a day might come when he would be secure and his own master able to refuse limitations himself and to release other people from limitations all bobbys life hitherto had been a matter of direction and eminent necessity he had been sent to school and sent to college he had been on the eve of being put into the position of agent upon a friendly estate when the great war had seized upon him and the rest of his generation and drilled him and sent him off to mesopotamia and after the war he had had to do something to supplement his diminished inheritance life had been so indicated and prescribed for him at every stage his parents existence had been so entirely directed by a class tradition that bobbys mind was exceptionally well prepared to be impressed by paul lambones freedoms it was curious to note how completely paul lambone arose out of the present day world and how completely he didnt belong to it he had all its advantages and so little of its standard obligations he had escaped from it with most of its gifts he had to go to no court follow no seasons make no calls and perform no functions was he exceptional in his circumstances altogether or were there a lot of people escaping as he was escaping prosperously from the old decaying social system a queer sort of new people who didnt belong bobby sat on the terrace and looked over the back of his seat at this extremely new but very sightly and comfortable cottage of lambones with this freshly arrived idea of a new sort of people getting loose in the world and living unrelated to the old order of things and shaping out new ways of living very active in his mind this house seemed to embody that idea it was new and novel but not a bit apologetic nor rebellious it was just breaking out like a new fashion it was just arising like a new century he had always assumed that revolutions came from below through the rage of the excluded and the disinherited he had thought every one took that for granted but suppose revolutions were merely smashes up that hadnt very much to do with real progress either way and that the new age dawned anywhere in the social order where people could get free enough to work out new ideas new ideas sargon was new paul lambone was new devizes new before the war there could not have been any such people they had grown out of their own past selves they were as different from pre war people as nineteenth century people had been different from eighteenth century people newest of all was this christina alberta who had effaced her blue eyed predecessor she was so direct and free in her thoughts and talk that she made bobby feel that his own mind wore a bonnet and flounces he had gone for two walks with her once to brede and once to rye and he liked her tremendously whether he was in love with her he didnt yet know falling in love with her for anyone was evidently going to be a quite unconventional untested and difficult series of exercises nothing at all like that unborn normal affair with the non existent blue eyed girl she seemed to like him and particularly the way his hair grew on his head she had mentioned it twice and ruffled it once a queer aspect of the situation was the riddle of how she and sargon and himself came to be the guests of paul lambone with devizes in attendance it was just a part of paul lambones freedom from prescription that he should be able to give sanctuary to sargon and assemble this odd unconventional week end party but bobby had a sense of hidden links and missing clues devizes was a natural enough visitor of course he was manifestly lambones close friend but their interest in sargon was stronger than bobby could imagine it ought to be he was puzzled he examined all sorts of possibilities in a gingerly fashion some impulse like his own no doubt but not quite the same lay at the bottom of this sargonism bobby had begun by feeling very hostile to devizes as an unexpected intruder on a system of relationships sufficiently interesting without him he was glad that he had to go to london for friday and not particularly pleased by his return on saturday then he found his feelings changing to a curious respect mingled with a defensive element that was almost like fear devizes was more aware of you than lambone he looked at you his mind came at you it had the habit of coming at people he was more actively and aggressively interested in things than lambone and more self forgetful lambone observed enough to make bright comments devizes made penetrating observations bobby often felt encumbered with himself most people he thought were encumbered with themselves but devizes to a conspicuous degree wasnt he was a man of science a man of scientific habits bobby had known one or two scientific men before rather wrapped away from ordinary things but the interest that wrapped them was something that wrapped them away from oneself one had been concerned chiefly with stresses in glass and another with the eggs of echinoderms you always seemed to be looking at the backs of these fellows heads and smiling at their immense preoccupation but this man devizes was wrapped up in the motives and thoughts of people he didnt look away from you he looked into you that grew upon bobbys consciousness devizes eye lacked delicacy he had come down for the week end chiefly to deal with sargon he went up and had long talks to sargon he was treating sargon he didnt go up and talk to sargon as man to man as bobby would have done he went up to a sort of mental jiu jitsu with sargon to exercise him and push him about into new attitudes devizes was formidable enough in himself but far more formidable as a portent he had all the appearance of being a precursor the most vigorous precursor they were all precursors of a new type of human relationships relationships without delicate reservations without rich accumulations of feeling behind emotions avoided and things unsaid so it seemed to bobby who didnt for a moment suspect how much these people were avoiding and suppressing christina albertas thoughts and speech seemed to him to be moving about without a stitch on like the people in some horrible utopia by wells he compared the vast impalpable network of understanding he and tessy had woven between each other new people he whispered and looked paul lambones new house in the face to him they were stupendously new an immense discovery the war had overstrained him he realized and left him too tired for a time to see new things he had been one of the vast multitude of those who had come out of the war in the expectation of a trite and obvious old fashioned millennium and who expressed their disappointment by declaring that nothing had happened except devastation and impoverishment they were too jaded at first to observe anything else but indeed bobby now realized the european world had been travelling faster and faster since the break up of the armed peace in and here were new types new habits of thought new ideas new reactions new morals new ways of living he discovered himself in the advent of a new age a new age that was coming so fast that there hadnt been time ever to clear the forms and institutions of the old age away they werent reversed or abolished they werent overthrown they were just disregarded which was just why it was possible to get along for a year or so without noting the tremendous changes everything was undergoing new people did that apply to sargon that was sargons room the two long windows between the buttresses was sargon also an escape from the established order of relationships into novel things what was the real significance of the absurd little man with his preposterous map of the world and his still more preposterous planisphere who wanted to be lord of the earth when bobby came to talk it over with sargon it seemed to him that devizes had taken the little man completely to pieces and presented him with the disarticulated portions of himself devizes went back to london on monday he took christina alberta with him in his hired car but lambone urged bobby to stay on for a day or so to cheer up the patient lambone so far as he could discover his own intentions meant to stay on at udimore for a week or more and work bobby saw christina alberta off meditated on her for an hour then gave the rest of the morning to aunt suzannah and the afternoon to sargon and sargon who was distinctly better sat propped up by two pillows and discussed the dissected structure of himself not a bit fatigued said sargon im having a tonic now every three hours he considered his next remark for some moments before he made it who is this mr paul lambone he asked it is very hospitable for him to entertain us very hrrmp is he a friend of yours hes quite a well known writer hes a friend of christina albertas she has so many friends young people do nowadays and what is this dr devizes he is a nervous specialist and he was consulted he was consulted about the possibilities of getting you away from that place nervous specialist he is a wonderful talker most intelligent and hrrmp understanding i have a curious feeling that somewhere somewhen somehow i have met him before in this life or some other it is all quite vague and he does not seem to have any corresponding recollection no probably a coincidence of some sort bobby saw nothing in the coincidence sargon shut his eyes for a second or so we talked of my recent experiences he resumed naturally said bobby helping there has been a lot of confusion about my personality it is a trouble more frequent nowadays than it used to be most of my life i have thought that i was a person called albert edward preemby a limited person a most limited person then i had a light i began to realize that nobody could really be such a thing as that albert edward preemby i began to seek for myself i had reason too long to explain to suppose that i was sargon the first the great sumerian the founder of the first empire in the world then then came trouble you saw something of it i grasped at the sceptre one afternoon in holborn rashly most painful affair i was sent to that place yes it shook me humiliations hardship real uncleanness i doubted whether i wasnt after all just that little preemby a human rabbit my faith faltered i admit it faltered he mused painfully for some moments then he laid his hand reassuringly on bobbys wrist i am sargon he said talking to your friend devizes has cleared my mind greatly i am sargon but in a rather different sense from what i had imagined preemby was as i had supposed a mere accidental covering but the little face puckered with intellectual effort i am not exclusively sargon you you perhaps are still unawakened but you are sargon too his blood is in our veins we are co heirs it is fairly easy to understand sargon regal position naturally many wives political biological necessity offspring numerous they again positions of advantage many children next generation more like a vast expanding beam of intellectual and moral force you can prove it prove it by mathematics dr devizes and i we worked it out on a piece of paper we are all descended from sargon just as we are all descended from csar just as nearly all english and americans are descended from william the conqueror few people realize this a little arithmetic it is perfectly plain long before the christian era the blood of sargon was diffused throughout all mankind his traditions still more so we all inherit not merely from him from all the great kings from all the noble conquerors from all the brave and beautiful women all the statesmen and inventors and creators if not directly from them from their fathers and mothers all that rich wine from the past is in my veins and i thought i was just albert edward preemby and at woodford wells i went for a silly little walk nearly every afternoon with sixpence in my pocket to spend and nothing in the world to do for twenty years it seems incredible the blue eyes sought confirmation from bobby who nodded there was i walking about epping forest in a suit of clothes i never really liked a rather exaggerated golfing suit with baggy knickerbockers that my wife chose for me they seemed to get baggier every year and i was quite ignorant that i was the heir of all the ages and that the whole earth down to the centre and up to the sky was mine and yours ours i had no sense of duty to it i hadnt woke up to self respect i wasnt only sargon but all the men and women who have ever mattered on earth i was gods everlasting servant instead of which i was rather timid about horses and strange dogs and often when i saw people approaching and thought they were observing me and speaking about me i did not know what to do with my arms and legs and became quite confused about them he paused to smile at the thought of it it has been interesting to talk to your dr devizes of the absurdity of that contracted blind littleness in which i lived so long we talked of the great man i really was the great men we really were all the incorporated great men you and i the same because in the past you and i and he were one and in the future we may come together again we have just separated to take hold of things as the hand separates into thumb and fingers we talked of the time when the spirit that is in us made the first hut launched the first ship rode the first horse we could not remember those great moments as exact incidents but we recalled them generally we recalled a blazing day when a band of men went out across a sandy desert for the first time and when a man first stood upon a glacier it was slippery then i remembered watching my people heap up the earth walls of my first city we went out against the robbers of the first herds then dr devizes and i stood in imagination on a sort of quarter deck and watched our men lugging the great oars of the galley that took us to iceland and vinland we both saw we planned the great walls of china i counted our lateen sails upon our grand canal you see i have built a million wonderful temples and made an innumerable multititude of lovely sculptures paintings jewels and decorations i had forgotten it but i have and i have loved a billion loves i have indeed to bring me here we all have we talked it over your dr devizes and i i had not dreamt the millionth part of what i am when i thought i was sargon wholly and solely i still did not realize my great inheritance and my enormous destiny even now i am only beginning to see that it is preposterous to think that i who have all this past of efforts and adventures behind me should have been content to run about woodford wells in a ridiculous suit of tweeds with plus four breeches that were extremely heavy and uncomfortable they tickled me you know on hot days yet i did i did not realizing i used to go on until i could endure it no longer and then i would have to stop and scratch behind my knees of course when i called myself sargon king of kings and proposed to rule all the world i was dr devizes called it symbolizing of course everybody is really sargon king of kings and everybody ought to take hold of all the world and save it and rule it just as i have got to do he had concluded his exposition he had spread out his disarticulated parts before bobby just as devizes had returned them to him but just what are you going to do said bobby i have been thinking of that for a little while he continued to think it becomes all different he said when one realizes that one is not the only sargon i thought of being a great king a great leader with the rest of the world just following me i doubt if i ever felt quite up to a job of that sort but i couldnt see any other way of being sargon and a king now i do i did my best but even when i went to buckingham palace i realized that the thing was going to be too big for me i was telling dr devizes i told him that since he was sargon and king just as much as me and that almost anyone might become sargon and king then it wasnt a case for palaces and thrones any longer or for being proclaimed and crowned such things were as much out of date as flint implements and that the real things was to be just a kingly person and work with all the other kingly persons in the world to make the world worthy of our high descent anyone who wakes up to that becomes a kingly person we can be active kings even if we remain kings incognito one can be a laundryman like i was when i was just preemby and think of nothing but the profits and needs and vanities and fears of a little laundryman and how dull it was or one can be a king the descendant of ten thousand kings the joint heir to the inheritance of all human affairs the lord of the generations still unborn who happens to be living in exile as a laundryman he paused i agree with most of that said bobby its its attractive so far it is as plain as can be but after that the difficulties begin it isnt enough just to say you are a king you have to be a king you have to do you cant be a king and not do kingly things but its just there that dr devizes and i we werent so clear theres a lot to be thought out what is my kingly task in this frail body and what i am i am not clear yet the mere fact that i am not clear shows clearly where i have to begin i have to get clear i have to get knowledge find out about my kingdom thats reasonable i have to learn more about my great inheritance our great inheritance the history of it the possibilities of it the ways of the men who misrule it i have to learn about business and economics and money and then when i see it all plain i have to exert myself and vote and work and i have to find out what particular gifts i have and how i may best give them to our kingdom each king must glorify his particular reign with his particular gift we agreed about that so far i do not know my particular gift dr devizes says that so far as he is concerned he must work out human motives and human relationships his gift and his natural interest is for mental science he has his task meted out for him his kingly task but for me at present there isnt that much self knowledge i have to begin lower down and with broader questions i have to learn about the universe and about the history of this world empire of sargons and of all the things i have neglected in my dreams and littleness i have to go to school again to learn how to think harder i dont mind the fatigue but i am impatient when i think of all that lies before me the reading the inquiries the visits to museums and suchlike places i want to get up right away and begin i have lived so unobservant and irresponsible a life that i am puzzled how to account for the years i have spent i have mooned them away but i am glad i have awakened to my kingship before it is too late i am quite a young man still i am a little past forty but that is nothing half of that was childhood and boyhood and much of the rest inattention for all i know i may live for another forty years im not half through and they may be the best years the full years i can spend three or four just learning learning the round world i shall begin to find out politics and why men and women are servile and little minded i shall begin to realize how i can extend to those others this great liberation that has come to me i shall begin to have a political life a man who has no political life is like a rat which lives in a ship rather than like a man who navigates it then within that i shall begin to find my own proper life my particular task it is premature i think but i am very greatly drawn to the riddle of madness and asylums i do not understand why there is madness it puzzles and distresses me and dr devizes agrees with me that when a thing puzzles and distresses the mind the thing to do is to gather all the knowledge and ideas one can about it scientifically presently it ceases to distress it interests and occupies and when i was in that place i talked to some of those poor creatures i was very sorry for them i made them promises to help them when my kingdom came and now i begin to see what my kingdom is and the way in which i must enter in to possess it perhaps in good time i shall learn and spread knowledge about asylums and make things better in them so that they will not simply imprison people but help and cure them it was dr devizes idea i think or we may have worked it out together that there is a real and important purpose in madness it is a sort of simplification a removal of checks and controls and a sort of natural experiment the secret things of the mind are laid bare but then if poor souls are to suffer that sort of thing to yield knowledge for others they ought to be treated properly they ought to be cherished and made the utmost use of and not handed over to such brutes as we had i cant tell you not yet brutes they were and in their sane moments they all have sane moments these lunatics they ought to be comforted and told the queer little round face with its sprouting moustache and its pale blue eyes stared at bobby when first i saw you said sargon i did not realize in the least how things really were between us i was still wrapped up in vaingloriousness i thought i was a great prophet and teacher and king and that all the world had to obey me i thought you were going to be the first and best and nearest of my disciples but now i know better about myself and about other people they are here not to be my followers and disciples but to be my fellow kings we have to work together with all the others who are awakened for our kingdom and the great progress of mankind he went on talking rather to himself than to bobby i have always wanted to know things but now i shall have the will really to know them i shall be different now it seems incredible that a little while ago i was bothered about what i should do with my time now i am only eager to get at things and however long my time may be i know it will be full it is astonishing to me that there has been flying in my kingdom for a dozen years and i have never been in an aeroplane i must look at the world from an aeroplane and perhaps i shall need to go to india and china and suchlike strange and wonderful countries because they too are a part of my inheritance i need to know about them and jungles and wildernesses that we have to subjugate i have to see them the beasts are under us we have to cherish them or destroy them mercifully as the necessities of our kingdom may require it is a terrible thing even to be lord of a beast all the beasts wild or tame are under our dominion and there is science all the wonderful work men do in laboratories and their marvellous discoveries are our care if i do not understand i may hinder how blind i have been to the splendour of my life when i think of all these things i can hardly endure to be here in bed i am so impatient to get on with them but i suppose i must be patient with these poor wheezing lungs patient he repeated he looked at his wrist watch and it had stopped can you tell me the time at seven i ought to take some more of that excellent tonic it is working wonders in me but no dont trouble the nurse will be thinking of it it puts fresh life into me but sargon did not live forty years more nor thirty nor twenty he lived just a day under seven weeks from that conversation he stayed in bed for two days after bobby returned to london then lambone also went and he became intractable as his strength returned he bothered his nurse more and more for books he couldnt name or describe and for volumes of the encyclopdia britannica and when she declared that seven volumes of that monumental publication were surely as much as any invalid could need at one time he got up and put on his rough little dressing gown and came paddling downstairs hrrmping resolutely to the library after that he got up for three days running a fire was made in the most bookish corner of the downstairs room and screens put to keep him warm but his tonic was driving him perhaps it was too stimulating a tonic and he would not stay in his protected corner the nurse seems to have been a weak complaining character indisposed to act without authority she telephoned through to devizes in london but she did not succeed in making clear to him the gravity of sargons misbehaviour the crowning offence came when he wouldnt go to bed at seven but instead slipped out in an overcoat and a wrapper indeed but in slippers upon the terrace before the house his bare ankles and legs were exposed to the cold wind the slow moving periodic beams of light from the lighthouse upon the coast sweeping across the phantom hills under the clear starlight had drawn him out those processional lights and sirius that white splendour and the steadfast sprawling glory of orion it was a clear november night with frost in the air the nurse heard him cough and rushed out to him he was looking at sirius through lambones field glasses and she had to drag him in by main force she lost her temper there was an ungracious struggle the next day he was in no state to leave his bed yet he tossed about and exposed his inflamed chest in feeble attempts to read i know nothing he complained for a while he got better again and then it is highly probable that he went to his open window in the night and sat for a long time wondering at the stars after that came a relapse and a week or so of struggle and then after a phase of delirium came great weakness and then one night death he was quite alone when he died bobby had not expected the death at all he heard of it from christina alberta with great astonishment he had been told nothing of sargon being worse nor of his misbehaviour he had been thinking of him rather enviously as growing steadily stronger and better and gratifying day by day a happy and expanding curiosity he had looked forward presently to another talk and another phase in this odd belated adolescence it was as though an interesting story had come to an abrupt end in the middle as though all its concluding chapters had been torn out rudely and unreasonably this mood of frustrated sympathy lasted over the cremation of sargon at golders green bobby went to that queer ceremony he arrived late with billy the coffin that held the little body stood ready to glide into the furnace the church of england burial service had already begun there were very few people in the chapel christina alberta in the black she had worn for her mother was in the front seat as chief mourner between paul lambone and devizes behind her with an air of earnest support were harold and fay crumb astonishingly in deep mourning and following the service meticulously in two prayer books an unpleasant looking individual with a very long pock marked sheeps face small eyes and habitual looking blacks turned round and stared at bobby as he came in he was accompanied by a very large blonde lady who seemed to have slept in her mourning under a bed relations of the deceased the air of relationship was unmistakable behind a young woman and two detached old ladies seemed to be indulging a simple propensity for funeral services at large they completed the congregation christina alberta looked unusually small and overshadowed by her two odd men friends it was a grey day outside and the general effect of the gathering was thin and scattered and damp and chilly the organ was playing as bobby came in and he thought he had never heard a less musical organ the service as it went on sounded more and more trite and theological and insincere what an old second hand damp mackintosh the church of england is thought bobby for a striving soul to wear but then what can any religion in the world really be in the face of normal death theologically one should rejoice when a good man dies but none of these religions had had the pluck to brazen it out to that extent none can get rid of the effect of confrontation with a blank amazing interrogation was there anything within that coffin there that heard or cared a jot for those sombre mummeries bobbys thoughts converged upon that still thing within the coffin the little face would be wearing a waxen unaccustomed dignity the round preposterously innocent blue eyes would be closed and a little sunken where were those thoughts and hopes now that bobby had listened to a few weeks since sargon had talked of flying of visiting india and china of doing noble work in the world he had said that half his life still lay before him he had seemed to be opening like a flower on the first sunny morning of a belated spring and it was all delusion the door of death that had slammed upon him was already closing then surely those hopes had been life in them if in anything was something of the life that lives and cannot die but was it yonder no that in the coffin there was no more than a photographic impression a cast garment the parings of a nail there was more of sargon now in bobbys brain alone than in that coffin but sargon where was he where were those dreams and desires bobby became aware of the voice of the officiating clergyman driving high like a flying bird over the welter of his thoughts but some men will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened unless it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not the body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or any other grain but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him but to every seed its own body queer tortuous ingenious fellow that paul thought bobby now what exactly was he driving at there queer fellow bad manners too with his thou fool a rather strained analogy this about the seed sown in corruption after all a seed was the cleanest most living bit of vegetable matter you could have it had to be sown in clean mould growing plants you manured perhaps but not seed boxes but there was a queer insistence in the discourse of the difference the discontinuity of the new life what was to come was to be altogether different from what was sown bobby had never noted that before never noted how plainly the apostle insisted that no body no earthly sort of body no personality ever came back the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory what was the drift of that was it translated properly what had paul been up against in corinth after all why couldnt the church speak to ones living needs instead of disinterring this levantine argument and that analogy of the seed was it after all a good one whatever comes from a seed must itself die again it is no more immortal than the plant that came before it the clergyman was going too fast too to follow him closely better get a prayer book at home afterwards and read all this o grave where is thy sting o death where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is in the law no there was no following that it sounded like nonsense one just missed the implications it was like listening to some one who was too far off to be heard distinctly but who made eloquent gestures and noises the service came to an embarrassed pause everyone was motionless arrested man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live he cometh up and is cut down like a flower he fleeth as it were a shadow set in motion by unseen hands the coffin went gliding towards the furnace doors which opened to receive it there was a deep roar a sound like a mighty rushing wind an elemental and chaotic sound life is a faint dispersed film upon one little planet but flames roar like this and great winds rush and whirl out to the remotest star in the unfathomable depths of space that deep disorderly tumult is the true voice of lifeless matter not of dead matter for what has never lived cannot be dead but of lifeless matter outside of and beneath and beyond life everyone in the chapel seemed still and bowed and hushed and dwarfed to minute dimensions until the furnace doors had closed again upon that soulless devouring clamour chapter the fourth may at udimore bobby forgot that glimpse of the elemental powers that the furnace doors had given him altogether for such things do not remain naturally in the mind they inconvenience life but the voice of the clergyman hustling the arguments of st paul along and the scene in the crematorium chapel with the little coffin waiting to be launched into eternity and the few still black mourners dotted among the yellow benches came back to him very vividly when paul lambone began to quote and twist those familiar sentences about the contrast between the corruptible and the incorruptible and expand a fantastic philosophy of his own bobby had always intended to read that funeral service over again slowly and judicially but he had never done so and he regretted it now very much it left him and paul of tarsus at the mercy of paul lambone and he knew that paul lambone loved ingenious slight misquotations it was a very warm serenely still may evening and lambones party sat after dinner in the twilight some just inside the house and some on deck chairs upon the terrace they looked out over the marsh and over the still sea the sky was like the inside of a deep blue globe on which an ever increasing multitude of starry midges was alighting and rye and winchelsea crouched low beneath it black low lumps with a street light and a window or so showing minutely receding out to sea was a liner quite brightly lit with a swift steadiness the beam of the nearer lighthouse swept the distant flats came near lit the faces of the talkers lit the room called a church tower and a group of trees into existence and dropped them back into the darkness and forgot about them and passed on and then presently it was coming again a thin white streak of light hurrying far away across the levels when ones attention wandered from the talk one became aware of an abundance of nightingales they were nightingales newly come from the south one or it might be two were in the trees close at hand others remoter wove a gauze curtain of faint sweet sounds over the visible universe bobby sat on the step between the room and the terrace with his back against a pillar and with his empty coffee cup beside him he had put himself there by the feet of christina alberta who was deep in a big arm chair and very still her face was dim except when her cigarette glowed and showed a red lit unfamiliar face and yet that afternoon she had been the most familiar thing in the world to him she had kissed him and pulled his ears and he had kissed her bare shoulders and clasped her in his arms devizes too was silent and preoccupied he sat over against christina alberta on the other side of the opening of the room and he was so much in the twilight that except when the lighthouse beam lit his face only his shining shoes and socks were clearly visible to bobby there had been times when bobby had thought that devizes was in love with christina alberta and he had a vague inexplicable feeling that to some extent she was or had been in love with devizes he had a sense of unfathomed deeps in their relationship but he did not know where these deeps lay if christina alberta loved devizes she would have said so bobby knew of no reason why she should not but to day she had hugged and kissed bobby so that it was impossible to believe she loved anyone else yet in the last three or four months she had gone about with devizes a lot bobby had seen her mind responding and changing with her talks with this man she used to quote him and she would say things exactly like the things he said it had been a great inconvenience and trial to bobby this preoccupation and then suddenly he found devizes wasnt the lover at all never could have been a lover that day she had proved that up to the hilt and now in a state between pride and servitude bobby sat at her feet he sat at her feet and close to her devizes in the darkness was remote a full three yards away except for lambones unquenchable flow it had not been a very talkative party to night it was less talkative than ever this is too perfect margaret means had sighed i cant talk i just thank god i am alive and she had nestled into her big deck chair upon the terrace this was the girl it had suddenly become apparent to bobby a fortnight ago in london whom devizes intended to marry abruptly she had come upon the scene to destroy the triangle that had obsessed bobbys imagination a sweetly pretty fragile thing she was in the twilight she seemed as faint and fragrant as nightstock and she was a wonderful pianist last night she had played for two hours pauls sister miss lambone had been evoked from somewhere in the west of england to come and be hostess to the engaged couple bobby had tried to talk to christina alberta about margaret but christina alberta hadnt wanted to talk about her you see said christina alberta compactly she has opened the whole world of music to him thats what brought them together shes clever shes very clear and clever id never heard of her until you mentioned their engagement theyve gone to concerts together and that sort of thing hes known her much longer than he has known me when did you first meet devizes about the time my daddy came to midgard street as recently as that its hardly six months paul lambone took me to him to get advice about daddy but they have been going about for more than a year i thought it was just music that interested them theyd seemed to be friends and i thought he didnt mean to marry again he just suddenly decided christina alberta reflected thats the way with life bobby things accumulate and then you suddenly decide had she been undecided had she made him wait not her said christina alberta with a remarkable hardness in her voice no she said he decided she seemed to feel there was still something to express he just took hold of the situation this was bobbys second visit to udimore paul lambone had suddenly seen fit to gather this party apparently on the spur of devizes engagement in the interval bobby had seen christina alberta a number of times and developed an immense sense of relationship to her it filled his life he had always been dreaming things about her from the time when he anticipated her with blue eyes and a fragile person and always she was and did things that tore his dreams to shreds this made her profoundly interesting more and more he had become dependent upon her for interest he wanted to marry her if only to make sure he wouldnt lose the interest of her she had refused twice without any of the graces proper to the occasion no fear bobby she said it wouldnt do im not the woman you take me for you never are he said i dont mind that youre the dearest companion she said i like the way your hair grows then why not make it yours and be companions for ever nothing more frightful she said and so dismissed the proposal they went about together they spent much of their spare time together except for those distressing occasions when she would suddenly throw him over to go to a theatre or walk with devizes or to go to devizes to talk she never hesitated to throw him over for devizes yet bobby got a lot of her she didnt know much about theatres or music halls or restaurants or dancing places or that sort of thing and bobby was discreetly competent in that province the malmesburys felt themselves deserted and susan was vindictive in her resentment at his frequent absence from her bed time rituals tessy bobby declared remained his dearest friend but when he tried to tell her all about himself in the old old fashion which he did when christina alberta was away with devizes he naturally had to tell her all about christina alberta but tessy declined in the most emphatic way to be told about christina alberta it was extremely surprising and disappointing to bobby to find out how incapable tessy was of appreciating the endless interestingness and charm of christina alberta it was a blind spot in her mind she seemed to assume that christina alberta was no better than she should be whereas she was much better it estranged bobby and tessy very much and it was a great sorrow to bobby because christina alberta was good and interesting beyond dispute she was growing with tremendous rapidity mentally and in her knowledge of the world every time he met her she seemed more of a person with richer fuller more commanding ideas she seemed to be living every moment of her time she was working now at the royal college of science under macbride she was taking hold of her new studies there with tremendous enthusiasm she was in love with comparative anatomy bobby had always thought that comparative anatomy was dry pedantic stuff about bones but she declared it lit up the whole story of life for her it changed her ideas about the world and about herself profoundly it is the most romantic stuff i have ever read or thought about she said it makes human history seem silly she took him three times to the natural history museum at south kensington to show him something of the fine realizations that stirred her mind she made it clear to him how the bones of a wing or the scratches of a flint could restore the storms and sunlight and passions of ten million years ago and then suddenly a week ago christina alberta had consented to marry bobby she had taken back her two refusals but the way she did it made it like everything else she did astonishing and disconcerting she had a confession to make and for a time until he could think it over thoroughly that confession seemed to bobby to explain her refusals completely and to clear up everything about her she got him to take her to hampton court but they did not go into the gardens because they saw through the park gates that the chestnuts of bushey avenue were in full blossom they went instead by the pond and up under the riotously flowering branches a belated spring was coming now in a hurry warm and brilliant the trees were glorious it was as if a bright green sea was splashing up warm creamy foam under a shower of cannon shots the blue sky hummed with light the spring has come fast now that it has begun to come she said he felt she had something to say and waited i never know bobby this year less than ever whether spring is the happiest time in the year or the most miserably restless everybody and everything is falling in love i didnt wait for spring said bobby but what of the frogs that cant find water said christina alberta theres water where there are frogs said bobby everybody is marrying and giving in marriage she said i thought i thought dr devizes at least was an inconsolable widower but the spring tides have caught even him they catch everybody theyve caught you i dont know im miserable bobby and restless and all astir then let yourself go one aches alone but are you alone fairly theres me bobby dear what do you want in me you to be with you to be always about with you and to be loved by you its kind of you oh nonsense kindness listen bobby she said and made a long pause her voice when she spoke had adopted the ease of casual conversation do you believe in chastity bobby could you love a girl who wasnt chaste bobby winced as if she had struck his face with a whip he went white what do you mean he asked plainly she said for a time neither of them said a word you have had your experiences she thrust in france they all did bobby made no answer to that now you know she flung at him for a little while the light had gone out of bobbys world did you love the man he asked if i did i dont remember it it was just curiosity and the stir of growing up and the intolerable sense of being forbidden no i think i was almost cold blooded i liked the look of him and then i disliked him but there it is bobby thats how things are bobby weighed his words id care if it were any girl but you you youre different i love you what has or hasnt happened to you doesnt matter at least it doesnt matter so much youre sure it doesnt matter so much quite sure for good yes from this moment you forget you begin to forget what i have told you as i want to forget it it will go soon enough if you want to forget it it doesnt matter at all i see now it doesnt matter at all but why on earth do you want to marry me bobby what is there in me im ugly rude greedy inconsiderate ive no purity no devotion youre incessantly interesting youre straight swift and endlessly beautiful bobby truly does it look like that to you yes doesnt my manner dont you know yes she said gravely i suppose i know she came to a stop in front of him with her arms akimbo they stood looking at one another and bobby winced as if he was going to cry her face was grave and troubled and then at the sight of his expression her smile broke through her gravity vanished she was a different christina alberta she was suddenly the gayest conceivable thing to him confident and impudent if you were to kiss me bobby right here and now in bushey park would they lock us up most wonderful it was to bobby to take her in his arms a new christina alberta was revealed to bobby christina alberta seen from a distance of six inches or so an amazingly beautiful christina alberta one might have thought she had never lived for anything but being loved by bobby youre learning said christina alberta after a little while now do it all over again bobby nobody seems to be looking neither lambone nor devizes had seemed in the least surprised at their engagement indeed their attitude of gratified expectation was almost embarrassing the young couple had come down to udimore with devizes and miss means under the ample protection of miss lambone almost as though they had been appointed for each other from the beginning of things but at udimore there were further surprises and perplexities for bobby all day saturday christina alberta seemed to be not so much in love as in a thoroughly bad temper she seemed far more concerned by the fact that devizes was going to marry miss means than by the generous devotion that bobby was prepared to lavish upon her she was inattentive to his various little manuvres to get isolated with her the two couples played tennis after tea until it was time to dress for dinner she was badly out of practice and fundamentally unorthodox and margaret played with a smoothness and sweetness that roused her to a pitch of viciousness only too evident to bobbys fine perceptions it seemed to bobby that devizes also noted her annoyance but miss means was blissfully unobservant of anything in the world but devizes on sunday morning christina alberta carried off bobby through the distant cheerfulness of church bells for a walk to brede castle and she announced to bobby that she did not intend to marry him bobby protested you dont love me havent i kissed you didnt i hug you havent i ruffled your hair then why dont you want to marry me i do not want to marry anyone i dont love anybody except of course you but even you i cant marry i want to be loved bobby yes but not to be married but why not the the old reason no i took your word about that but all the same i dont want to marry you bobby i think its because i dont want to be bound up with anyones life i dont want to be a wife i want to be my free and independent self ive got to grow thats it bobby i want to be free to grow bobby made protesting noises i dont want some one seeing me grow all the time youd always be looking at me bobby i know you would it was useless of bobby to say he wouldnt he would i didnt know that things were going to take me like this until i fixed to marry you i wanted to marry you when i consented honestly i did i wanted dreadfully then to get close to some one as close as possible and to be kissed and told there there and to keep there it was a comfort for me bobby you are a comfort for me id ache to madness without you but how close we come when we love bobby and how far away we are all the time how can we know each other when we hardly know ourselves when we dont dare know ourselves you are such a dear bobby you are so warm and kind that it seems ungrateful not to give myself to you with both hands but i just cant im not a normal woman perhaps or something has happened to me unawares perhaps life has cheated me out of something oh i dont know bobby i want some one dreadfully i want you dreadfully and i dont want you at all id rather be dead than a female thing like margaret means if thats marrying but i thought said bobby after all thats happened no ill wait ten years for you said bobby on the chance of your altering your mind you are the dearest comforter said christina alberta and stopped short and suddenly she had put her hands upon his shoulders and clung to him and broken into a wild passion of weeping wetting you instead of wedding you she sobbed and laughed oh my poor bobby you dear lover she clung to him for a time then she detached herself and stood wiping her eyes the christina alberta he generally knew except for the traces of her tears if women cant control their emotions better she said theyll have to go back to harems we cant have it both ways but i wont marry you theres no man in the world i can marry im going to be a free and independent woman bobby from now on but i dont understand said bobby its not because i dont want you to love me he was baffled bobby she whispered and seemed to glow bobby took her back into his arms and held her and pressed his cheek and ears against hers and kissed her and kissed her again and it seemed to him to mark his own unworthiness that he should think at such a time that there were no such wonderful kisses in the world as kisses flavoured with salt tears and yet she wasnt going to marry him she had snatched herself back from him and nevertheless she was in his arms he was enormously perplexed at what was happening but it was quite clear that the end of his engagement was not to be the end of his love making anyhow here was love it was so manifestly the time for love high may ruled the world about them there were hawthorn trees white with blossom and great bushes of elder just breaking into flower bobby sat in the gloaming with his friends and thought of the things that had happened to him that day thought of christina albertas salt tears and the incessant intriguing strangeness of her ways he was still immensely puzzled but now in a large restful contented fashion christina alberta and he were not to marry it seemed nevertheless he had kissed her and embraced her and he was free to sit at her feet for a time he was not even to humiliate himself by telling these others he was not to marry her he said nothing his thoughts and feelings were beyond words christina alberta too was darkly silent everyone indeed seemed preoccupied talk about the view and the stars and the coming of the nightingales and about migratory birds and lighthouses rambled on for a time and died away they were all too full for talking the silence lengthened he wondered what would happen if nobody spoke any more he thought of christina alberta close behind him and he began to quiver in all his being the silence was becoming oppressive he felt as though he could no longer change his attitude nobody stirred but lambone saved the situation it is exactly six months ago to night that sargon died upstairs said lambone he paused and seemed to answer an unspoken question we dont know when he died exactly he just faded out in the night i wish i could have known him said margaret means after quite a long interval bobbys thoughts came round to sargon that still young woman sitting in the darkness behind him ceased to dominate his thoughts he was moved to speak and had to cough to clear his throat i hate to think of his being burnt and scattered he said its not so disagreeable said miss lambone as to think of the body all shut up in the coffin and decaying oh dont cried bobby its death any death that i hate to think of now when it is spring time when the whole world is so full of life i remember all he was the hopes he had and they are scattered and dispersed anyhow they are scattered and dispersed they are not boxed up and locked up and buried when i was here last he was like a little boy who has just heard of the world he was going to fly going to india and china going to learn all about everything and then do all sorts of splendid things and there were the beastly bacteria at work in his lungs and beating his strength down and none of it was ever to happen when first i heard he was dead i could not believe it is he dead said paul lambone there was no reply to be made to that paul adjusted his shoulder blades a little more comfortably against the back of the small deep sofa on which he sat the more i think over sargon the less dead he seems to me and the more important he becomes i dont agree with you roothing i dont find anything futile in his life i think he was symbolically perfect i have thought about him endlessly and talked said devizes endlessly and given you some very helpful ideas for your treatment dont be ungrateful you think that sargon is over he has only just begun you are becoming too professional with success devizes you begin to take up cases and work them off and drop them out of your mind you dont go on with them and learn you dont sit about and think about them as i do i continue to think about sargon i go on with him because he is still a living being for me i have got a new religion from him the religion of sargonism i declare him prophet of a new dispensation it is my latest new religion there will always be new religions and the new religions will always be the only ones that matter religion is a living thing and what is alive must be continually dying and be continually born again differently but the same you believe in immortality mr lambone said miss means i wish that i could but when i try to imagine it my wits fail me sometimes one seems to feel what it might be on a night like this perhaps her pretty clear voice died away in the stillness as the trail of a falling star dies away paul a large dark lump on the dim pale sofa went on speaking immortality he said is a mystery one can only speak of it in dark metaphors how can we believe that each of our individual commonplace lives is to have an endless commonplace sequel that is incredible nonsense yet we go on living after death nevertheless when we die we are changed all wise teachers have insisted upon that as roothing said we are not boxed up and buried and forgotten our real death is an escape and we escape and become what did you say dispersed immortal life is endless consequence our lives are like lines in a great poem it is an unfinished and yet it is a perfect poem the line begins and ends but it has to be there and once it is there it is there eternally nothing could follow if it was not there but every star has not the same glory some lives some lines stand out as more significant than the others they open a new branch of the subject they start a new point of view they express something fresh they are geniuses they are prophets they are major stars sargon was the last the latest of these prophets and i am his paul not for nothing was i christened paul paul of tarsus said devizes was a man of energy there will always be minor differences in such parallels said lambone i will tell you my doctrine he said he began to talk in that clear miniature voice of his which was so like a little mouse running out of the mountain of his person of sargon and his struggles with his individuality and of the struggles in every man between his individual life and something greater that is also in him there was a streak of fantasy in what he was saying a touch of burlesque in his constant use of theological and religious phrasing and withal a profound sincerity in every human being he declared the little laundryman battled with the king of kings he expanded and amplified his theme ever and again devizes would cut into the monologue and talk for a time not so much to make objections as to restate and amend and amplify the others said little margaret means twice made soft sweet sounds suggestive of intellectual sensuousness and once christina alberta said but very loudly and then never mind go on and relapsed for a long time into a silence that could be felt bobby sat still sometimes listening intently and sometimes with his mind spreading out like an uncared for stream into a number of parallel channels the argument itself was interesting to follow but moving at the side of that was the question of the talkers sincerity how much of all this stuff did lambone mean how much of what he said was of a piece with the rest of his observant self indulgent life his life as a humorous comment on a universe that was profoundly absurd how easily lambone played with phrases and ideas for which men had lived and died how widely he had read and thought to bring so many things together he produced a great effect of erudition the golden bough he had at his fingers ends he talked of the sacramental mysteries of half a dozen cults from mithraism to ritual sacrifices of varying ideas of personality that had held and swayed human life from fiji to yucatan now he was in pre christian alexandria and now among the chinese philosophers the superior person of confucius he declared was merely an example of our way of translating all chinese phrases as ridiculously as possible it meant really the higher and greater man the universal man in whom the inferior egotistical man merged himself it was the salvation of the revivalist everywhere it was the spiritual man of pauline christianity when the late mr albert edward preemby poured out all his little being into the personality of sargon king of kings he was only doing over again what the saints and mystics the religious teachers and fanatics have done throughout the ages he was just the master under the bo tree translated into the cockney of woodford wells presently devizes was talking devizes was a great contrast to lambone he talked a different language he did not seem nearly so clear and clever to bobby as lambone did but he had an effect of sincerity and solidity of conviction that lambone lacked altogether his interventions made all that lambone said seem like a wild and picturesque parody of something that was otherwise inexpressible both he and lambone had an air of casting verbal nets for some truth that still eluded them and yet this truth so remotely and imperfectly apprehended was for each of them the most important thing in life stripped of its theological trappings devizes said to lambone your new religion is simply a statement of this that our race has reached and is now receding from a maximum of individuation that it turns now towards synthesis and co operation it will move back towards what you call sargon the great ruler and it will swallow up individual egotistical men in its common aims as already scientific work swallows them up or good administrative work or art that is what you are saying exactly said paul lambone if we must talk your language devizes and not mine art science public service creative work of every sort these are parts of what you i suppose would call the race mind parts of the race life every man who matters is a fresh thought a fresh idea he is himself still it is true but his significance is that he comes out of his past and out of his conditions and he flows on to further men this is the new realization that is changing all the values in human life it is happening everywhere even in the books and reading of to day you can see the thing happening history now becomes more important than biography what made up the whole of life in the romantic past the love story the treasure story the career getting on making a fortune the personal deed and victory the sacrifices for an individual friend or love or leader remains no longer the whole of life and sometimes not even the leading interest in life we are passing into a new way of living into a new sort of lives into new relationships the world which seemed for a time not to be changing any more is changing very swiftly in its mental substance new sorts of people said bobby softly and went off from listening to lambones lucid little voice into a final recapitulation of the puzzling things christina alberta had said and done that day bobby was recalled to the matter of the talk by a movement in the chair behind him lambones smooth voice was explaining so that it does not matter so much what we achieve as what we contribute that cherished personal life which men and women struggle to round off and make noble and perfect disappears from the scheme of things what matters more and more is the work one does what matters less and less is our personal romance and our personal honour or rather our honour will go out of us into our work our love affairs our devotions and private passions for example will fall more and more definitely into a subordination to our science or whatever our function is our romances and our fame and honour will join our vices among the things we suppress there was a time when men lived for a noble tomb and in order to leave sweet and great memories behind them soon it will matter nothing to a man and his work to know that he will probably die in a ditch misunderstood so long as he gets the work done with no last judgment ever to vindicate him said devizes that will not matter in the least to him i agree some of us begin to feel like that even now even if one has done nothing worth doing said paul lambone and in his voice was that faint quality of the sigh of one who has crowned a rather difficult and uncertain card castle even if sargon had died unrescued in his asylum and all the world had thought him mad all the same he would have escaped his imagination would have touched the imagination of the greater life came a pause of edification and then a sigh of satisfaction from miss lambone she never understood in the least what her brother was talking about but she adored him when he talked nobody she thought had ever talked like him or could possibly talk like him his voice was so clear and bright like the best sort of print only sometimes you wished you had spectacles but now miss lambone was to receive a shock christina alberta suddenly came out of the silence in which she had been sitting i dont believe in this said christina alberta out of the depths of her chair bobby was beginning to know the voice of christina alberta very well and he knew now that she was terrified at having to talk and at the same time desperately resolved to get something said he knew too that she was gripping hard at the arms of her chair he glanced at devizes and in that instant the lighthouse beam touched his face and bobby saw it very intent watching christina alberta steadily and as if forgetful of all other things it was intent and tender and tenderly apprehensive grave and very pale in that white illumination when the light had passed away bobby still seemed to see that face but now conversely it was a face of ebony i do not believe in any of this said christina alberta she paused with the effect of marshalling her argument it is theology i suppose she said or mysticism it is all an intellectual game that men have played to comfort themselves men rather than women it makes no real difference tragedy is tragedy failure is failure death is death but is there ever complete failure asked lambone suppose said christina alberta suppose a man is thrown into prison and misrepresented to all the world suppose he is taken away presently and made to dig his own grave and shot at the edge of it and buried and then lied about for a time and forgotten it isnt part of the race that is murdered it isnt a wonderful thing that passes on it is a man who has been killed and made away with your mysticism is just an attempt to dodge the desolation of that it doesnt such things have happened they happen to day in russia in america everywhere men are just wiped out body and soul hope and will that man and his black personal universe are done with and over and there is an end to his business he is beaten and wiped out and all the clever talk upon easy sofas in the warm twilight will not alter that one jot it is frustration if i am frustrated i am frustrated if i have desires and dreams and they are defeated and die i die it is playing with words to say i do not die or that they are changed and sublimated and carried on into something better my dear said miss lambone to miss means you are sure you are not feeling cold her voice conveyed a faint intimation that she would cease to be acutely interested in the talk if this chit of a girl intervened any further in the discussion and that she would begin to do things with wraps and shawls and break up the meeting im perfectly happy dear miss means answered all this i wish it could go on for ever but christina alberta disregarded miss lambones warning she had something to say and there was some one she wanted to say it to not too pointedly not too plainly all this theology this religion the new religions that are only the old ones painted over reborn said paul painted over i dont want them but that is not what i want to say what i want to say is that you are wrong about my daddy you are quite wrong about him that i do know mr lambone has dressed him up to suit his own philosophy he had that philosophy long before he knew him and you talked my daddy over and put mr lambones ideas into him when he was beaten and broken because they suited his case they werent there before i know him and exactly how he thought i was brought up on him he talked to me more than to anyone and it is all nonsense to talk of him his exaltation as being like the great soul coming like the tidal sea into the pool of the little soul it didnt when he said he was lord of the world he wanted to be lord of the world he didnt want to incorporate any other people at all or be incorporated he was just as exclusively himself when he was sargon as when he was albert edward preemby more so and i believe that is how it is with all of us she went on rather hurriedly for she knew there were forces there very ready to silence her i want to be myself and nothing else i want the world for myself i want to be a goddess in the world it does not matter that i am an ugly girl with natural bad manners it does not matter that it is impossible that is what i want that is what i am made to want one may get moments anyhow a moment of glory is better than none i believe that sort of thing is what you all want really you just persuade yourselves you dont and you call that religion i dont believe anyone has ever believed religion from the beginning buddhism christianity this fantastic sargonism this burlesque religion you invent to make an evenings talk they are all consolations and patchings up bandages and wooden legs people have tried to believe in such religions no doubt broken people but because we cannot satisfy the desires of our hearts why should we cry sour grapes at them i dont want to serve anything or anybody i may be heading for frustration the universe may be a system of frustration but that doesnt alter the fact that this is how i feel about it i may be defeated it may be certain that i shall be defeated but as for bringing a contrite heart out of the mess and starting again as a good little part of something i dont fink oh i know i beat my hands against a wall its not my fault why dont we take oh why dont we dare miss lambone stirred and rustled the darkness that was devizes spoke to christina alberta and miss lambone became still we dont take and we dont dare he said we dont defy laws and customs because there are other things in our lives in us and not outside us that are more important to us that is why it pleases paul to dress up his view of these things in old mystical phrasing but what he says is really an unscientific way of putting psychological fact you think you are simple but you are really complex you are the individual but you are the race also that is your nature and mine and everyones the more our intelligence awakens the more we know that but it is the difference that is distinctively me and not the general part the race in me is no more to me than the ground i walk on i am christina alberta i am not woman or mankind as christina alberta i want and i want and i want and when the door is slammed upon my imaginations i cry out against it why pretend i give up a thing because i cant have it why make a glory of renunciation and letting go i hate the idea of self sacrifice what is the good of coming into the world as christina alberta just in order to sacrifice being christina alberta what is the good of being different if one is not to live a different life unexpectedly miss lambone intervened the life of a woman is one long sacrifice she said there was a pause but we have the vote now said christina alberta almost flippantly why is a womans life sacrifice think of the children we bear said miss lambone in a constrained voice well said christina alberta and suppressed some scandalous remark the most astonishing thing about us she broke out again after a pause the most astonishing thing in the feminine make up is that hardly any of us do seem to want children a lot of us anyhow dont now that i am beginning to learn something about biology i realize how marvellous that is as a race of creatures specialized for children we ought to be eaten up by the desire for children as a matter of fact most modern women will do anything to avoid having children we dread them to me they seem like a swarm of hidden dwarfs prepared to come upon me and eat up my whole existence its not simply i dont want them i live in fear of them love we may want many of us do intensely we want to love and be loved to get close and near to some one its a delusion i suppose one of natures clumsy tricks it is all a delusion he vanishes he was never there under the old conditions it availed it got the children nature wanted but we dont think of children we dont want to think about them there it is and anyway children do not take a woman out of her egotism they only extend and intensify it i have known intelligent girls marry and have children and when the baby appeared their minds evaporated they became creatures of instinct messing about with napkins i could scream at the thought of it no i am an egoist pure and simple i am christina alberta and her only i am not sargon i refuse altogether to mix with that promiscuous anybody nobody after all that may only be a phase in your development said devizes it is the only one i know that is evident but i assure you christina alberta that this revolt and distress of yours is a phase you are talking rebellion and egoism and anarchism as a healthy baby screams to get breath into its lungs and escape from the stuffiness of old air the baby doesnt know why it screams and no doubt finds some dim little grievance in its brain go on said christina alberta chastise me and chastise me it seemed to bobby that there were tears in her voice no but you are so young my dear said devizes my dear not so young not so actually young cried christina alberta if i live to be eighty said christina alberta shall i ever be able to feel more than i am feeling now why will you always treat me like a child nowadays feeling isnt the only measure said devizes even now to night you are talking below your beliefs you are not an egoistic adventurer you take sides on a score of matters you insist you are a communist for example oh just to smash up things said christina alberta just to smash up everything no you say that to night but you have told me differently before you have a care for the world you want to help forward the common interest you develop a passion for scientific truth well theres no way of fencing in your individuality from other minds in science or in public affairs youre a part by necessity you cant be a complete whole you find already you cant keep away from these things they will take you more and more whether you like it or not because it is the spirit of the time that is what is happening to us all you cant escape our work our part is the first thing in our lives to that pride must bow now and passion and romance we have to slam and lock and bar the door against all personal passion that might wreck our work bar it and put it out of your mind as a secondary thing work give the greater things a chance to keep you thats all very well its everything why should they keep me came from christina alberta sullenly and resolutely i know that this is your faith she said you told me all about it youve always told me about it bobbys quick ear detected a change in her voice do you remember our first talk together do you remember our talk in lonsdale mews when we dined together at that italian place that night just after we had found each other found each other but i did not know then that your faith meant all the suppressions and sacrifices and discretions it seems to do i thought it was something robust and bold i did not understand its qualifications but since then we have argued about these things and argued that day at kew gardens that day when you took me for that walk over the downs to shere we have threshed things out why should we argue again i am giving in what can i do but give in and soon i will be a sargonite with you and paul but not this summer not now this night this wonderful first night of summer to night i rebel against any renunciation any fobbing off of individuals with second best things i am going to be impossible and absurd for the last time i want the world from the stars to the bottom of the sea for myself for my own hungry self and all between the precious things between the love there vague questions appeared and vanished again on the screen of bobbys mind what had christina alberta renounced what was she renouncing what was anyone renouncing and had his ears cheated him or had devizes called her my dear in front of margaret means and in face of all the circumstances of the case it seemed to bobby that devizes was the last person who ought to call christina alberta my dear and what was this about fobbing off was this really a shameless plainness of speech an atrocious confession or something that he misunderstood miss lambone stirred uneasily it was as if an evil spirit possessed christina alberta oh damn renunciation she said with bitter gusto they seemed to be sitting for some moments in a profound silence and then the nightingale became very audible i think said miss lambone in the silence that it is getting just a leetle chilly it is so beautiful here said miss means who was warm in miss lambones shawl perfectly beautiful how you can talk of frustration she added and left her sentence incomplete i think said miss lambone that i shall go in and light the candles it is too wonderful a night for the electric lights far too wonderful we will just light the candles and the fire and perhaps you will play us something beautiful these are such marvellous fire places here that they blaze up at once i dont know if you have noticed them a new sort the fire is all on the hearth no draught below but the shape of the back draws it up i love a wood fire said miss lambone and sighed and rose slowly and voluminously two days later bobby came into one of the little studies on the garden side of paul lambones house paul had found out that bobby wanted a few days of uninterrupted thought in which to begin his novel and had asked him to stay on after the other guests had returned to london it was a perfect room for a writer of bobbys temperament it had a low writing table close to the sill of the casemented window and on the sill was a silver bowl of forget me nots and white tulips a little glass paned door released one into the garden without ones having to go back through the house the writing table had everything a fastidious writer could desire a pleasant paper rack and wafers and real quill pens and plenty of elbow room the chair he sat in was an arm chair immensely comfortable but not too luxurious no hint of repose in it but only a completely loyal support for a working occupant a garden path ran up hill from the window a garden path skirted by wonderful clusters of pansies on either side of the pansies were rose bushes and though not a rosebud was showing yet the fresh green leaves tinged with ruddy brown were very exquisite in the light he stood looking up the path for a time and then sat down and drew the writing pad towards him he took one of those delightful quills tested the delicious flexibility of its points dipped it in the ink and wrote in his very neat and beautiful handwriting ups and downs a pedestrian novel by robert roothing chapter the first which introduces our hero he wrote this very readily because it was very familiar to him from first to last he had written it on fair fresh sheets of paper perhaps half a dozen times then he stopped short and sat quite still with his head on one side then very neatly he corrected which introduces into in which we introduce it was nearly two years now since he had first begun his novel in this fashion and he was still quite uncertain about the details of his heros introduction his original intention about the story still floated pleasantly in the sky of his mind a promise of a happy succession of fine various and delightful adventures told easily and good humouredly the fortunes of a kindly unpretending not too brave but brave enough young man on his way through the world to live happily afterwards with a delicious young woman picaresque was the magic word none of these adventures had as yet assumed a concrete form in his mind he felt they would come to him definitely enough one day if one sat and mused one half saw them and that was assurance enough for him and so having rewritten his title page neatly and prettily he fell into a day dream and was presently thinking round and about his christina alberta as a good hero should bobby was always being puzzled by christina alberta always coming upon something that seemed to clear up everything and then being puzzled again but now it seemed to him that he really did know the last fact of importance that was to be known about her overnight paul lambone had described how he had taken her to devizes to get advice and how they had blundered upon the reality of her parentage he told his story well as a story writer should he gave it dramatic point evidently he told the tale of set intention because it was time bobby knew lambone was aware of christina albertas engagement he did not know and nobody but bobby knew that she never intended to be married but this it seemed to bobby made the understanding of her situation possible explained that watchful tenderness of devizes face suddenly betrayed by the light of his inadvertent my dear explained her position as though she belonged to him and paul lambone instead of being a rather unaccountable visitor excused her vehement jealousy of margaret means because evidently she had become violently possessive of her father and had counted perhaps upon recognition and being very much with him no doubt margaret means stood in the way of that it was natural for christina alberta to want to be with devizes and work with him and natural for her to suspect and anticipate and resent an intervening personality apart from the magic of kinship it was natural that two such subtle and abundant personalities should attract each other greatly that devizes should have decided quite abruptly to marry margaret means did not present any difficulties to bobby he was not thinking very closely about devizes margaret means was pretty enough for anyone to want to marry her there are times as bobby knew when that sweet prettiness can stab one like an arrow it had evidently stabbed and won devizes and almost the only thing that gave bobby a second thought but no more than a second thought was christina albertas fluctuation of purpose why she should have consented to marry him and then have changed her mind so quickly and definitely and yet have retained him as a lover that resolution not to marry seemed after all just a part of her immense modernity because of all this group of new people in which he found her she seemed to bobby to be in every way the newest she was the boldest enterprise in living he had ever met her flare of hungry rebel individuality fascinated him where in this world was she going would she win out to this free personal life she desired or would she fail to find an objective of work and come upon disappointment and solitude like some creature that has strayed the world had terrified bobby in his own person greatly it terrified him still more when he thought of this valiant little figure going out to challenge it bobby was naturally inherently afraid his instinct was for security protection kindliness and help he clung to his aunt suzannah job for safety he didnt believe christina alberta knew one tenth of the dangers she ran of insult defeat humiliation neglect repulse fatigue and lonely distress his imagination presented a tormenting picture of her away there in dark confused immense and blundering london as an excessively fragile figure light on its feet shock head erect arms akimbo unaware of monstrous ambushed dangers now that he began to understand her he began to understand a great number of bright eyed adventurous difficult young women he had met in the last few years and he had his first dim realization of the meaning of the deep wide stir among womankind that had won them votes and a score of unprecedented freedoms many of these younger women were doing their work and holding their own exactly like men they were painting and drawing like men writing criticism like men writing plays and novels like men leading movements doing scientific work playing a part in politics like men on reflection not exactly no they still kept different but they didnt do their things in any fashion one could call womanly without adding strange new meanings to womanly the novels they were writing interested him immensely people like stella benson wrote books like anybody you could not tell from her work whether she was a man or a woman all that again was new george eliot perhaps was a precursor perhaps the former sort of womens writings when they were not pretty me books were kindly auntie books you heard the petticoats swish in every page sexless these new ones bobby weighed the word the earlier generation of women who wanted to be emancipated suppressed sex suppressed it so fiercely that its negative presence became the dominant factor in their lives they ceased to be positive woman they became fantastically negative woman but this newer multitude was not so much repressing as forgetting their sex making little of it christina alberta had in a way made nothing of her sex not by struggling against it but by making it cheap for herself as a man makes it cheap for himself so that it was a thing of mere intermittent moods and impulses for her and she could go on to other things going on to other things his imagination recurred to that little figure resolved to conquer the world for itself in defiance of every tradition there was a strong urgency in him to start off to london in pursuit of her to hover about her intervene protect her and carry her off to security he knew she wouldnt permit that sort of thing to happen anyhow hed have to be just a friend and companion to her be at hand for her and if she did encounter some disaster stand by her it was a queer thing that he should want to stand by this unsexed young woman it was just what one would not expect it was part perhaps of the immense biological changes of the time in the past the species had needed half the race specialized for child bearing and child rearing now plainly it didnt the tremendous and worshipful dignity of wife and mother was not for all women any longer that would remain for a certain sort of them to take up if they would but a vast multitude of women were born now to miss that some would become pretty nuisances who would presently cease to be pretty parasites on love and the respect for motherhood shams simulacra others would break away to a real individual life a third sex perhaps in the new world there would cease to be two sexes only there would be recognized varieties and subdivisions so bobby speculated for just as there were women who did not want to bear children so there were men who did not want to lord it over wife and children they would want to love all the same every individual of a social species needed love to fail in that need was to escape out of social life to lonely futility mutual comfort bobby quoted in his past bobby had dreamt of the love of children even now he remembered as a fact that he had dreamt particularly of a little girl of his own that he could protect and explore but now the thought and interest of christina alberta had blotted that out it was extraordinary to him to perceive how possessed he was by her he could endure no prospect of life just now unless it was to include christina alberta as its principal fact but hed be no use to her unless she respected him he couldnt hope to stand subordinate to her any more than he could hope to be her master in the latter case shed rebel in the former shed despise they would have to stand side by side and since she was clever able and resolved to work hard and distinguish herself he must word hard and also distinguish himself too he had to be her equal and remain and keep himself her equal that in fact was why he was going to write a great novel not just a novel but a great one he looked again at the neatly written page ups and downs he read a pedestrian novel it dawned upon him that there was something profoundly wrong about that it was to have been a story of wandering about in the world that is the story of the happy adventures of a well tempered mind in a well understood scheme of things but bobby was beginning to realize that there is not and there never has been a world that is there is only a world that has been and a world that is to be new people whispered bobby and dipped a quill in the ink and made a border of dots round his title then suddenly he crossed out those three words ups and downs and wrote instead new country that might be the title of any novel that matters said bobby he mused deeply then he altered the sub title to the history of an explorer he scratched out explorer involuntary traveller said bobby finally he put back a pedestrian novel as his sub title he became aware of an intermittent dull tapping and following the sound discovered a thrush trying to break up a snail on the gravel path but the gravel path was too fine and soft to give a firm anvil for the beating the silly bird ought to find a brick or a potsherd said bobby and reflected i suppose all the flower pots are shut up in the shed i dont like to see that bird wasting the morning and being disappointed it wouldnt take a minute he got up let himself out by the little glass door beside the window and went to find a brick presently he returned with it but he did not go back into the study because while he had been looking for the brick he had seen a young blackbird which had got under the strawberry netting and was evidently scared out of its silly wits so he went back to see about the blackbird the minutes passed and he did not reappear perhaps he had found some other fellow creature in trouble presently a little breeze blew into the study through the open glass door and lifted the sheet of paper which was to introduce our hero and wafted it softly and suggestively on to the unlit wood fire upon the hearth there it lay for a long time transcribers notes italicized text is surrounded by underscores italics superscripted characters are preceded by
