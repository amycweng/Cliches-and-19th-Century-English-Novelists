illustration above were the lava hot gases and ash and below the seething floods and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake here is an impressive story based on the interaction of planetary bodies and of the sun upon them a great star is seen approaching the earth at first it is only an object of interest to the general public but there is an astronomer on the earth who is watching each phase and making mathematical calculations for he knows the intimate relation of gravitation between bodies and the effect on rotating bodies of the same force from an outside source he fears all sorts of wreckage on our earth he warns the people but they as usual discount all he says and label him mad but he was not mad h g wells in his own way gives us a picturesque description of the approach of the new body through long days and nightshe tells how the earth and natural phenomena of the earth will react though this star never touches our sphere the devastation and destruction wrought by it are complete and horrible the story is correct in its astronomical aspects the star by h g wells author of the war of the worlds the time machine etc it was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made almost simultaneously from three observatories that the motion of the planet neptune the outermost of all the planets that wheeled about the sun had become erratic ogilvy had already called attention to a suspected retardation in its velocity in december such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to interest the world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet neptune nor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause any great excitement scientific people however found the intelligence remarkable enough even before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter that its motion was quite different from the orderly progress of the planets and that the deflection of neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an unprecedented kind few people without training in science can realize the huge isolation of the solar system the sun with its specks of planets its dust of planetoids and its impalpable comets swims in vacant immensity that almost defeats the imagination beyond the orbit of neptune there is space vacant so far as human observation has penetrated without warmth or light or sound blank emptiness for twenty billion times a million miles that is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed before the nearest of the stars is attained and saving a few comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame no matter had ever to human knowledge crossed the gulf of space until early in the twentieth century this wanderer appeared a vast mass of matter it was bulky heavy rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the sky into the radiance of the sun by the second day it was clearly visible to any decent instrument as a speck with a barely sensible diameter in the constellation leo near regulus in a little while an opera glass could attain it on the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual apparition in the heavens a planetary collision one london paper headed the news and proclaimed duchines opinion that this strange new planet would probably collide with neptune the leader writers enlarged upon the topic so that in most of the capitals of the world on jan there was an expectation however vague of some eminent phenomenon in the sky and as the night followed the sunset round the globe thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to seethe old familiar stars just as they had always been until it was dawn in london and pollux setting and the stars overhead grown pale the winters dawn it was a sickly filtering accumulation of daylight and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to show where people were astir but the yawning policeman saw the thing the busy crowds in the market stopped agape workmen going to their work betimes milkmen the drivers of news carts dissipation going home jaded and pale homeless wanderers sentinels on their beats and in the country laborers trudging afield poachers slinking home all over the dusky quickening country it would be seenand out at sea by seamen watching for the daya great white star come suddenly into the westward sky brighter it was than any star in our skies brighter than the evening star at its brightest it still glowed out white and large no mere twinkling spot of light but a small round clear shining disk an hour after the day had come and where science has not reached men stared and feared telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by these fiery signs in the heavens sturdy boers dusky hottentots gold coast negroes frenchmen spaniards portuguese stood in the glow of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star and in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement rising almost to shouting pitch as the two remote bodies had rushed together there had been a hurrying to and fro to gather photographic apparatus and spectroscope to gather this appliance and that to record the novel astonishing sight the destruction of a worldfor it was a world a sister planet of our earth far greater than our earth indeed that had so suddenly flashed into flaming death neptune it was which had been struck fairly and squarely by the planet from outer space and the heat of concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one vast mass of incandescence round the world that day two hours before the dawn went the pallid great white star fading only as it sank westward and the sun mounted above it everywhere man marveled at it but of all those who saw it none could have marveled more than those sailors habitual watchers of the stars who far away at sea had heard nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the night and when next it rose over europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on hilly slopes on house roofs in open spaces staring eastward waiting for the rising of the new star it rose with a white glow in front like the glare of a white fire and those who had seen it come into existence the night before cried out at the sight of it it is larger they cried it is brighter and indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond comparison but scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little circle of the strange new star it is brighter cried the people clustering in the streets but in the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one another it is nearer they said nearer and voice after voice repeated it is nearer and the clicking telegraph took that up and it trembled along telephone wires and in a thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type it is nearer men writing in offices struck with strange realization flung down their pens men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in those words it is nearer it hurried along awakening streets it was shouted down the froststilled ways of quiet villages men who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellowlit doorways shouting the news to the passersby it is nearer pretty women flushed and glittering heard the news told jestingly between dances and feigned an intelligent interest they did not feel nearer indeed how curious how clever people must be to find out things like that lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to comfort themselveslooking skyward it has need to be nearer for the nights as cold as charity dont seem much warmth from it if it is nearer all the same what is a new star to me cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her dead the schoolboy rising early for his examination work puzzled it out for himselfwith the great white star shining broad and bright through the frostflowers of his window centrifugal centripetal he said with his chin on his fist stop a planet in its flight rob it of its centrifugal force what then centripetal has it and down it falls into the sun and this do we come in the way i wonder the light of that day went the way of its brethren and with the later watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again and it was now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of itself rising huge in the sunset hour in a south african city a great man had married and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride even the skies have illuminated said the flatterer under capricorn two negro lovers daring the wild beasts and evil spirits for love of one another crouched together in a cane brake where the fireflies hovered that is our star they whispered and felt strangely comforted by the sweet brilliancy of its light the master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers from him his calculations were already finished in a small white phial there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and active for four long nights each day serene explicit patient as ever he had given his lecture to his students and then had come back at once to his momentous calculation his face was grave a little drawn and hectic from his drugged activity for some time he seemed lost in thought then he went to the window and the blind went up with a click half way up the sky over the clustering roofs chimneys and steeples of the city hung the star he looked at it as one might look into the eye of a brave enemy you may kill me he said after a silence but i can hold youand all the universe for that matterin the grip of this little brain i would not change even now he looked at the little phial there will be no need of sleep again he said the next day at noon punctual to the minute he entered his lecture theater put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was and carefully selected a large piece of chalk it was a joke among his students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers and once he had been stricken to impotence by their hiding his supply he came and looked under his gray eyebrows at the rising tiers of young fresh faces and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of phrasing circumstances have arisencircumstances beyond my control he said and paused which will debar me from completing the course i had designed it would seem gentlemen if i may put the thing clearly and briefly thatman has lived in vain the students glanced at one another had they heard aright mad raised eyebrows and grinning lips there were but one or two faces remained intent upon his calm grayfringed face it will be interesting he was saying to devote this morning to an exposition so far as i can make it clear to you of the calculations that have led me to this conclusion let us assume he turned toward the blackboard meditating a diagram in the way that was usual to him what was that about lived in vain whispered one student to another listen said the other nodding toward the lecturer and presently they began to understand that night the star rose later for its proper eastward motion had carried it some way across leo toward virgo and its brightness was so great that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose and every star and planet was hidden save only jupiter near the zenith capella aldebaran sirius and the pointers of the bear it was white and beautiful in many parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled it about it was perceptibly larger in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter of the size of the moon the frost was still on the ground in england but the world was as brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight one could see to read quite ordinary print by that cold clear light and in the cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan and everywhere the world was awake that night and throughout christendom a somber murmur hung in the keen air over the countryside like the buzzing of the bees in the heather and this murmurous tumult grew to a clangor in the cities it was the tolling of the bells in a million belfry towers and steeples summoning the people to sleep no more to sin no more but to gather in their churches and pray and overhead growing larger and brighter as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed rose the dazzling star and the streets and houses were alight in all the cities the shipyards glared and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all night long and in all the seas about the civilized lands ships with throbbing engines and ships with bellying sails crowded with men and living creatures were standing out to ocean and the north for already the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed over the world and translated into a hundred tongues the new planet and neptune locked in a fiery embrace were whirling headlong ever faster and faster toward the sun already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred miles and every second its terrific velocity increased as it flew its course it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it but near its destined path as yet only slightly perturbed spun the mighty planet jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid around the sun every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger and the result of that attraction inevitably jupiter would be deflected from its orbit to a new elliptical path and the burning star swung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush would describe a curved path and perhaps collide with and certainly pass close to our earth earthquakes volcanic outbreaks cyclones sea waves floods and a steady rise in temperature to i know not what limitso prophesied the master mathematician and overhead to carry out his words lonely and cold and livid blazed the star of the coming doom to many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached it seemed that it was visibly approaching and that night too the weather changed and the frost that had gripped all central europe and france and england softened towards a thaw but you must not imagine because i have spoken of people praying through the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing towards mountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because of the star as a matter of fact use and wont still ruled the world and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendor of the night nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations in all the cities the shops save one here and there opened and closed at their proper hours the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades and workers gathered in the factories soldiers drilled scholars studied lovers sought one another thieves lurked and fled politicians planned their schemes the presses of the newspapers roared through the nights and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish panic the newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year for then too people had anticipated the end the star was no starmere gasa comet and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth there was no precedent for such a thing common sense was sturdy everywhere scornful jesting a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful that night at by greenwich time the star would be at its nearest to jupiter then the world would see the turn things would take the master mathematicians grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate selfadvertisement common sense at last a little heated by argument signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed so too barbarism and savagery already tired of the novelty went about their nightly business and save for a howling dog here and there the beastworld left the star unheeded and yet when at last the watchers in the european states saw their star rise an hour later it is true but no larger than it had been the night before there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master mathematicianto take the danger as if it had passed but hereafter the laughter ceased the star grewit grew with a terrible steadiness hour after hour a little larger each hour a little nearer the midnight zenith and brighter and brighter until it had turned night into day had it come straight to the earth instead of in a curved path had it lost no velocity to jupiter it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet the next night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to english eyes and the thaw was assured it rose over america nearly the size of the moon but blinding white to look at and hot and a breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and gathering strength and in virginia and brazil and down the st lawrence valley it shone intermittently through a driving reek of thunder clouds flickering violet lightning and hail unprecedented in manitoba were a thaw and devastating floods and upon the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt that night and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and turbid and soonin their upper reaches with swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men they rose steadily steadily in the ghostly brilliance and came trickling over their banks at last behind the flying population of their valleys and along the coast of argentina and up the south atlantic tides were higher than they had ever been in the memory of man and the storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland drowning whole cities and so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow the earthquakes began and grew until all down america from the arctic circle to cape horn hillsides were sliding fissures were opening and houses and walls crumbling to destruction china was lit glowing white but over japan and java and all the islands of eastern asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its coming above were the lava hot gases and ash and below the seething floods and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake shocks soon the immemorial snows of tibet and the himalayas were melting and pouring down by ten million deepening converging channels upon the plains of burma and hindustan the tangled summits of the indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that struggled feebly and reflected the blood red tongues of fire and in a ungovernable confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad riverways to that one last hope of menthe open sea larger grew the star and larger hotter and brighter with a terrible swiftness now the tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence and the whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged incessantly speckled with stormtossed ships and then came a wonder it seemed to those who in europe watched for the rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation in a thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill watched for that rising in vain hour followed hour through a terrible suspense and the star rose not once again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had counted lost to them forever in england it was hot and clear overhead though the ground quivered perpetually but in the tropics sirius and capella and aldebaran showed through a veil of steam and when at last the great star rose near ten hours late the sun rose close upon it and in the center of its white heart was a disk of black over asia the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the sky and then suddenly as it hung over india its light had been veiled all the plain of india from the mouth of the indus to the mouths of the ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night out of which rose temples and palaces mounds and hills black with people every minaret was a clustering mass of people who fell one by one into the turbid waters as heat and terror overcame them the whole land seemed awailing and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair and a breath of cold wind and a gathering of clouds out of the cooling air men looking up nearly blinded at the star and saw that black disk creeping across the light it was the moon coming between the star and the earth and even as men cried to god at this respite out of the east with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun and then star sun and moon rushed together across the heavens so it was that presently to the european watchers star and sun rose close upon each other drove headlong for a space and then slower and at last came to rest star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the zenith of the sky the moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the brilliance of the sky and though those who were still alive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that hunger fatigue heat and despair engender there were still men who could perceive the meaning of these signs star and earth had been at their nearest had swung about one another and the star had passed already it was receding swifter and swifter in the last stage of its headlong journey downward into the sun and then the clouds gathered blotting out the vision of the sky the thunder and lightning wove a garment around the world all over the earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never seen before and where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents of mud everywhere the waters were pouring off the land leaving mud stilted ruins and the earth littered like a stormworn beach with all that had floated and the dead bodies of the men and brutes its children for days the water streamed off the land sweeping away soil and trees and houses in the way and piling huge dikes and scooping out titanic gullies over the countryside those were the days of darkness that followed the star and the heat all through them and for many weeks and months the earthquakes continued but the star had passed and men hungerdriven and gathering courage only slowly might creep back to their ruined cities buried granaries and sodden fields such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time came stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously through the new marks and shoals of once familiar ports and as the storms subsided men perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore and the sun larger and the moon shrunk to a third of its size took now fourscore days between its new and new but of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men of the saving of laws and machines of the strange change that had iceland and greenland the shores of baffins bay so that the sailors coming there presently found them green and gracious and could scarce believe their eyes this story does not tell nor of the movement of mankind now that the earth was hotter northward and southward towards the poles of the earth it concerns itself only with the coming and the passing of the star the martian astronomersfor there are astronomers on mars although they are different beings from menwere naturally profoundly interested by these things they saw them from their own standpoint of course considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun one wrote it is astonishing what little damage the earth which it missed so narrowly has sustained all the familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain intact and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discoloration supposed to be frozen water round either pole which only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophies may seem at a distance of a few million miles transcribers note this story appeared in the june issue of
