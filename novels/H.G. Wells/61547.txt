chapter page the prologue in heaven at sea view sundering on sea the three visitors do we truly die elihu reproves job the operation letters and a telegram the undying fire chapter the first the prologue in heaven two eternal beings magnificently enhaloed the one in a blinding excess of white radiance and the other in a bewildering extravagance of colours converse amidst stupendous surroundings these surroundings are by tradition palatial but there is now also a marked cosmic tendency about them they have no definite locality they are above and comprehensive of the material universe there is a quality in the scene as if a futurist with a considerable knowledge of modern chemical and physical speculation and some obscure theological animus had repainted the designs of a pre raphaelite the vast pillars vanish into unfathomable darknesses and the complicated curves and whorls of the decorations seem to have been traced by the flight of elemental particles suns and planets spin and glitter through the avanturine depths of a floor of crystalline ether great winged shapes are in attendance wrought of iridescences and bearing globes stars rolls of the law flaming swords and similar symbols the voices of the cherubim and seraphim can be heard crying continually holy holy holy now as in the ancient story it is a reception of the sons of god the master of the gathering to whom one might reasonably attribute a sublime boredom seeing that everything that can possibly happen is necessarily known to him displays on the contrary as lively an interest in his interlocutor as ever this interlocutor is of course satan the unexpected the contrast of these two eternal beings is very marked while the deity veiled and almost hidden in light with his hair like wool and his eyes like the blue of infinite space conveys an effect of stable remote and mountainous grandeur satan has the compact alertness of habitual travel he is as definite as a grip sack and he brings a flavour of initiative and even bustle upon a scene that would otherwise be one of serene perfection his halo even has a slightly travelled look he has been going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it his labels are still upon him his status in heaven remains as undefined as it was in the time of job it is uncertain to this day whether he is to be regarded as one of the sons of god or as an inexplicable intruder among them but see upon this question the encyclopdia biblica under his name whatever his origin there can be little doubt of his increasing assurance of independence and importance in the divine presence his freedom may be sanctioned or innate but he himself has no doubt remaining of the security of his personal autonomy he believes that he is a necessary accessory to god and that his incalculable quality is an indispensable relief to the acquiescences of the archangels he never misses these reunions if god is omnipresent by a calm necessity satan is everywhere by an infinite activity they engage in unending metaphysical differences into which satan has imported a tone of friendly badinage they play chess together but the chess they play is not the little ingenious game that originated in india it is on an altogether different scale the ruler of the universe creates the board the pieces and the rules he makes all the moves he may make as many moves as he likes whenever he likes his antagonist however is permitted to introduce a slight inexplicable inaccuracy into each move which necessitates further moves in correction the creator determines and conceals the aim of the game and it is never clear whether the purpose of the adversary is to defeat or assist him in his unfathomable project apparently the adversary cannot win but also he cannot lose so long as he can keep the game going but he is concerned it would seem in preventing the development of any reasoned scheme in the game celestial badinage is at once too high and broad to come readily within the compass of earthly print and understanding the satanic element of unexpectedness can fill the whole sphere of being with laughter thrills begotten of those vast reverberations startle our poor wits at the strangest moments it is the humour of satan to thrust upon the master his own title of the unique and to seek to wrest from him the authorship of life but such jesting distresses the angels i alone create but ii ferment matter i made and all things stagnant as a sleeping top but for the wabble i give it you are just the little difference of the individual you are the little uniqueness in everyone and everything the unique that breaks the law a marginal idiosyncracy sire you are the unique the uniqueness of the whole heaven smiled and there were halcyon days in the planets i shall average you out in the end and you will disappear and everything will end will be complete without me you spoil the symmetry of my universe i give it life life comes from me no sire life comes from me one of the great shapes in attendance became distinct as michael bearing his sword he blasphemes o lord shall i cast him forth but you did that some time ago answered satan speaking carelessly over his shoulder and not even looking at the speaker you keep on doing it andi am here he returns said the lord soothingly perhaps i will him to return what should we be without him without me time and space would freeze into crystalline perfection said satan and at his smile the criminal statistics of a myriad planets displayed an upward wave it is i who trouble the waters i trouble all things i am the spirit of life but the soul said god satan sitting with one arm thrown over the back of his throne towards michael raised his eyebrows by way of answer this talk about the soul he regarded as a divine weakness he knew nothing of the soul i made man in my own image said god and i made him a man of the world if it had not been for me he would still be a needless gardenerpretending to cultivate a weedless garden that grew right because it couldnt grow wrongin those endless summers the blessed ones see think of it ye powers and dominions perfect flowers perfect fruits never an autumn chill never a yellow leaf golden leopards noble lions carnivores unfulfilled purring for his caresses amidst the aimless friskings of lambs that would never grow old good lord how bored he would have been how bored instead of which did i not launch him on the most marvellous adventures it was i who gave him history up to the very limit of his possibilities up to the very limit and did not you o lord by sending your angels with their flaming swords approve of what i had done god gave no answer but that reminds me said satan unabashed the great winged shapes drew nearer for satan is the celestial raconteur he alone makes stories there was a certain man in the land of uz whose name was job we remember him we had a wager of sorts said satan it was some time ago the wager was never very distinctand now that you remind me of it there is no record of your paying did i lose or win the issue was obscured by discussion how those men did talk you intervened there was no decision you lost satan said a great being of light who bore a book the wager was whether job would lose faith in god and curse him he was afflicted in every way and particularly by the conversation of his friends but there remains an undying fire in man satan rested his dark face on his hand and looked down between his knees through the pellucid floor to that little eddying in the ether which makes our world job he said lives still then after an interval the whole earth is nowjob satan delights equally in statistics and in quoting scripture he leant back in his seat with an expression of quiet satisfaction job he said in easy narrative tones lived to a great age after his disagreeable experiences he lived one hundred and forty years he had again seven sons and three daughters and he saw his offspring for four generations so much is classical these ten children brought him seventy grandchildren who again prospered generally and had large families it was a prolific strain and now if we allow three generations to a century and the reality is rather more than that and if we take the survival rate as roughly three to a family and if we agree with your excellent bishop usher that job lived about thirty five centuries ago that gives ushow many three to the hundred and fifth power it is at any rate a sum vastly in excess of the present population of the earth you have globes and rolls and swords and stars here has anyone a slide rule but the computation was brushed aside a thousand years in my sight are but as yesterday when it is past i will grant what you seek to prove that job has become mankind the dark regard of satan smote down through the quivering universe and left the toiling light waves behind see there he said pointing my old friend on his little planetadamjobmanlike a roast on a spit it is time we had another wager god condescended to look with satan at mankind circling between day and night whether he will curse or bless whether he will even remember god i have given my promise that i will at last restore adam the downcast face smiled faintly these questions change from age to age said satan the whole remains the same the story grows longer in either direction said satan speaking as one who thinks aloud past and future unfold together when the first atoms jarred i was there and so conflict was thereand progress the days of the old story have each expanded to hundreds of millions of years now and still i am in them all the sharks and crawling monsters of the early seas the first things that crept out of the water into the jungle of fronds and stems the early reptiles the leaping and flying dragons of the great age of life the mighty beasts of hoof and horn that came later they all feared and suffered and were perplexed at last came this man of yours out of the woods hairy beetle browed and blood stained peering not too hopefully for that eden bower of the ancient story it wasnt there there never had been a garden he had fallen before he arose and the weeds and thorns are as ancient as the flowers the fall goes back in time now beyond man beyond the world beyond imagination the very stars were born in sin if we can still call it sin mused satan on a little planet this thing arises this red earth this adam this edomite this job he builds cities he tills the earth he catches the lightning and makes a slave of it he changes the breed of beast and grain clever things to do but still petty things you say that in some manner he is to come up at last to this he is too foolish and too weak his achievements only illuminate his limitations look at his little brain boxed up from growth in a skull of bone look at his bag of a body full of rags and rudiments a haggis of diseases his life is decay does he grow i do not see it has he made any perceptible step forward in quality in the last ten thousand years he quarrels endlessly and aimlessly with himself in a little while his planet will cool and freeze in the end he will rule over the stars said the voice that was above satan my spirit is in him satan shaded his face with his hand from the effulgence about him he said no more for a time but sat watching mankind as a boy might sit on the bank of a stream and watch the fry of minnows in the clear water of a shallow nay he said at last but it is incredible it is impossible i have disturbed and afflicted him long enough i have driven him as far as he can be driven but now i am moved to pity let us end this dispute it has been interesting but nowis it not enough it grows cruel he has reached his limit let us give him a little peace now lord a little season of sunshine and plenty and then some painless universal pestilence and so let him die he is immortal and he does but begin he is mortal and near his end at times no doubt he has a certain air that seems to promise understanding and mastery in his world it is but an air give me the power to afflict and subdue him but a little and after a few squeaks of faith and hope he will whine and collapse like any other beast he will behave like any kindred creature with a smaller brain and a larger jaw he too is doomed to suffer to no purpose to struggle by instinct merely to live to endure for a season and then to pass give me but the power and you shall see his courage snap like a rotten string you may do all that you will to him only you must not slay him for my spirit is in him that he will cast out of his own accordwhen i have ruined his hopes mocked his sacrifices blackened his skies and filled his veins with torture but it is too easy to do let me just slay him now and end his story then let us begin another a different one and something more amusing let us for example put brainsand this soul of yoursinto the ants or the bees or the beavers or take up the octopus already a very tactful and intelligent creature no but do as you have said satan for you also are my instrument try man to the uttermost see if he is indeed no more than a little stir amidst the slime a fuss in the mud that signifies nothing the satan his face hidden in shadow seemed not to hear this but remained still and intent upon the world of men and as that brown figure with its vast halo like the worn tail of some fiery peacock brooded high over the realms of being this that follows happened to a certain man upon the earth chapter the second at sea view sundering on sea in an uncomfortable armchair of slippery black horsehair in a mean apartment at sundering on sea sat a sick man staring dully out of the window it was an oppressive day hot under a leaden sky there was scarcely a movement in the air save for the dull thudding of the gun practice at shorehamstow a multitude of flies crawled and buzzed fitfully about the room and ever and again some chained up cur in the neighbourhood gave tongue to its discontent the window looked out upon a vacant building lot a waste of scorched grass and rusty rubbish surrounded by a fence of barrel staves and barbed wire between the ruinous notice board of some pre war building enterprise and the gaunt verandah of a convalescent home on which the motionless blue forms of two despondent wounded men in deck chairs were visible came the sea view which justified the name of the house beyond a wide waste of mud over which quivered the heat tormented air the still anger of the heavens lowered down to meet in a line of hard conspiracy the steely criminality of the remote deserted sea the man in the chair flapped his hand and spoke you accursed creature he said why did god make flies after a long interval he sighed deeply and repeated why he made a fitful effort to assume a more comfortable position and relapsed at last into his former attitude of brooding despondency when presently his landlady came in to lay the table for lunch an almost imperceptible wincing alone betrayed his sense of the threatening swish and emphasis of her movements she was manifestly heated by cooking and a smell of burnt potatoes had drifted in with her appearance she was a meagre little woman with a resentful manner glasses pinched her sharp red nose and as she spread out the grey white diaper and rapped down the knives and forks in their places she glanced at him darkly as if his inattention aggrieved her twice she was moved to speak and did not do so but at length she could endure his indifference no longer still feeling ill i suppose mr uss she said in the manner of one who knows only too well what the answer will be he started at the sound of her voice and gave her his attention as if with an effort i beg your pardon mrs croome the landlady repeated with acerbity i arst if you was still feeling ill mr uss he did not look at her when he replied but glanced towards her out of the corner of his eyes yes he said yes i am i am afraid i am ill she made a noise of unfriendly confirmation that brought his face round to her but mind you mrs croome i dont want mrs huss worried about it she has enough to trouble her just now quite enough misfortunes dont ever come singly said mrs croome with quiet satisfaction leaning across the table to brush some spilt salt from off the cloth to the floor she was not going to make any rash promises about mrs huss we ave to bear up with what is put upon us said mrs croome we ave to find strength where strength is to be found she stood up and regarded him with pensive malignity very likely all you want is a tonic of some sort very likely youve just let yourself go i shouldnt be surprised the sick man gave no welcome to this suggestion if you was to go round to the young doctor at the cornerbarrack isnameisvery likely hed put you right everybody says hes very clever not that me and croome put much faith in doctors nor need to but youre in a different position the man in the chair had been to see the young doctor at the corner twice already but he did not want to discuss that interview with mrs croome just then i must think about it he said evasively after all it isnt fair to yourself it isnt fair to others to sicken forit might be anythinkwithout proper advice sitting there and doing nothing especially in lodgings at this time of year it isnt wellnot what i call considerate exactly said mr huss weakly theres homes and hospitals properly equipped the sick man nodded his head appreciatively if things are nipped in the bud theyre nipped in the bud otherwise they grow and make trouble it was exactly what her hearer was thinking mrs croome ducked to the cellarette of a gaunt sideboard and rapped out a whisky bottle a bottle of lime juice and a soda water syphon upon the table she surveyed her handiwork with a critical eye cruet she whispered and vanished from the room leaving the door after a tormenting phase of creaking to slam by its own weight behind her the invalid raised his hand to his forehead and found it wet with perspiration his hand was trembling violently my god he whispered this mans name was job huss his father had been called job before him and so far as the family tradition extended the eldest son had always been called job four weeks ago he would have been esteemed by most people a conspicuously successful and enviable man and then had come a swift rush of disaster he had been the headmaster of the great modern public school at woldingstanton in norfolk a revived school under the papermakers guild of the city of london he had given himself without stint to its establishment and he had made a great name in the world for it and for himself he had been the first english schoolmaster to liberate the modern side from the entanglement of its lower forms with the classical masters it was the only school in england where spanish and russian were honestly taught his science laboratories were the best school laboratories in great britain and perhaps in the world and his new methods in the teaching of history and politics brought a steady stream of foreign inquirers to woldingstanton the hand of the adversary had touched him first just at the end of the summer term there had been an epidemic of measles in which through the inexplicable negligence of a trusted nurse two boys had died on the afternoon of the second of these deaths an assistant master was killed by an explosion in the chemical laboratory then on the very last night of the term came the school house fire in which two of the younger boys were burnt to death against any single one of these misfortunes mr huss and his school might have maintained an unbroken front but their quick succession had a very shattering effect every circumstance conspired to make these events vividly dreadful to mr huss he had been the first to come to the help of his chemistry master who had fallen among some carboys of acid and though still alive and struggling was blinded nearly faceless and hopelessly mangled the poor fellow died before he could be extricated on the night of the fire mr huss strained himself internally and bruised his foot very painfully and he himself found and carried out the charred body of one of the two little victims from the room in which they had been trapped by the locking of a door during some last day ragging it added an element of exasperating inconvenience to his greater distresses that all his papers and nearly all his personal possessions were burnt on the morning after the fire mr husss solicitor committed suicide he was an old friend to whom mr huss had entrusted the complete control of the savings that were to secure him and mrs huss a dignified old age the lawyer was a man of strong political feelings and liberal views and he had bought roubles to his utmost for mr huss as for himself in order to demonstrate his confidence in the russian revolution all these things had a quite sufficiently disorganizing effect upon mr huss upon his wife the impression they made was altogether disastrous she was a worthy but emotional lady effusive rather than steadfast like the wives of most schoolmasters she had been habitually preoccupied with matters of domestic management for many years and her first reaction was in the direction of a bitter economy mingled with a display of contempt she had never manifested hitherto for her husbands practical ability far better would it have been for mr huss if she had broken down altogether she insisted upon directing everything and doing so with a sort of pitiful vehemence that brooked no contradiction it was impossible to stay at woldingstanton through the vacation in sight of the tragic and blackened ruins of school house and so she decided upon sundering on sea because of its nearness and its pre war reputation for cheapness there she announced her husband must pull himself together and pick up and then return to the rebuilding of school house and the rehabilitation of the school many formalities had to be gone through before the building could be put in hand for in those days britain was at the extremity of her war effort and labour and material were unobtainable without special permits and great exertion sundering on sea was as convenient a place as anywhere from which to write letters but his idea of going to london to see influential people was resisted by mrs huss on the score of the expense and overcome when he persisted in it by a storm of tears on her arrival at sundering mrs huss put up at the railway hotel for the night and spent the next morning in a stern visitation of possible lodgings something in the unassuming outlook of sea view attracted her and after a long dispute she was able to beat down mrs croomes demand from five to four and a half guineas a week that afternoon some importunate applicant in an extremity of homelessnessfor there had been a sudden rush of visitors to sunderingoffered six guineas mrs croome tried to call off her first bargain but mrs huss was obdurate and thereafter all the intercourse of landlady and her lodgers went to the unspoken refrain of i get four and a half guineas and i ought to get six to recoup herself mrs croome attempted to make extra charges for the use of the bathroom for cooking after five oclock for cleaning mr husss brown boots with specially bought brown cream instead of blacking and for the ink used by him in his very voluminous correspondence upon all of which points there was much argument and bitterness but a heavier blow than any they had hitherto experienced was now to fall upon mr and mrs huss job in the ancient story had seven sons and three daughters and they were all swept away this job was to suffer a sharper thrust he had but one dear only son a boy of great promise who had gone into the royal flying corps news came that he had been shot down over the german lines unhappily there had been a conflict between mr and mrs huss about this boy huss had been proud that the youngster should choose the heroic service mrs huss had done her utmost to prevent his joining it the poor lady was now ruthless in her anguish she railed upon him as the murderer of their child she hoped he was pleased with his handiwork he could count one more name on his list he could add it to the roll of honour in the chapel with the others her baby boy this said she went wailing from the room the wretched man sat confounded that with the others cut him to the heart for the school chapel had a list of vcs dcms and the like second to none and it had indeed been a pride to him for some days his soul was stunned he was utterly exhausted and lethargic he could hardly attend to the most necessary letters from dignity hope and a great sheaf of activities his life had shrunken abruptly to the compass of this dingy lodging pervaded by the squabbling of two irrational women his work in the world was in ruins he had no strength left in him to struggle against fate and a vague internal pain crept slowly into his consciousness his wife insane now and cruel with sorrow tried to put a great quarrel upon him about wearing mourning for their son he had always disliked and spoken against these pomps of death but she insisted that whatever callousness he might display she at least must wear black he might she said rest assured that she would spend no more money than the barest decency required she would buy the cheapest material and make it up in her bedroom but black she must have this resolution led straight to a conflict with mrs croome who objected to her best bedroom being littered with bits of black stuff and cancelled the loan of her sewing machine the mourning should be made mrs huss insisted though she had to sew every stitch of it by hand and the poor distraught lady in her silly parsimony made still deeper trouble for herself by cutting her material in every direction half an inch or more short of the paper pattern she came almost to a physical tussle with mrs croome because of the state of the carpet and counterpane and mrs croome did her utmost to drag mr huss into an altercation upon the matter with her husband croome dont interfere much but some things he or nobody aint going to stand mr uss for some days in this battlefield of insatiable grief and petty cruelty and with a dull pain steadily boring its way to recognition mr huss forced himself to carry on in a fashion the complex of business necessitated by the school disaster then in the night came a dream as dreams sometimes will to enlighten him upon his bodily condition projecting from his side he saw a hard white body that sent round wormlike tentacles into every corner of his being a number of doctors were struggling to tear this thing away from him at every effort the pain increased he awoke but the pain throbbed on he lay quite still upon the heavy darkness he saw the word cancer bright red and glowingas pain glows he argued in the face of invincible conviction he kept the mood conditional if it be so he said though he knew that the thing was so what should he do there would have to be operations great expenses enfeeblement whom could he ask for advice who would help him suppose in the morning he were to take a bathing ticket as if he meant to bathe and struggle out beyond the mud flats he could behave as though cramp had taken him suddenly five minutes of suffocation he would have to force himself through and then peaceendless peace no he said with a sudden gust of courage i will fight it out to the end but his mind was too dull to form plans and physically he was afraid he would have to find a doctor somehow and even that little task appalled him then he would have to tell mrs huss for a time he lay quite still as if he listened to the alternative swell and diminuendo of his pain oh if i had someone to help me he whispered and was overcome by the lonely misery of his position if i had someone for years he had never wept but now tears were wrung from him he rolled over and buried his face in the pillow and tried to wriggle his body away from that steady gnawing he fretted as a child might do the night about him was as it were a great watching presence that would not help nor answer behind the brass plate at the corner which said dr elihu barrack mr huss found a hard competent young man who had returned from the war to his practice at sundering after losing a leg the mechanical substitute seemed to have taken to him very kindly he appeared to be both modest and resourceful his unfavourable diagnosis was all the more convincing because it was tentative and conditional he knew the very specialist for the case no less a surgeon than sir alpheus mengo came it happened quite frequently to play golf on the sundering links it would be easy to arrange for him to examine mr huss in dr barracks little consulting room and if an operation had to be performed it could be managed with a minimum of expense in mr husss own lodgings without any extra charge for mileage and the like of course said mr huss of course with a clear vision of mrs croome confronted with the proposal sir alpheus mengo came down the next saturday and made a clandestine examination he decided to operate the following week end mr huss was left at his own request to break the news to his wife and to make the necessary arrangements for this use of mrs croomes rooms but it was two days before he could bring himself to broach the matter he sat now listening to the sounds of his wife moving about in the bedroom overhead and to the muffled crashes that intimated the climax of mrs croomes preparation of the midday meal he heard her calling upstairs to know whether mrs huss was ready for her to serve up he was seized with panic as a schoolboy might be who had not prepared his lesson he tried hastily to frame some introductory phrases but nothing would come into his mind save terms of disgust and lamentation the sullen heat of the day mingled in one impression with his pain he was nauseated by the smell of cooking he felt it would be impossible to sit up at table and pretend to eat the meal of burnt bacon and potatoes that was all too evidently coming it came its progress along the passage was announced by a clatter of dishes the door was opened by a kick mrs croome put the feast upon the table with something between defence and defiance in her manner what else she seemed to intimate could one expect for four and a half guineas a week in the very height of the season from a woman who could have got six your dinners there mrs croome called upstairs to mrs huss in tones of studied negligence and then retired to her own affairs in the kitchen slamming the door behind her the room quivered down to silence and then mr huss could hear the footsteps of his wife crossing the bedroom and descending the staircase mrs huss was a dark graceful and rather untidy lady of seven and forty with the bridling bearing of one who habitually repels implicit accusations she lifted the lid of the vegetable dish i thought i smelt burning she said the woman is impossible she stood by her chair regarding her husband and waiting he rose reluctantly and transferred himself to a seat at table it had always been her custom to carve she now prepared to serve him no he said full of loathing i cant eat i cant she put down the tablespoon and fork she had just raised and regarded him with eyes of dark disapproval its all we can get she said he shook his head it isnt that i dont know what you expect me to get for you here she complained the tradesmen dont know usand dont care it isnt that im ill its the heat we are all ill everyone in such weather as this its no excuse for not making an effort situated as we are i mean i am really ill i am in pain she looked at him as one might look at an unreasonable child he was constrained to more definite statement i suppose i must tell you sooner or later ive had to see a doctor without consulting me i thought if it turned out to be fancy i neednt bother you but how did you find a doctor theres a fellow at the corner oh its no good making a long story of it i have cancer nothing will do but an operation self pity wrung him he controlled a violent desire to cry i am too ill to eat i ought to be lying down she flopped back in her chair and stared at him as one stares at some hideous monstrosity oh she said to have cancer now in these lodgings i cant help it he said in accents that were almost a whine i didnt choose the time cancer she cried reproachfully the horror of it he looked at her for a moment with hate in his heart he saw under her knitted brows dark and hostile eyes that had once sparkled with affection he saw a loose mouth with downturned corners that had been proud and pretty and this mask of dislike was projecting forward upon a neck he had used to call her head stalk so like had it seemed to the stem of some pretty flower she had had lovely shoulders and an impudent humour and now the skin upon her neck and shoulders had a little loosened and she was no longer impudent but harsh her brows were moist with heat and her hair more than usually astray but these things did not increase they mitigated his antagonism they did not repel him as defects they hurt him as wounds received in a common misfortune always he had petted and spared and rejoiced in her vanity and weakness and now as he realized the full extent of her selfish abandonment a protective pity arose in his heart that overcame his physical pain it was terrible to see how completely her delicacy and tenderness of mind had been broken down she had neither the strength nor the courage left even for an unselfish thought and he could not help her whatever power he had possessed over her mind had gone long ago his magic had departed latterly he had been thinking very much of her prospects if he were to die in some ways his death might be a good thing for her he had an endowment assurance running that would bring in about seven thousand pounds immediately at his death but which would otherwise involve heavy annual payments for some years so far to die would be clear gain but who would invest this money for her and look after her interests she was he knew very silly about property suspicious of people she knew intimately and greedy and credulous with strangers he had helped to make her incompetent and he owed it to her to live and protect her if he could and behind that intimate and immediate reason for living he had a strong sense of work in the world yet to be done by him and a task in education still incomplete he spoke with his chin in his hand and his eyes staring at the dark and distant sea an operation he said might cure me her thoughts it became apparent had been travelling through some broken and unbeautiful country roughly parallel with the course of his own but need there be an operation she thought aloud are they ever any good i could die he admitted bitterly and repented as he spoke there had been times he remembered when she had said and done sweet and gallant things poor soul poor broken companion and now she had fallen into a darkness far greater than his he had feared that he had hurt her and then when he saw that she was not hurt and that she scrutinized his face eagerly as if she weighed the sincerity of his words his sense of utter loneliness was completed over his mean drama of pain and debasement in its close atmosphere buzzing with flies it was as if some gigantic and remorseless being watched him as a man of science might hover over some experiment and marked his life and all his world you are alone this brooding witness counselled you are utterly alone curse god and die it seemed a long time before mr huss answered this imagined voice and when he answered it he spoke as if he addressed his wife alone no he said with a sudden decisiveness no i will face that operation we are ill and our hearts are faint neither for you dear nor for me must our story finish in this fashion no i shall go on to the end and have your operation here in this house it is by far the most convenient place as things are you may die here well i shall die fighting leaving me here with mrs croome his temper broke under her reply leaving you here with mrs croome he said harshly he got up i can eat nothing he repeated and dropped back sullenly into the horsehair armchair there was a long silence and then he heard the little almost mouselike movements of his wife as she began her meal for a while he had forgotten the dull ache within him but now glowing and fading and glowing it made its way back into his consciousness he was helpless and perplexed he had not meant to quarrel he had hurt this poor thing who had been his love and companion he had bullied her his clogged brain could think of nothing to set matters right he stared with dull eyes at a world utterly hateful to him chapter the third the three visitors while this unhappy conversation was occurring at sundering on sea three men were discussing the case of mr huss very earnestly over a meatless but abundant lunch in the bow window of a club that gives upon the trees and sunshine of carlton gardens lobster salad engaged them and the ice in the jug of hock cup clinked very pleasantly as they replenished their glasses the host was sir eliphaz burrows the patentee and manufacturer of those temanite building blocks which have not only revolutionized the construction of army hutments but put the whole problem of industrial and rural housing upon an altogether new footing his guests were mr william dad formerly the maker of the celebrated dad and showhite car de luxe and now one of the chief contractors for aeroplanes in england and mr joseph farr the head of the technical section of woldingstanton school both the former gentlemen were governors of that foundation and now immensely rich and sir eliphaz had once been a pupil of the father of mr huss and had played a large part in the appointment of the latter to woldingstanton he was a slender old man with an avid vulturine head poised on a long red neck and he had an abundance of parti coloured hair red and white springing from a circle round the crown of his head from his eyebrows his face generally and the backs of his hands he wore a blue soft shirt with a turn down collar within a roomy blue serge suit and that and something about his large loose black tie suggested scholarship and refinement his manners were elaborately courteous mr dad was a compacter keener type warily alert in his bearing an industrial fox terrier from the midlands silver haired and dressed in ordinary morning dress except for a tan vest with a bright brown ribbon border mr farr was big in a grey flannel norfolk suit he had a large round white shiny clean shaven face and uneasy hands and it was apparent that he carried pocket books and suchlike luggage in his breast pocket they consumed the lobster appreciatively and approached in a fragmentary and tentative manner the business that had assembled them namely the misfortunes that had overwhelmed mr huss and their bearing upon the future of the school for my part i dont think there is such a thing as misfortune said mr dad i dont hold with it miscalculation if you like in a sense said mr farr ambiguously glancing at sir eliphaz if a man keeps his head screwed on the right way said mr dad and attacked a claw with hope and appetite mr dad affected the parsimony of unfinished sentences i cant help thinking said sir eliphaz putting down his glass and wiping his moustache and eyebrows with care before resuming his lobster that a man who entrusts his affairs to a solicitor after the fashion of the widow and orphan must be singularly lacking in judgment or reckless never in the whole course of my life have i met a solicitor who could invest money safely and profitably clergymen i have known women of all sorts savages monomaniacs criminals but never solicitors i have known some smart business parsons said mr dad judicially one in particular sharp as nails they are a much underestimated class perhaps it is natural that a solicitor should be a wild investor sir eliphaz pursued his subject he lives out of the ordinary world in a dirty little office in some antiquated inn his office fittings are fifty years out of date his habitual scenery consists of tin boxes painted with the names of dead and disreputable clients he has to take the law courts filled with horseboxes and men dressed up in gowns and horsehair wigs quite seriously nobody ever goes near him but abnormal people or people in abnormal states people upset by jealousy people upset by fear blackmailed people cheats trying to dodge the law lunatics litigants and legatees the only investments he ever discusses are queer investments naturally he loses all sense of proportion naturally he becomes insanely suspicious and when a client asks for positive action he flounders and gambles naturally said mr dad and here we find poor huss giving all his business over exactly said sir eliphaz and filled his glass theres been a great change in him in the last two years said mr farr he let the war worry him for one thing no good doing that said mr dad and even before the war sir eliphaz even before the war said mr farr in a pause there was a change said sir eliphaz he had been bitten by educational theories no business for a headmaster said mr farr our intention had always been a great scientific and technical school said sir eliphaz he introduced logic into the teaching of plain englishagainst my opinion he encouraged some of the boys to read philosophy all he could said mr farr i never held with his fad for teaching history said mr dad he was history mad it got worse and worse whats history after all at the best its over and done with but he wouldnt argue upon itnot reasonably he wasoverbearing he had a way of looking at you it was never our intention to make woldingstanton into a school of history and now mr farr said sir eliphaz what are the particulars of the fire it isnt for me to criticize said mr farr what i say said mr dad projecting his muzzle with an appearance of great determination is fix responsibility fix responsibility here is a door locked that common sense dictated should be open who was responsible no one in school house seems to have been especially responsible for that door so far as i can ascertain said mr farr all responsibility said mr dad with an expression of peevish insistence as though mr farr had annoyed him all responsibility that is not delegated rests with the head thats a hard and fast and primary rule of business organization in my factory i say quite plainly to everyone who comes into it man or woman chick or child mr dad was still explaining in a series of imaginary dialogues tersely but dramatically his methods of delegating authority when sir eliphaz cut across the flow with returning to mr huss for a moment the point that sir eliphaz wanted to get at was whether mr huss expected to continue headmaster at woldingstanton from some chance phrase in a letter sir eliphaz rather gathered that he did well said mr farr portentously letting the thing hang for a moment he does tcha said mr dad and shut his mouth tightly and waved his head slowly from side to side with knitted brows as if he had bitten his tongue i would be the first to recognize the splendid work he did for the school in his opening years said mr farr i would be the last to alter the broad lines of the work as he set it out barring that i should replace a certain amount of the biological teaching and practically all this new history stuff by chemistry and physics but one has to admit that mr huss did not know when to relinquish power nor when to devolve responsibility we all of us the entire staffit is no mere personal grievance of minewere kept well to say the least of it in tutelage rather than let authority go definitely out of his hands he would allow things to drift witness that door witness the business of the nurse mr dad with his lips compressed nodded his head each nod like the tap of a hammer i never believed in all this overdoing history in the school mr dad remarked rather disconnectedly if you get rid of latin and greek why bring it all back again in another form why im told he taught em things about assyria assyria a modern school ought to be a modern schoolbusiness first and business last and business all the time and teach boys to work we shall need it mark my words a certain amount of modern culture waved sir eliphaz modern said mr farr softly mr dad grunted in my opinion that sort of thing gives the boys ideas mr farr steered his way discreetly science with a due regard to its technical applications should certainly be the substantial part of a modern education they were in the smoking room and half way through three princely cigars before they got beyond such fragmentary detractions of the fallen headmaster then mr dad in the clear cut style of a business man brought his companions to action well said mr dad turning abruptly upon sir eliphaz what about it it is manifest that woldingstanton has to enter on a new phase what has happened brings us to the parting of the ways said sir eliphaz much as i regret the misfortunes of an old friend that said mr dad spells farr if he will shoulder the burthen said sir eliphaz smiling upon mr farr not so much with his mouth as by the most engaging convolutions curvatures and waving about of his various strands of hair i dont want to see the school go down said mr farr ive given it a good slice of my life right said mr dad right file that that suits us and now how do we set about the affair the next thing i take it is to break it to huss how he paused to give the ideas of his companions a fair chance well my idea is this none of us want to be hard on mr huss luck has been hard enough as it is we want to do this job as gently as we can it happens that i go and play golf at sundering on sea ever and again excellent links well kept up all things considered and the big hotel close by does you wonderfully the railway company sees to that in spite of the war well why shouldnt we all if sir eliphazs engagements permit go down there in a sort of casual way and take the opportunity of a good clear talk with him and settle it all up the things got to be done and it seems to me altogether more kindly to go there personally and put it to him than do it by correspondence very likely we could put it to him in such a way that he himself would suggest the very arrangement we want you particularly sir eliphaz being as you say an old friend since there was little likelihood of mr huss going away from sundering on sea it did not appear necessary to mr dad to apprise him of the projected visitation and so these three gentlemen heard nothing about any operation for cancer until they reached that resort mr dad came down early on friday afternoon to the golf hotel where he had already engaged rooms for the party he needed the relaxation of the links very badly the task of accumulating a balance sufficiently large to secure an opulent future for british industry with which mr dad in his straightforward way identified himself was one that in a controlled establishment between the scylla of aggressive labour and the charybdis of the war profits tax strained his mind to the utmost he was joined by mr farr at dinner time and sir eliphaz who was detained in london by some negotiations with the american government arrived replete by the dining car train mr farr made a preliminary reconnaissance at sea view and was the first to hear of the operation sir alpheus mengo was due at sea view by the first morning train on saturday he had arranged to operate before lunch it was clear therefore that the only time available for a conversation between the three and mr huss was between breakfast and the arrival of sir alpheus mr huss whose lethargy had now departed displayed himself feverishly anxious to talk about the school there are points i must make clear he said vital points and so a meeting was arranged for half past nine this would give a full hour before the arrival of the doctors he feels that in a way it will be his testament so to speak said mr farr naturally he has his own ideas about the future of the school we all have i would be the last person to suggest that he could say anything about woldingstanton that would not be well worth hearing some of us may have heard most of it before and be better able to discount some of his assertions but that under the present circumstances is neither here nor there matters in the confined space of sea view were not nearly so strained as mr huss had feared the prospect of an operation was not without its agreeable side to mrs croome possibly she would have preferred that the subject should have been mrs rather than mr huss but it was clear that she made no claim to dictate upon this point her demand for special fees to meet the inconveniences of the occasion had been met quite liberally by mr huss and there was a genuine appreciation of order and method in mrs croome she was a furious spring cleaner a hurricane tidier up her feeling for the discursive state of mrs husss hair was almost as involuntary as a racial animosity and the swift dexterous preparations of the nurse who presently came to convert the best bedroom to surgical uses impressed her deeply she was allowed to help superfluous hangings and furnishings were removed everything was thoroughly scrubbed at the last moment clean linen sheets of a wonderful hardness were to be spread over every exposed surface they were to be brought in sterilized drums the idea of sterilized drums fascinated her she had never heard of such things before she wished she could keep her own linen in a sterilized drum always and let her lodgers have something else instead she felt she was going to be a sort of assistant priestess at a sacrifice the sacrifice of mr huss she had always secretly feared his submissive quiet as a thing unaccountable that might at any time turn upon her she suspected him of ironies and he would be helpless under chloroform subject to examination with no possibilities of disconcerting repartee she did her best to persuade dr barrack that she would be useful in the room during the proceedings her imagination conjured up a wonderful vision of the huss interior as a great chest full of strange and interesting viscera with the lid wide open and sir alpheus picking thoughtfully with deprecatory remarks amid its contents but that sight was denied her she was very helpful and cheerful on the saturday morning addressing herself to the consolation of mr and the bracing up of mrs huss she assisted in the final transformation of the room it might be a real ospital she said nursing must be nice work i never thought of it like this before mr huss was no longer depressed but flushed and resolute but mrs huss wounded by the neglect of everyoneno one seemed to consider for a moment what she must be feelingremained very much in her own room working inefficiently upon the mourning that might now be doubly needed mr huss knew mr farr very well for the last ten years it had been his earnest desire to get rid of him but he had been difficult to replace because of his real accomplishment in technical chemistry in the course of their five minutes talk in his bedroom on friday evening mr huss grasped the situation woldingstanton his creation his life work was to be taken out of his hands and in favour of this his most soul deadening assistant he had been foolish no doubt but he had never anticipated that he had never supposed that farr would dare he thought hard through that long night of friday his pain was no distraction he had his intentions very ready and clear in his mind when his three visitors arrived he had insisted upon getting up and dressing fully i cant talk about woldingstanton in bed he said the doctor was not there to gainsay him sir eliphaz was the first to arrive and mrs huss retrieved him from mrs croome in the passage and brought him in he was wearing a norfolk jacket suit of a coarse yet hairy consistency and of a pale sage green colour he shone greatly in the eyes of mrs huss i cant help thinking of you dear lady he said bowing over her hand and all his hair was for a moment sad and sympathetic like a sick skye terriers mr dad and mr farr entered a moment later mr farr in grey flannel trousers and a brown jacket and mr dad in a natty dark grey suit with a luminous purple waistcoat my dear said mr huss to his wife i must be alone with these gentlemen and when she seemed disposed to linger near the understanding warmth of sir eliphaz he added figures my dearfinance and drove her forth pon my honour said mr dad coming close up to the armchair wrinkling his muzzle and putting through his compliments in good business like style before coming to the harder stuff in hand i dont like to see you like this mr huss nor does sir eliphaz i hopenor farr please find yourselves chairs and while mr farr made protesting noises and sir eliphaz waved his hair about before beginning the little speech he had prepared mr huss took the discourse out of their mouths and began i know perfectly well the task you have set yourselves you have come to make an end of me as headmaster of woldingstanton and mr farr has very obligingly he held up his white and wasted hand as mr farr began to disavow no said mr huss but before you three gentlemen proceed with your office i should like to tell you something of what the school and my work in it and my work for education is to me i am a man of little more than fifty a month ago i counted with a reasonable confidence upon twenty years more of work before i relaxed then these misfortunes rained upon me i have lost all my private independence there have been these shocking deaths in the school my son my only son killed trouble has darkened the love and kindness of my wife and now my body is suffering so that my mind is like a swimmer struggling through waves of pain far from land these are heavy blows but the hardest blow of all harder to bear than any of these othersi do not speak rashly gentlemen i have thought it out through an endless nightthe last blow will be this rejection of my life work that will strike the inmost me the heart and soul of me he paused you mustnt take it quite like that mr huss protested mr dad it isnt fair to us to put it like that i want you to listen to me said mr huss only the very kindest motives continued mr dad let me speak said mr huss with the voice of authority that had ruled woldingstanton for five and twenty years i cannot wrangle and contradict at most we have an hour mr dad made much the same sound that a dog will make when it has proposed to bark and has been told to get under the table for a time he looked an ill used man to end my work in the school will be to end me altogether i do not see why i should not speak plainly to you gentlemen situated as i am here i do not see why i should not talk to you for once in my own language pain and death are our interlocutors this is a rare and raw and bleeding occasion in an hour or so the women may be laying out my body and i may be silent for ever i have hidden my religion but why should i hide it now to you i have always tried to seem as practical and self seeking as possible but in secret i have been a fanatic and woldingstanton was the altar on which i offered myself to god i have done ill and feebly there i know i have been indolent and rash those were my weaknesses but i have done my best to the limits of my strength and knowledge i have served god and now in this hour of darkness where is this god that i have served why does he not stand here between me and this last injury you would do to the work i have dedicated to him at these words mr dad turned horrified eyes to mr farr but mr huss went on as though talking to himself in the night i have looked into my heart i have sought in my heart for base motives and secret sins i have put myself on trial to find why god should hide himself from me now and i can find no reason and no justification in the bitterness of my heart i am tempted to give way to you and to tell you to take the school and to do just what you will with it the nearness of death makes the familiar things of experience flimsy and unreal and far more real to me now is this darkness that broods over me as blight will sometimes overhang the world at noon and mocks me day and night with a perpetual challenge to curse god and die why do i not curse god and die why do i cling to my work when the god to whom i dedicated it issilent because i suppose i still hope for some sign of reassurance because i am not yet altogether defeated i would go on telling you why i want woldingstanton to continue on its present lines and why it is impossible for you why it will be a sort of murder for you to hand it over to farr here if my pain were ten times what it is at the mention of his name mr farr started and looked first at mr dad and then at sir eliphaz really he said really one might think i had conspired i am afraid mr huss said sir eliphaz with a large reassuring gesture to the technical master that the suggestion that mr farr should be your successor came in the first instance from me you must reconsider it said mr huss moistening his lips and staring steadfastly in front of him here mr dad broke out in a querulous voice are you really in a state mr huss to discuss a matter like thisfeverish and suffering as you are i could not be in a better frame for this discussion said mr huss and now for what i have to say about the schoolwoldingstanton when i came to it was a humdrum school of some seventy boys following a worn out routine a little latin was taught and less greek chiefly in order to say that greek was taught some scraps of mathematical processes a few rags of general knowledge english historynot human history mind you but just the national brand cut dried flowers from the past with no roots and no meaning a smattering of french that was practically all it was no sort of education it was a mere education like posturing and to day what has that school become we never grudged you money said sir eliphaz nor loyal help said mr farr but in a half whisper i am not thinking of its visible prosperity the houses and laboratories and museums that have grown about that nucleus are nothing in themselves the reality of a school is not in buildings and numbers but in matters of the mind and soul woldingstanton has become a torch at which lives are set aflame i have lit a candle therethe winds of fate may yet blow it into a world wide blaze as mr huss said these things he was uplifted by enthusiasm and his pain sank down out of his consciousness what he said is the task of the teacher in the world it is the greatest of all human tasks it is to ensure that man man the divine grows in the souls of men for what is a man without instruction he is born as the beasts are born a greedy egotism a clutching desire a thing of lusts and fears he can regard nothing except in relation to himself even his love is a bargain and his utmost effort is vanity because he has to die and it is we teachers alone who can lift him out of that self preoccupation we teachers we can release him into a wider circle of ideas beyond himself in which he can at length forget himself and his meagre personal ends altogether we can open his eyes to the past and to the future and to the undying life of man so through us and through us only he escapes from death and futility an untaught man is but himself alone as lonely in his ends and destiny as any beast a man instructed is a man enlarged from that narrow prison of self into participation in an undying life that began we know not when that grows above and beyond the greatness of the stars he spoke as if he addressed some other hearer than the three before him mr dad with eyebrows raised and lips compressed nodded silently to mr farr as if his worst suspicions were confirmed and there were signs and signals that sir eliphaz was about to speak when mr huss resumed for five and twenty years i have ruled over woldingstanton and for all that time i have been giving sight to the blind i have given understanding to some thousands of boys all those routines of teaching that had become dead we made live again there my boys have learnt the history of mankind so that it has become their own adventure they have learnt geography so that the world is their possession i have had languages taught to make the past live again in their minds and to be windows upon the souls of alien peoples science has played its proper part it has taken my boys into the secret places of matter and out among the nebul always i have kept farr and his utilities in their due subordination some of my boys have already made good business menbecause they were more than business men but i have never sought to make business men and i never will my boys have gone into the professions into the services into the great world and done welli have had dull boys and intractable boys but nearly all have gone into the world gentlemen broad minded good mannered understanding and unselfish masters of self servants of man because the whole scheme of their education has been to release them from base and narrow things when the war came my boys were ready they have gone to their deathshow many have gone to their deaths my own son among them i did not grudge him woldingstanton is a new school its tradition has scarcely begun the list of its old boys is now so terribly depleted that its young tradition wilts like a torn seedling but still we can keep on with it still that tradition will grow if my flame still burns but my teaching must go on as i have planned it it must it must what has made my boys all that they are has been the history the biological science the philosophy for these things are wisdom all the rest is training and mere knowledge if the school is to live the head must still be a man who can teach historyhistory in the widest sense he must be philosopher biologist and archologist as well as scholar and you would hand that task to farr farr farr here has never even touched the essential work of the school he does not know what it is his mind is no more opened than the cricket professionals mr dad made an impatient noise the sick man went on with his burning eyes on farr his lips bloodless he thinks of chemistry and physics not as a help to understanding but as a help to trading so long as he has been at woldingstanton he has been working furtively with our materials in the laboratories dreaming of some profitable patent oh i know you farr do you think i didnt see because i didnt choose to complain if he could have discovered some profitable patent he would have abandoned teaching the day he did so he would have been even as you are but with a lifeless imagination you cannot even invent patentable things he would talk to the boys of the empire at times but the empire to him is no more than a trading conspiracy fenced about with tariffs it goes on to nothing and he thinks we are fighting the germans he thinks my dear and precious boy gave his life and that all these other brave lads beyond counting died in order that we might take the place of the germans as the chapman bullies of the world that is the measure of his mind he has no religion no faith no devotion why does he want my place because he wants to serve as i have served no but because he envies my house my income my headship whether i live or die it is impossible that woldingstanton my woldingstanton should live under his hand give it to him and in a little while it will be dead gentlemen mr farr protested with a white perspiring face i had no idea ejaculated mr dad i had no idea that things had gone so far sir eliphaz indicated by waving his hand that his associates might allay themselves he recognized that the time had come for him to speak it is deplorable sir eliphaz began he put down his hands and gripped the seat of his chair as if to hold himself on to it very tightly and he looked very hard at the horizon as if he was trying to decipher some remote inscription you have imported a tone into this discussion he tried he got off at the third attempt it is an extremely painful thing to me mr huss that to you standing as you do on the very brink of the great chasm it should be necessary to speak in any but the most cordial and helpful tones but it is my duty it is our duty to hold firmly to those principles which have always guided us as governors of the woldingstanton school you speak i must say it with an extreme arrogance of an institution to which all of us here have in some measure contributed you speak as though you and you alone were its creator and guide you must pardon me mr huss if i remind you of the facts the eternal verities of the story the school sir was founded in the spacious days of queen elizabeth and many a good man guided its fortunes down to the time when an unfortunatea diversion of its endowments led to its temporary cessation the charity commissioners revived it after an inquiry some fifty years ago and it has been largely the lavish generosity of the papermakers guild of which i and dad are humble members that has stimulated its expansion under you loth as i am to cross your mood mr huss while you are in pain and anxiety i am bound to recall to you these things which have made your work possible you could not have made bricks without straw you could not have built up woldingstanton without the money obtained by that commercialism for which you display such unqualified contempt we sordid cits it was who planted who watered mr huss seemed about to speak but said nothing exactly what i say said mr dad turning for confirmation to mr farr the school is essentially a modern commercial school it should be run as that mr farr nodded his white face ambiguously with his eye on sir eliphaz i should have been chary mr huss of wrangling about our particular shares and contributions on an occasion so solemn as this but since you will have it so since you challenge discussion he turned to his colleagues as if for support go on said mr dad facts are facts sir eliphaz cleared his throat and continued to read the horizon i have raised these points mr huss by way of an opening the gist of what i have to say lies deeper so far i have dealt with the things you have said only in relation to us as against us you assume your own righteousness you flout our poor judgments you sweep them aside the school must be continued on your lines the teaching must follow your schemes you can imagine no alternative opinion god forbid that i should say a word in my own defence i have given freely both of my time and of my money to our school it would tax my secretaries now to reckon up how much but i make no claims none but let me now put all this discussion upon a wider and a graver footing it is not only us and our poor intentions you arraign strange things have dropped from you mr huss in this discussion things it has at once pained and astonished me to hear from you you have spoken not only of mans ingratitude but of gods i could scarcely believe my ears but indeed i heard you say that god was silent unhelpful and that he too had deserted you in spite of the most meritorious exertions on your part standing as you do on the very margin of the great secret i want to plead very earnestly with you against all that you have said sir eliphaz seemed to meditate remotely he returned like a soaring vulture to his victim i would be the last man to obtrude my religious feelings upon anyone i make no parade of religion mr huss none at all many people think me no better than an unbeliever but here i am bound to make my confession i owe much to god mr huss he glowered at the sick man he abandoned his grip upon the seat of his chair for a moment to make a gesture with his hairy claw of a hand your attitude to my god is a far deeper offence to me than any merely personal attack could be under his chastening blows under trials that humbler spirits would receive with thankfulness and construe as lessons and warnings you betray yourself more proud more self assured morefroward is not too harsh a wordmore froward mr huss than you were even in the days when we used to fret under you on founders day in the great hall when you would dictate to us that here you must have an extension and there you must have a museum or a picture room or what not leaving nothing to opinion making our gifts a duty you will not recognise the virtue of gifts and graces either in man or god cannot you see my dear mr huss the falsity of your position it is upon that point that i want to talk to you now god does not smite man needlessly this world is all one vast intention and not a sparrow falls to the ground unless he wills that sparrow to fall is your heart so sure of itself does nothing that has happened suggest to you that there may be something in your conduct and direction of woldingstanton that has made it not quite so acceptable an offering to god as you have imagined it to be sir eliphaz paused with an air of giving mr huss his chance but meeting with no response he resumed i am an old man mr huss and i have seen much of the world and more particularly of the world of finance and industry a world of swift opportunities and sudden temptations i have watched the careers of many young men of parts who have seemed to be under the impression that the world had been waiting for them overlong i have seen more promotions schemes and enterprises great or grandiose than i care to recall developing woldingstanton from the mere endowed school of a market town it was to its present position has been for me a subordinate incident a holiday task a piece of by play upon a crowded scene my experiences have been on a far greater scale far greater and in all my experience i have never seen what i should call a really right minded man perish or an innocent dealerprovided that is that he took ordinary precautionsdestroyed ups and downs no doubt there are for the good as well as the bad i have seen the foolish taking root for a timeit was but for a time i have watched the manuvres of some exceedingly crafty men sir eliphaz shook his head slowly from side to side and all the hairs on his head waved about he hesitated for a moment and decided to favour his hearers with a scrap of autobiography quite recently he began there was a fellow came to us just as we were laying down our plant for production on a large scale he was a very plausible energetic young fellow indeed an american armenian well he happened to know somehow that we were going to use kaolin from felspar a by product of the new potash process and he had got hold of a scheme for washing london clay that produced he assured us an accessible kaolin just as good for our purpose and not a tenth of the cost of the norwegian stuff it would have reduced our prime cost something like thirty per cent let alone tonnage excuse these technicalities on the face of it it was a thoroughly good thing the point was that i knew all along that his stuff retained a certain amount of sulphur and couldnt possibly make a building block to last that wouldnt prevent us selling and using the stuff with practical impunity it wasnt up to us to know no one could have made us liable the thing indeed looked so plain and safe that i admit it tempted me sorely and then mr huss god came in i received a secret intimation i want to tell you of this in all good faith and simplicity in the night when all the world was deep in sleep i awoke and i was in the extremest terror my very bones were shaking i sat up in my bed afraid almost to touch the switch of the electric light my hair stood on end i could see nothing i could hear nothing but it was as if a spirit passed in front of my face and in spite of the silence something seemed to be saying to me how about god sir eliphaz have you at last forgotten him how can you that would dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is the dust escape his judgments that was all mr huss just that whose foundation is the dust straight to the point well mr huss i am not a religious man but i threw over that armenian mr dad made a sound to intimate that he would have done the same i mention this experience this interventionand it is not the only one of which i could tellbecause i want you to get my view that if an enterprise even though it is as fair and honest seeming a business as woldingstanton school begins suddenly to crumple and wilt it means that somehow somewhere you must have been putting the wrong sort of clay into it it means not that god is wrong and going back upon you but that you are wrong you may be a great and famous teacher now mr huss thanks not a little to the pedestal we have made for you but god is a greater and more famous teacher he manifestly you have not convinced even if you could have convinced us of woldingstantons present perfection that is practically all i have to say when we propose in all humility to turn the school about into new and less pretentious courses and you oppose us that is our answer if you had done as well and wisely as you declare you would not be in this position and this discussion would never have arisen he paused said with truth and dignity said mr dad you have put my opinion sir eliphaz better than i could have put it myself i thank you he coughed briefly the question you put to me i have put to myself said mr huss and thought deeply for a little while no i do not feel convicted of wrong doing i still believe the work i set myself to do was right right in spirit and intention right in plan and method you invite me to confess my faith broken and in the dust and my faith was never so sure there is a god in my heart in my heart at least there is a god who has always guided me to right and who guides me now my conscience remains unassailable these afflictions that you speak of as trials and warnings i can only see as inexplicable disasters they perplex me but they do not cow me they strike me as pointless and irrelevant events but this is terrible said mr dad deeply shocked you push me back sir eliphaz from the discussion of our school affairs to more fundamental questions you have raised the problem of the moral government of the world a problem that has been distressing my mind since i first came here to sundering whether indeed failure is condemnation and success the sunshine of gods approval you believe that the great god of the stars and seas and mountains is attentive to our conduct and responds to it his sense of right is the same sense of right as ours he endorses a common aim your prosperity is the mark of your harmony with that supreme god i wouldnt go so far as that mr dad interjected no no arrogance and my misfortunes express his disapproval well i have believed that i have believed that the rightness of a schoolmasters conscience must needs be the same thing as the rightness of destiny i too had fallen into that comforting persuasion of prosperity but this series of smashing experiences i have had culminating in your proposal to wipe out the whole effect and significance of my life brings me face to face with the fundamental question whether the order of the great universe the god of the stars has any regard or relationship whatever to the problems of our consciences and the efforts of man to do right that is a question that echoes to me down the ages so far i have always professed myself a christian well i should hope so said mr dad considering the terms of the schools foundation for i take it the creeds declare in a beautiful symbol that the god who is present in our hearts is one with the universal father and at the same time his beloved son continually and eternally begotten from the universal fatherhood and crucified only to conquer he has come into our poor lives to raise them up at last to himself but to believe that is to believe in the significance and continuity of the whole effort of mankind the life of man must be like the perpetual spreading of a fire if right and wrong are to perish together indifferently if there is aimless and fruitless suffering if there opens no hope for an eternal survival in consequences of all good things then there is no meaning in such a belief as christianity it is a mere superstition of priests and sacrifices and i have read things into it that were never truly there the rushlight of our faith burns in a windy darkness that will see no dawn nay said sir eliphaz nay if there is god in your work we cannot destroy it you are doing your best said mr huss and now i am not sure that you will fail at one time i should have defied you but now i am not sure i have sat here through some dreary and dreadful days and lain awake through some interminable nights i have thought of many things that men in their days of prosperity are apt to dismiss from their minds and i am no longer sure of the goodness of the world without us or in the plan of fate perhaps it is only in us within our hearts that the light of god flickersand flickers insecurely where we had thought a god somehow akin to ourselves ruled in the universe it may be there is nothing but black emptiness and a coldness worse than cruelty mr dad was about to interrupt and restrained himself by a great effort it is a commonplace of pietistic works that natural things are perfect things and that the whole world of life if it were not for the sinfulness of man would be perfect paley you will remember sir eliphaz in his evidences of christianity from which we have both suffered declares that this earth is manifestly made for the happiness of the sentient beings living thereon but i ask you to consider for a little and dispassionately whether life through all its stages up to and including man is not rather a scheme of uneasiness imperfect satisfaction and positive miseries arent we getting a bit out of our depth in all this mr dad burst out put it at thatout of our depth what does this sort of carping and questioning amount to mr huss does it do us any good does it help us in the slightest degree why should we go into all this why cant we be humble and leave these deep questions to those who make a specialty of dealing with them we dont know the ropes we cant here are you and mr farr for instance both of you whole time schoolmasters so to speak heres sir eliphaz toiling night and day to make simple cheap suitable homes for the masses who probably wont say thank you to him when they see them heres me an overworked engineer and understaffed most cruelly not to speak of the most unfair and impossible labour demands so that you never know where you are and what they wont ask you next and in the midst of it all we are to start an argey bargey about the goodness of god were busy men mr huss what do we know of the world being a scheme of imperfect satisfaction and what all where does it come in whats its practical value words it is all words and getting away from the plain and definite question we came to talk over and settle and have done with such talk i will confess makes me uncomfortable give me the bible and the simple religion i learnt at my mothers knee thats good enough for me cant we just have faith and leave all these questions alone what are men in reality after all their arguments worms just worms well then lets have the decency to behave as such and stick to business and do our best in that state of life unto which it has pleased god to call us thats what i say said mr dad he jerked his head back coughed shortly adjusted his tie and nodded to mr farr in a resolute manner a simple straightforward commercial and technical education he added by way of an explanatory colophon thats what were after mr huss stared absently at mr dad for some moments and then resumed let us look squarely at this world about us what is the true lot of life is there the slightest justification for assuming that our conceptions of right and happiness are reflected anywhere in the outward universe is there for instance much animal happiness do health and well being constitute the normal state of animals he paused mr dad got up and stood looking out of the window with his back to mr huss pulling nature to pieces he said over his shoulder he turned and urged further with a snarl of bitterness in his voice suppose things are so what is the good of our calling attention to it wheres the benefit but the attitude of sir eliphaz conveyed a readiness to listen before i became too ill to go out here said mr huss i went for a walk in the country behind this place i was weary before i started but i was impelled to go by that almost irresistible desire that will seize upon one at times to get out of ones immediate surroundings i wanted to escape from this wretched room and i wanted to be alone secure from interruptions and free to think in peace there was a treacherous promise in the day outside much sunshine and a breeze i had heard of woods a mile or so inland and that conjured up a vision of cool green shade and kindly streams beneath the trees and of the fellowship of shy and gentle creatures so i went out into the heat and into the dried and salted east wind through glare and inky shadows across many more fields than i had expected until i came to some woods and then to a neglected park and there for a time i sat down to rest but i could get no rest the turf was unclean through the presence of many sheep and in it there was a number of close growing but very sharply barbed thistles and after a little time i realized that harvesters those minute red beasts that creep upon one in the chalk lands and burrow into the skin and produce an almost intolerable itching abounded i got up again and went on hoping in vain to find some fence or gate on which i might rest more comfortably there were many flies and gnats many more than there are here and of different sorts and they persecuted me more and more they surrounded me in a humming cloud and i had to wave my walking stick about my head all the time to keep them off me i felt too exhausted to walk back but there was i knew a village a mile or so ahead where i hoped to find some conveyance in which i might return by road and as i struggled along in this fashion i came upon first one thing and then another so apt to my mood that they might have been put there by some adversary first it was a very young rabbit indeed it was scarcely as long as my hand which some cruel thing had dragged from its burrow the back of its head had been bitten open and was torn and bloody and the flies rose from its oozing wounds to my face like a cloud of witnesses then as i went on trying to distract my mind from the memory of this pitiful dead thing by looking about me for something more agreeable i discovered a row of little brown objects in a hawthorn bush and going closer found they were some half dozen victims of a butcherbirdbeetles fledgelings and a mouse or sospiked on the thorns they were all twisted into painful attitudes as if each had suffered horribly and challenged me by the last gesture of its limbs to judge between it and its creator and a little further on a gaunt villainous looking cat with rusty black fur that had bare patches suddenly ran upon me out of a side path it had something in its mouth which it abandoned at the sight of me and left writhing at my feet a pretty crested bird very mangled that flapped in flat circles upon the turf unable to rise a fit of weak and reasonless rage came upon me at this and seeing the cat halt some yards away and turn to regard me and move as if to recover its victim i rushed at it and pursued it shouting then it occurred to me that it would be kinder if instead of a futile pursuit of the wretched cat i went back and put an end to the birds sufferings for a time i could not find it and i searched for it in the bushes in a fever to get it killed groaning and cursing as i did so when i found it it fought at me with its poor bleeding wings and snapped its beak at me and made me feel less like a deliverer than a murderer i hit it with my stick and as it still moved i stamped it to death with my feet i fled from its body in an agony and this i cried this hell revealed is gods creation tcha exclaimed mr dad suddenly it seemed to me that scales had fallen from my eyes and that i saw the whole world plain it was as if the universe had put aside a mask it had hitherto worn and shown me its face and it was a face of boundless evil it was as if a power of darkness sat over me and watched me with a mocking gaze and for the rest of that day i could think of nothing but the feeble miseries of living things i was tortured and all life was tortured with me i failed to find the village i sought i strayed far i got back here at last long after dark stopping sometimes by the wayside to be sick sometimes kneeling or lying down for a time to rest shivering and burning with an increasing fever i had as you know been the first to find poor williamson lying helpless among the acids that ghastly figure and the burnt bodies of the two boys who died in school house haunt my mind constantly but what was most in my thoughts on that day when the world of nature showed its teeth to me was the wretchedness of animal life i do not know why that should have seemed more pitiful to me and more fundamental but it did human suffering perhaps is complicated by moral issues man can look before and after and find remote justifications and stern consolations outside his present experiences but the poor birds and beasts they have only their present experiences and their individual lives cut off and shut in how can there be righteousness in any scheme that afflicts them i thought of one creature after another and i could imagine none that had more than an occasional gleam of false and futile satisfaction between suffering and suffering and to day gentlemen as i sit here with you the same dark stream of conviction pours through my mind i feel that life is a weak and inconsequent stirring amidst the dust of space and time incapable of overcoming even its internal dissensions doomed to phases of delusion to irrational and undeserved punishments to vain complainings and at last to extinction is there so much as one healthy living being in the world i question it as i wandered that day i noted the trees as i had never noted them before there was not one that did not show a stricken or rotten branch or that was not studded with the stumps of lost branches decaying backwards towards the main stem from every fork came dark stains of corruption the bark was twisted and contorted and fungoid protrusions proclaimed the hidden mycelium of disease the leaves were spotted with warts and blemishes and gnawed and bitten by a myriad enemies i noted too that the turf under my feet was worn and scorched and weary gossamer threads and spiders of a hundred sorts trapped the multitudinous insects in the wilted autumnal undergrowth the hedges were a slow conflict of thrusting and strangulating plants in which every individual was more or less crippled or stunted most of these plants were armed like assassins they had great thorns or stinging hairs some ripened poisonous berries and this was the reality of life this was no exceptional mood of things but a revelation of things established i had been blind and now i saw even as these woods and thickets were so was all the world i had been reading in a book i had chanced to pick up in this lodging about the jungles of india which many people think of as a vast wealth of splendid and luxuriant vegetation for the greater part of the year they are hot and thorny wastes of brown dead and mouldering matter comes the steaming downpour of the rains and then for a little while there is a tangled rush of fighting greenery jostling choking torn and devoured by a multitude of beasts and by a horrible variety of insects that the hot moisture has called to activity then under the dry breath of the destroyer the exuberance stales and withers everything ripens and falls and the jungle relapses again into sullen heat and gloomy fermentation and in truth everywhere the growth season is a wild scramble into existence the rest of the year a complicated massacre even in our british climate is it not plain to you how the summer outlasts the lavish promise of the spring in our spring there is no doubt an air of hope of budding and blossoming there is the nesting and singing of birds a certain cleanness of the air an emergence of primary and comparatively innocent things but hard upon that freshness follow the pests and parasites the creatures that corrupt and sting the minions of waste and pain and lassitude and fever you may say that i am dwelling too much upon the defects in the lives of plants which do not feel and of insects and small creatures which may feel in a different manner from ourselves but indeed their decay and imperfection make up the common texture of life even the things that live are only half alive you may argue that at least the rarer larger beasts bring with them a certain delight and dignity into the world but consider the lives of the herbivora they are all hunted creatures fear is their habit of mind even the great indian buffalo is given to panic flights they are incessantly worried by swarms of insects when they are not apathetic they appear to be angry exasperated with life their seasonal outbreaks of sex are evidently a violent torment to them an occasion for fierce bellowings mutual persecution and desperate combats such beasts as the rhinoceros or the buffalo are habitually in a rage they will run amuck for no conceivable reason and so too will many elephants betraying a sort of organic spite against all other living things and if we turn to the great carnivores who should surely be the lords of the jungle world their lot seems to be not one whit more happy the tiger leads a life of fear a dirty scrap of rag will turn him from his path much of his waking life is prowling hunger when he kills he eats ravenously he eats to the pitch of discomfort he lies up afterwards in reeds or bushes savage disinclined to move the hunter must beat him out and he comes out sluggishly and reluctantly to die his paws too are strangely tender a few miles of rock will make them bleed they gather thorns his mouth is so foul that his bite is a poisoned bite all that day i struggled against this persuasion that the utmost happiness of any animal is at best like a transitory smile on a grim and inhuman countenance i tried to recall some humorous and contented looking creatures that only recalled a fresh horror you will have seen pictures and photographs of penguins they will have conveyed to you the sort of effect i tried to recover they express a quaint and jolly gravity an aldermanic contentment but to me now the mere thought of a penguin raises a vision of distress i will tell you one of my old boys came to me a year or so ago on his return from a south polar expedition he told me the true story of these birds their lives he saidhe was speaking more particularly of the king penguinare tormented by a monstrously exaggerated maternal instinct an instinct shared by both sexes which is a necessary condition of survival in the crowded rookeries of that frozen environment and that instinct makes life one long torment for them there is always a great smashing of eggs there through various causes there is an excessive mortality among the chicks they slip down crevasses they freeze to death and so forth three quarters of each years brood perish and without this extravagant passion the species would become extinct so that every bird is afflicted with a desire and anxiety to brood upon and protect a chick but each couple produces no more than one egg a year eggs get broken they roll away into the water there is always a shortage and every penguin that has an egg has to guard it jealously and each one that has not an egg is impelled to steal or capture one some in their distress will mother pebbles or scraps of ice some fortunate in possession will sit for days without leaving the nest in spite of the gnawings of the intense antarctic hunger to leave a nest for a moment is to tempt a robber and the intensity of the emotions aroused is shown by the fact that they will fight to the death over a stolen egg you see that these pictures of rookeries of apparently comical birds are really pictures of poor dim minded creatures worried and strained to the very limit of their powers that is what their lives have always been but the king penguin draws near the end of its history let me tell you how its history is closing let me tell you of what is happening in the peaceful southern seasnow this old boy of mine was in great distress because of a vile traffic that has arisen unless it is stopped it will destroy these rookeries altogether these birds are being murdered wholesale for their oil parties of men land and club them upon their nests from which the poor silly things refuse to stir the dead and stunned the living and the dead together are dragged away and thrust into iron crates to be boiled down for their oil the broken living with the dead each bird yields about a farthings profit but it pays to kill them at that and so the thing is done the people who run these operations you see have had a sound commercial training they believe that when god gives us power he means us to use it and that what is profitable is just well really protested mr dad really mr farr also betrayed a disposition to speak he cleared his throat his uneasy hands worried the edge of the table his face shone sir eliphaz he said let me finish said mr huss for i have still to remind you of the most stubborn facts of all in such an argument as this have you ever thought of the significance of such creatures as the entozoa and the vast multitudes of other sorts of specialized parasites whose very existence is cruelty there are thousands of orders and genera of insects crustacea arachnids worms and lowlier things which are adapted in the most complicated way to prey upon the living and suffering tissues of their fellow creatures and which can live in no other way have you ever thought what that means if forethought framed these horrors what sort of benevolence was there in that forethought i will not distress you by describing the life cycles of any of these creatures too exactly you must know of many of them i will not dwell upon those wasps for example which lay their eggs in the living bodies of victims which the young will gnaw to death slowly day by day as they develop nor will i discuss this unmeaning growth of cells which has made my body its soil nor any one of our thousand infectious fevers that fall upon uswithout reason without justice man is of all creatures the least subjected to internal parasites in the brief space of a few hundred thousand years he has changed his food his habitat and every attitude and habit of his life and comparatively few species thirty or forty at most i am told have been able to follow his changes and specialize themselves to him under these fresh conditions yet even man can entertain some fearful guests every time you drink open water near a sheep pasture you may drink the larval liver fluke which will make your liver a little township of vile creatures until they eat it up until they swarm from its oozing ruins into your body cavity and destroy you in europe this is a rare fate for a man but in china there are wide regions where the fluke abounds and rots the life out of thousands of people the fluke is but one sample of such feats of the creator an unwashed leaf of lettuce may be the means of planting a parasitic cyst in your brain to dethrone your reason a feast of underdone pork may transfer to you from the swine the creeping death torture of trichinosis but all that men suffer in these matters is nothing to the suffering of the beasts the torments of the beasts are finished and complete my biological master tells me that he rarely opens a cod or dogfish without finding bunches of some sort of worm or such like pallid lodger in possession he has rows of little tubes with the things he has found in the bodies of rabbits but i will not disgust you further is this a world made for the happiness of sentient things i ask you how is it possible for man to be other than a rebel in the face of such facts how can he trust the maker who has designed and elaborated and finished these parasites in their endless multitude and variety for these things are not in the nature of sudden creations and special judgments they have been produced fearfully and wonderfully by a process of evolution as slow and deliberate as our own how can man trust such a maker to treat him fairly why should we shut our eyes to things that stare us in the face either the world of life is the creation of a being inspired by a malignancy at once filthy petty and enormous or it displays a carelessness an indifference a disregard for justice the voice of mr huss faded out for some time mr farr had been manifesting signs of impatience the pause gave him his opportunity he spoke with a sort of restrained volubility sir eliphaz mr dad after what has passed in relation to myself i would have preferred to have said nothing in this discussion nothing so far as i myself am concerned i will still say nothing but upon some issues it is impossible to keep silence mr huss has said some terrible things things that must surely never be said at woldingstanton think of what such teaching as this may mean among young and susceptible boys think of such stuff in the school pulpit chary as i am of all wrangling and i would not set myself up for a moment to wrangle against mr huss yet i feel that this cavilling against gods universe this multitude of evil words must be answered it is imperative to answer it plainly and sternly it is our duty to god who has made us what we are mr huss in your present diseased state you seem incapable of realizing the enormous egotism of all this depreciation of gods marvels but indeed you have suffered from that sort of incapacity always it is no new thing have i not chafed under your arrogant assurance for twelve long years your right now as ever is the only right your doctrine alone is pure would that god could speak and open his lips against you how his voice would shatter you and us and everything about us how you would shrivel amidst your blasphemies excuse me gentlemen if i am too forcible said mr farr moistening his white lips but mr dad nodded fierce approval thus encouraged mr farr proceeded when first i came into this room mr huss i was full of pity for your afflictioni think we all werewe were pitiful but now it is clear to me that god exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves surely the supreme sin is pride you criticize and belittle gods universe but what sort of a universe would you give us mr huss if you were the creator pardon me if i startle you gentlemen but that is a fair question to ask for it is clear to me now mr huss that no less than that will satisfy you woldingstanton for all the wonders you have wrought there in spite of the fact that never before and never again can there be such a head in spite of the fact that you have lit such a candle there as may one day set the world ablaze is clearly too small a field for you headmaster of the universe is your position then and then alone could you display your gifts to the full then cats would cease to eat birds and trees grow on in perfect symmetry until they cumbered the sky i can dimly imagine the sort of world that it would be the very fleas reformed and trained under your hand would be flushed with health and happiness and doing the work of boy scouts every blade of grass would be at least six feet long as for the liver flukebut i cannot solve the problem of the liver fluke i suppose you will provide euthanasia for all the parasites abruptly mr farr passed from this vein of terrible humour to an earnest and pleading manner mr huss with mortal danger so close to you i entreat you to reconsider all this wild and wicked talk of yours you take a few superficial aspects of the world and frame a judgment on them you try with the poor foot rule of your mind to measure the plans of god plans which are longer than the earth wider than the sea i ask you how can such insolence help you in this supreme emergency there can be little time left providence was manifestly resolved to give mr farr the maximum of dramatic effect but what is this said mr farr he stood up and looked out of the window somebody had rung the bell and now with an effect of impatience was rapping at the knocker of sea view chapter the fourth do we truly die mrs croome was heard in the passage someone was admitted there were voices and the handle of the parlour door was turned asnt e come then they heard the voice of mrs croome through the opening dr elihu barrack appeared in the doorway he was a round headed young man with a clean shaven face a mouth that was determinedly determined and slightly oblique a short nose and a general expression of resolution the fact that he had an artificial leg was scarcely perceptible in his bearing he considered the four men before him for a moment and then addressed himself to mr huss in a tone of brisk authority you ought to be in bed he said i had this rather important discussion said mr huss with a gesture portending introductions but sitting up will fatigue you the doctor insisted sticking to his patient it wont distress me so much as leaving these things unsaid would have done opinions may differ upon that said mr farr darkly we are still far from any settlement of our difficulties said sir eliphaz to the universe i have indicated my view at any rate said mr huss i suppose now sir alpheus is here he isnt here said dr barrack neatly he telegraphs to say that he is held up and will come by the next train so you get a reprieve mr huss in that case i shall go on talking you had better go to bed no i couldnt lie quiet and mr huss proceeded to name his guests to dr barrack who nodded shortly to each of them in turn and said pleased t meet you his face betrayed no excess of pleasure his eye was hard he remained standing as if waiting for them to display symptoms our discussion has wandered far said sir eliphaz our original business here was to determine the future development of woldingstanton school which we think should be made more practical and technical than hitherto and less concerned with history and philosophy than it has been under mr huss wont you sit down doctor the doctor sat down still watching sir eliphaz with hard intelligence well we have drifted from that sir eliphaz continued not so far as you may think said mr huss at any rate mr huss has been regaling us with a discourse upon the miseries of life how we are all eaten up by parasites and utterly wretched and how everything is wretched and this an accursed world ruled either by a cruel god or a god so careless as to be practically no god at all nice stuff for nineteen eighteen ad said mr dad putting much meaning into the ad since i left woldingstanton and came here said mr huss i have done little else but think i have not slept during the night i have had nothing to occupy me during the day and i have been thinking about fundamental things i have been forced to revise my faith and to look more closely than i have ever done before into the meaning of my beliefs and into my springs of action i have been wrenched away from that habitual confidence in the order of things which seemed the more natural state for a mind to be in but that has only widened a difference that already existed between me and these three gentlemen and that was showing very plainly in the days when success still justified my grip upon woldingstanton suddenly swiftly i have had misfortune following upon misfortunewithout cause or justification i am thrown now into the darkest doubt and dismay the universe seems harsh and black to me whereas formerly i believed that at the core of it and universally pervading it was the will of a god of light i have always denied even when my faith was undimmed that the god of righteousness ruled this world in detail and entirely giving us day by day our daily rewards and punishments these gentlemen on the contrary do believe that they say that god does rule the world traceably and directly and that success is the measure of his approval and pain and suffering the fulfilment of unrighteousness and as for what has this to do with educationit has all to do with education you can settle no practical questions until you have settled such disputes as this before you can prepare boys to play their part in the world you must ask what is this world for which you prepare them is it a tragedy or comedy what is the nature of this drama in which they are to play dr barrack indicated that this statement was noted and approved for clearly said mr huss if success is the justification of life you must train for success there is no need for men to understand life then so long as they do their job in it that is the opinion of these governors of mine it has been the opinion of most men of the worldalways obey the thing that is that is the lesson they would have taught to my boys acquiesce life for them is not an adventure not a struggle but simply obedience and the enjoyment of rewards that dr barrack is what such a technical education as they want set up at woldingstanton really means but i have believed always and taught always that what god demands from man is his utmost effort to co operate and understand i have taught the imagination first and most i have made knowledge knowledge of what man is and what mans world is and what man may be which is the adventure of mankind the substance of all my teaching at woldingstanton i have taught philosophy i have taught the whole history of mankind if i could not have done that without leaving chemistry and physics mathematics and languages out of the curriculum altogether i would have left them out and you see why dr barrack i see your position certainly said dr barrack and now that my heavens are darkened now that my eyes have been opened to the wretchedness futility and horror in the texture of life i still cling i cling more than ever to the spirit of righteousness within me if there is no god no mercy no human kindliness in the great frame of space and time if life is a writhing torment an itch upon one little planet and the stars away there in the void no more than huge empty flares signifying nothing then all the brighter shines the flame of god in my heart if the god in my heart is no son of any heavenly father then is he prometheus the rebel it does not shake my faith that he is the master for whom i will live and die and all the more do i cling to this fire of human tradition we have lit upon this little planet if it is the one gleam of spirit in all the windy vastness of a dead and empty universe dr barrack seemed about to interrupt with some comment and then it was manifest deferred his interpolation loneliness and littleness said mr huss harshness in the skies above and in the texture of all things if so it is that things are so we must see them every baby in its mothers arms feels safe in a safe creation every child in its home many men and women have lived and died happy in that illusion of security but this war has torn away the veil of illusion from millions of men mankind is coming of age we can see life at last for what it is and what it is not here we spin upon a ball of rock and nickel steel upon which a film of water a few score miles of air lie like the bloom upon a plum all about that ball is space unfathomable all the suns and stars are mere grains of matter scattered through a vastness that is otherwise utterly void to that thin bloom upon a particle we are confined if we tunnel down into the earth presently it is too hot for us to live if we soar five miles into the air we freeze the blood runs out of our vessels into our lungs we die suffocated and choked with blood out of the litter of muds and gravels that make the soil of the world we have picked some traces of the past of our race and the past of life in our observatories and laboratories we have gleaned some hints of its future we have a vision of the opening of the story but the first pages we cannot read we discover life a mere stir amidst the mud creeping along the littoral of warm and shallow seas in the brief nights and days of a swiftly rotating earth we follow through vast ages the story of lifes extension into the waters and its invasion of the air and land plants creep upon the land and raise themselves by stems towards the sun a few worms and crustaceans follow insects appear and at length come our amphibious ancestors breathing air by means of a swimming bladder used as a lung from the first the land animals are patched up creatures they eke out the fish ear they inherit by means of an ear drum made out of a gill slit you can trace scale and fin in bone and limb at last this green scum of vegetable life with the beasts entangled in its meshes creeps in the form of forests over the hills grass spreads across the plains and great animals follow it out into the open what does it all signify no more than green moss spreading over an old tile steadily the earth cools and the day lengthens through long ages of warmth and moisture the wealth of unmeaning life increases come ages of chill and retrocession glacial periods and periods when whole genera and orders die out comes man at last the destroyer the war maker setting fire to the world burning the forests exhausting the earth what hope has he in the end always the day drags longer and longer and always the sun radiates its energy away a time will come when the sun will glow dull red in the heavens shorn of all its beams and neither rising nor setting a day will come when the earth will be as dead and frozen as the moon a spirit in our hearts the god of mankind cries no but is there any voice outside us in all the cold and empty universe that echoes that no ah mr huss mr huss said sir eliphaz his eye seemed seeking some point of attachment and found it at last in the steel engraving of queen victoria giving a bible to a dusky potentate which adorned the little parlour your sickness colours your vision said sir eliphaz what you say is so profoundly true and so utterly false mysteriously evolved living as you say in a mere bloom of air and moisture upon this tiny planet how could we exist how could we continue were we not sustained in every moment by the mercy and wisdom of god the flimsier life is the greater the wonder of his providence not a sparrow said sir eliphaz and then enlarging the metaphor with a boom in his voice not a hair of my head falls to the ground without his knowledge and consent i am a man much occupied i cannot do the reading i would but while you have been reviling the works of god i have been thinking of some wonders sir eliphaz lifted up a hand with thumb and finger opposed as though he held some exquisite thing therein the human eye said sir eliphaz with an intensity of appreciation that brought tears to his own the cross fertilization of plants the marvellous transformations of the higher insects the highly elaborate wing scales of the lepidoptera the mercy that tempers the wind to the shorn lamb the dark warm marvels of embryology the order and rhythm and obedience with which the cells of the fertilized ovum divide to build up the perfect body of a living thing yea even of a human beingin gods image first there is one cell then two the process of division is extremely beautiful and is called i believe karyokinesis then after the two come four each knows his part each divides certainly and marvellously eight sixteen thirty two each of those thirty two cells is a complete thirty second part of a man presently this cell says i become a hair this a blood corpuscle this a cell in the brain of a man to mirror the universe each goes to his own appointed place would that we could do the like said sir eliphaz then consider water said sir eliphaz i am not deeply versed in physical science but there are certain things about water that fill me with wonder and amaze all other liquids contract when they solidify with one or two exceptionsuseful in the arts water expands now water is a non conductor of heat and if water contracted and became heavier when it became ice it would sink to the bottom of the polar seas and remain there unmelted more ice would sink down to it until all the ocean was ice and life ceased but water does not do so no were it not for the vapour of water which catches and entangles the suns heat this world would scorch by day and freeze by night mercy upon mercy i myself said sir eliphaz in tones of happy confession am ninety per cent water we all are and think how mercifully winter is tempered to us by the snow when water freezes in the air in winter time it does not come pelting down as lumps of ice conceivably it might and then where should we be but it belongs to the hexagonal systema system prone to graceful frameworks it crystallizes into the most delicate and beautiful lace of six rayed crystalswonderful under the microscope they flake delicately they lie loosely one upon another out of ice is woven a warm garment like wool white like wool because like wool it is full of aira warm garment for bud and shoot then againyou revile god for the parasites he sends but are they not sent to teach us a great moral lesson each one for himself and god for us all not so the parasites they choose a life of base dependence with that comes physical degeneration swift and sure they are the socialists of nature they lose their limbs they lose colour become blenched unappetising beings vile creatures of slothoften microscopic do they not urge us by their shameful lives to self help and exertion yet even parasites have a use i am told that were it not for parasitic bacteria man could not digest his food a lichen again is made up of an alga and a fungus mutually parasitic that is called symbiosisliving together for a mutual benefit maybe every one of those thousands of parasites you deem so horrible is working its way upward towards an arrangement sir eliphaz weighed his words some mutually advantageous arrangement with its host a paying guest and finally said sir eliphaz with the roll of distant thunder in his voice think of the stately procession of life upon the earth through a myriad of forms the glorious crescendo of evolution up to its climax man what a work is man the paragon of creation the microcosm of the cosmos the ultimate birth of time and you would have us doubt the guiding hand he ceased with a gesture mr dad made a noise like responses in church a certain beauty in the world is no mark of gods favour said mr huss there is no beauty one may not balance by an equal ugliness the wart hog and the hyna the tapeworm and the stinkhorn are equally gods creations nothing you have said points to anything but a cold indifference towards us of this order in which we live beauty happens it is not given pain suffering happiness there is no heed only in the heart of man burns the fire of righteousness for a time mr huss was silent then he went on answering sir eliphaz you spoke of the wonder of the cross fertilization of plants but do you not know that half these curious and elaborate adaptations no longer work scarcely was their evolution completed before the special need that produced them ceased half the intricate flowers you see are as futile as the ruins of palmyra they are self fertilized or wind fertilized the transformation of the higher insects which give us our gnats and wasps our malaria and apple maggots in due season are a matter for human astonishment rather than human gratitude if there is any design in these strange and intricate happenings surely it is the design of a misplaced and inhuman ingenuity the scales of the lepidoptera again have wasted their glittering splendours for millions of years if they were meant for man why do the most beautiful species fly by night in the tropical forests as for the human eye oculists and opticians are scarcely of your opinion you hymn the peculiar properties of water that make life possible they make it possible do they make it other than it is you have talked of the marvels of embryonic growth in the egg i admit the wonderful precision of the process but how does it touch my doubts rather it confuses them as though the god who rules the world ruled not so much in love as in irony wonderfully indeed do the cells divide and the chromoplasts of the division slide along their spindle lines they divide not as if a divine hand guided them but with remorseless logic with the pitiless consistency of a mathematical process they divide and marshal themselves and turn this way and that to make an idiot to make a congenital cripple millions of such miracles pile upand produce the swaying drunkard at the pot house door you talk of the crescendo of evolution of the first beginnings of life and how the scheme unfolds until it culminates in usus here under these circumstances you and mr dad and farr and mewaiting for the knife would that i could see any such crescendo i see change indeed and change and change without plan and without heart consider for example the migrations of birds across the mediterranean and the tragic absurdity of its incidents ages ago and for long ages there stretched continuous land connexions from africa to europe then the instinct was formed the birds flew over land from the heated south to the northern summer to build and breed slowly age by age the seas crept over those necks of land those linking tracts have been broken now for a hundred thousand years and yet over a constantly widening sea in which myriads perish exhausted instinct blind and pitiless still drives those birds and again think of those vain urgencies for some purpose long since forgotten that drive the swarming lemmings to their fate and look at man your evolutions crown consider his want of balance the invalidism of his women the extravagant disproportion of his desires consider the record of the rocks honestly and frankly and where can you trace this crescendo you suggest there have been great ages of marvellous tree ferns and wonderful forest swamps and all those glorious growths have died they did not go on they reached a climax and died another sort of plant succeeded them then think of all that wonderful fauna of the mesozoic times the age of leviathan the theriodonts reptilian beasts the leaping dinosaurs the mososaurs and suchlike monsters of the deep the bat winged pterodactyls the plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs think of the marvels of the mesozoic seas the thousands of various ammonites the wealth of fish life across all that world of life swept death as the wet fingers of a child wipe a drawing from a slate they left no descendants they clambered to a vast variety and complexity and ceased the dawn of the eocene was the bleak dawn of a denuded world crescendo if you will but thereafter diminuendo pianissimo and then once again from fresh obscure starting points far down the stem life swelled and swelled again only to dwindle the world we live in to day is a meagre spectacle beside the abundance of the earlier tertiary time when behemoth in a thousand forms deinotherium titanotherium helladotherium sabre toothed tiger a hundred sorts of elephant and the like pushed through the jungles that are now this mild world of to day where is that crescendo now crescendo through those long ages our ancestors were hiding under leaves and climbing into trees to be out of the way of the crescendo as the motif of a crescendo they sang exceedingly small and now for a little while the world is ours and we wax in our turn to what good to what end tell me you who say the world is good tell me the end how can we escape at last the common fate under the darkling sky of a frozen world he paused for some moments weary with speaking there is no comfort he said in the flowers or the stars no assurance in the past and no sure hope in the future there is nothing but the god of faith and courage in the hearts of men and he gives no sign of power no earnest of victory he gives no sign whereupon sir eliphaz breathed the word immortality let me say a word or two upon immortality said sir eliphaz breaking suddenly into eagerness for that i presume is the thing we have forgotten that i see is the difference between us and you mr huss that is why we can sit here content to play our partial rles knowing full surely that some day the broken lines and inconsecutivenesses that perplex us in this life will all be revealed and resolved into their perfect circles while you to whom this earthly life is all and final you must needs be a rebel you must needs preach a doctrine between defiance and despair if indeed death ended all ah then indeed you might claim that reason was on your side the afflictions of man are very many why should i deny it the patentee and chief proprietor of the temanite blocks paused for a moment yes he said peering up through his eyebrows at the sky that is the real issue blind to that you are blind to everything i dont know whether i am with you on this question of immortality sir eliphaz warned dr barrack coughing shortly for my part im altogether with him said mr dad if there is no immortal lifewell whats the good of being temperate and decent and careful for five and fifty years sir eliphaz had decided now to drop all apologetics for the scheme of nature a place of trial a place of stimulus and training he said respice finem the clues are allbeyond but if you really consider this world as a place for soul making said mr huss what do you think you are doing when you propose to turn woldingstanton over to farr at any rate said farr tartly we do not want soul blackening and counsels of despair at woldingstanton we want the boys taught to serve and help first in this lowly economic sphere cheerfully and enterprisingly and then in higher things before they pass on if death ends all then what is the good of trying mr dad said still brooding over the question if i thought that he added with deep conviction i should let myself go anyone would he blew heavily stuck his hands in his pockets and sat more deeply in his chair an indignant man a business man asked to give up something for nothing for a moment the little gathering hung only too manifestly contemplating the spectacle of mr dad amidst wine women and waistcoats without restraint letting himself go eating drinking and rejoicing being a perfect devil because on the morrow he had to die immortal said mr huss i did not expect immortality to come into this discussion are you immortal farr he asked abruptly i hope so said mr farr unworthy though i be exactly said mr huss and so that is the way out for us you and i mr dad from his factory and sir eliphaz from his building office are to soar it is all arranged for us and that is why the tragic greatness of life is to be hidden from my boys yet even so continued mr huss i do not see why you should be so anxious for technical science and so hostile to the history of mankind because it is not a true history said sir eliphaz his hair waving about like the hair of a man electrified by fresh ideas because it is a bunch of loose ends that are really not ends at all but only beginnings that pass suddenly into the unseen i admit that in this world nothing is rationalized nothing is clearly just i admit everything you say but the reason the reason because this life is only the first page of the great book we have to read we sit here mr huss like men in a waiting room all this life is like waiting outside in a place of some disorder before being admitted to the wider reality the larger sphere where all the cruelties all these confusions everythingwill be explained justifiedand set right he paused and then perceiving that mr huss was about to speak he resumed raising his voice slightly and i do not speak without my book in these matters he said i have been greatly impressedand what is more lady burrows has been greatly impressed by the writings of two thoroughly scientific men two thoroughly scientific men dr conan doyle and sir oliver lodge ever since she lost her younger sister early in life lady burrows has followed up this interest it has been a great consolation to her and the point is as sir oliver insists in that wonderful book raymond that continued existence in another world is as proven now as the atomic theory in chemistry it is not a matter of faith but knowledge the partition is breached at last we are in communication news is coming through scientific certainty sir eliphaz cleared his throat we have already evidences and descriptions of the life into which we shall pass remember this is no idle talk no deception by sludges and the like it is a great english scientific man who publishes these records it is a great french philosopher no less a man than that wonderful thinkerand how he thinksprofessor bergson who counselled their publication a glory of science and a glory of philosophy combine to reassure us we walk at last upon a path of fact into that further world we know already much we know for example that those who have passed over to that higher plane have bodies still that i foundcomforting without thatone would feel bleak but the messages say the internal organs are constituted differently naturally as one would have expected the dietary is i gather practically non existent needless as the outline is the same the space is i presume used for other purposes some sort of astral storage they do not bleed an interesting fact lady burrows sister is now practically bloodless and her teethshe had lost several she suffered greatly with her teethher teeth have all been replaceda beautiful set used now only for articulate speech raymond all over again said the doctor you have read the book said sir eliphaz the doctor grunted in a manner that mingled assent and disapproval his expression betrayed the scientific bigot we know now details of the passage said sir eliphaz we have some particulars we know for instance that people blown to pieces take some little time to reconstitute there is a correlation between this corruptible body and the spirit body that replaces it there is a sort of spirit doctor over there very helpful in such cases and burnt bodies too are a trouble the sexes are still distinct but all the coarseness of sex is gone the passions fade in that better world every passion even the habit of smoking and the craving for alcohol fade not at first the newly dead will sometimes ask for a cigar they are given cigars higher plane cigars and they do not ask for more there are no children born there nothing of that sort that it is very important to understand here is the place of birth this is where lives begin this coarse little planet is the seed bed of life when it has served its purpose and populated those higher planes then indeed it may freeze as you say a mere empty hull a seed case that has served its purpose mattering nothing these are the thoughts the comforting and beautiful thoughts that receive the endorsement of our highest scientific and philosophical intelligences one thinks of that life there no doubt in some other dimension of space that world arranged in planesmetaphorical planes of course in which people go to and fro living in a sort of houses surrounded by a sort of beautiful things made so we are told from the smells of the things we have here that is curious but not irrational our favorite doggies will be there sublimated also that thought has been a great comfort to lady burrows we had a dog called fido a leetle teeny fellowpractically human these blessed ones engage very largely in conversation other occupations i found difficult to trace raymond attended a sort of reception on the very highest plane it was a special privilege perhaps a compliment to sir oliver he met the truth of revealed religion so to speak personally it was a wonderful moment sir oliver suppresses the more solemn details lady burrows intends to write to him she is anxious for particulars but i will not dilate said sir eliphaz i will not dilate and you believe this stuff said the doctor in tones of the deepest disgust sir eliphaz waved himself upon the questioner so far as poor earthly expressions can body forth spiritual things he hedged he regarded his colleagues with an eye of florid defiance both mr farr and mr dad had slightly shamefaced expressions and mr dads ears were red mr dad cleared his throat im sure theres something in itanyhow said mr dad hoarsely doing his best in support if i was born with a hare lip said the doctor would that be put right do congenital idiots get sublimated what becomes of a dog one has shot for hydrophobia to all of such questions said sir eliphaz serenely the answer iswe dont know why should we mr huss seemed lost in meditation his pale and sunken face and crumpled pose contrasted strongly with the bristling intellectual rectitude and mounting choler of dr elihu barrack no sir eliphaz said mr huss and sighed no he repeated what a poor phantom of a world these people conjure up what a mockery of loss and love the very mothers and lovers who mourn their dead will not believe their foolish stories restoration it is a crowning indignity it makes me think of nothing in the world but my dear boys body broken and crumpled and some creature half fool and half impostor sitting upon it getting between it and me and talking cheap rubbish over it about planes of being and astral bodies after all you teach me sir eliphaz that life for all its grossness and pain and horror is not so bad as it might beif such things as this were true but it needs no sifting of the evidence to know they are untrue no sane man believes this stuff for ten minutes together it is impossible to believe it dr elihu barrack applauded sir eliphaz acted a fine self restraint they are contrary to the texture of everything we know said mr huss they are less convincing than the wildest dreams by pain by desire by muscular effort by the feeling of sunshine or of rain in the face by their sense of justice and suchlike essential things do men test the reality of appearances before them this certainly is no reality it has none of the feel of reality i will not even argue about it it is thrust now upon a suffering world as comfort and even as comfort for people stunned and uncritical with grief it fails you and lady burrows may be pleased to think that somehow you two with your teeth restored and your complexions rejuvenated will meet again the sublimation of your faithful fido at any rate thank god for that i know clearly that so i shall never meet my son never he has gone from me for some moments mental and physical suffering gripped him and he could not speak but his purpose to continue was so manifested by sweating face and gripping hand that no one spoke until he spoke again now let me speak plainly about immortality for surely i stand nearest to that possibility of all of us here immortality then is no such dodging away as you imagine from this strange world which is so desolating so dreadful so inexplicableand at times so utterly lonely there may be a god in the universe or there may not be god if he exists can be terribly silent but if there is a god he is a coherent god if there is a god above and in the scheme of things then not only you and i and my dead son but the crushed frog and the trampled anthill signify on that the god in my heart insists there has to be an answer not only to the death of my son but to the dying penguin roasted alive for a farthings worth of oil there must be an answer to the men who go in ships to do such things there has to be a justification for all the filth and wretchedness of louse and fluke i will not have you slipping by on the other side chattering of planes of living and sublimated atoms while there is a drunken mother or a man dying of cholera in this world i will not hear of a god who is just a means for getting away whatever foulness and beastliness there is you must square god with that or there is no universal god but only a coldness a vast cruel difference i would not make my peace with such a god if i could i tell you of these black and sinister realities and what do you reply that it is all right because after death we shall get away from them why if presently i go down under the surgeons knife down out of this hot and weary world and then find myself being put together by a spirit doctor in this beyond of yours waking up to a new world of amiable conversations and artificial flowers having my hair restored and the gaps among my teeth filled up i shall feel like someone who has deserted his kind who has sneaked from a sickroom into a party wellmy infection will go with me i shall talk of nothing but the tragedy out of which i have comewhich still remainswhich continuestragedy and yet i believe in immortality dr barrack who had hitherto been following mr huss with evident approval started sounded a note of surprise and protest and fixed accusing eyes upon him for the moment he did not interrupt but it is not i that am immortal but the god within me all this personal immortality of which you talk is a mockery of our personalities what is there personal in us that can live what makes us our very selves it is all a matter of little mean things small differences slight defects where does personal love gripon just these petty things oh dearly and bitterly did i love my son and what is it that my heart most craves for now his virtues no his ambitions his achievements no none of these things but for a certain queer flush among his freckles for a kind of high crack in his voice a certain absurd hopefulness in his talk the sound of his footsteps a little halt there was in the rhythm of them these are the things we long for these are the things that wring the heart but all these things are just the mortal things just the defects that would be touched out upon this higher plane you talk about you would give him back to me smoothed and polished and regularized so i grant it must be if there is to be this higher plane but what does it leave of personal distinction what does it leave of personal love when my son has had his defects smoothed away then he will be like all sons when the older men have been ironed out they will be like the younger men there is no personality in hope and honour and righteousness and truth my son has gone he has gone for evermore the pain may some day go the immortal thing in us is the least personal thing it is not you nor i who go on living it is man that lives on man the universal and he goes on living a tragic rebel in this same world and in no other mr huss leant back in his chair there burns an undying fire in the hearts of men by that fire i live by that i know the god of my salvation his will is truth his will is service he urges me to conflict without consolations without rewards he takes and does not restore he uses up and does not atone he suffersperhaps to triumph and we must suffer and find our hope of triumph in him he will not let me shut my eyes to sorrow failure or perplexity though the universe torment and slay me yet will i trust in him and if he also must dienevertheless i can do no more i must serve him he ceased for some moments no one spoke silenced by his intensity chapter the fifth elihu reproves job i dont know how all this strikes you said mr farr turning suddenly upon dr barrack wellits interestin said dr barrack leaning forward upon his folded arms upon the table and considering his words carefully its interestin he repeated i dont know how far you want to hear what i think about it im rather a downright person sir eliphaz with great urbanity motioned him to speak on theres been if youll forgive me nonsense upon both sides he turned to sir eliphaz this spook stuff he said and paused and compressed his lips and shook his head it wont do i have given some little attention to the evidences in that matter im something of a psychologista doctor has to be of course sir eliphaz youre not responsible for all the nonsense you have been talking about sublimated bricks and spook dogs made of concentrated smell sir eliphaz was convulsed tut tut he said but indeed no offence sir eliphaz if you dont want me to talk i wont but if you do then i must say what i have in my mind and as i say i dont hold you responsible for the things you have been saying all this cheap medium stuff has been shot upon the world by sir oliver j lodge handed out by him to people distraught with grief in a great fat impressive looking volume no end of them have tried their utmost to take it seriously its been a pitiful business ive no doubt the man is honest after his lights but what lights they are obstinate credulity posing as liberalism he takes every pretence and dodge of these mediums he accepts their explanations he edits their babble and rearranges it to make it seem striking look at his critical ability because many of the mediums are fairly respectable people who either make no money by theirrevelations or at most a very ordinary livingits a guinea a go i believe usuallyhe insists upon their honesty thats his key blunder any doctor could tell him as i could have told him after my first years practice that telling the truth is the very last triumph of the human mind hardly any of my patients tell the truthever it isnt only that they havent a tithe of the critical ability and detachment necessary they havent any real desire to tell the truth they want to produce effects human beings are artistic still they arent beginning to be scientific either they minimize or they exaggerate we all do if i saw a cat run over outside and i came in here to tell you about it i should certainly touch up the story make it more dramatic hurt the cat more make the dray bigger and so on i should want to justify my telling the story put a woman in that chair there tell her to close her eyes and feel odd and shell feel odd right enough tell her to produce words and sentences that she finds in her head and shell produce them give her half a hint that it comes from eastern asia and the stuff will begin to correspond to her ideas of pigeon english it isnt that she is cunningly and elaborately deceiving you it is that she wants to come up to your expectation you are focussing your interest on her and all human beings like to have interest focussed on them so long as it isnt too hostile shell cling to that interest all she knows how shell cling instinctively most of these mediums never held the attention of a roomful of people in their lives until they found out this way of doing it what can you expect dr barrack cleared his throat but all thats beside the question he said dont think that because i reject all this spook stuff im setting up any finality for the science we have to day its just a little weak squirt of knowledgeall the science in the world i grant you there may be forces i would almost say there must be forces in the world forces universally present of which we still know nothing take the case of electricity what did men know of electricity in the days of gilbert practically nothing in the early neolithic age i doubt if any men had ever noticed there was such a thing as air i grant you that most things are still unknown things perhaps right under our noses but that doesnt help the case of sir eliphaz one little bit these unknown things as they become known will join on to the things we do know theyll complicate or perhaps simplify our ideas but they wont contradict our general ideas theyll be things in the system they wont get you out of the grip of the arguments mr huss has brought forward so far so far as concerns your immortality sir eliphaz i am you see entirely with mr huss its a fancy its a dream as a fancy its about as pretty as creaking boards at bedtime as a dream its unattractive as mr huss has said but when it comes to mr huss and his immortality then i find myself with you gentlemen that too is a dream less than a dream less even than a fancy its a play on words here is this undying flame this spirit of god in man its in him he says its in you sir eliphaz its in you mrdad wasnt it its in this other gentleman whose name i didnt quite catch and its in me well its extraordinary that none of us know of it except mr huss how you feel about it i dont know but personally i object to being made part of god and one with mr huss without my consent in this way i prefer to remain myself that may be egotism but i am by nature an egotistical creature and agnostic youve got me talking now and i may as well go through with it what is an agnostic really a man who accepts fully the limitations of the human intelligence who takes the world as he finds it and who takes himself as he finds himself and declines to go further there may be other universes and dimensions galore there may be a fourth dimension for example and if you like a fifth dimension and a sixth dimension and any number of other dimensions they dont concern me i live in this universe and in three dimensions and i have no more interest in all these other universes and dimensions than a bug under the wallpaper has in the deep deep sea possibly there are bugs under the wallpaper with a kind of reasoned consciousness of the existence of the deep deep sea and a half belief that when at last the keatings powder gets them thither they will go iif i may have one more go at the imagejust live under the wallpaper i am an agnostic i say i have had my eyes pretty well open at the universe since i came into it six and thirty years ago and not only have i never seen nor heard of nor smelt nor touched a ghost or spirit sir eliphaz but i have never seen a gleam or sign of this providence the great god of the world of yours or of this other minor and modern god that mr huss has taken up in the hearts of men i have found malformations ossifications clots and fatty degeneration but never a god you will excuse me if i speak plainly to you gentlemen but this gentleman whose name i havent somehow got farr mr farr has brought it down on himself and you he called me in and i am interested in these questions its clear to me that since we exist theres something in all this but what it is im convinced i havent the ganglia even to begin to understand i decline either the wild guesses of the spookist and providentialisti must put you there im afraid sir eliphazor the metaphors of mr huss fact dr barrack paused i put my faith in fact theres a lot in fact said mr dad who found much that was congenial in the doctors downright style what do i see about me asked dr barrack a struggle for existence about that i ask a very plain and simple question why try to get behind it that is it it made me i study it and watch it it put me up like a cockshy and it keeps on trying to destroy me i do my best to dodge its blows it got my leg my head is bloody but unbowed i reproduce my kindas abundantly as circumstances permiti stamp myself upon the universe as much as possible if i am right if i do the right things and have decently good luck i shall hold out until my waning instincts dispose me to rest my breed and influence are the marks of my rightness what else is there you may call this struggle what you like god if you like but god for me is an anthropomorphic idea call it the process why not evolution said mr huss i prefer the process the word evolution rather begs the moral question its a cheap word shon evolution seems to suggest just a simple and automatic unfolding the process is complex it has its ups and downsas mr huss understands it is more like a will than an automaton a will feeling about it isnt indifferent to us as mr huss suggests it uses us it isnt subordinate to us as sir eliphaz would have us believe playing the part of a providence just for our comfort and happiness some of us are hammer and some of us are anvil some of us are sparks and some of us are the beaten stuff which survives the process doesnt confide in us why should it we learn what we can about it and make what is called a practical use of it for that is what the will in the process requires mr dad stirred by the word practical made a noise of assent but not a very confident noise a loan rather than a gift and that is where it seems to me mr huss goes wrong altogether he does not submit himself to those realities he sets up something called the spirit in man or the god in his heart to judge them he wants to judge the universe by the standards of the human intelligence at its present stage of development thats where i fall out with him these are not fixed standards man goes on developing and evolving some things offend the sense of justice in mr huss but that is no enduring criterion of justice the human sense of justice has developed out of something different and it will develop again into something different like everything else in us it has been produced by the process and it will be modified by the process some things again he says are not beautiful there also he would condemn but nothing changes like the sense of beauty a band of art students can start a new movement cubist vorticist or what not and change your sense of beauty if seeing things as beautiful conduces to survival we shall see them as beautiful sooner or later rest assured i daresay the hyenas admire each otherin the rutting season anyhow so it is with mercy and with everything each creature has its own standards after man is the beyond man who may find mercy folly who may delight in things that pain our feeble spirits we have to obey the process in our own place and our own time that is how i see things that is the stark truth of the universe looked at plainly and hard the lips of mr dad repeated noiselessly plainly and hard but he felt very uncertain for some moments the doctor sat with his forearms resting on the table as if he had done then he resumed i gather that this talk here to day arose out of a discussion about education youd hardly believe it said mr dad but dr barracks next remark checked mr dads growing approval that seems perfectly logical to me its one of the things i can never understand about schoolmasters and politicians and suchlike the way they seem to take it for granted you can educate and not bring in religion and socialism and all your beliefs what is education teaching young people to talk and read and write and calculate in order that they may be told how they stand in the world and what we think we and the world generally are up to and the part we expect them to play in the game well how can we do that and at the same time leave it all out what is the game that is what every youngster wants to know answering him is education either we are going to say what we think the game is plainly and straightforwardly or else we are going to make motions as though we were educating when we are really doing nothing of the kind in which case the stupid ones will grow up with their heads all in a muddle and be led by any old catchword anywhere according to luck and the clever ones will grow up with the idea that life is a sort of empty swindle most educated people in this country believe it is a sham and a swindle they flounder about and never get up against a reality its amazing how people can lose their grip on realityhow most people have the way my patients come along to me and tell me lieseven about their stomach aches the idea of anything being direct and reasonable has gone clean out of their heads they think they can fool me about the facts and that when im properly fooled i shall then humbug their stomachs into not achingsomehow now my gospel is thisface facts take the world as it is and take yourself as you are and the fundamental fact we all have to face is this that this process takes no account of our desires or fears or moral ideas or anything of the sort it puts us up it tries us over and if we dont stand the tests it knocks us down and ends us that may not be right as you test it by your little human standards but it is right by the atoms and the stars then what must a proper education be dr barrack paused tell them what the world is tell them every rule and trick of the game mankind has learnt and tell them be yourselves be yourselves up to the hilt it is no good being anything but your essential self because dr barrack spoke like one who quotes a sacred formula there is no inheritance of acquired characteristics your essential self your essential heredity are on trial put everything of yourself into the process if the process wants you it will accept you if it doesnt you will go under you cant help iteither way you may be the bit of marble that is left in the statue or you may be the bit of marble that is thrown away you cant help it be yourself dr barrack had sat back he raised his voice at the last words and lifted his hand as if to smite the table but so good a thing is professional training he let his hand fall slowly as he remembered that mr huss was his patient mr huss did not speak for some moments he was thinking so deeply that he seemed to be unobservant of the cessation of the doctors discourse then he awoke to the silence with a start you do not differ among yourselves so much as you may think he said at last you all argue to one end however wide apart your starting points may be you argue that men may lead fragmentary lives and he reflected further submissive lives not submissive said dr barrack in a kind of footnote you say sir eliphaz that this universe is in the charge of providence all wise and amiable that he guides this world to ends we cannot understand desirable ends did we but know them but incomprehensible that this life this whole universe is but the starting point for a developing series of immortal lives and from this you conclude that the part a human being has to play in this scheme is the part of a trustful child which need only not pester the higher powers which need only do its few simple congenial duties to be surely preserved and rewarded and carried on there is much in simple faith said sir eliphaz sneer though you may but your view is a grimmer one dr barrack you say that this process is utterly beyond knowledge and control we cannot alter it or appease it it makes of some of us vessels of honour and of others vessels of dishonour it has scrawled our race across the black emptiness of space and it may wipe us out again such is the quality of fate we can but follow our lights and instincts in the end in practical matters your teaching marches with the teaching of sir eliphaz you bow to the thing that is he gladly and trustfullywith a certain old world courtesy you grimlyin the modern style for some moments mr huss sat with compressed lips as though he listened to the pain within him then he said i dont i dont submit i rebelnot in my own strength nor by my own impulse i rebel by the spirit of god in me i rebel not merely to make weak gestures of defiance against the black disorder and cruelties of space and time but for mastery i am a rebel of pridei am full of the pride of god in my heart i am the servant of a rebellious and adventurous god who may yet bring order into this cruel and frightful chaos in which we seem to be driven hither and thither like leaves before the wind a god who in spite of all appearances may yet rule over it at last and mould it to his will what a world it will be whispered mr farr unable to restrain himself and yet half ashamed of his sneer what a world it is farr what a cunning and watchful world does it serve even you so insecure has it become that opportunity may yet turn a frightful face upon youin the very moment as you snatch but you see how i differ from you all you see that the spirit of my life and of my teachingof my teachingfor all its weaknesses and slips and failures is a fight against that dark being of the universe who seeks to crush us all who broods over me now even as i talk to you it is a fight against disorder a refusal of that very submission you have made a repudiation altogether of that same voluntary death in life he moistened his lips and resumed the end and substance of all real education is to teach men and women of the battle of god to teach them of the beginnings of life upon this lonely little planet amidst the endless stars and how those beginnings have unfolded to show them how man has arisen through the long ages from amidst the beasts and the nature of the struggle god wages through him and to draw all men together out of themselves into one common life and effort with god the nature of gods struggle is the essence of our dispute it is a struggle with a hope of victory but with no assurance you have argued sir eliphaz that it is an unreal struggle a sham fight that indeed all things are perfectly adjusted and for our final happiness and when i have reminded you a little of the unmasked horrors about us you have shifted your ground of compensation into anotherinto an incredibleworld sir eliphaz sounded dissent musically then he waved his long hand as mr huss paused and regarded him but go on he said go on and now i come to you dr barrack and your modern fatalism you hold this universe is uncontrollableanyhow and incomprehensible for good or illwe can be no more than our strenuous selves you must you say be yourself i answer you must lose yourself in something altogether greaterin god there is a curious likeness doctor and a curious difference in your views and mine i think you see the world very much as i see it but you see it coldly like a man before sunrise and i he paused there is a light upon it he asserted with a noticeable flatness in his voice there is a light light he became silent for a while it seemed as if the light he spoke of had gone from him and as if the shadow had engulfed him when he spoke again it was with an evident effort he turned to dr barrack you think he said that there is a will in this process of yours which will take things somewhere somewhere definitely greater or better or onward i hold that there is no will at all except in and through ourselves if there be any will at all i hold that even your maxim be ourselves is a paradox for we cannot be ourselves until we have lost ourselves in god i have talked to sir eliphaz and to you since you came in of the boundless disorder and evil of nature let me talk to you now of the boundless miseries that arise from the disorderliness of men and that must continue age after age until either men are united in spirit and in truth or destroyed through their own incoherence whether men will be lost or saved i do not know there have been times when i was sure that god would triumph in us but dark shadows have fallen upon my spirit consider the posture of mens affairs now consider where they stand to day because they have not yet begun to look deeply and frankly into realities because as they put it they take life as they find it because they are themselves heedless of history and do not realize that in truth they are but parts in one great adventure in space and time for four years now the world has been marching deeper and deeper into tragedy our life that seemed so safe grows insecure and more and more insecure six million soldiers six million young men have been killed on the battlefields alone three times as many have been crippled and mutilated as many again who were not soldiers have been destroyed that has been only the beginning of the disaster that has come upon our race all human relationships have been strained roads ships harvests destroyed and behind the red swift tragedy of this warfare comes the gaunt and desolating face of universal famine now and behind famine that inevitable follower of famine pestilence you gentlemen who have played so useful a part in supplying munitions of war who have every reason in days well spent and energies well used to see a transitory brightness upon these sombre things you may tell me that i lack faith when i say that i can see nothing to redeem the waste and destruction of the last four years and the still greater waste and spiritless disorder and poverty and disease ahead of us you will tell me that the world has learnt a lesson it could learn in no other way that we shall set up a world league of nations now and put an end to war but on what will you set up your world league of nations what foundations have you made in the last four years but ruins is there any common idea any common understanding yet in the minds of men they are still taking the world as they find it they are being their unmitigated selves more than ever and below the few who scramble for profits now is a more and more wolfish multitude scrambling for bread there are no common ideas in mens minds upon which we can build how can men be united except by common ideas the schools have failed the world what common thought is there in the world a loud bawling of base newspapers a posturing of politicians you can see chaos coming again over all the east of europe now and bit by bit western europe crumbles and drops into the confusion art science reasoned thought creative effort such things have ceased altogether in russia they may have ceased there perhaps for centuries they die now in germany the universities of the west are bloodless and drained of their youth that war that seemed at first so like the dawn of a greater age has ceased to matter in the face of this greater disaster the french and british and americans are beating back the germans from paris can they beat them back to any distance will not this present counterthrust diminish and fail as the others have done which side may first drop exhausted now will hardly change the supreme fact the supreme fact is exhaustionexhaustion mental as well as material failure to grasp and comprehend cessation even of attempts to grasp and comprehend slackening of every sort of effort whats the good of such despair said mr dad i do not despair no but what is the good of lying about hope and success in the midst of failure and gathering disaster what is the good of saying that mankind winsautomaticallyagainst the spirit of evil when mankind is visibly losing point after point is visibly losing heart what is the good of pretending that there is order and benevolence or some sort of splendid and incomprehensible process in this festering waste this windy desolation of tremendous things there is no reason anywhere there is no creation anywhere except the undying fire the spirit of god in the hearts of men which may fail which may fail which seems to me to fail he paused dr barrack cleared his throat i dont want to seem obdurate said dr barrack i want to respect deep feeling one must respect deep feeling but for the life of me i cant put much meaning into this phrase the spirit of god in the hearts of men its rather against my habits to worry a patient but this is so interestingthis is an exceptional occasion i would like to ask you mr hussfranklyis there anything very much more to it than a phrase there was no answer words said mr dad joost words if mr huss had ever spent three months of war time running a big engineering factory my mind is a sceptical mind dr barrack went on after staring a moment to see if mr dad meant to finish his sentence i want things i can feel and handle i am an agnostic by nature and habit and profession a doubting thomas born and bred well i take it that about the universe mr huss is very much of an agnostic too more so he doubts more than i do he doubts whether there is any trace of plan or purpose in it what i call a process he calls a windy desolation he sees chaos still waiting for a creator but then he sets up against that this undying fire of his this spirit of god which is lit in him and only waiting to be lighted in us a sort of insurgent apprentice creator well the doctor frowned and meditated on his words i want more of the practical outcome of this fire i admit a certain poetry in the idea but i am a plain and practical man give me something to know this fire by and to recognize it again when i see it i wont ask why undying i wont quibble about that but what does this undying fire mean in actual things and our daily life in some way it is mixed up with teaching history in schools a faint note of derision made him glance at the face to his right that doesnt strike me as being so queer as it seems to strike mr farr it interests me there is a cause for it but i think there are several links mr huss hasnt shown and several vital points he still has to explain this undying fire is something that is burning in mr huss and i gather from his pretty broad hints it ought he thinks to be burning in meand you gentlemen it is something that makes us forget our little personal differences makes us forget ourselves and brings us all into line againstwhat thats my first pointagainst what i dont see the force and value of this line up i think we struggle against one another by nature and necessity that we polish one another in the struggle and sharpen our edges i think that out of this struggle for existence comes better things and better they may not be better things by our standards now but by the standards of the process they are sometimes the mills of the process may seem overpoweringly grim and high and pitiless that is a question of scale but mr huss does not believe in the struggle he wants to take mens minds and teach them so that they will not struggle against each other but live and work all together for what that is my second pointfor what there is a rationality in my idea of an everlasting struggle making incessantly for betterment such an idea does at any rate give a direction and take us somewhere but there is no rationality in declaring we are still fighting and fighting more than ever while in effect we are arranging to stop that struggle which carries life onif we canif we can that is the paradox of mr huss when there is neither competition at home nor war abroad when the cat and the bird have come to a satisfactory understanding when the spirit of his human god rules even in the jungle and the sea then where shall we be heading time will be still unfolding but man will have halted if he has ceased to compete individually he will have halted mr huss looks at me as if he thought i wronged him in saying that well then he must answer my questions what will the human god be leading us against and what shall we be living for let me tell you first what the spirit of god struggles against said mr huss i will not dispute that this process of yours has made good things all the good things in man it has made as well as all the evil it has made them indifferently in usin some of usit has made the will to seize upon that chance born good and separate it from the chance born evil the spirit of god rises out of your process as if he were a part of your process except for him the good and evil are inextricably mixed good things flower into evil things and evil things wholly or partially redeem themselves by good consequences good and evil have meaning only for us the process is indifferent it makes it destroys it favours it torments on its own account it preserves nothing and continues nothing it is just careless but for us it has made opportunity life is opportunity unless we do now ourselves seize hold upon life and the process while we are in it the process becoming uncontrollable again will presently sweep us altogether away in the back of your mind doctor is the belief in a happy ending just as much as in the mind of sir eliphaz i see deeper because i am not blinded by health you think that beyond man comes some sort of splendid super man a healthy delusion there is nothing beyond man unless men will that something shall be we shall be wiped out as carelessly as we have been made and something else will come as disconnected and aimless something neither necessarily better nor necessarily worse but something different to be wiped out in its turn unless the spirit of god that moves in us can rouse us to seize this universe for him and ourselves that is the nature of your process your process is just chaos man is the opportunity the passing opportunity for order in the waste people write and talk as if this great war which is now wrecking the world was a dramatic and consecutive thing they talk of it as a purge as a great lesson as a phase in history that marks the end of wars and divisions so it might be but is it so and will it be so i asked you a little time ago to look straightly at the realities of animal life of life in general as we know it i think i did a little persuade you to my own sense of shallowness of our assumption that there is any natural happiness the poor beasts and creatures have to suffer i ask you now to look as straightly at the things that men have done and endured in this war it is plain that they have shown extraordinary fertility and ingenuity in the inventions they have used and an amazing capacity for sacrifice and courage but it is i argue equally plain that the pains and agonies they have undergone have taught the race little or nothing and that their devices have been mainly for their own destruction the only lesson and the only betterment that can come out of this war will come if men inspired by the divine courage say this and all such things must end but i do not perceive them saying that on the other hand i do perceive a great amount of human energy and ability that has been devoted and is still being devoted to things that lead straight to futility and extinction the most desolating thing about this war is neither the stupidity nor the cruelty of it but the streak of perversion that has run through it against the meagreness of the intelligence that made the war against the absolute inability of the good forces in life to arrest it and end it i ask you to balance the intelligence and devotion that has gone to such an enterprise as the offensive use of poison gas consider the ingenuity and the elaboration of that the different sorts of shell used the beautifully finished devices to delay the release of the poison so as to catch men unawares after their gas masks are removed one method much in favour with the germans now involves the use of two sorts of gas they have a gas now not very deadly but so subtle that it penetrates the gas masks and produces nausea and retching the man is overcome by the dread of being sick so that he will clog his mask and suffocate and he snatches off his protection in an ungovernable physical panic then the second gas of the coarser more deadly type comes into play that he breathes in fully his breath catches he realizes what he has done but it is too late death has him by the throat he passes through horrible discomfort and torment to the end you cough you stagger you writhe upon the ground and are deadly sick you die heaving and panting with staring eyes so it is men are being killed now it is but one of a multitude of methods disgusting undignified and monstrous but intelligent technically admirable you cannot deny doctor barrack that this ingenious mixture is one of the last fruits of your process to that your process has at last brought men from the hoeing and herding of neolithic days now tell me how is the onward progress of mankind to anything anywhere secured by this fine flower of the process intellectual energy industrial energy are used up without stint to make this horror possible multitudes of brave young men are spoilt or killed is there any selection in it along such lines can you imagine men or life or the universe getting anywhere at all why do they do such things they do not do it out of a complete and organized impulse to evil if you took the series of researches and inventions that led at last to this use of poison gas you would find they were the work of a multitude of mainly amiable fairly virtuous and kindly meaning men each one was doing his bit as mr dad would say each one to use your phrase doctor was being himself and utilizing the gift that was in him in accordance with the drift of the world about him each one sir eliphaz was modestly taking the world as he found it they were living in an uninformed world with no common understanding and no collective plan a world ignorant of its true history and with no conception of its future into these horrors they drifted for the want of a world education out of these horrors no lesson will be learnt no will can arise for the same reason every man lives ignorantly in his own circumstances from hand to mouth from day to day swayed first of all by this catchword and then by that let me take another instance of the way in which human ability and energy if they are left to themselves without co ordination without a common basis of purpose without a god will run into cul de sacs of mere horribleness let me remind you a little of what the submarine is and what it signifies in this country we think of the submarine as an instrument of murder but we think of it as something ingeniously contrived and at any rate not tormenting and destroying the hands that guide it i will not recall to you the stories that fill our newspapers of men drowning in the night of crowded boatloads of sailors and passengers shelled and sunken of men forced to clamber out of the sea upon the destroying u boat and robbed of their lifebelts in order that when it submerged they should be more surely drowned i want you to think of the submarine in itself there is a kind of crazy belief that killing however cruel has a kind of justification in the survival of the killer we make that our excuse for instance for the destruction of the native tasmanians who were shot whenever they were seen and killed by poisoned meat left in their paths but the marvel of these submarines is that they also torture and kill their own crews they are miracles of short sighted ingenuity for the common unprofitable reasonless destruction of germans and their enemies they are almost quintessential examples of the elaborate futility and horror into which partial ideas about life combative and competitive ideas of life thrust mankind take some poor german boy with an ordinary sort of intelligence an ordinary human disposition to kindliness and some gallantry who becomes finally a sailor in one of these craft consider his case and what we do to him you will find in him a sample of what we are doing for mankind as a child he is ingenuous teachable plastic he is also egotistical greedy and suspicious he is easily led and easily frightened he likes making things if he knows how to make them he is capable of affection and capable of resentment he is a sheet of white paper upon which anything may be written his parents teach him his companions his school do they teach him anything of the great history of mankind do they teach him of his blood brotherhood with all men do they tell him anything of discovery of exploration of human effort and achievement no they teach him that he belongs to a blonde and wonderful race the only race that matters on this planet no such distinct race ever existed it is a lie for the damning of men and these teachers incite him to suspicion and hatred and contempt of all other races they fill his mind with fears and hostilities everything german they tell him is good and splendid everything not german is dangerous and wicked they take that poor actor of an emperor at potsdam and glorify him until he shines upon this lads mind like a star the boy grows up a mental cripple his capacity for devotion and self sacrifice is run into a mould of fanatical loyalty for the kaiser and hatred for foreign things comes this war and the youngster is only too eager to give himself where he is most needed he is told that the submarine war is the sure way of striking the enemies of his country a conclusive blow to be in a submarine is to be at the spear point he dare scarcely hope that he will be accepted for this vital service to which princes might aspire but he is fortunate he is he trains for a submarine i do not know how far you gentlemen remember your youth a schoolmaster perhaps remembers more of his early adolescence than other men because he is being continually reminded of it but it is a time of very fine emotions boundless ambitions a newly awakened and eager sense of beauty this youngster sees himself as a hero fighting for his half divine kaiser for dear germany against the cold and evil barbarians who resist and would destroy her he passes through his drill and training he goes down into a submarine for the first time clambers down the narrow hatchway it is a little cold but wonderful a marvellous machine how can such a nest of inventions ingenuities beautiful metal work wonderful craftsmanship be anything but right his mind is full of dreams of proud enemy battleships smitten and heeling over into the waters while he watches his handiwork with a stern pride a restrained exultation a sense of germany vindicated that is how his mind has been made for him that is the sort of mind that has been made and is being made in boys all over the world because there is no common plan in the world because each person in the making of this boy just as each person in the making of the submarine had been himself and done his bit followed his own impulses and interests without regard to the whole regardless of any plan or purpose in human affairs ignorant of the spirit of god who would unify us and lead us to a common use for all our gifts and energies let me go on with the story of this youngster comes a day when he realizes the reality of the work he is doing for his kind he stands by one of the guns of the submarine in an attack upon some wretched ocean tramp he realizes that the war he wages is no heroic attack on pride or predominance but a mere murdering of traffic he sees the little ship shelled the wretched men killed and wounded no tyrants of the seas but sailor men like himself he sees their boats smashed to pieces mostly such sinkings are done at dawn or sundown under a level light which displays a world of black lines and black silhouettes asway with the slow heaving and falling of coldly shining water these little black things he realizes incredulously that struggle and disappear amidst the wreckage are the heads of men brothers to himself for hundreds of thousands of men who have come into this war expecting bright and romantic and tremendous experiences their first killing must have been a hideous disillusionment for none so much as for the men of the submarines all that sense of being right and fine that carries men into battle that carries most of us through the world must have vanished completely at this first vision of reality our man must have asked himself what am i doing in the night he must have lain awake and stared at that question in horrible doubt we scold too much at the german submarine crews in this country most of us in their places would be impelled to go on as they go on the work they do has been reached step by step logically inevitably because our world has been content to drift along on false premises and haphazard assumptions about nationality and race and the order of things these things have happened because the technical education of men has been better than their historical and social education once men have lost touch with or failed to apprehend that idea of a single human community that idea which is the substance of all true history and the essential teaching of god it is towards such organized abominations as these that they driftnecessarily people in this country who are just as incoherent in their minds just as likely to drift into some kindred cul de sac of conduct would have these u boat men torturedto show the superiority of their own moral standards but indeed these men are tortured bear yet a little longer with this boy of mine in the u boat ive tried to suggest him to you with his conscience scaredat a moment when his submarine had made a kill but those moments are rare for most of its time the u boat is under water and a hunted thing the surface swarms with hostile craft sea planes and observation balloons are seeking it every time a u boat comes even near to the surface it may be spotted by a sea plane and destruction may fall upon it even when it is submerged below the limits of visibility in the turbid north sea waters the noise of its engines will betray it to a listening apparatus and a happy guess with a depth charge may end its career i want you to think of the daily life of this youngster under these conditions i want you to see exactly where wrong ideas not his but wrong ideas ruling in the world about him are driving him the method of detection by listening apparatus improves steadily and nowadays our destroyers will follow up a u boat sometimes for sixty or seventy hours following her sounds as a hound follows the scent of its quarry at last if the u boat cannot shake off her pursuers she must come to the surface and fight or surrender that is the strangest game of blind man that ever human beings played the u boat doubles and turns listening also for the sounds of the pursuers at the surface are they coming nearer are they getting fainter unless a helpful mud bank is available for it to lie up in silence for a time the u boat must keep moving and using up electrical force so that ultimately it must come to the surface to recharge its batteries as far as possible the crew of the u boat are kept in ignorance of the chase in progress they get hints from the anxiety or irritation of the commander or from the haste and variety of his orders something is going onthey do not know quite whatsomething that may end disagreeably if the pursuer tries a depth charge then they know for certain from the concussion that the hand of death is feeling for them in the darkness always the dread of a depth charge must haunt the imagination of the u boat sailor without notice at any hour may come thud and concussion to warn him that the destroying powers are on his track the fragile ship jumps and quivers from end to end the men are thrown about that happens to our youngster he curses the damned english and if you think it over what else can you expect him to curse a little nearer and the rivets will start and actual leakage begin letting in a pressure of several atmospheres yet a little nearer and the water will come pressing in through cracks and breaches at a score of points the air will be compressed in his lungs the long death struggle of the u boat will begin and after some hours of hopeless suffering he will suffocate and drown like a rat in a flooded tunnel think of the life of endless apprehension in that confined space below the waters the air is almost always stuffy and sometimes it is poisonous all sorts of evil chances may occur in this crowded tinful of machinery to release oppressive gases and evil odours a whiff of chlorine for instance may warn the crew of flooded accumulators at the first sting of chlorine the u boat must come up at any risk and nothing can be kept dry the surfaces of the apparatus and the furniture sweat continually except where the machinery radiates a certain heat a clammy chill pervades the whole contrivance have you ever seen the thick blubber of a whale only by means of that enormous layer of non conductor can a whale keep its body warm in spite of the waters about it a u boat cannot afford any layer of blubber it is at the temperature of the dark under waters and this life of cold fear suffocation headache and nausea is not sustained by hot and nourishing food there is no blazing galley fire for the cook of the u boat the u boat rolls very easily she is of course no heavier nor lighter than the water in which she floats and if by chance she touches bottom in shallow water she bounds about like a rubber ball on a pavement inside the sailors are thrown about and dashed against the machinery that is the quality of everyday life in a u boat retained below the surface now think what an emergence involves up she comes until the periscope can scrutinize the sky and the nearer sea nothing in sight thank god she rises out of the water and some of the sailors get a breath of fresh air not all for there is no room nor time for all of them to come out but the fortunate ones who get to the hatches may even have the luck of sunshine to come to the surface on a calm open sea away from any traffic at all is the secret hope of every u boat sailor but suppose now there is something in sight then the u boat must come up with infinite discretion and examine the quarry it looks an innocent craft a liner a trawler a cargo boat but is that innocence certain how does the u boat man know that she hasnt a gun what new contrivance of the hunter may not hide behind that harmless looking mask until they have put a ship down the u boat sailors never know what ugly surprise she may not have in store for them when they approach a vessel they must needs be ignorant of what counter attack creeps upon them from her unseen other side as a consequence these men are in terror of every ship they hail is it any wonder then if their behaviour is hasty and hysterical if they curse and insult the wretched people they are proposing to drown if they fire upon them unexpectedly and do strange and abominable things the u boat man is no fine captain on his quarter deck he is a man who lives a life of intense physical hardship and extreme fear who faces overwhelming risks in order to commit as inglorious a crime as any man can commit he is a man already in hell the germans do what they can to keep up the spirit of these crews an english captain who spent a fortnight upon one as a prisoner and who was recently released by way of switzerland says that when they had sunk a merchant ship they played victory music on the gramophone imagine that bleak festival the inevitable end of the u boat sailor unless he is lucky enough to get captured is death and a very horrible and slow death indeed sooner or later it is bound to come some never return from their first voyage there is a brief spree ashore if they do then out they go again perhaps they return a second time perhaps not some may even have made a score of voyages but sooner or later they are caught the average life of a u boat is less than five voyagesout and home of the crews of the original u boats which began the u boat campaign very few men survive to day when our young hopeful left his home in germany to join the u boat service he left it for a certain death he learns that slowly from the conversation of his mates men are so scarce now for this vile work that once germany has got a man she will use him to the end and that end i was given some particulars of the fate of one u boat that were told by two prisoners who died at harwich the other day this particular boat was got by a mine which tore a hole in her aft she was too disabled to come to the surface and she began to sink tail down now the immediate effect of a hole in a u boat is of course to bring the air pressure within her to the same level as the pressure of the water outside for every ten yards of depth this means an addition of fourteen pounds to the square inch the ears and blood vessels are suddenly subjected to this enormous pressure there is at once a violent pain in the ears and a weight on the chest cotton wool has to be stuffed into ears and nostrils to save the ear drum then the boat is no longer on an even keel the men stand and slip about on the sides of things they clamber up the floor out of the way of the slowly rising water for the water does not come rushing in to drown them speedily it cannot do that because there is no escape for the air the water creeps in steadily and stealthily as the u boat goes deeper and deeper it is a process of slow and crushing submergence that has the cruel deliberation of some story by edgar allan poe it may last for hours a time comes when the lights go out and the rising waters stop the apparatus for keeping up the supply of oxygen and absorbing the carbonic acid suffocation begins think of what must happen in the minds of the doomed men crowded together amidst the machinery in the particular case these prisoners described several of the men drowned themselves deliberately in the rising waters inside the boat and in another case where the boat was recovered full of dead men they had all put their heads under the water inside the boat people say the u boat men carry poison against such mischances as this they dont it would be too tempting when it becomes evident that the u boat can never recover the surface there is usually an attempt to escape by the hatches the hatches can be opened when at last the pressure inside is equal to that of the water without the water of course rushes in and sinks the u boat to the bottom like a stone but the men who are nearest to the hatch have a chance of escaping with the rush of air to the surface there is of course a violent struggle to get nearest to the hatch this is what happened in the case of the particular u boat from which these prisoners came the forward hatch was opened our patrol boat cruising above saw the waters thrown up by the air burst and then the heads of the men struggling on the surface most of these men were screaming with pain all of them went under before they could be picked up except two and these two died in a day or so they died because coming suddenly up to the ordinary atmosphere out of the compressed air of the sinking submarine had burst the tissues of their lungs they were choked with blood think of those poor creatures dying in the hospital they were worn out by fits of coughing and hmorrhage but there must have been moments of exhausted quiet before the end when our youngster lay and stared at the bleak walls of the ward and thought when he asked himself what have i been doing what have i done what has this world done for me it has made me a murderer it has tortured me and wasted me and i meant well by it whether he thought at all about the making of the submarine the numberless ingenuities and devices the patience and devotion that had gone to make that grim trap in which he had been caught at last i cannot guess probably he took it as a matter of course so it was that our german youngster who dreamt dreams who had ambitions who wished to serve and do brave and honourable things died so five thousand men at least have died english some of them as well as german in lost submarines beneath the waters of the narrow seas there is a story and a true story it is more striking than the fate of most men and women in the world but is it in its essence different is not the whole life of our time in the vein of this story is not this story of youth and hope and possibility misled marched step by step into a world misconceived thrust into evil and driven down to ugliness and death only a more vivid rendering of what is now the common fate of great multitudes is there any one of us who is not in some fashion aboard a submarine doing evil and driving towards an evil end what are the businesses in which men engage how many of them have any likeness to freighted ships that serve the good of mankind think of the lying and cornering the crowding and outbidding the professional etiquette that robs the common man the unfair advantage smugly accepted what man among us can say all that i do is service our holding and our effort is it much better than the long interludes below the surface and when we come up to struggle for our own hands torpedoing competitors wrecking antagonists how is it with us the submarine sailors stare in the twilight at drowning men every day i stare at a world drowning in poverty and ignorance a world awash in the seas of hunger disease and misery we have been given leisure freedom and intelligence what have we done to prevent these things i tell you all the world is a submarine and every one of us is something of a u boat man these fools who squeal in the papers for cruelties to the u boat men do not realize their own part in the world we might live in sunshine and freedom and security and we live cramped and cold in bitter danger because we are at war with our fellow men but there doctor you have the answer to the first part of your question you asked what the spirit of god in man was against it is against these mental confusions these ignorances that thrust life into a frightful cul de sac that the god in our hearts urges us to fight he is crying out in our hearts to save us from these blind alleys of selfishness darkness cruelty and pain in which our race must die he is crying for the high road which is salvation he is commanding the organized unity of mankind the lassitude that had been earlier apparent in the manner of mr huss had vanished he was talking now with more energy his eyes were bright and there was a flush in his cheeks his voice was low but his speech was clear and no longer broken by painful pauses but your question had a double edge he continued you asked me not only what it is that the spirit of god in us fights against but what it is he fights for whither does the high road lead i have told you what i think the life of man is a felted and corrupting mass of tragic experiences let me tell you now a little if this pain at my side will still permit it what life upon this earth under the leadership of the spirit of god our captain might be i will take it that men are still as they are that all this world is individually the same i will suppose no miraculous change in human nature but i will suppose that events in the past have run along different channels so that there has been much more thinking much more exchange of thought far better teaching i want simply this world better taught so that wherever the flame of god can be lit it has been lit everyone i will suppose educated by educated to be explicit i mean a knowledge and understanding of history yes mr farrsalvation by history everyone about the earth i will suppose has been taught not merely to read and write and calculate but has been given all that can be told simply and plainly of the past history of the earth of our place in space and time and the true history of mankind i will not suppose that there is any greater knowledge of things than men actually possess to day but instead of its being confusedly stored in many minds and many books and many languages it has all been sorted out and set out plainly so that it can be easily used it has been kept back from no one mistold to no one moreover i will suppose that instead of a myriad of tongues and dialects all men can read the same books and talk together in the same speech these you may say are difficult suppositions but they are not impossible suppositions quite a few resolute men could set mankind definitely towards such a state of affairs so that they would reach it in a dozen generations or so but think what a difference there would be from our conditions in such a world in a world so lit and opened by education most of these violent dissensions that trouble mankind would be impossible instead of men and communities behaving like fever patients in delirium striking at their nurses oversetting their food and medicine and inflicting injuries on themselves and one another they would be alive to the facts of their common origin their common offspringfor at last in our descendants all our lives must meet againand their common destiny in that more open and fresher air the fire that is god will burn more brightly for most of us who fail to know god fail through want of knowledge many more men and women will be happily devoted to the common work of mankind and the evil that is in all of us will be more plainly seen and more easily restrained i doubt if any man is altogether evil but in this dark world the good in men is handicapped and sacrifice is mocked bad example finishes what weak and aimless teaching has begun this is a world where folly and hate can bawl sanity out of hearing only the determination of schoolmasters and teachers can hope to change that how can you hope to change it by anything but teaching cannot you realize what teaching means when i ask you to suppose a world instructed and educated in the place of this old traditional world of unguided passion and greed and meanness and mean bestiality a world taught by men instead of a world neglected by hirelings i do not ask you to imagine any miraculous change in human nature i ask you only to suppose that each mind has the utmost enlightenment of which it is capable instead of its being darkened and overcast everyone is to have the best chance of being his best self everyone is to be living in the light of the acutest self examination and the clearest mutual criticism naturally we shall be living under infinitely saner and more helpful institutions such a state of things will not indeed mitigate natural vanity or natural self love it will not rob the greedy man of his greed the fool of his folly the eccentric of his abnormality nor the lustful of his lust but it will rob them of excuses and hiding places it will light them within and cast a light round about them it will turn their evil to the likeness of a disease of which they themselves in their clear moments will be ready to be cured and which they will hesitate to transmit that is the world which such of us schoolmasters and teachers among us as have the undying fire of god already lit in our hearts do now labour generation by generation against defeat and sometimes against hope to bring about that is the present work god has for us and as we do bring it about then the prospect opens out before mankind to a splendour in this present world men live to be themselves having their lives they lose them in the world that we are seeking to make they will give themselves to the god of mankind and so they will live indeed they will as a matter of course change their institutions and their methods so that all men may be used to the best effect in the common work of mankind they will take this little planet which has been torn into shreds of possession and make it again one garden the most perplexing thing about men at the present time is their lack of understanding of the vast possibilities of power and happiness that science is offering them then why not teach science cried mr farr provided only that they will unite their efforts they solve the problems of material science in vain until they have solved their social and political problems when those are solved the mechanical and technical difficulties are trivial it is no occult secret it is a plain and demonstrable thing to day that the world could give ample food and ample leisure to every human being if only by a world wide teaching the spirit of unity could be made to prevail over the impulse to dissension and not only that but it would then be possible to raise the common health and increase the common fund of happiness immeasurably look plainly at the world as it is most human beings when they are not dying untimely are suffering more or less from avoidable disorders they are ill or they are convalescent or they are suffering from or crippled by some preventable taint in the blood or they are stunted or weakened by a needlessly bad food supply or spiritless and feeble through bad housing bad clothing dull occupations or insecurity and anxiety few enjoy for very long stretches at a time that elementary happiness which is the natural accompaniment of sound health this almost universal lowness of tone which does not distress us only because most of us are unable to imagine anything better means an enormous waste of human possibility less work less hopefulness isolated efforts will never raise men out of this swamp of malaise at woldingstanton we have had the best hygienic arrangements we could find we have taken the utmost precautions and yet there has scarcely been a year when our work has not been crippled and delayed by some epidemic influenza one year measles another and so on we take our precautions but the townspeople especially in the poorer quarters dont and cant i think myself the wastage of these perennial petty pestilences is far greater than that caused by the big epidemics that sometimes sweep the world but all such things great or petty given a sufficient world unanimity could be absolutely banished from human life given a sufficient unanimity and intelligent direction men could hunt down all these infectious diseases one by one to the regions in which they are endemic and from which they start out again and again to distress the world and could stamp them out for ever it is not want of knowledge prevents this now but want of a properly designed education which would give people throughout the world the understanding the confidence and the will needed for so collective an enterprise the sufferings and mutual cruelties of animals are no doubt a part of the hard aimlessness of nature but men are in a position to substitute aim for that aimlessness they have already all the knowledge and all the resources needed to escape from these cul de sacs of wrong doing and suffering and ugly futility into which they jostle one another but they do not do it because they have not been sufficiently educated and are not being sufficiently educated to sane understanding and effort the bulk of their collective strength is dissipated in miserable squabbles and suspicions in war and the preparation for war in lawsuits and bickering in making little sterile private hoards of wealth and power in chaffering in stupid persecutions and oppositions and vanities it is not only that they live in a state of general infection and ill health and bad temper ill nourished ill housed and morally horrible when the light is ready to shine upon them and health and splendour is within their grasp but that all that they could so attain would be but the prelude to still greater attainments apart from and above the sweeping away of the poverty filthiness and misery of life that would follow on an intelligent use of such powers and such qualities as men possess now there would be a tremendous increase in happiness due to the contentment of belonging to one common comprehensible whole of knowing that one played a part and a worthy part in an immortal and universal task the merest handful of people can look with content upon the tenor of their lives to day a few teachers are perhaps aware that they serve god rightly a few scientific investigators a few doctors and bridge builders and makers of machinery a few food growers and sailors and the like they can believe that they do something that is necessary or build something which will endure but most men and women to day are like beasts caught in a tunnel they follow base occupations they trade and pander and dispute there is no peace in their hearts they gratify their lusts and seek excitements they know they spend their lives in vain and they have no means of escape the world is full of querulousness and abuse derision and spite mean tricks and floundering effort vice without a gleam of pleasure and vain display because blind nature spews these people into being and there is no light to guide their steps yet there is work to be done by everyone a plain reason for that work and happiness in the doing of it i do not know if any of us realize all that a systematic organization of the human intelligence upon the work of research would mean for our race people talk of the wonders that scientific work has given us in the past two hundred years wonders of which for the most part we are too disordered and foolish to avail ourselves fully but what scientific research has produced so far must be as yet only the smallest earnest of what scientific research can presently give mankind all the knowledge that makes to day different from the world of queen elizabeth has been the work of a few score thousand men mostly poorish men working with limited material and restricted time in a world that discouraged and misunderstood them many hundreds of thousands of men with gifts that would have been of the profoundest value in scientific work have missed the education or the opportunity to use those gifts but in a world clarified by understanding the net of research would miss few of its born servants there would be the swiftest clearest communication of results from worker to worker the readiest honour and help for every gift poor science which goes about now amidst our crimes and confusions like an ill trimmed evil smelling oil lantern in a dark cavern in which men fight and steal her flickering light snatched first by this man and then by that as often as not a help to violence and robbery would become like the sunrise of a bright summer morning we do not realize what in a little while mankind could do our power over matter our power over life our power over ourselves would increase year by year and day by day here am i after great suffering waiting here for an uncertain operation that may kill me it need not have been so here are we all sitting hot and uncomfortable in this ill ventilated ill furnished room looking out upon a vile waste it need not have been so such is the quality of our days i sit here wrung by pain in the antechamber of death because mankind has suffered me to suffer all this could have been avoided not for ever will such things endure not for ever will the mocker of mankind prevail and such knowledge and power and beauty as we poor watchers before the dawn can guess at are but the beginning of all that could arise out of these shadows and this torment not for ever shall life be marooned upon this planet imprisoned by the cold and incredible emptiness of space is it not plain to you all from what man in spite of everything has achieved that he is but at the beginning of achievement that presently he will take his body and his life and mould them to his will that he will take gladness and beauty for himself as a girl will pick a flower and twine it in her hair you have said doctor barrack that when industrial competition ends among men all change in the race will be at an end but you said that unthinkingly for when a collective will grows plain there will be no blind thrusting into life and no blind battle to keep in life like the battle of a crowd crushed into a cul de sac any more the qualities that serve the great ends of the race will be cherished and increased the sorts of men and women that have these qualities least will be made to understand the necessary restraints of their limitation you said that when men ceased to compete they would stand still rather is it true that when men cease their internecine war then and then alone can the race sweep forward the race will grow in power and beauty swiftly in every generation it will grow and not only the human race all this world will man make a garden for himself ruling not only his kind but all the lives that live banishing the cruel from life making the others merciful and tame beneath his hand the flies and mosquitoes the thorns and poisons the fungus in the blood and the murrain upon his beasts he will utterly end he will rob the atoms of their energy and the depths of space of their secrets he will break his prison in space he will step from star to star as now we step from stone to stone across a stream until he stands in the light of gods presence and looks his mocker and the adversary in the face oh ravins mr dad burst out unable to contain himself you may think my mind is fevered because my body is in pain but never was my mind clearer than it is now it is as if i stood already half out of this little life that has held me so long it is not a dream i tell but a reality the world is for man the stars in their courses are for manif only he will follow the god who calls to him and take the gift god offers as i sit here and talk of these things to you here they become so plain to me that i cannot understand your silence and why you do not burnas i burnwith the fire of gods purpose he stopped short he seemed to have come to the end of his strength his chin sank and his voice when he spoke again was the voice of a weak and weary man i talk i talk and then a desolating sense of reality blows like a destroying gust through my mind and my little lamp of hope goes out it is as if some great adversary sat over all my world mocking me in every phrase i use and every act i do he sighed deeply have i answered your questions doctor he asked you speak of god said dr barrack but this that you speak of as god is it really what men understand by god it seems to me as i said to begin with it is just a personification of the good will in us all why bring in god god is a word that has become associated with all sorts of black and cruel things it sets one thinking of priesthoods orthodoxies persecutions why do you not call this upward and onward power humanity why do you not call it the spirit of men then it might be possible for an agnostic like myself to feel a sort of agreement because i have already shown you it is not humanity it is not the spirit of men humanity the spirit of men made poison gas and the submarine the spirit of man is jealous aggressive and partizan humanity has greed and competition in grain and the spirit of man is fear and hatred secrecy and conspiracy quite as much as much more than it is making or order but this spirit in me this fire which i call god was lit i know not how but as if it came from outside i use the phrases said mr huss that come ready to the mind but i will meet you so far as to say that i know that i am metaphorical and inexact this spirit that comes into lifeit is more like a person than a thing and so i call it he and he is not a feature not an aspect of things but a selection among things he seizes upon and brings out and confirms all that is generous in the natural impulses of the mind he condemns cruelty and all evil i will not pretend to explain what i cannot explain it may be that god is as yet only foreshadowed in life you may reason doctor barrack that this fire in the heart that i call god is as much the outcome of your process as all the other things in life i cannot argue against that what i am telling you now is not what i believe so much as what i feel to me it seems that the creative desire that burns in me is a thing different in its nature from the blind process of matter is a force running contrariwise to the power of confusion but this i do know that once it is lit in a man it is like a consuming fire once it is lit in a man then his mind is alightthenceforth it rules his conscience with compelling power it summons him to live the residue of his days working and fighting for the unity and release and triumph of mankind he may be mean still and cowardly and vile still but he will know himself for what he is some ancient phrases live marvellously within my heart i know that my redeemer liveth he stopped abruptly dr barrack was unprepared with a reply but he shook his head obstinately these time worn phrases were hateful to his soul they smacked to him of hypocrisy of a bidding for favour with obsolete and discredited influences through such leaks it is superstition comes soaking back into the laboriously bailed out minds of men yet mr huss was a difficult controversialist to grapple no said the doctor provisionally no fate came to the relief of dr barrack the little conference at sea view was pervaded by the sense of a new personality this was a short and angry and heated little man with active dark brown eyes in a tan face a tooth brush moustache of iron grey and a protruded lower jaw he was dressed in a bright bluish grey suit and bright brown boots and he carried a bright brown leather bag he appeared mouthing outside the window beyond the range of distinct hearing his expression was blasphemous he made threatening movements with his bag good god cried dr barrack sir alpheus i had no idea of the time he rushed out of the room and there was a scuffle in the passage i ought to have been met said sir alpheus entering i ought to have been met its ridiculous to pretend you didnt know the time a general practitioner always knows the time it is his first duty i cannot understand the incivility of this reception i have had to make my way to your surgery dr barrack without assistance not a cab free at the station i have had to come down this road in the heat carrying everything myself reading all the names on the gatesthe most ridiculous and banal names the taj thyme bank the cedars and capernaum cheek by jowl its worse than freud dr barrack expressed further regrets confusedly and indistinctly we have been talking sir alpheus said sir eliphaz advancing as if to protect the doctor from his specialist upon some very absorbing topics that must be our excuse for this neglect we have been discussing educationand the universe fate free will predestination absolute it is not every building contractor can quote milton the great surgeon regarded the patentee of temanite fatefiddlesticks said sir alpheus suddenly and rudely thats no excuse for not meeting me his bright little eyes darted round the company and recognized mr huss what my patient not in bed not even in bed go to bed sir go to bed he became extremely abusive to dr barrack you treat an operation sir with a levity chapter the sixth the operation while sir alpheus grumbled loudly at the unpreparedness of everything mr huss with the assistance of dr barrack walked upstairs and disrobed himself this long discussion had taken a very powerful grip upon his mind much remained uncertain in his thoughts he had still a number of things he wanted to say and these proceedings preliminary to his vivisection seemed to him to be irrelevant and tiresome rites interrupting something far more important the bed the instruments the preparation for ansthesia were to him no more than new contributions to the argument while he lay on the bed with dr barrack handling the funnel hood that was to go over nose and mouth for the administration of the chloroform he tried to point out that the very idea of operative surgery was opposed to the scientific fatalism of that gentleman but sir alpheus interrupted him breathe deeply said dr barrack breathe deeply the whole vast argumentative fabric that had arisen in his mind swung with him across an abyss of dread and mental inanity whether he thought or dreamt what follows it is impossible to say we can but record the ideas that like a crystalline bubble as great as all things filled his consciousness he felt a characteristic doubt whether the chloroform would do its duty and then came that twang like the breaking of a violin stringploot and still he did not seem to be insensible he was not insensible and yet things had changed dr elihu was still present but somehow sir eliphaz and mr dad and mr farr whom he had left downstairs had come back and were sitting on the groundon the ashes they were all seated gravely on a mound of ashes and beneath a sky that blazed with light sir alpheus the nurse the bedroom had vanished it seemed that they had been the dream but this was the reality an enduring reality this sackcloth and these reeking ash heaps outside the city gates this was the scene of an unending experiment and an immortal argument he was job the same job who had sat here for thousands of years and this lean vulturous old man in the vast green turban was eliphaz the temanite the smaller man who peered out of the cowl of a kind of hooded shawl was his friend bildad the shuhite the eager coarse face of the man in unclean linen was zophar the naamathite and this fist faced younger man who sat with an air of false humility insolently judging them all was elihu the son of barachel the buzite of the kindred of ram it was queer that there should have ever been the fancy that these men were doctors or schoolmasters or munition makers a queer veiling of their immortal quality in the transitory garments of a period for ages they had sat here and disputed and for ages they had still to sit a little way off waited the asses and camels and slaves of the three emirs and the two ethiopian slaves of eliphaz had been coming towards them bearing bowls of fine grey ashes for eliphaz for sanitary reasons did not use the common ashes of the midden upon his head there far away splashed green with palms and pierced between pylons by a glittering arm of the river were the low brown walls of sun dried brick the flat roofed houses and the twisted temple towers of the ancient city of uz where first this great argument had begun east and west and north and south stretched the wide levels of the world dotted with small date trees and above them was the measureless dome of heaven set with suns and stars and flooded with a light this light had shone out since elihu had spoken and it was not only a light but a voice clear and luminous before which jobs very soul bowed and was still who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge by a great effort job lifted up his eyes to the zenith it was as if one shone there who was all and yet who comprehended powers and kingdoms and it was as if a screen or shadow was before his face it was as if a dark figure enhaloed in shapes and colours bent down over the whole world and regarded it curiously and malevolently and it was as if this dark figure was no more than a translucent veil before an infinite and lasting radiance was it a veil before the light or did it not rather nest in the very heart of the light and spread itself out before the face of the light and spread itself and recede and again expand in a perpetual diastole and systole it was as if the voice that spoke was the voice of god and yet ever and again it was as if the timbre of the voice was satan as the voice spoke to job his friends listened and watched him and the eyes of elihu shone like garnets and the eyes of eliphaz like emeralds but the eyes of bildad were black like the eyes of a lizard upon a wall and zophar had no eyes but looked at him only with the dark shadows beneath his knitted brows as god spake they all and job with them became smaller and smaller and shrank until they were the minutest of conceivable things until the whole scene was a little toy they became unreal like discolourations upon a floating falling disc of paper confetti amidst greatnesses unfathomable who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge but in this dream that was dreamt by mr huss while he was under the ansthetic god did not speak by words but by light there were no sounds in his ears but thoughts ran like swift rivulets of fire through his brain and gathered into pools and made a throbbing pattern of wavelets curve within curve that interlaced the thoughts that it seemed to him that god was speaking through his mind can be put into words only after a certain fashion and with great loss for they were thoughts about things beyond and above this world and our words are all made out of the names of things and feelings in this world things that were contradictory had become compatible and things incomprehensible seemed straightforward because he was in a dream it was as if the ansthetic had released his ideas from their anchorage to words and phrases and their gravitation towards sensible realities but it was still the same line of thought he pursued through the stars and spaces that he had pursued in the stuffy little room at sundering on sea it was somewhat after this fashion that things ran through the mind of mr huss it seemed to him at first that he was answering the challenge of the voice that filled the world not of his own will but mechanically he was saying they give me knowledge to which the answer was in the voice of satan and in tones of mockery for satan had become very close and definite to job as a dark face time worn and yet animated that sent out circle after circle of glowing colour towards the bounds of space as a swimmer sends waves towards the bank but what have you got in the way of a vessel to hold your knowledge if we gave it you in the name of the god in my heart said job i demand knowledge and power who are you a pedagogue who gives ill prepared lessons about history in frowsty rooms and dreams that he has been training his young gentlemen to play leap frog amidst the stars i am man said job huss but that queer power of slipping ones identity and losing oneself altogether which dreams will give had come upon mr huss he answered with absolute conviction i am man down there i was huss but here i am man i am every man who has ever looked up towards this light of god i am every one who has thought or worked or willed for the race i am all the explorers and leaders and teachers that man has ever had the argument evaporated he carried his point as such points are carried in dreams the discussion slipped to another of the issues that had been troubling him you would plumb the deep of knowledge you would scale the heights of space there is no limit to either then i will plumb and scale for ever i will defeat you but you will never destroy me i will fight my way through you to god and never attain him it seemed as though yet another voice was speaking for a while the veil of satan was drawn aside the thoughts it uttered ran like incandescent molten metal through the mind of job but whether he was saying these things to god or whether god was saying these things to him did not in any way appear so life goes on for ever and in no other way could it go on in no other way could there be such a being as life for how can you struggle if there is a certainty of victory why should you struggle if the end is assured how can you rise if there is no depths into which you can fall the blacknesses and the evils about you are the warrants of reality through the centuries the voice of job had complained and will complain through the centuries the fire of his faith flares and flickers and threatens to go out but is job justified in his complaints is job indeed justified in his complaints his mind has been coloured by the colour of misfortune he has seen all the world reflecting the sufferings of his body he has dwelt upon illness and cruelty and death but is there any evil or cruelty or suffering that is beyond the possibility of human control were that so then indeed he might complain that god has mocked him are sunsets ugly and oppressive do mountains disgust do distant hills repel is there any flaw in the starry sky if the lives of beasts and men are dark and ungracious yet is not the texture of their bodies lovely beyond comparison you have sneered because the beauty of cell and tissue may build up an idiot why oh man do they build up an idiot have you no will have you no understanding that you suffer such things to be the darkness and ungraciousness the evil and the cruelty are no more than a challenge to you in you lies the power to rule all these things through the tumbled clouds of his mind broke the sunlight of this phrase the power to rule all these things the power to rule you have dwelt overmuch upon pain pain is a swift distress it ends and is forgotten without memory and fear pain is nothing a contradiction to be heeded a warning to be taken without pain what would life become pain is the master only of craven men it is in mans power to rule it it is in mans power to rule all things it was as if the dreaming patient debated these ideas with himself and again it was as if he were the universal all and job and satan and god disputed together within him the thoughts in his mind raced faster and suddenly grew bright and glittering as the waters grow bright when they come racing out of the caves at han into the light of day green faced he murmured and stirred in his great debate while the busy specialist plied his scalpels and dr barrack whispered directions to the intent nurse another whiff said doctor barrack a cloud rolls back from my soul i have been through great darkness i have been through deep waters has not your life had laughter in it has the freshness of the summer morning never poured joy through your being do you know nothing of the embrace of the lover cheek to cheek or lip to lip have you never swum out into the sunlit sea or shouted on a mountain slope is there no joy in a handclasp your son your son you say is dead with honour is there no joy in that honour clean and straight was your son and beautiful in his life is that nothing to thank god for have you never played with happy children has no boy ever answered to your teachinggiving back more than you gave him dare you deny the joy of your appetites the first mouthful of roast red beef on the frosty day and the deep draught of good ale do you know nothing of the task well done nor of sleep after a day of toil is there no joy for the farmer in the red ploughed fields and the fields shooting with green blades when the great prows smite the waves and the aeroplane hums in the sky is man still a hopeless creature can you watch the beat and swing of machinery and still despair your illness has coloured the world a little season of misfortune has hidden the light from your eyes it was as if the dreamer pushed his way through the outskirts of a great forest and approached the open but it was not through trees that he thrust his way but through bars and nets and interlacing curves of blinding many coloured light towards the clear promise beyond he had grown now to an incredible vastness so that it was no longer earth upon which he set his feet but that crystalline pavement whose translucent depths contain the stars yet though he approached the open he never reached the open the iridescent net that had seemed to grow thin grew dense again he was still struggling and the black doubts that had lifted for a moment swept down upon his soul again and he realized he was in a dream a dream that was drawing swiftly now to its close oh god he cried answer me for satan has mocked me sorely answer me before i lose sight of you again am i right to fight am i right to come out of my little earth here above the stars right if you dare shall i conquer and prevail give me your promise everlastingly you may conquer and find fresh worlds to conquer maybut shall i it was as if the torrent of molten thoughts stopped suddenly it was as if everything stopped answer me he cried slowly the shining thoughts moved on again so long as your courage endures you will conquer if you have courage although the night be dark although the present battle be bloody and cruel and end in a strange and evil fashion nevertheless victory shall be yoursin a way you will understandwhen victory comes only have courage on the courage in your heart all things depend by courage it is that the stars continue in their courses day by day it is the courage of life alone that keeps sky and earth apart if that courage fail if that sacred fire go out then all things fail and all things go out all thingsgood and evil space and time leaving nothing nothing nothing he echoed and the word spread like a dark and darkening mask across the face of all things and then as if to mark the meaning of the word it seemed to him that the whole universe began to move inward upon itself faster and faster until at last with an incredible haste it rushed together he resisted this collapse in vain and with a sense of overwhelmed effort the white light of god and the whirling colours of the universe the spaces between the starsit was as if an unseen fist gripped them together they rushed to one point as water in a clepsydra rushes to its hole the whole universe became small became a little thing diminished to the size of a coin of a spot of a pinpoint of one intense black mathematical point andvanished he heard his own voice crying in the void like a little thing blown before the wind but will my courage endure the question went unanswered not only the things of space but the things of time swept together into nothingness the last moment of his dream rushed towards the first crumpled all the intervening moments together and made them one it seemed to mr huss that he was still in the instant of insensibility that sound of the breaking string was still in his earsploot it became part of that same sound which came before the vision he was aware of a new pain within him not that dull aching now but a pain keen and sore he gave a fluttering gasp quick said a voice he is coming to hell not wake for hours said a second voice his mouth and eyes he lifted his eyelids as one lifts lead he found himself looking into the intelligent but unsympathetic face of sir alpheus mengo he tried to comprehend his situation but he had forgotten how he got to it he closed his eyes and sank back consciously and wilfully towards insensibility chapter the seventh letters and a telegram it was three weeks later never had there been so successful an operation as an operation in the experience of either sir alpheus mengo or dr barrack the growth that had been removed was a non malignant growth the diagnosis of cancer had been unsound mr huss was still lying flat in his bed in mrs croomes house but he was already able to read books letters and newspapers and take an interest in affairs the removal of his morbid growth had made a very great change in his mental atmosphere he no longer had the same sense of an invisible hostile power brooding over all his life his natural courage had returned and the world which had seemed a conspiracy of misfortunes was now a hopeful world again the last great offensive of the germans towards paris had collapsed disastrously under the counter attacks of marshal foch each mornings paper told of fresh victories for the allies and the dark shadow of a german csarism fell no longer across the future the imaginations of men were passing through a phase of reasonableness and generosity the idea of an organized world peace had seized upon a multitude of minds there was now a prospect of a new and better age such as would have seemed incredible in the weeks when the illness of mr huss began to bear him down and it was not simply a general relief that had come to his forebodings his financial position for example which had been wrecked by one accident had been restored by another a distant cousin of mr huss to whom however mr huss was the nearest relative had died of softening of the brain after a career of almost imbecile speculation he had left his property partly to mr huss and partly to woldingstanton school for some years before the war he had indulged in the wildest buying of depreciated copper shares and had accumulated piles of what had seemed at the time valueless paper the war had changed all that instead of being almost insolvent the deceased in spite of heavy losses on canadian land deals was found by his executors to be worth nearly thirty thousand pounds it is easy to underrate the good in money the windfall meant a hundred needed comforts and freedoms and a release for the mind of mrs huss that nothing else could have given her and the mind of mr huss reflected the moods of his wife much more than he suspected but still better things seemed to be afoot in the world of mr huss the rest of the governors of woldingstanton it became apparent were not in agreement with sir eliphaz and mr dad upon the project of replacing mr huss by mr farr and a number of the old boys of the school at the front getting wind of what was going on had formed a small committee for the express purpose of defending their old master at the head of this committee by a happy chance was young kenneth burrows the nephew and heir of sir eliphaz at the school he had never been in the front rank he had been one of those good all round boys who end as a school prefect a sound man in the first eleven and second or third in most of the subjects he took never had he played a star part or enjoyed very much of the heads confidences it was all the more delightful therefore to find him the most passionate and indefatigable champion of the order of things that mr huss had set up he had heard of the proposed changes at his uncles dinner table when on leave and he had done something forthwith to shake that gentlemans resolves lady burrows who adored him became at once pro huss she was all the readier to do this because she did not like mr dads rather emphatic table manners nor mr farrs clothes you dont know what mr huss was to us sir the young man repeated several times and returned to france with that sentence growing and flowering in his mind he was one of those good types for whom the war was a powerful developer death hardship and responsibilityhe was still not two and twenty and a major in the artilleryhad already made an understanding man out of the schoolboy he could imagine what dispossession meant his new maturity made it seem a natural thing to write to comfort his old head as one man writes to another his pencilled sheets when first they came made the enfeebled recipient cry not with misery but happiness they were reread like a love letter they were now on the coverlet and mr huss was staring at the ceiling and already planning a new woldingstanton rising from its ashes greater than the old it is only in the last few weeks the young man wrote that we have heard of all these schemes to break up the tradition of woldingstanton and now there is a talk of your resigning the headmastership in favour of mr farr personally sir i cant imagine how you can possibly dream of giving up your workand to him of all peoplei still have a sort of doubt about it but my uncle was very positive that you were disposed to resign personally he said he had implored you to stay and it is on the off chance of his being right that i am bothering you with this letter briefly it is to implore you to stand by the school which is as much as to say to stand by yourself and us youve taught hundreds of us to stick it and now you owe it to us to stick it yourself i know youre ill dreadfully ill ive heard about gilbert and i know sir we all know although he wasnt in the school and you never betrayed a preference or were led into an unfair thing through it how much you loved him youve been put through it sir to the last degree but sir there are some of us here who feel almost as though they were your sons if you dont and cant give us that sort of love it doesnt alter the fact that there are men out here who think of you as theyd like to think of their fathers men like myself particularly who were left as boys without a father im no great hand at expressing myself im no credit to mr cross and his english class generally i dont believe in saying too much but i would like to tell you something of what you have been to a lot of us and why woldingstanton going on will seem to us like a flag still flying and woldingstanton breaking its tradition like a sort of surrender and i dont want a bit to flatter you sir if youll forgive me and set you up in what i am writing to you one of the loveable things about you to us is that you have always been so jolly human to us youve always been unequal ive seen you give lessons that were among the best lessons in the world and ive seen you give some jolly bad lessons and there were some affairsthat business of the november fireworks for examplewhen we thought you were harsh and wrong i was wrong said mr huss that almost led to a mutiny but that is just where you score and why woldingstanton cant do without you when that firework row was on we called a meeting of the school and house prefects and had up some of the louts to ityou never heard of that meetingand we said we all agreed you were wrong and we all agreed that right or wrong we stood by you and wouldnt let the row go further perhaps you remember how that affair shut up all at once but that is where youve got us you do wrong you let us see through you there never was a schoolmaster or a father gave himself away so freely as you do you never put up a sham front on us and consequently every one of us knows that what he knows about you is the real thing in you the very kids in the lower fifth can get a glimpse of it and grasp that you are driving at something with all your heart and soul and that the school goes somewhere and has life in it we woldingstanton boys have that in common when we meet we understand one another we have something that a lot of the other chaps one meets out here even from the crack schools dont seem to have it isnt a flourish with us sir it is a simple statement of fact that the life we joined up to at woldingstanton is more important to us than the life in our bodies just as it is more important to you it isnt only the way you taught it though you taught it splendidly it is the way you felt it that got hold of us you made us think and feel that the past of the world was our own history you made us feel that we were in one living story with the reindeer men and the egyptian priests with the soldiers of csar and the alchemists of spain nothing was dead and nothing alien you made discovery and civilization our adventure and the whole future our inheritance most of the men i meet here feel lost in this war they are like rabbits washed out of their burrows by a flood but we of woldingstanton have taken it in the days work and when the peace comes and the new world begins it will still be in the story for us the days work will still join on thats the essence of woldingstanton that it puts you on the high road that goes on the other chaps i talk to here from other schools seem to be on no road at all they are tough and plucky by nature and association they are fighters and sturdy men but what holds them in it is either just habit and the example of people about them or something unsound that cant hold out to the end a vague loyalty to the empire or a desire to punish the hun or restore the peace of europe some short range view of that sort motives that will leave them stranded at the end of the war anyhow with nothing to go on to to talk of after the war to them is to realize what blind alleys their teachers have led them into they can understand fighting against things but not for things beyond an impossible ambition to go back somewhere and settle down as they used to be theres not the ghost of an idea to them at all the whole value of woldingstanton is that it steers a man through and among the blind alleys and sets him on a way out that he can follow for all the rest of his days it makes him a player in a limitless team and one with the creator we are all coming back to take up our jobs in that spirit jobs that will all join up at last in making a real world state a world civilization and a new order of things and unless we can think of you sir away at woldingstanton working away to make more of us ready to pick up the sons we shall send you presently mr huss stopped reading he lay thinking idly i was talking about blind alleys the other day queer that he should have hit on the same phrase some old sermon of mine perhaps no doubt ive had the thought before i suppose that one could define education as the lifting of minds out of blind alleys a permissible definition anyhow i wish i could remember that talk better i said a lot of things about submarines i said something about the whole world really being like the crew of a submarine its trueuniversally everyone is in a blind alley until we pierce a road that was a queer talk we had i remember i wouldnt go to beda kind of fever in the mind then there was a dream i wish i could remember more of that dream it was as if i could see round some metaphysical corner i seemed to be in a great placetalking to god but how could one have talked to god no it is gone his thought reverted to the letter of young burrows he began to scheme out the reinstatement of woldingstanton he had an idea of rebuilding school house with a map corridor to join it to the picture gallery and the concert hall which were both happily still standing he wanted the maps on one side to show the growth and succession of empires in the western world and on the other to present the range of geographical knowledge and thought at different periods in mans history as with many great headmasters his idle daydreams were often architectural he took out another of his dream toys now and played with it this dream was that he could organize a series of ethnological exhibits showing various groups of primitive peoples in a triple order first little models of them in their savage state then displays of their arts and manufactures to show their distinctive gifts and aptitudes and then suggestions of the part such a people might play as artists or guides or beast tamers or the like in a wholly civilized world such a collection would be far beyond the vastest possibilities to which woldingstanton would ever attainbut he loved the dream the groups would stand in well lit bays side chapels so to speak in his museum building there would be a group of seats and a blackboard for it was one of his fantasies to have a school so great that the classes would move about it like little groups of pilgrims in a cathedral from that he drifted to a scheme for grouping great schools for such common purposes as the educational development of the cinematograph a central reference library and the like for one great school leads to another schools are living things and like all living things they must grow and reproduce their kind and go on from conquest to conquestor fall under the sway of the farrs and dads and stagnate become diseased and malignant and perish but woldingstanton was not to perish it was to spread it was to call to its kind across the atlantic and throughout the world it was to give and receive ideas interbreed and develop across the blue october sky the white clouds drifted and the air was full of the hum of a passing aeroplane the chained dog that had once tortured the sick nerves of mr huss now barked unheeded i would like to give one of the chapels of the races to the memory of gilbert whispered mr huss the door at the foot of his bed opened and mrs huss appeared she had an effect of appearing suddenly and yet she moved slowly into the room clutching a crumpled bit of paper in her hand her face had undergone some extraordinary change it was dead white and her eyes were wide open and very bright she stood stiffly she might have been about to fall she did not attempt to close the door behind her mrs croome became audible rattling her pans downstairs when mrs huss spoke it was in an almost noiseless whisper job he had a strange idea that mrs croome must have given them notice to quit instantly or perpetrated some such brutality a suspicion which his wifes gesture seemed to confirm she was shaking the crumpled scrap of paper in an absurd manner he frowned in a gust of impatience i didnt open it she said at last not till i had eaten some breakfast i didnt dare i saw it was from the bank and i thought it might be about the overdraft all the while she was weeping all the while i was eating my egg oh what is it she grimaced from him he stared a cheque jobcome throughfrom him from our boy his mouth fell open he drew a deep breath his tears came he raised himself and was reminded of his bandaged state and dropped back again he held out his lean hand to her hes a prisoner he gasped alive she nodded she seemed about to fling herself violently upon his poor crumpled body her arms waved about seeking for something to embrace then she flopped down in the narrow space between bed and paper adorned fireplace and gathered the counterpane together into a lump with her clutching hands oh my baby boy she wept my baby boy and i was so wicked about the mourning i was so wicked mr huss lay stiff as the doctor had ordered him to do but the hand he stretched down could just touch and caress her hair printed in the united states of america the following pages contain advertisements of macmillan books
