the three cutters by captain marryat captain frederick marryat was born july and died august he retired from the british navy in in order to devote himself to writing in the following years he wrote books many of which are among the very best of english literature and some of which are still in print marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories he says somewhere that when he sat down for the days work he never knew what he was going to write he certainly was a literary genius the three cutters was published in the tenth book to flow from marryats pen this ebook was transcribed in by nick hodson and was reformatted in and again in the three cutters by captain frederick marryat chapter one cutter the first reader have you ever been at plymouth if you have your eye must have dwelt with ecstasy upon the beautiful property of the earl of mount edgcumbe if you have not been at plymouth the sooner that you go there the better at mount edgcumbe you will behold the finest timber in existence towering up to the summits of the hills and feathering down to the shingle on the beach and from this lovely spot you will witness one of the most splendid panoramas in the world you will seei hardly know what you will not seeyou will see ram head and cawsand bay and then you will see the breakwater and drakes island and the devils bridge below you and the town of plymouth and its fortifications and the hoe and then you will come to the devils point round which the tide runs devilish strong and then you will see the new victualling officeabout which sir james gordon used to stump all day and take a pinch of snuff from every man who carried a box which all were delighted to give and he was delighted to receive proving how much pleasure may be communicated merely by a pinch of snuff and then you will see mount wise and mutton cove the town of devonport with its magnificent dockyard and arsenals north corner and the way which leads to saltash and you will see ships building and ships in ordinary and ships repairing and ships fitting and hulks and convict ships and the guardship ships ready to sail and ships under sail besides lighters menofwars boats dockyardboats bumboats and shoreboats in short there is a great deal to see at plymouth besides the sea itself but what i particularly wish now is that you will stand at the battery of mount edgcumbe and look into barn pool below you and there you will see lying at single anchor a cutter and you may also see by her pendant and ensign that she is a yacht of all the amusements entered into by the nobility and gentry of our island there is not one so manly so exciting so patriotic or so national as yachtsailing it is peculiar to england not only for our insular position and our fine harbours but because it requires a certain degree of energy and a certain amount of income rarely to be found elsewhere it has been wisely fostered by our sovereigns who have felt that the security of the kingdom is increased by every man being more or less a sailor or connected with the nautical profession it is an amusement of the greatest importance to the country as it has much improved our shipbuilding and our shipfitting while it affords employment to our seamen and shipwrights but if i were to say all that i could say in praise of yachts i should never advance with my narrative i shall therefore drink a bumper to the health of admiral lord yarborough and the yacht club and proceed you observe that this yacht is cutterrigged and that she sits gracefully on the smooth water she is just heaving up her anchor her foresail is loose all ready to cast herin a few minutes she will be under way you see that there are ladies sitting at the taffrail and there are five haunches of venison hanging over the stern of all amusements give me yachting but we must go on board the deck you observe is of narrow deal planks as white as snow the guns are of polished brass the bitts and binnacles of mahogany she is painted with taste and all the mouldings are gilded there is nothing wanting and yet how clear and unencumbered are her decks let us go below there is the ladies cabin can anything be more tasteful or elegant is it not luxurious and although so small does not its very confined space astonish you when you view so many comforts so beautifully arranged this is the diningroom and where the gentlemen repair what can be more complete or recherche and just peep into their staterooms and bedplaces here is the stewards room and the beaufet the steward is squeezing lemons for the punch and there is the champagne in ice and by the side of the pail the longcorks are ranged up all ready now let us go forwards here are the mens berths not confined as in a manofwar no luxury starts from abaft and is not wholly lost even at the forepeak this is the kitchen is it not admirably arranged what a multum in parvo and how delightful are the fumes of the turtlesoup at sea we do meet with rough weather at times but for roughing it out give me a yacht now that i have shown you round the vessel i must introduce the parties on board you observe that florid handsome man in white trousers and blue jacket who has a telescope in one hand and is sipping a glass of brandy and water which he has just taken off the skylight that is the owner of the vessel and a member of the yacht club it is lord b he looks like a sailor and he does not much belie his looks yet i have seen him in his robes of state at the opening of the house of lords the one near to him is mr stewart a lieutenant in the navy he holds on by the rigging with one hand because having been actively employed all his life he does not know what to do with hands which have nothing in them he is a protege of lord b and is now on board as sailingmaster of the yacht that handsome wellbuilt man who is standing by the binnacle is a mr hautaine he served six years as midshipman in the navy and did not like it he then served six years in a cavalry regiment and did not like it he then married and in a much shorter probation found that he did not like that but he is very fond of yachts and other mens wives if he does not like his own and wherever he goes he is welcome that young man with an embroidered silk waistcoat and white gloves bending to talk to one of the ladies is a mr vaughan he is to be seen at almacks at crockfords and everywhere else everybody knows him and he knows everybody he is a little in debt and yachting is convenient the one who sits by the lady is a relation of lord b you see at once what he is he apes the sailor he has not shaved because sailors have no time to shave every day he has not changed his linen because sailors cannot change every day he has a cigar in his mouth which makes him half sick and annoys his company he talks of the pleasure of a rough sea which will drive all the ladies belowand then they will not perceive that he is more sick than themselves he has the misfortune to be born to a large estate and to be a fool his name is ossulton the last of the gentlemen on board whom i have to introduce is mr seagrove he is slightly made with marked features full of intelligence he has been brought up to the bar and has every qualification but application he has never had a brief nor has he a chance of one he is the fiddler of the company and he has locked up his chambers and come by invitation of his lordship to play on board of his yacht i have yet to describe the ladiesperhaps i should have commenced with themi must excuse myself upon the principle of reserving the best to the last all puppetshowmen do so and what is this but the first scene in my puppetshow we will describe them according to seniority that tall thin crosslooking lady of fortyfive is a spinster and sister to lord b she has been persuaded very much against her will to come on board but her notions of propriety would not permit her niece to embark under the protection of only her father she is frightened at everything if a rope is thrown down on the deck up she starts and cries oh if on the deck she thinks the water is rushing in below if down below and there is a noise she is convinced there is danger and if it be perfectly still she is sure there is something wrong she fidgets herself and everybody and is quite a nuisance with her pride and illhumour but she has strict notions of propriety and sacrifices herself as a martyr she is the hon miss ossulton the lady who when she smiles shows so many dimples in her pretty oval face is a young widow of the name of lascelles she married an old man to please her father and mother which was very dutiful on her part she was rewarded by finding herself a widow with a large fortune having married the first time to please her parents she intends now to marry to please herself but she is very young and is in no hurry that young lady with such a sweet expression of countenance is the hon miss cecilia ossulton she is lively witty and has no fear in her composition but she is very young yet not more than seventeenand nobody knows what she really isshe does not know herself these are the parties who meet in the cabin of the yacht the crew consist of ten fine seamen the steward and the cook there is also lord bs valet mr ossultons gentleman and the ladysmaid of miss ossulton there not being accommodation for them the other servants have been left on shore the yacht is now under way and her sails are all set she is running between drakes island and the main dinner has been announced as the reader has learnt something about the preparations i leave him to judge whether it be not very pleasant to sit down to dinner in a yacht the air has given everybody an appetite and it was not until the cloth was removed that the conversation became general mr seagrove said his lordship you very nearly lost your passage i expected you last thursday i am sorry my lord that business prevented my sooner attending to your lordships kind summons come seagrove dont be nonsensical said hautaine you told me yourself the other evening when you were talkative that you had never had a brief in your life and a very fortunate circumstance replied seagrove for if i had had a brief i should not have known what to have done with it it is not my fault i am fit for nothing but a commissioner but still i had business and very important business too i was summoned by ponsonby to go with him to tattersalls to give my opinion about a horse he wishes to purchase and then to attend him to forest wild to plead his cause with his uncle it appears then that you were retained replied lord b may i ask you whether your friend gained his cause no my lord he lost his cause but he gained a suit expound your riddle sir said cecilia ossulton the fact is that old ponsonby is very anxious that william should marry miss percival whose estates join on to forest wild now my friend william is about as fond of marriage as i am of law and thereby issue was joined but why were you to be called in inquired mrs lascelles because madam as ponsonby never buys a horse without consulting me i cannot see the analogy sir observed miss ossulton senior bridling up pardon me madam the fact is continued seagrove that as i always have to back ponsonbys horses he thought it right that in this instance i should back him he required special pleading but his uncle tried him for the capital offence and he was not allowed counsel as soon as we arrived and i had bowed myself into the room mr ponsonby bowed me out againwhich would have been infinitely more jarring to my feelings had not the door been left ajar do anything but pun seagrove interrupted hautaine well then i will take a glass of wine do so said his lordship but recollect the whole company are impatient for your story i can assure you my lord that it was equal to any scene in a comedy now be it observed that mr seagrove had a great deal of comic talent he was an excellent mimic and could alter his voice almost as he pleased it was a custom of his to act a scene as between other people and he performed it remarkably well whenever he said that anything he was going to narrate was as good as a comedy it was generally understood by those who were acquainted with him that he was to be asked so to do cecilia ossulton therefore immediately said pray act it mr seagrove upon which mr seagrovepremising that he had not only heard but also seen all that passedchanging his voice and suiting the action to the word commenced it may said he be called five thousand acres in a ringfence we shall not describe mr seagroves motions they must be inferred from his words it will then william observed mr ponsonby stopping and turning to his nephew after a rapid walk up and down the room with his hands behind him under his coat so as to allow the tails to drop their perpendicular about three inches clear of his body i may say without contradiction be the finest property in the countryfive thousand acres in a ringfence i dare say it will uncle replied william tapping his foot as he lounged in a green morocco easychair and so because you have set your fancy upon having these two estates enclosed together in a ringfence you wish that i should also be enclosed in a ringfence and a beautiful property it will be replied mr ponsonby which uncle the estate or the wife both nephew both and i expect your consent uncle i am not avaricious your present property is sufficient for me with your permission instead of doubling the property and doubling myself i will remain your sole heir and single observe william such an opportunity may not occur again for centuries we shall restore forest wild to its ancient boundaries you know it has been divided nearly two hundred years we now have a glorious golden opportunity of reuniting the two properties and when joined the estate will be exactly what it was when granted to our ancestors by henry the eighth at the period of the reformation this house must be pulled down and the monastery left standing then we shall have our own again and the property without encumbrance without encumbrance uncle you forget that there will be a wife and you forget that there will be five thousand acres in a ringfence indeed uncle you ring it too often in my ears that i should forget it but much as i should like to be the happy possessor of such a property i do not feel inclined to be the happy possessor of miss percival and the more so as i have never seen the property we will ride over it tomorrow william ride over miss percival uncle that will not be very gallant i will however one of these days ride over the property with you which as well as miss percival i have not as yet seen then i can tell you she is a very pretty property if she were not in a ringfence in good heart william that is i mean an excellent disposition valuable in matrimony and well tilledi should say well educatedby her three maiden aunts who are the patterns of propriety does any one follow the fashion in a high state of cultivation that is her mind highly cultivated and according to the last new systemwhat is it a fourcourse shift i presume replied william laughing that is dancing singing music and drawing and only seventeen capital soil promising good crops what would you have more a very pretty estate uncle if it were not the estate of matrimony i am sorry very sorry to disappoint you but i must decline taking a lease of it for life then sir allow me to hint to you that in my testament you are only a tenantatwill i consider it a duty that i owe to the family that the estate should be reunited that can only be done by one of our family marrying miss percival and as you will not i shall now write to your cousin james and if he accept my proposal shall make him my heir probably he will more fully appreciate the advantages of five thousand acres in a ringfence and mr ponsonby directed his steps towards the door stop my dear uncle cried william rising up from his easychair we do not quite understand one another it is very true that i would prefer half the property and remaining single to the two estates and the estate of marriage but at the same time i did not tell you that i would prefer beggary to a wife and five thousand acres in a ringfence i know you to be a man of your word i accept your proposal and you need not put my cousin james to the expense of postage very good william i require no more and as i know you to be a man of your word i shall consider this match as settled it was on this account only that i sent for you and now you may go back again as soon as you please i will let you know when all is ready i must be at tattersalls on monday uncle there is a horse i must have for next season pray uncle may i ask when you are likely to want me let me seethis is mayabout july i should think july uncle spare mei cannot marry in the dogdays no hang it not july well william perhaps as you must come down once or twice to see the propertymiss percival i should sayit may be too soonsuppose we put it off till october octoberi shall be down at melton pray sir may i then inquire what portion of the year is not with you dogdays why uncle next april nowi think that would do next april eleven months and a winter between suppose miss percival was to take a cold and die i should be excessively obliged to her thought william no no continued mr ponsonby there is nothing certain in this world william well then uncle suppose we arrange it for the first hard frost we have had no hard frosts lately william we may wait for years the sooner it is over the better go back to town buy your horse and then come down here my dear william to oblige your unclenever mind the dogdays well sir if i am to make a sacrifice it shall not be done by halves out of respect for you i will even marry in july without any regard to the thermometer you are a good boy william do you want a cheque i have had one today thought william and was almost at fault i shall be most thankful sirthey sell horseflesh by the ounce nowadays and you pay in pounds there william thank you sir im all obedience and ill keep my word even if there should be a comet ill go and buy the horse and then i shall be ready to take the ringfence as soon as you please yes and youll get over it cleverly ive no doubt five thousand acres william anda pretty wife have you any further commands uncle said william depositing the cheque in his pocketbook none my dear boy are you going yes sir i dine at the clarendon well then goodbye make my compliments and excuses to your friend seagrove you will come on tuesday or wednesday thus was concluded the marriage between william ponsonby and emily percival and the junction of the two estates which formed together the great desideratumfive thousand acres in a ringfence mr seagrove finished and he looked round for approbation very good indeed seagrove said his lordship you must take a glass of wine after that i would not give much for miss percivals chance of happiness observed the elder miss ossulton of two evils choose the least they say observed mr hautaine poor ponsonby could not help himself thats a very polite observation of yours mr hautainei thank you in the name of the sex replied cecilia ossulton nay miss ossulton would you like to marry a person whom you never saw most certainly not but when you mentioned the two evils mr hautaine i appeal to your honour did you not refer to marriage or beggary i must confess it miss ossulton but it is hardly fair to call on my honour to get me into a scrape i only wish that the offer had been made to me observed vaughan i should not have hesitated as ponsonby did then i beg you will not think of proposing for me said mrs lascelles laughing for mr vaughan had been excessively attentive it appears to me vaughan observed seagrove that you have slightly committed yourself by that remark vaughan who thought so too replied mrs lascelles must be aware that i was only joking fie mr vaughan cried cecilia ossulton you know it came from your heart my dear cecilia said the elder miss ossulton you forget yourself what can you possibly know about gentlemens hearts the bible says that they are deceitful and desperately wicked aunt and cannot we also quote the bible against your sex miss ossulton replied seagrove yes you could perhaps if any of you had ever read it replied miss ossulton carelessly upon my word cissy you are throwing the gauntlet down to the gentlemen observed lord b but i shall throw my warder down and not permit this combat a loutrancei perceive you drink no more wine gentlemen we will take our coffee on deck we were just about to retire my lord observed the elder miss ossulton with great asperity i have been trying to catch the eye of mrs lascelles for some time but i was looking another way i presume interrupted mrs lascelles smiling i am afraid that i am the unfortunate culprit said mr seagrove i was telling a little anecdote to mrs lascelles which of course from its being communicated in an undertone was not proper for all the company to hear replied the elder miss ossulton but if mrs lascelles is now ready continued she bridling up as she rose from her chair at all events i can hear the remainder of it on deck replied mrs lascelles the ladies rose and went into the cabin cecilia and mrs lascelles exchanging very significant smiles as they followed the precise spinster who did not choose that mrs lascelles should take the lead merely because she had once happened to have been married the gentlemen also broke up and went on deck we have a nice breeze now my lord observed mr stewart who had remained on deck and we lie right up channel so much the better replied his lordship we ought to have been anchored at cowes a week ago they will all be there before us tell mr simpson to bring me a light for my cigar said mr ossulton to one of the men mr stewart went down to his dinner the ladies and the coffee came on deck the breeze was fine the weather it was april almost warm and the yacht whose name was the arrow assisted by the tide soon left the mewstone far astern chapter two cutter the second reader have you ever been at portsmouth if you have you must have been delighted with the view from the saluting battery and if you have not you had better go there as soon as you can from the saluting battery you may look up the harbour and see much of what i have described at plymouth the scenery is different but similar arsenals and dockyards and an equal portion of our stupendous navy are to be found there and you will see gosport on the other side of the harbour and sallyport close to you besides a great many other places which from the saluting battery you cannot see and then there is southsea beach to your left before you spithead with the menofwar and the motherbank crowded with merchant vessels and there is the buoy where the royal george was wrecked and where she still lies the fish swimming in and out of her cabin windows but that is not all you can also see the isle of wightryde with its long wooden pier and cowes where the yachts lie in fact there is a great deal to be seen at portsmouth as well as at plymouth but what i wish you particularly to see just now is a vessel holding fast to the buoy just off the saluting battery she is a cutter and you may know that she belongs to the preventive service by the number of gigs and galleys which she has hoisted up all round her she looks like a vessel that was about to sail with a cargo of boats two on deck one astern one on each side of her you observe that she is painted black and all her boats are white she is not such an elegant vessel as the yacht and she is much more lumbered up she has no haunches of venison hanging over the stern but i think there is a leg of mutton and some cabbages hanging by their stalks but revenuecutters are not yachts you will find no turtle or champagne but nevertheless you will perhaps find a joint to carve at a good glass of grog and a hearty welcome let us go on board you observe the guns are iron and painted black and her bulwarks are painted red it is not a very becoming colour but then it lasts a long while and the dockyard is not very generous on the score of paintor lieutenants of the navy troubled with much spare cash she has plenty of men and fine men they are all dressed in red flannel shirts and blue trousers some of them have not taken off their canvas or tarpaulin petticoats which are very useful to them as they are in the boats night and day and in all weathers but we will at once go down into the cabin where we shall find the lieutenant who commands her a masters mate and a midshipman they have each their tumbler before them and are drinking gintoddy hot with sugar capital gin too bove proof it is from that small anker standing under the table it was one that they forgot to return to the customhouse when they made their last seizure we must introduce them the elderly personage with grizzly hair and whiskers a round pale face and a somewhat red nose being too much in the wind will make the nose red and this old officer is very often in the wind of course from the very nature of his profession is a lieutenant appleboy he has served in every class of vessel in the service and done the duty of firstlieutenant for twenty years he is now on promotionthat is to say after he has taken a certain number of tubs of gin he will be rewarded with his rank as commander it is a pity that what he takes inside of him does not count for he takes it morning noon and night he is just filling his fourteenth glass he always keeps a regular account as he never exceeds his limited number which is seventeen then he is exactly down to his bearings the masters mates name is tomkins he has served his six years three times over and has now outgrown his ambition which is fortunate for him as his chances of promotion are small he prefers a small vessel to a large one because he is not obliged to be so particular in his dressand looks for his lieutenancy whenever there shall be another charity promotion he is fond of soft bread for his teeth are all absent without leave he prefers porter to any other liquor but he can drink his glass of grog whether it be based upon rum brandy or the liquor now before him mr smith is the name of that young gentleman whose jacket is so out at the elbows he has been intending to mend it these last two months but is too lazy to go to his chest for another he has been turned out of half the ships in the service for laziness but he was born soand therefore it is not his fault a revenuecutter suits him she is half her time hove to and he has no objection to boatservice as he sits down always in the sternsheets which is not fatiguing creeping for tubs is his delight as he gets over so little ground he is fond of grog but there is some trouble in carrying the tumbler so often to his mouth so he looks at it and lets it stand he says little because he is too lazy to speak he has served more than eight years but as for passingit has never come into his head such are the three persons who are now sitting in the cabin of the revenuecutter drinking hot gintoddy let me see it was i think in ninetythree or ninetyfour before you were in the service tomkins maybe sir its so long ago since i entered that i cant recollect datesbut this i know that my aunt died three days before then the question is when did your aunt die oh she died about a year after my uncle and when did your uncle die ill be hanged if i know then dye see youve no departure to work from however i think you cannot have been in the service at that time we were not quite so particular about uniform as we are now then i think the service was all the better for it nowadays in your crack ships a mate has to go down in the hold or spiritroom and after whipping up fifty empty casks and breaking out twenty full ones he is expected to come on quarterdeck as clean as if he was just come out of a bandbox well theres plenty of water alongside as far as the outward man goes and iron dust is soon brushed off however as you say perhaps a little too much is expected at least in five of the ships in which i was firstlieutenant the captain was always hauling me over the coals about the midshipmen not dressing properly as if i was their drynurse i wonder what captain prigg would have said if he had seen such a turnout as you mr smith on his quarterdeck i should have had one turnout more drawled smith with your outatelbows jacket there eh continued mr appleboy smith turned up his elbows looked at one and then at the other after so fatiguing an operation he was silent well where was i oh it was about ninetythree or ninetyfour as i said that it happenedtomkins fill your glass and hand me the sugar how do i get on this is number said appleboy counting some white lines on the table by him and taking up a piece of chalk he marked one more line on his tally i dont think this is so good a tub as the last tomkins theres a twang about ita want of juniper however i hope we shall have better luck this time of course you know we sail tomorrow i presume so by the leg of mutton coming on board truetrue im regularas clockwork after being twenty years a firstlieutenant one gets a little method i like regularity now the admiral has never omitted asking me to dinner once every time i have come into harbour except this time i was so certain of it that i never expected to sail and i have but two shirts clean in consequence thats odd isnt itand the more so because he has had such great people down here and has been giving large parties every day and yet i made three seizures besides sweeping up those thirtyseven tubs i swept them up observed smith thats all the same thing younker when youve been a little longer in the service youll find out that the commanding officer has the merit of all that is done but youre green yet let me see where was i ohit was about ninetythree or ninetyfour as i said at that time i was in the channel fleettomkins ill trouble you for the hot water this waters cold mr smith do me the favour to ring the belljem some more hot water please sir said jem who was barefooted as well as bareheaded touching his lock of hair on his forehead the cook had capsized the kettlebut he has put more on capsized the kettle hahvery wellwell talk about that tomorrow mr tomkins do me the favour to put him in the report i may forget it and pray sir how long is it since he has put more on just this moment sir as i came aft very well well see to that tomorrow you bring the kettle aft as soon as it is ready i say mr jem is that fellow sober yees sir he be sober as you be its quite astonishing what a propensity the common sailors have to liquor forty odd years have i been in the service and ive never found any difference i only wish i had a guinea for every time that i have given a fellow sevenwater grog during my servitude as firstlieutenant i wouldnt call the king my cousin well if theres no hot water we must take lukewarm it wont do to heaveto by the lord harry who would have thought itim at number sixteen let me count yessurely i must have made a mistake a fact by heaven continued mr appleboy throwing the chalk down on the table only one more glass after this that is if i have counted righti may have seen double yes drawled smith well never mind lets go on with my story it was either in the year ninetythree or ninetyfour that i was in the channel fleet we were then abreast of torbay here be the hot water sir cried jem putting the kettle down on the deck very well boy bythebye has the jar of butter come on board yes but it broke all down the middle i tied him up with a ropeyarn who broke it sir coxswain says as how he didnt but who did sir coxswain handed it up to bill jones and he says as how he didnt but who did sir bill jones gave it to me and im sure as how i didnt then who did sir i ask you i think it be bill jones sir cause hes fond of butter i know and there be very little left in the jar very well well see to that tomorrow morning mr tomkins youll oblige me by putting the butterjar down in the report in case it should slip my memory bill jones indeed looks as if butter wouldnt melt in his mouth never mind well it was as i said beforeit was in the year ninetythree or ninetyfour when i was in the channel fleet we were then off torbay and had just taken two reefs in the topsails stopbefore i go on with my story ill take my last glass i think its the lastlet me count yes by heavens i make out sixteen all told never mind it shall be a stiff one boy bring the kettle and mind you dont pour the hot water into my shoes as you did the other night there that will do now tomkins fill up yours and you mr smith let us all start fair and then you shall have my storyand a very curious one it is i can tell you i wouldnt have believed it myself if i hadnt seen it hilloa whats this confound it whats the matter with the toddy heh mr tomkins mr tomkins tasted but like the lieutenant he had made it very stiff and as he had also taken largely before he was like him not quite so clear in his discrimination it has a queer twang sir smith what is it smith took up his glass tasted the contents saltwater drawled the midshipman saltwater so it is by heavens cried mr appleboy salt as lots wife by all thats infamous cried the masters mate saltwater sir cried jem in a fright expecting a salt eel for supper yes sir replied mr appleboy tossing the contents of the tumbler in the boys face saltwater very well sirvery well it warnt me sir replied the boy making up a piteous look no sir but you said the cook was sober he was not so very much disguised sir replied jem oh very wellnever mind mr tomkins in case i should forget it do me the favour to put the kettle of saltwater down in the report the scoundrel im very sorry gentlemen but theres no means of having any more gintoddy but never mind well see to this tomorrow two can play at this and if i dont saltwater their grog and make them drink it too i have been twenty years a firstlieutenant for nothing thats all good night gentlemen and continued the lieutenant in a severe tone youll keep a sharp lookout mr smith do you hear sir yes drawled smith but its not my watch it was my first watch and just now it struck one bell youll keep the middle watch then mr smith said mr appleboy who was not a little put out and mr tomkins let me know as soon as its daylight boy get my bed made saltwater by all thats blue however well see to that tomorrow morning mr appleboy then turned in so did mr tomkins and so did mr smith who had no idea of keeping the middle watch because the cook was drunk and had filled up the kettle with saltwater as for what happened in ninetythree or ninetyfour i really would inform the reader if i knew but i am afraid that that most curious story is never to be handed down to posterity the next morning mr tomkins as usual forgot to report the cook the jar of butter and the kettle of saltwater and mr appleboys wrath had long been appeased before he remembered them at daylight the lieutenant came on deck having only slept away half of the sixteen and a taste of the seventeenth saltwater glass of gintoddy he rubbed his grey eyes that he might peer through the grey of the morning the fresh breeze blew about his grizzly locks and cooled his rubicund nose the revenuecutter whose name was the active cast off from the buoy and with a fresh breeze steered her course for the needles passage chapter three cutter the third reader have you been to saint malo if you have you were glad enough to leave the hole and if you have not take my advice and do not give yourself the trouble to go and see that or any other french port in the channel there is not one worth looking at they have made one or two artificial ports and they are no great things there is no getting out or getting in in fact they have no harbours in the channel while we have the finest in the world a peculiar dispensation of providence because it knew that we should want them and france would not in france what are called ports are all alikenasty narrow holes only to be entered at certain times of tide and certain winds made up of basins and backwaters customhouses and cabarets just fit for smugglers to run into and nothing more and therefore they are used for very little else now in the doghole called saint malo there is some pretty land although a great deficiency of marine scenery but never mind that stay at home and dont go abroad to drink sour wine because they call it bordeaux and eat villainous trash so disguised by cooking that you cannot possibly tell which of the birds of the air or beasts of the field or fishes of the sea you are cramming down your throat if all is right there is no occasion for disguise is an old saying so depend upon it that there is something wrong and that you are eating offal under a grand french name they eat everything in france and would serve you up the head of a monkey who has died of the smallpox as singe a la petite verolethat is if you did not understand french if you did they would call it tete damour a lethiopique and then you would be even more puzzled as for their wine there is no disguise in that its half vinegar no no stay at home you can live just as cheaply if you choose and then you will have good meat good vegetables good ale good beer and a good glass of grog and what is of more importance you will be in good company live with your friends and dont make a fool of yourself i would not have condescended to have noticed this place had it not been that i wish you to observe a vessel which is lying along the pierwharf with a plank from the shore to her gunwale it is low water and she is aground and the plank dips down at such an angle that it is a work of danger to go either in or out of her you observe that there is nothing very remarkable in her she is a cutter and a good seaboat and sails well before the wind she is short for her breadth of beam and is not armed smugglers do not arm nowthe service is too dangerous they effect their purpose by cunning not by force nevertheless it requires that smugglers should be good seamen smart active fellows and keenwitted or they can do nothing this vessel has not a large cargo in her but it is valuable she has some thousand yards of lace a few hundred pounds of tea a few bales of silk and about forty ankers of brandyjust as much as they can land in one boat all they ask is a heavy gale or a thick fog and they trust to themselves for success there is nobody on board except a boy the crew are all up at the cabaret settling their little accounts of every descriptionfor they smuggle both ways and every man has his own private venture there they are all fifteen of them and finelooking fellows too sitting at that long table they are very merry but quite sober as they are to sail tonight the captain of the vessel whose name bythebye is the happygoluckythe captain christened her himself is that finelooking young man with dark whiskers meeting under his throat his name is jack pickersgill you perceive at once that he is much above a common sailor in appearance his manners are good he is remarkably handsome very clean and rather a dandy in his dress observe how very politely he takes off his hat to that frenchman with whom he had just settled accounts he beats johnny crapeau at his own weapons and then there is an air of command a feeling of conscious superiority about jack see how he treats the landlord de haut en bas at the same time that he is very civil the fact is that jack is of a very good old family and received a very excellent education but he was an orphan his friends were poor and could do but little for him he went out to india as a cadet ran away and served in a schooner which smuggled opium into china and then came home he took a liking to the employment and is now laying up a very pretty little sum not that he intends to stop no as soon as he has enough to fit out a vessel for himself he intends to start again for india and with two cargoes of opium he will return he trusts with a handsome fortune and reassume his family name such are jacks intentions and as he eventually means to reappear as a gentleman he preserves his gentlemanly habits he neither drinks nor chews nor smokes he keeps his hands clean wears rings and sports a gold snuffbox notwithstanding which jack is one of the boldest and best of sailors and the men know it he is full of fun and as keen as a razor jack has a very heavy venture this timeall the lace is his own speculation and if he gets it in safe he will clear some thousands of pounds a certain fashionable shop in london has already agreed to take the whole off his hands that short neatlymade young man is the second in command and the companion of the captain he is clever and always has a remedy to propose when there is a difficulty which is a great quality in a second in command his name is corbett he is always merryhalfsailor halftradesman knows the markets runs up to london and does business as well as a chapmanlives for the day and laughs at tomorrow that little punchy old man with long grey hair and fat face with a nose like a note of interrogation is the next personage of importance he ought to be called the sailingmaster for although he goes on shore in france off the english coast he never quits the vessel when they leave her with the goods he remains on board he is always to be found off any part of the coast where he may be ordered holding his position in defiance of gales and tides and fogs as for the revenuevessels they all know him well enough but they cannot touch a vessel in ballast if she has no more men on board than allowed by her tonnage he knows every creek and hole and corner of the coast how the tide runs intide halftide eddy or current that is his value his name is morrison you observe that jack pickersgill has two excellent supporters in corbett and morrison his other men are good seamen active and obedient which is all that he requires i shall not particularly introduce them now you may call for another litre my lads and that must be the last the tide is flowing fast and we shall be afloat in half an hour and we have just the breeze we want what dye think morrison shall we have dirt ive been looking just now and if it were any other month in the year i should say yes but theres no trusting april captain howsomever if it does blow off ill promise you a fog in three hours afterwards that will do as well corbett have you settled with duval yes after more noise and charivari than a panic in the stock exchange would make in england he fought and squabbled for an hour and i found that without some abatement i never should have settled the affair what did you let him off seventeen sous replied corbett laughing and that satisfied him inquired pickersgill yesit was all he could prove to be a surfaire two of the knives were a little rusty but he will always have something off he could not be happy without it i really think he would commit suicide if he had to pay a bill without a deduction let him live replied pickersgill jeannette a bottle of volnay of and three glasses jeannette who was the fille de cabaret soon appeared with a bottle of wine seldom called for except by the captain of the happygolucky you sail tonight said she as she placed the bottle before him pickersgill nodded his head i had a strange dream said jeannette i thought you were all taken by a revenuecutter and put in a cachot i went to see you and i did not know one of you againyou were all changed very likely jeannette you would not be the first who did not know their friends again when in misfortune there was nothing strange in your dream mais mon dieu je ne suis pas comme ca moi no that you are not jeannette you are a good girl and some of these fine days ill marry you said corbett doit etre bien beau ce jour la par exemple replied jeannette laughing you have promised to marry me every time you have come in these last three years well that proves i keep to my promise anyhow yes but you never go any further i cant spare him jeannette that is the real truth said the captain but wait a littlein the meantime here is a fivefranc piece to add to your petite fortune merci bien monsieur le capitaine bon voyage jeannette held her finger up to corbett saying with a smile mechant and then quitted the room come morrison help us to empty this bottle and then we will all go on board i wish that girl wouldnt come here with her nonsensical dreams said morrison taking his seat i dont like it when she said that we should be taken by a revenuecutter i was looking at a blue and a white pigeon sitting on the wall opposite and i said to myself now if that be a warning i will see if the blue pigeon flies away first i shall be in jail in a week if the white i shall be back here well said pickersgill laughing it wasnt well answered morrison tossing off his wine and putting the glass down with a deep sigh for the cursed blue pigeon flew away immediately why morrison you must have a chickenheart to be frightened at a blue pigeon said corbett laughing and looking out of the window at all events he has come back again and there he is sitting by the white one its the first time that ever i was called chickenhearted replied morrison in wrath nor do you deserve it morrison replied pickersgill but corbett is only joking well at all events ill try my luck in the same way and see whether i am to be in jail i shall take the blue pigeon as my bad omen as you did the sailors and captain pickersgill all rose and went to the window to ascertain corbetts fortune by this new species of augury the blue pigeon flapped his wings and then he sidled up to the white one at last the white pigeon flew off the wall and settled on the roof of the adjacent house bravo white pigeon said corbett i shall be here again in a week the whole party laughing then resumed their seats and morrisons countenance brightened up as he took the glass of wine poured out by pickersgill he said heres your health corbett it was all nonsense after allfor dye see i cant be put in jail without you are we all sail in the same boat and when you leave me you take with you everything that can condemn the vesselso heres success to our trip we will all drink that toast my lads and then on board said the captain heres success to our trip the captain rose as did the mates and men drank the toast turned down the drinkingvessels on the table hastened to the wharf and in half an hour the happygolucky was clear of the port of saint malo chapter four portland bill the happygolucky sailed with a fresh breeze and a flowing sheet from saint malo the evening before the arrow sailed from barn pool the active sailed from portsmouth the morning after the yacht as we before observed was bound to cowes in the isle of wight the active had orders to cruise wherever she pleased within the limits of the admirals station and she ran for west bay on the other side of the bill of portland the happygolucky was also bound for that bay to land her cargo the wind was light and there was every appearance of fine weather when the happygolucky at ten oclock on the tuesday night made the portland lights as it was impossible to run her cargo that night she hove to at eleven oclock the portland lights were made by the revenuecutter active mr appleboy went up to have a look at them ordered the cutter to be hove to and then went down to finish his allowance of gintoddy at twelve oclock the yacht arrow made the portland lights and continued her course hardly stemming the ebb tide day broke and the horizon was clear the first on the lookout were of course the smugglers they and those on board the revenuecutter were the only two interested partiesthe yacht was neuter there are two cutters in sight sir said corbett who had the watch for pickersgill having been up the whole night had thrown himself down on the bed with his clothes on what do they look like said pickersgill who was up in a moment one is a yacht and the other may be but i rather think as far as i can judge in the grey that it is our old friend off here what old appleboy yes it looks like him but the day has scarcely broke yet well he can do nothing in a light wind like this and before the wind we can show him our heels but are you sure the other is a yacht said pickersgill coming on deck yes the king is more careful of his canvas youre right said pickersgill that is a yacht and youre right there again in your guessthat is the stupid old active which creeps about creeping for tubs well i see nothing to alarm us at present provided it dont fall a dead calm and then we must take to our boats as soon as he takes to his we are four miles from him at least watch his motions corbett and see if he lowers a boat what does she go now four knotsthat will soon tire their men the positions of the three cutters were as follows the happygolucky was about four miles off portland head and well into west bay the revenuecutter was close to the head the yacht was outside of the smuggler about two miles to the westward and about five or six miles from the revenuecutter two vessels in sight sir said mr smith coming down into the cabin to mr appleboy very well replied the lieutenant who was lying down in his standing bedplace the people say one is the happygolucky sir drawled smith heh what happygolucky yes i recollect ive boarded her twenty timesalways empty hows she standing she stands to the westward now sir but she was hove to they say when they first saw her then she has a cargo in her and mr appleboy shaved himself dressed and went on deck yes said the lieutenant rubbing his eyes again and again and then looking through the glass it is her sure enough let draw the foresheethands make sail what vessels the other dont know sirshes a cutter a cutter yes may be a yacht or may be the new cutter ordered on the station make all sail mr tomkins hoist our pendant and fire a gunthey will understand what we mean then they dont know the happygolucky as well as we do in a few minutes the active was under a press of sail she hoisted her pendant and fired a gun the smuggler perceived that the active had recognised her and she also threw out more canvas and ran off more to the westward theres a gun sir reported one of the men to mr stewart on board of the yacht yes give me the glassa revenuecutter then this vessel in shore running towards us must be a smuggler she has just now made all sail sir yes theres no doubt of it i will go down to his lordship keep her as she goes mr stewart then went down to inform lord b of the circumstance not only lord b but most of the gentlemen came on deck as did soon afterwards the ladies who had received the intelligence from lord b who spoke to them through the door of the cabin but the smuggler had more wind than the revenuecutter and increased her distance if we were to wear round my lord observed mr stewart she is just abreast of us and in shore we could prevent her escape round with her mr stewart said lord b we must do our duty and protect the laws that will not be fair papa said cecilia ossulton we have no quarrel with the smuggler im sure the ladies have not for they bring us beautiful things miss ossulton observed her aunt it is not proper for you to offer an opinion the yacht wore round and sailing so fast the smuggler had little chance of escaping her but to chase is one thingto capture another let us give her a gun said lord b that will frighten her and he dare not cross our hawse the gun was loaded and not being more than a mile from the smuggler actually threw the ball almost a quarter of the way the gentlemen as well as lord b were equally excited by the ardour of pursuit but the wind died away and at last it was nearly calm the revenuecutters boats were out and coming up fast let us get our boat out stewart said his lordship and help them it is quite calm now the boat was soon out it was a very large one usually stowed on and occupying a large portion of the deck it pulled six oars and when it was manned mr stewart jumped in and lord b followed him but you have no arms said mr hautaine the smugglers never resist now observed stewart then you are going on a very gallant expedition indeed observed cecilia ossulton i wish you joy but lord b was too much excited to pay attention they shoved off and pulled towards the smuggler at this time the revenue boats were about five miles astern of the happygolucky and the yacht about threequarters of a mile from her in the offing pickersgill had of course observed the motions of the yacht had seen her wear on chase hoist her ensign and pendant and fire her gun well said he this is the blackest ingratitude to be attacked by the very people whom we smuggle for i only wish she may come up with us and let her attempt to interfere she shall rue the day i dont much like this though as we before observed it fell nearly calm and the revenue boats were in chase pickersgill watched them as they came up what shall we do said corbettget the boat out yes replied pickersgill we will get the boat out and have the goods in her all ready but we can pull faster than they do in the first place and in the next they will be pretty well tired before they come up to us we are fresh and shall soon walk away from them so i shall not leave the vessel till they are within half a mile we must sink the ankers that they may not seize the vessel for it is not worth while taking them with us pass them along ready to run them over the bows that they may not see us and swear to it but we have a good half hour and more ay and you may hold all fast if you choose said morrison although its better to be on the right side and get ready otherwise before half an hour ill swear that we are out of their sight look there said he pointing to the eastward at a heavy bank its coming right down upon us as i said it would true enough but still there is no saying which will come first morrison the boats or the fog so we must be prepared hilloa whats this why theres a boat coming from the yacht pickersgill took out his glass yes and the yachts own boat with the name painted on her bows well let them comewe will have no ceremony in resisting them they are not in the act of parliament and must take the consequences we have nought to fear get stretchers my lads and handspikes they row six oars and are three in the sternsheets they must be good men if they take us in a few minutes lord b was close to the smuggler boat ahoy what do you want surrender in the kings name to what and to whom and what are we to surrender we are an english vessel coasting along shore pull on board my lads cried stewart i am a kings officer we know her the boat darted alongside and stewart and lord b followed by the men jumped on the deck well gentlemen what do you want said pickersgill we seize you you are a smugglertheres no denying it look at the casks of spirits stretched along the deck we never said that we were not smugglers replied pickersgill but what is that to you you are not a kings ship or employed by the revenue no but we carry a pendant and it is our duty to protect the laws and who are you said pickersgill i am lord b then my lord allow me to say that you would do much better to attend to the framing of laws and leave people of less consequence like those astern of me to execute them mind your own business is an old adage we shall not hurt you my lord as you have only employed words but we shall put it out of your power to hurt us come aft my lads now my lord resistance is useless we are double your numbers and you have caught a tartar lord b and mr stewart perceived that they were in an awkward predicament you may do what you please observed mr stewart but the revenue boats are coming up recollect look you sir do you see the revenuecutter said pickersgill stewart looked in that direction and saw that she was hidden in the fog in five minutes sir the boats will be out of sight also and so will your vessel we have nothing to fear from them indeed my lord we had better return said mr stewart who perceived that pickersgill was right i beg your pardon you will not go on board your yacht so soon as you expect take the oars out of the boat my lads two or three of you and throw in a couple of our paddles for them to reach the shore with the rest of you knock down the first man who offers to resist you are not aware perhaps my lord that you have attempted piracy on the high seas stewart looked at lord b it was true enough the men of the yacht could offer no resistance the oars were taken out of the boat and the men put in again my lord said pickersgill your boat is manned do me the favour to step into it and you sir do the same i should be sorry to lay my hands upon a peer of the realm or a kings officer even on half pay remonstrance was vain his lordship was led to the boat by two of the smugglers and stewart followed i will leave your oars my lord at the weymouth customhouse and i trust this will be a lesson to you in future to mind your own business the boat was shoved off from the sloop by the smugglers and was soon lost sight of in the fog which had now covered the revenue boats as well as the yacht at the same time it brought down a breeze from the eastward haul to the wind morrison said pickersgill we will stand out to get rid of the boats if they pull on they will take it for granted that we shall run into the bay as will the revenuecutter pickersgill and corbett were in conversation abaft for a short time when the former desired the course to be altered two points keep silence all of you my lads and let me know if you hear a gun or a bell from the yacht said pickersgill there is a gun sir close to us said one of the men the sound was right ahead that will do keep her as she goes aft here my lads we cannot run our cargo in the bay for the cutter has been seen to chase us and they will all be on the lookout at the preventive stations for us on shore now my lads i have made up my mind that as these yacht gentlemen have thought proper to interfere that i will take possession of the yacht for a few days we shall then outsail everything go where we like unsuspected and land our cargo with ease i shall run alongside of hershe can have but few hands on board and mind do not hurt anybody but be civil and obey my orders morrison you and your four men and the boy will remain on board as before and take the vessel to cherbourg where we will join you in a short time another gun was fired from the yacht those on board particularly the ladies were alarmed the fog was very thick and they could not distinguish the length of the vessel they had seen the boat board but had not seen her turned adrift without oars as the fog came on just at that time the yacht was left with only three seamen on board and should it come on bad weather they were in an awkward predicament mr hautaine had taken the command and ordered the guns to be fired that the boat might be enabled to find them the fourth gun was loading when they perceived the smugglers cutter close to them looming through the fog here they are cried the seamen and they have brought the prize along with them three cheers for the arrow hilloa youll be on board of us cried hautaine thats exactly what i intend to be sir replied pickersgill jumping on the quarterdeck followed by his men who the devil are you thats exactly the same question that i asked lord b when he boarded us replied pickersgill taking off his hat to the ladies well but what business have you here exactly the same question which i put to lord b replied pickersgill where is lord b sir said cecilia ossulton going up to the smuggler is he safe yes madam he is safe at least he is in his boat with all his men and unhurt but you must excuse me if i request you and the other ladies to go down below while i speak to these gentlemen be under no alarm miss you will receive neither insult nor illtreatmenti have only taken possession of this vessel for the present take possession cried hautaine of a yacht yes sir since the owner of the yacht thought proper to attempt to take possession of me i always thought that yachts were pleasurevessels sailing about for amusement respected themselves and not interfering with others but it appears that such is not the case the owner of this yacht has thought proper to break through the neutrality and commence aggression and under such circumstances i have now in retaliation taken possession of her and pray what do you mean to do sir simply for a few days to make an exchange i shall send you on board of my vessel as smugglers while i remain here with the ladies and amuse myself with yachting why sir you cannot mean i have said gentlemen and that is enough i should be sorry to resort to violence but i must be obeyed you have i perceive three seamen only left they are not sufficient to take charge of the vessel and lord b and the others you will not meet for several days my regard for the ladies even common humanity points out to me that i cannot leave the vessel in this crippled condition at the same time i must have hands on board of my own you will oblige me by going on board and taking her safely into port it is the least return you can make for my kindness in those dresses gentlemen you will not be able to do your duty oblige me by shifting and putting on these corbett handed a flannel shirt a rough jacket and trousers to messrs hautaine ossulton vaughan and seagrove after some useless resistance they were stripped and having put on the smugglers attire they were handed on board of the happygolucky the three english seamen were also sent on board and confined below as well as ossultons servant who was also equipped like his master and confined below with the seamen corbett and the men then handed up all the smuggled goods into the yacht dropped the boat and made it fast astern and morrison having received his directions the vessels separated morrison running for cherbourg and pickersgill steering the yacht along shore to the westward about an hour after this exchange had been effected the fog cleared up and showed the revenuecutter hove to for her boats which had pulled back and were close on board of her and the happygolucky about three miles in the offing lord b and his boats crew were about four miles in shore paddling and drifting with the tide towards portland as soon as the boats were on board the revenuecutter made all sail after the smuggler paying no attention to the yacht and either not seeing or not caring about the boat which was drifting about in west bay chapter five the travesty here we are corbett and now i only wish my venture had been double observed pickersgill but i shall not allow business to absorb me whollywe must add a little amusement it appears to me corbett that the gentlemans clothes which lie there will fit you and those of the goodlooking fellow who was spokesman will i am sure suit me well now let us dress ourselves and then for breakfast pickersgill then exchanged his clothes for those of mr hautaine and corbett fitted on those of mr ossulton the steward was summoned up and he dared not disobey he appeared on deck trembling stewardyou will take these clothes below said pickersgill and observe that i now command this yacht and during the time that i am on board you will pay me the same respect as you did lord b nay more you will always address me as lord b you will prepare dinner and breakfast and do your duty just as if his lordship was on board and take care that you feed us well for i will not allow the ladies to be entertained in a less sumptuous manner than before you will tell the cook what i say and now that you have heard me take care that you obey if not recollect that i have my own men here and if i but point with my finger overboard you go do you perfectly comprehend me yessir stammered the steward yes sirwhat did i tell you sirrahyes my lord do you understand me yesmy lord pray steward whose clothes has this gentleman put on mrmr ossultons i thinksirmy lord i mean very well steward then recollect in future you always address that gentleman as mr ossulton yes my lord and the steward went down below and was obliged to take a couple of glasses of brandy to keep himself from fainting who are they and what are they mr maddox cried the ladysmaid who had been weeping piratesbloody murderous stickatnothing pirates replied the steward oh screamed the ladysmaid what will become of us poor unprotected females and she hastened into the cabin to impart this dreadful intelligence the ladies in the cabin were not in a very enviable situation as for the elder miss ossulton but perhaps it will be better in future to distinguish the two ladies by calling the elder simply miss ossulton and her niece cecilia she was sitting with her salts to her nose agonised with a mixture of trepidation and wounded pride mrs lascelles was weeping but weeping gently cecilia was sad and her heart was beating with anxiety and suspensewhen the maid rushed in o madam o miss o mrs lascelles i have found it all outthey are murderous bloody doeverything pirates mercy on us exclaimed miss ossulton surely they will never dare oh maam they dare anythingthey just now were for throwing the steward overboard and they have rummaged for all the portmanteaus and dressed themselves in the gentlemens best clothes the captain of them told the steward that he was lord b and that if he dared to call him anything else he would cut his throat from ear to ear and if the cook dont give them a good dinner they swear that theyll chop his right hand off and make him eat it without pepper or salt miss ossulton screamed and went off into hysterics mrs lascelles and cecilia went to her assistance but the latter had not forgotten the very different behaviour of jack pickersgill and his polite manners when he boarded the vessel she did not therefore believe what the maid had reported but still her anxiety and suspense were great especially about her father after having restored her aunt she put on her bonnet which was lying on the sofa where are you going dear said mrs lascelles on deck replied cecilia i must and will speak to these men gracious heaven miss ossulton going on deck have you heard what phoebe says yes aunt i have but i can wait here no longer stop her stop hershe will be murderedshe will beshe is mad screamed miss ossulton but no one attempted to stop cecilia and on deck she went on her arrival she found jack pickersgill and corbett walking the deck one of the smugglers at the helm and the rest forward and as quiet as the crew of the yacht as soon as she made her appearance jack took off his hat and made her a bow i do not know whom i have the honour of addressing young lady but i am flattered with this mark of confidence you feel and i assure you you feel correctly that you are not exactly in lawless hands cecilia looked with more surprise than fear at pickersgill mr hautaines dress became him he was a handsome finelooking man and had nothing of the ruffian in his appearance unless like byrons corsair he was half savage half soft she could not help thinking that she had met many with less pretensions as far as appearance went to the claims of a gentleman at almacks and other fashionable circles i have ventured on deck sir said cecilia with a little tremulousness in her voice to request as a favour that you will inform me what your intentions may be with regard to the vessel and with regard to the ladies and i feel much obliged to you for so doing and i assure you i will as far as i have made up my own mind answer you candidly but you trembleallow me to conduct you to a seat in few words then to remove your present alarm i intend that the vessel shall be returned to its owner with every article in it as religiously respected as if they were church property with respect to you and the other ladies on board i pledge you my honour that you have nothing to fear that you shall be treated with every respect your privacy never invaded and that in a few days you will be restored to your friends young lady i pledge my hopes of future salvation to the truth of this but at the same time i must make a few conditions which however will not be very severe but sir replied cecilia much relieved for pickersgill had stood by her in the most respectful manner you are i presume the captain of the smuggler pray answer me one question morewhat became of the boat with lord b he is my father i left him in his boat without a hair of his head touched young lady but i took away the oars then he will perish cried cecilia putting her handkerchief to her eyes no young lady he is on shore probably by this time although i took away his means of assisting to capture us i left him the means of gaining the land it is not every one who would have done that after his conduct to us i begged him not to go said cecilia i told him that it was not fair and that he had no quarrel with the smugglers i thank you even for that replied pickersgill and now missi have not the pleasure of recollecting his lordships family name ossulton sir cried cecilia looking at pickersgill with surprise then with your permission miss ossulton i will now make you my confidant excuse my using so free a term but it is because i wish to relieve your fears at the same time i cannot permit you to divulge all my intentions to the whole party on board i feel that i may trust you for you have courage and where there is courage there generally is truth but you must first tell me whether you will condescend to accept these terms cecilia demurred a moment the idea of being the confidant of a smuggler rather startled her but still her knowledge of what his intentions were if she might not reveal them might be important as perhaps she might dissuade him she could be in no worse position than she was now and she might be in a much better the conduct of pickersgill had been such up to the present as to inspire confidence and although he defied the laws he appeared to regard the courtesies of life cecilia was a courageous girl and at length she replied provided what you desire me to keep secret will not be injurious to any one or compromise me in my peculiar situation i consent i would not hurt a fly miss ossulton but in selfdefence and i have too much respect for you from your conduct during our short meeting to compromise you allow me now to be very candid and then perhaps you will acknowledge that in my situation others would do the same and perhaps not show half so much forbearance your father without any right whatever interferes with me and my calling he attempts to make me a prisoner to have me thrown into jail heavily fined and perhaps sent out of the country i will not enter into any defence of smuggling it is sufficient to say that there are pains and penalties attached to the infraction of certain laws and that i choose to risk them but lord b was not empowered by government to attack me it was a gratuitous act and had i thrown him and all his crew into the sea i should have been justified for it was in short an act of piracy on their part now as your father has thought to turn a yacht into a revenuecutter you cannot be surprised at my retaliating in turning her into a smuggler and as he has mixed up looking after the revenue with yachting he cannot be surprised if i retaliate by mixing up a little yachting with smuggling i have dressed your male companions as smugglers and have sent them in the smuggling vessel to cherbourg where they will be safely landed and i have dressed myself and the only person whom i could join with me in this frolic as gentlemen in their places my object is twofold one is to land my cargo which i have now on board and which is very valuable the other is to retaliate upon your father and his companions for their attempt upon me by stepping into their shoes and enjoying for a day or two their luxuries it is my intention to make free with nothing but his lordships wines and eatablesthat you may be assured of but i shall have no pleasure if the ladies do not sit down to the dinnertable with us as they did before with your father and his friends you can hardly expect that sir said cecilia yes i do and that will be not only the price of the early release of the yacht and themselves but it will also be the only means by which they will obtain anything to eat you observe miss ossulton the sins of the fathers are visited on the children i have now told you what i mean to do and what i wish i leave you to think of it and decide whether it will not be the best for all parties to consent you have my permission to tell the other ladies that whatever may be their conduct they are as secure from illtreatment or rudeness as if they were in grosvenorsquare but i cannot answer that they will not be hungry if after such forbearance in every point they show so little gratitude as not to honour me with their company then i am to understand that we are to be starved into submission no not starved miss ossulton but recollect that you will be on bread and water and detained until you do consent and your detention will increase the anxiety of your father you know how to persuade sir said cecilia as far as i am concerned i trust i shall ever be ready to sacrifice any feelings of pride to spare my father so much uneasiness with your permission i will now go down into the cabin and relieve my companions from the worst of their fears as for obtaining what you wish i can only say that as a young person i am not likely to have much influence with those older than myself and must inevitably be overruled as i have not permission to point out to them reasons which might avail would you so far allow me to be relieved from my promise as to communicate all you have said to me to the only married woman on board i think i might then obtain your wishes which i must candidly tell you i shall attempt to effect only because i am most anxious to rejoin my friends and be relieved of my company replied pickersgill smiling ironicallyof course you are but i must and will have my pretty revenge and although you may and probably will detest me at all events you shall not have any very formidable charge to make against me before you go below miss ossulton i give you my permission to add the married lady to the number of my confidants and you must permit me to introduce my friend mr ossulton and pickersgill waved his hand in the direction of corbett who took off his hat and made a low obeisance it was impossible for cecilia ossulton to help smiling and continued pickersgill having taken the command of this yacht instead of his lordship it is absolutely necessary that i also take his lordships name while on board i am lord b and allow me to introduce myself under that name i cannot be addressed otherwise depend upon it miss ossulton that i shall have a most paternal solicitude to make you happy and comfortable had cecilia ossulton dared to have given vent to her real feelings at that time she would have burst into a fit of laughter it was too ludicrous at the same time the very burlesque reassured her still more she went into the cabin with a heavy weight removed from her heart in the meantime miss ossulton and mrs lascelles remained below in the greatest anxiety at cecilias prolonged stay they knew not what to think and dared not go on deck mrs lascelles had once determined at all risks to go up but miss ossulton and phoebe had screamed and implored her so fervently not to leave them that she unwillingly consented to remain cecilias countenance when she entered the cabin reassured mrs lascelles but not her aunt who ran to her crying and sobbing and clinging to her saying what have they done to you my poor poor cecilia nothing at all aunt replied cecilia the captain speaks very fairly and says he shall respect us in every possible way provided that we obey his orders but if not if notwhat cecilia said miss ossulton grasping her nieces arm he will starve us and not let us go god have mercy on us cried miss ossulton renewing her sobs cecilia then went to mrs lascelles and communicated to her apart all that had passed mrs lascelles agreed with cecilia that they were in no danger of insult and as they talked over the matter they at last began to laugh there was a novelty in it and there was something so ridiculous in all the gentlemen being turned into smugglers cecilia was glad that she could not tell her aunt as she wished her to be so frightened as never to have her company on board the yacht again and mrs lascelles was too glad to annoy her for many and various insults received the matter was therefore canvassed over very satisfactorily and mrs lascelles felt a natural curiosity to see this new lord b and the second mr ossulton but they had had no breakfast and were feeling very hungry now that their alarm was over they desired phoebe to ask the steward for some tea or coffee the reply was that breakfast was laid in the cabin and lord b trusted that the ladies would come to partake of it no no replied mrs lascelles i never can without being introduced to them first nor will i go replied cecilia but i will write a note and we will have our breakfast here cecilia wrote a note in pencil as follows miss ossultons compliments to lord b and as the ladies feel rather indisposed after the alarm of this morning they trust that his lordship will excuse their coming to breakfast but hope to meet his lordship at dinner if not before that time on deck the answer was propitious and the steward soon appeared with the breakfast in the ladies cabin well maddox said cecilia how do you get on with your new master the steward looked at the door to see if it was closed shook his head and then said with a look of despair he has ordered a haunch of venison for dinner miss and he has twice threatened to toss me overboard you must obey him maddox or he certainly will these pirates are dreadful fellows be attentive and serve him just as if he was my father yes yes maam i will but our time may come its burglary on the high seas and ill go fifty miles to see him hanged steward cried pickersgill from the cabin o lord he cant have heard medye think he did miss the partitions are very thin and you spoke very loud said mrs lascelles at all events go to him quickly good bye miss good bye maam if i shouldnt see you any more said maddox trembling with fear as he obeyed the awful summonswhich was to demand a toothpick miss ossulton would not touch the breakfast not so mrs lascelles and cecilia who ate very heartily its very dull to be shut up in this cabin said mrs lascelles come cecilia lets go on deck and leave me cried miss ossulton there is phoebe here aunt we are going up to persuade the pirates to put us all on shore mrs lascelles and cecilia put on their bonnets and went up lord b took off his hat and begged the honour of being introduced to the pretty widow he handed the ladies to a seat and then commenced conversing upon various subjects which at the same time possessed great novelty his lordship talked about france and described its ports told now and then a good anecdote pointed out the different headlands bays towns and villages which they were passing rapidly and always had some little story connected with each before the ladies had been two hours on deck they found themselves to their infinite surprise not only interested but in conversation with the captain of the smuggler and more than once they laughed outright but the soidisant lord b had inspired them with confidence they fully believed that what he had told them was true and that he had taken possession of the yacht to smuggle his goods to be revenged and to have a laugh now none of these three offences are capital in the eyes of the fair sex and jack was a handsome finelooking fellow of excellent manners and very agreeable conversation at the same time neither he nor his friend were in their general deportment and behaviour otherwise than most respectful ladies as you are not afraid of me which is a greater happiness than i had reason to expect i think you may be amused to witness the fear of those who accuse your sex of cowardice with your permission i will send for the cook and steward and inquire about the dinner i should like to know what there is for dinner observed mrs lascelles demurely wouldnt you cecilia cecilia put her handkerchief to her mouth tell the steward and the cook both to come aft immediately cried pickersgill in a few seconds they both made their appearance steward cried pickersgill with a loud voice yes my lord replied maddox with his hat in his hand what wines have you put out for dinner champagne my lord and claret my lord and madeira and sherry my lord no burgundy sir no my lord there is no burgundy on board no burgundy sir do you dare to tell me that upon my soul my lord cried maddox dropping on his knees there is no burgundy on boardask the ladies very well sir you may go cook what have you got for dinner sir a haunch of mutof venison my lord replied the cook with his white nightcap in his hand what else sirrah a boiled calfs head my lord a boiled calfs head let it be roasted or ill roast you sir cried pickersgill in an angry tone yes my lord ill roast it and what else sir maintenon cutlets my lord maintenon cutlets i hate themi wont have them sir let them be dressed a lombre chinoise i dont know what that is my lord i dont care for that sirrah if you dont find out by dinnertime youre food for fishesthat all you may go the cook walked off wringing his hands and his nightcap as wellfor he still held it in his right handand disappeared down the forehatchway i have done this to pay you a deserved compliment ladies you have more courage than the other sex recollect that we have had confidence given to us in consequence of your pledging your word my lord you do me then the honour of believing me i did not until i saw you replied mrs lascelles but now i am convinced that you will perform your promise you do indeed encourage me madam to pursue what is right said pickersgill bowing for your approbation i should be most sorry to lose still more sorry to prove myself unworthy of it as the reader will observe everything was going on remarkably well chapter six the smuggling yacht cecilia returned to the cabin to ascertain whether her aunt was more composed but mrs lascelles remained on deck she was much pleased with pickersgill and they continued their conversation pickersgill entered into a defence of his conduct to lord b and mrs lascelles could not but admit the provocation after a long conversation she hinted at his profession and how superior he appeared to be to such a lawless life you may be incredulous madam replied pickersgill if i tell you that i have as good a right to quarter my arms as lord b himself and that i am not under my real name smuggling is at all events no crime and i infinitely prefer the wild life i lead at the head of my men to being spurned by society because i am poor the greatest crime in this country is poverty i may if i am fortunate some day resume my name you may perhaps meet me and if you please you may expose me that i should not be likely to do replied the widow but still i regret to see a person evidently intended for better things employed in so disreputable a profession i hardly know madam what is and what is not disreputable in this conventional world it is not considered disreputable to cringe to the vices of a court or to accept a pension wrung from the industry of the nation in return for base servility it is not considered disreputable to take tithes intended for the service of god and lavish them away at wateringplaces or elsewhere seeking pleasure instead of doing god service it is not considered disreputable to take fee after fee to uphold injustice to plead against innocence to pervert truth and to aid the devil it is not considered disreputable to gamble on the stock exchange or to corrupt the honesty of electors by bribes for doing which the penalty attached is equal to that decreed to the offence of which i am guilty all these and much more are not considered disreputable yet by all these are the moral bonds of society loosened while in mine we cause no guilt in others but still it is a crime a violation of the revenue laws and no more observe madam the english government encourage the smuggling of our manufactures to the continent at the same time that they take every step to prevent articles being smuggled into this country now madam can that be a crime when the head of the vessel is turned north which becomes no crime when she steers the opposite way there is a stigma attached to it you must allow that i grant you madam and as soon as i can quit the profession i shall no captive ever sighed more to be released from his chains but i will not leave it till i find i am in a situation not to be spurned and neglected by those with whom i have a right to associate at this moment the steward was seen forward making signs to mrs lascelles who excused herself and went to him for the love of god madam said maddox as he appears to be friendly with you do pray find out how these cutlets are to be dressed the cook is tearing his hair and we shall never have any dinner and then it will all fall upon me and ishall be tossed overboard mrs lascelles desired poor maddox to wait there while she obtained the desired information in a few minutes she returned to him i have found it out they are first to be boiled in vinegar then fried in batter and served up with a sauce of anchovy and malaga raisins first fried in vinegar then boiled in batter and served up with almonds and raisins nono mrs lascelles repeated the injunction to the frightened steward and then returned aft and reentered into a conversation with pickersgill in which for the first time corbett now joined corbett had sense enough to feel that the less he came forward until his superior had established himself in the good graces of the ladies the more favourable would be the result in the meantime cecilia had gone down to her aunt who still continued to wail and lament the young lady tried all she could to console her and to persuade her that if they were civil and obedient they had nothing to fear civil and obedient indeed cried miss ossulton to a fellow who is a smuggler and a pirate i the sister of lord b never the presumption of the wretch that is all very well aunt but recollect we must submit to circumstances these men insist upon our dining with them and we must go or we shall have no dinner i sit down with a pirate never ill have no dinnerill starve ill die but my dear aunt its the only chance we have of obtaining our release and if you do not do it mrs lascelles will think that you wish to remain with them mrs lascelles judges of other people by herself the captain is certainly a very wellbehaved handsome man he looks like a nobleman in disguise what an odd thing it would be aunt if this should be all a hoax a hoax child replied miss ossulton sitting up on the sofa cecilia found that she had hit the right nail as the saying is and she brought forward so many arguments to prove that she thought it was a hoax to frighten them and that the gentleman above was a man of consequence that her aunt began to listen to reason and at last consented to join the dinnerparty mrs lascelles now came down below and when dinner was announced they repaired to the large cabin where they found pickersgill and corbett waiting for them miss ossulton did not venture to look up until she heard pickersgill say to mrs lascelles perhaps madam you will do me the favour to introduce me to that lady whom i have not had the honour of seeing before certainly my lord replied mrs lascelles miss ossulton the aunt of this young lady mrs lascelles purposely did not introduce his lordship in return that she might mystify the old spinster i feel highly honoured in finding myself in the company of miss ossulton said pickersgill ladies we wait but for you to sit down ossulton take the head of the table and serve the soup miss ossulton was astonished she looked at the smugglers and perceived two welldressed gentlemanly men one of whom was apparently a lord and the other having the same family name it must be all a hoax thought she and she very quietly took to her soup the dinner passed off very pleasantly pickersgill was agreeable corbett funny and miss ossulton so far recovered herself as to drink wine with his lordship and to ask corbett what branch of their family he belonged to i presume its the irish branch said mrs lascelles prompting him exactly madam replied corbett have you ever been to torquay ladies inquired pickersgill no my lord answered mrs lascelles we shall anchor there in the course of an hour and probably remain there till tomorrow steward bring coffee tell the cook these cutlets were remarkably welldressed the ladies retired to their cabin miss ossulton was now convinced that it was all a hoax but said she i shall tell lord b my opinion of their practical jokes when he returns what is his lordships name who is on board he wont tell us replied mrs lascelles but i think i know it is lord blarney lord blaney you mean i presume said miss ossulton however the thing is carried too far cecilia we will go on shore at torquay and wait till the yacht returns with lord b i dont like these jokes they may do very well for widows and people of no rank now mrs lascelles was sorry to find miss ossulton so much at her ease she owed her no little spite and wished for revenge ladies will go very far to obtain this how far mrs lascelles would have gone i will not pretend to say but this is certain that the last innuendo of miss ossulton very much added to her determination she took her bonnet and went on deck at once told pickersgill that he could not please her or cecilia more than by frightening miss ossulton who under the idea that it was all a hoax had quite recovered her spirits talked of her pride and illnature and wished her to receive a useful lesson thus to follow up her revenge did mrs lascelles commit herself so far as to be confidential with the smuggler in return mrs lascelles i shall be able to obey you and at the same time to combine business with pleasure after a short conversation the yacht dropped her anchor at torquay it was then about two hours before sunset as soon as the sails were furled one or two gentlemen who resided there came on board to pay their respects to lord b and as pickersgill had found out from cecilia that her father was acquainted with no one there he received them in person asked them down in the cabincalled for wineand desired them to send their boats away as his own was going on shore the smugglers took great care that the steward cook and ladysmaid should have no communication with the guests one of them by corbetts direction being a sentinel over each individual the gentlemen remained about halfanhour on board during which corbett and the smugglers had filled the portmanteaus found in the cabin with the lace and they were put in the boat corbett then landed the gentlemen in the same boat and went up to the hotel the smugglers following him with the portmanteaus without any suspicion or interruption as soon as he was there he ordered posthorses and set off for a town close by where he had correspondents and thus the major part of the cargo was secured corbett then returned in the night bringing with him people to receive the goods and the smugglers landed the silks teas etcetera with the same good fortune everything was out of the yacht except a portion of the lace which the portmanteaus would not hold pickersgill might easily have sent this on shore but to please mrs lascelles he arranged otherwise the next morning about an hour after breakfast was finished mrs lascelles entered the cabin pretending to be in the greatest consternation and fell on the sofa as if she were going to faint good heavens what is the matter exclaimed cecilia who knew very well what was coming oh the wretch he has made such proposals proposals what proposals what lord blaney cried miss ossulton oh hes no lord hes a villain and a smuggler and he insists that we shall both fill our pockets full of lace and go on shore with him mercy on me then it is no hoax after all and ive been sitting down to dinner with a smuggler sitting down madamif it were to be no more than thatbut we are to take his arm up to the hotel oh dear cecilia i am ordered on deck pray come with me miss ossulton rolled on the sofa and rang for phoebe she was in a state of great alarm a knock at the door come in said miss ossulton thinking it was phoebe when pickersgill made his appearance what do you want sir go out sir go out directly of ill scream it is no use screaming madam recollect that all on board are at my service you will oblige me by listening to me miss ossulton i am as you know a smuggler and i must send this lace on shore you will oblige me by putting it into your pockets or about your person and prepare to go on shore with me as soon as we arrive at the hotel you will deliver it to me and i then shall reconduct you on board of the yacht you are not the first lady who has gone on shore with contraband articles about her person me sir go on shore in that way no sirnever what will the world saythe hon miss ossulton walking with a smuggler no sir never yes madam walking arminarm with a smuggler i shall have you on one arm and mrs lascelles on the other and i would advise you to take it very quietly for in the first place it will be you who smuggle as the goods will be found on your person and you will certainly be put in prison for at the least appearance of insubordination we run and inform against you and further your niece will remain on board as a hostage for your good behaviourand if you have any regard for her liberty you will consent immediately pickersgill left the cabin and shortly afterwards cecilia and mrs lascelles entered apparently much distressed they had been informed of all and mrs lascelles declared that for her part sooner than leave her poor cecilia to the mercy of such people she had made up her mind to submit to the smugglers demands cecilia also begged so earnestly that miss ossulton who had no idea that it was a trick with much sobbing and blubbering consented when all was ready cecilia left the cabin pickersgill came down handed up the two ladies who had not exchanged a word with each other during cecilias absence the boat was ready alongsidethey went in and pulled on shore everything succeeded to the smugglers satisfaction miss ossulton frightened out of her wits took his arm and with mrs lascelles on the other they went up to the hotel followed by four of his boats crew as soon as they were shown into a room corbett who was already on shore asked for lord b and joined them the ladies retired to another apartment divested themselves of their contraband goods and after calling for some sandwiches and wine pickersgill waited an hour and then returned on board mrs lascelles was triumphant and she rewarded her new allythe smugglerwith one of her sweetest smiles community of interest will sometimes make strange friendships chapter seven conclusion we must now return to the other parties who have assisted in the acts of this little drama lord b after paddling and paddling the men relieving each other in order to make head against the wind which was off shore arrived about midnight at a small town in west bay from whence he took a chaise on to portsmouth taking it for granted that his yacht would arrive as soon as if not before himself little imagining that it was in possession of the smugglers there he remained three or four days when becoming impatient he applied to one of his friends who had a yacht at cowes and sailed with him to look after his own we left the happygolucky chased by the revenuecutter at first the smuggler had the advantage before the wind but by degrees the wind went round with the sun and brought the revenuecutter leeward it was then a chase on a wind and the revenuecutter came fast up with her morrison perceiving that he had no chance of escape let run the ankers of brandy that he might not be condemned but still he was in an awkward situation as he had more men on board than allowed by act of parliament he therefore stood on notwithstanding the shot of the cutter went over and over him hoping that a fog or night might enable him to escape but he had no such good fortune one of the shot carried away the head of his mast and the happygoluckys luck was all over he was boarded and taken possession of he asserted that the extra men were only passengers but in the first place they were dressed in seamens clothes and in the second as soon as the boat was aboard of her appleboy had gone down to his gintoddy and was not to be disturbed the gentlemen smugglers therefore passed an uncomfortable night and the cutter going portland by daylight before appleboy was out of bed they were taken on shore to the magistrate hautaine explained the whole affair and they were immediately released and treated with respect but they were not permitted to depart until they were bound over to appear against the smugglers and prove the brandy having been on board they then set off for portsmouth in the seamens clothes having had quite enough of yachting for that season mr ossulton declaring that he only wanted to get his luggage and then he would take care how he put himself again in the way of the shot of a revenue cruiser or of sleeping a night on her decks in the mean time morrison and his men were locked up in the gaol the old man as the key was turned on him exclaiming as he raised his foot in vexation that cursed blue pigeon we will now return to the yacht about an hour after pickersgill had come on board corbett had made all his arrangements and followed him it was not advisable to remain at torquay any longer through fear of discovery he therefore weighed anchor before dinner and made sail what do you intend to do now my lord said mrs lascelles i intend to run down to cowes anchor the yacht in the night and an hour before daylight have you in my boat with all my men i will take care that you are in perfect safety depend upon it even if i run a risk i should indeed be miserable if through my wild freaks any accident should happen to mrs lascelles or miss ossulton i am very anxious about my father observed cecilia i trust that you will keep your promise i always have hitherto miss ossulton have i not ours is but a short and strange acquaintance i grant it but it will serve for you to talk about long after i shall disappear as suddenly as i have comeyou will neither of you in all probability ever see me again the dinner was announced and they sat down to table as before but the elderly spinster refused to make her appearance and mr lascelles and cecilia who thought she had been frightened enough did not attempt to force her pickersgill immediately yielded to these remonstrances and from that time she remained undisturbed in the ladies cabin meditating over the indignity of having sat down to table having drank wine and been obliged to walk on shore taking the arm of a smuggler and appear in such a humiliating situation the wind was light and they made but little progress and were not abreast of portland till the second day when another yacht appeared in sight and the two vessels slowly neared until in the afternoon they were within four miles of each other it then fell a dead calm signals were thrown out by the other yacht but could not be distinguished and for the last time they sat down to dinner three days companionship on board of a vessel cooped up together and having no one else to converse with will produce intimacy and pickersgill was a young man of so much originality and information that he was listened to with pleasure he never attempted to advance beyond the line of strict decorum and politeness and his companion was equally unpresuming situated as they were and feeling what must have been the case had they fallen into other hands both cecilia and mrs lascelles felt some degree of gratitude towards him and although anxious to be relieved from so strange a position they had gradually acquired a perfect confidence in him and this had produced a degree of familiarity on their parts although never ventured upon by the smuggler as corbett was at the table one of the men came down and made a sign corbett shortly after quitted the table and went on deck i wish my lord you would come up a moment and see if you can make this flag out said corbett giving a significant nod to pickersgill excuse me ladies one moment said pickersgill who went on deck it is the boat of the yacht coming on board said corbett and lord b is in the sternsheets with the gentleman who was with him and how many men in the boatlet me seeonly four well let his lordship and his friend come when they are on the deck have the men ready in case of accident but if you can manage to tell the boats crew that they are to go on board again and get rid of them that way so much the better arrange this with adams and then come down againhis lordship must see us all at dinner pickersgill then descended and corbett had hardly time to give his directions and to resume his seat before his lordship and mr stewart pulled up alongside and jumped on deck there was no one to receive them but the seamen and those whom they did not know they looked round in amazement at last his lordship said to adams who stood forwardwhat men are you belong to the yacht yer honour lord b heard laughing in the cabin he would not wait to interrogate the men he walked aft followed by mr stewart looked down the skylight and perceived his daughter and mrs lascelles with as he supposed hautaine and ossulton pickersgill had heard the boat rub the side and the sound of the feet on deck and he talked the more loudly that the ladies might be caught by lord b as they were he heard their feet at the skylight and knew that they could hear what passed and at that moment he proposed to the ladies that as this was their last meeting at table they should all take a glass of champagne to drink to their happy meeting with lord b this was a toast which they did not refuse maddox poured out the wine and they were all bowing to each other when his lordship who had come down the ladder walked into the cabin followed by mr stewart cecilia perceived her father the champagneglass dropped from her handshe flew into his arms and burst into tears who would not be a father mrs lascelles said pickersgill quietly seating himself after having first risen to receive lord b and pray whom may i have the honour of finding established here said lord b in an angry tone speaking over his daughters head who still lay in his arms by heavens yesstewart it is the smuggling captain dressed out even so my lord replied pickersgill you abandoned your yacht to capture me you left these ladies in a vessel crippled for want of men they might have been lost i have returned good for evil by coming on board with my own people and taking charge of them this night i expected to have anchored your vessel in cowes and have left them in safety by the cried stewart stop sir if you please cried pickersgill recollect you have once already attacked one who never offended oblige me by refraining from intemperate language for i tell you i will not put up with it recollect sir that i have refrained from that and also from taking advantage of you when you were in my power recollect sir also that the yacht is still in possession of the smugglers and that you are in no condition to insult with impunity my lord allow me to observe that we men are too hot of temperament to argue or listen coolly with your permission your friend and my friend and i will repair on deck leaving you to hear from your daughter and that lady all that has passed after that my lord i shall be most happy to hear anything which your lordship may please to say upon my word commenced mr stewart mr stewart interrupted cecilia ossulton i request your silence nay more if ever we are again to sail in the same vessel together i insist upon it your lordship will oblige me by enforcing miss ossultons request said mrs lascelles mr stewart was dumbfoundedno wonderto find the ladies siding with the smuggler i am obliged to you ladies for your interference said pickersgill for although i have the means of enforcing conditions i should be sorry to avail myself of them i wait for his lordships reply lord b was very much surprised he wished for an explanation he bowed with hauteur everybody appeared to be in a false position even he lord b somehow or another had bowed to a smuggler pickersgill and stewart went on deck walking up and down crossing each other without speaking but reminding you of two dogs who are both anxious to fight but have been restrained by the voice of their masters corbett followed and talked in a low tone to pickersgill stewart went over to leeward to see if the boat was still alongside but it had long before returned to the yacht miss ossulton had heard her brothers voice but did not come out of the aftercabin she wished to be magnificent and at the same time she was not sure whether all was right phoebe having informed her that there was nobody with her brother and mr stewart and that the smugglers still had the command of the vessel after a while pickersgill and corbett went down forward and returned dressed in the smugglers clothes when they resumed their walk on deck in the mean time it was dark the cutter flew along the coast and the needles lights were on the larboard bow the conversation between cecilia mrs lascelles and her father was long when all had been detailed and the conduct of pickersgill duly represented lord b acknowledged that by attacking the smuggler he had laid himself open to retaliation that pickersgill had shown a great deal of forbearance in every instance and after all had he not gone on board the yacht she might have been lost with only three seamen on board he was amused with the smuggling and the fright of his sister still more with the gentlemen being sent to cherbourg and much consoled that he was not the only one to be laughed at he was also much pleased with pickersgills intention of leaving the yacht safe in cowes harbour his respect for the property on board and his conduct to the ladies on the whole he felt grateful to pickersgill and where there is gratitude there is always good will but who can he be said mrs lascelles his name he acknowledges not to be pickersgill and he told me confidentially that he was of good family confidentially my dear mrs lascelles said lord b oh yes we are both his confidants are we not cecilia upon my honour mrs lascelles this smuggler appears to have made an impression which many have attempted in vain mrs lascelles did not reply to the remark but said now my lord you must decideand i trust you will to oblige us treat him as he has treated us with the greatest respect and kindness why should you suppose otherwise replied lord b it is not only my wish but my interest so to do he may take us over to france tonight or anywhere else has he not possession of the vessel yes replied cecilia but we flatter ourselves that we have the command shall we call him down papa ring for maddox maddox tell mr pickersgill who is on deck that i wish to speak with him and shall be obliged by his stepping down into the cabin who my lord what him yes him replied cecilia laughing must i call him my lord now miss you may do as you please maddox but recollect he is still in possession of the vessel replied cecilia then with your lordships permission i will its the safest way the smuggler entered the cabin the ladies started as he appeared in his rough costume with his throat open and his loose black handkerchief he was the beau ideal of a handsome sailor your lordship wishes to communicate with me mr pickersgill i feel that you have had cause of enmity against me and that you have behaved with forbearance i thank you for your considerate treatment of the ladies and i assure you that i feel no resentment for what has passed my lord i am quite satisfied with what you have said and i only hope that in future you will not interfere with a poor smuggler who may be striving by a life of danger and privation to procure subsistence for himself and perhaps his family i stated to these ladies my intention of anchoring the yacht this night at cowes and leaving her as soon as she was in safety your unexpected presence will only make this difference which is that i must previously obtain your lordships assurance that those with you will allow me and my men to quit her without molestation after we have performed this service i pledge you my word mr pickersgill and thank you into the bargain i trust you will allow me to offer some remuneration most certainly not my lord at all events mr pickersgill if at any other time i can be of service you may command me pickersgill made no reply surely mr pickersgill pickersgill how i hate that name said the smuggler musing i beg your lordships pardonif i may require your assistance for any of my unfortunate companions not for yourself mr pickersgill said mrs lascelles madam i smuggle no more for the pleasure i feel in hearing that resolution mr pickersgill said cecilia take my hand and thanks and mine said mrs lascelles half crying and mine too said lord b rising up pickersgill passed the back of his hand across his eyes turned round and left the cabin im so happy said mrs lascelles bursting into tears hes a magnificent fellow observed lord b come let us all go on deck you have not seen my aunt papa true ill go in to her and then follow you the ladies went upon deck cecilia entered into conversation with mr stewart giving him a narrative of what had happened mrs lascelles sat abaft at the taffrail with her pretty hand supporting her cheek looking very much a la juliette mrs lascelles said pickersgill before we part allow me to observe that it is you who have induced me to give up my profession why me mr pickersgill you said that you did not like it mrs lascelles felt the force of the compliment you said just now that you hated the name of pickersgill why do you call yourself so it was my smuggling name mrs lascelles and now that you have left off smuggling pray what may be the name we are to call you by i cannot resume it till i have not only left this vessel but shaken hands with and bid farewell to my companions and by that time mrs lascelles i shall be away from you but ive a great curiosity to know it and a ladys curiosity must be gratified you must call upon me some day and tell it me here is my address pickersgill received the card with a low bow and lord b coming on deck mrs lascelles hastened to meet him the vessel was now passing the bridge at the needles and the smuggler piloted her on as soon as they were clear and well inside the whole party went down into the cabin lord b requesting pickersgill and corbett to join him in a parting glass mr stewart who had received the account of what had passed from cecilia was very attentive to pickersgill and took an opportunity of saying that he was sorry that he had said or done anything to annoy him every one recovered his spirits and all was good humour and mirth because miss ossulton adhered her resolution of not quitting the cabin till she could quit the yacht at ten oclock the yacht was anchored pickersgill took his leave of the honourable company and went in his boat with his men and lord b was again in possession of his vessel although he had not ships company maddox recovered his usual tone and the cook flourished his knife swearing that he should like to see the smuggler who would again order him to dress cutlets a lombre chinoise the yacht had remained three days at cowes when lord b received a letter from pickersgill stating that the men of his vessel had been captured and would be condemned in consequence of their having the gentlemen on board who were bound to appear against them to prove that they had sunk the brandy lord b paid all the recognisances and the men were liberated for want of evidence it was about two years after this that cecilia ossulton who was sitting at her worktable in deep mourning for her aunt was presented with a letter by the butler it was from her friend mrs lascelles informing her that she was married again to a mr davenant and
