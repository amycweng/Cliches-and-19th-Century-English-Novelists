valerie by captain marryat this book was the last one that marryat was working on in his last days it is unusual for him in that the story concerned the life of a lady whereas he normally wrote about the roughandtumble of life aboard ship there is a preface which explains more about the way in which this book was conceived and written it was completed by someone whom i think may well have been marryats wife there are some interesting episodes particularly the way in which the young lionel is raised from being a junior servant to regain an estate which is rightfully his what is not so easy to cope with these days is the quantity of reported speech in the last few chapters but try it and see how you get on valerie by captain marryat preface on august marryat wrote to mrs s a lady for whom to the time of his death he retained the highest sentiments of friendship and esteem i really wish you would write your confessions i will publish them i have a beautiful opening in some memoranda i have made of the early life of a frenchwoman that is up to the age of seventeen when she is cast adrift upon the world and i would work it all up together let us commence and divide the tin it is better than doing nothing i have been helping ainsworth in the new monthly and i told him that i had commenced a work called mademoiselle virginie which he might perhaps have without my knowing it he has announced its coming forth but it does not follow that he is to have it nevertheless and indeed he now wishes me to continue one the privateersman that i have already begun in the magazine however mrs s with whom at one time washington irving also wished to collaborate declined the offer and mademoiselle virginie was ultimately published in the new monthly under the title of valerie the first eleven chapters appeared in the magazine and the remaining pages were addedaccording to the life and letters of captain marryatby another hand when it came out in book form there are two special features in valerie beyond its actual merits that inevitably excite our attention it is marryats last work and the only one in which the interest centres entirely on women for this reason and from the eighteenth century flavour in some of its characters the book inevitably recalls miss burney and her littleread the wanderer in which as in valerie a proud and sensitive girl is thrown on the world and discoversby bitter experience as governess companion and music mistressthe sneer that lurks beneath the smile of fashion and prosperity the subject is well handled on the old familiar lines and supplies the groundwork of an eminently readable story peopled by many lifelike humours and an attractive spirited heroine the adventures of valerie are various and wellsustained her bearing throughout secures the readers sympathy and he is conscious of a genuine pleasure in her ultimate prosperity and happiness valerie an autobiography is here reprinted from the first edition in two volumes henry colburn rbj after marryats death a fragment of a story for the juvenile library was found in his desk and has been published in the life and letters by florence marryat it describes the experience of a man who like marryat himself was compelled by the failure of speculations to live in the country and manage his own estate it was projected because few young people have any knowledge of farming and there are no books written by which any knowledge of it may be imparted to children marryat himself was not a very successful farmer but probably his theory was in advance of his practice chapter one i have titled these pages with nothing more than my baptismal name if the reader finds sufficient interest in them to read to the end he will discover the position that i am in after an eventful life i shall however not trespass upon his time by making many introductory remarks but commence at once with my birth parentage and education this is necessary as although the two first are perhaps of little comparative consequence still the latter is of importance as it will prepare the reader for many events in my afterlife i may add that much depends upon birth and parentage at all events it is necessary to complete a perfect picture let me therefore begin at the beginning i was born in france my father who was of the ancienne noblesse of france by a younger branch of the best blood and was a most splendid specimen of the outward man was the son of an old officer and an officer himself in the army of napoleon in the conquest of italy he had served in the ranks and continuing to follow napoleon through all his campaigns had arrived to the grade of captain of cavalry he had distinguished himself on many occasions was a favourite of the emperors wore the cross of the legion of honour and was considered in a fair way to rapid promotion when he committed a great error during the time that his squadron was occupying a small german town situated on the river erbach called deux ponts he saw my mother fell desperately in love and married there was some excuse for him for a more beautiful woman than my mother i never beheld moreover she was highly talented and a most perfect musician of a good family and with a dower by no means contemptible the reader may say that in marrying such a woman my father could hardly be said to have committed a very great error this is true the error was not in marrying but in allowing his wifes influence over him to stop his future advancement he wished to leave her with her father and mother until the campaign was over she refused to be left and he yielded to her wishes now napoleon had no objection to his officers being married but a very great dislike to their wives accompanying the army and this was the fault which my father committed and which lost him the favour of his general my mother was too beautiful a woman not to be noticed and immediately inquired about and the knowledge soon came to napoleons ears and militated against my fathers future advancement during the first year of their marriage my eldest brother auguste was born and shortly afterwards my mother promised an increase to the family which was the occasion of great satisfaction to my father who now that he had been married more than a year would at times look at my mother and beautiful as she was calculate in his mind whether the possession of her was indemnification sufficient for the loss of the brigade which she had cost him to account for my fathers satisfaction i must acquaint the reader with circumstances which are not very well known as i before observed napoleon had no objection to marriage because he required men for his army and because he required men and not women he thought very poorly of a married couple who produced a plurality of girls if on the contrary a woman presented her husband with six or seven boys if he was an officer in the army he was certain of a pension for life now as my mother had commenced with a boy and it is well known that there is every chance of a woman continuing to produce the sex which first makes its appearance she was much complimented and congratulated by the officers when she so soon gave signs of an increase and they prophesied that she would by her fruitfulness in a few years obtain a pension for her husband my father hoped so and thought that if he had lost the brigade he would be indemnified by the pension my mother was certain of it and declared it was a boy but prophesies hopes and declarations were all falsified and overthrown by my unfortunate appearance the disappointment of my father was great but he bore it like a man my mother was not only disappointed but indignant she felt mortified after all her declarations that i should have appeared and disproved them she was a woman of violent temper a discovery which my father made too late to me as the cause of her humiliation and disappointment she took an aversion which only increased as i grew up and which as will be hereafter shown was the main spring of all my vicissitudes in afterlife surely there is an error in asserting that there is no feeling so strong as maternal love how often do we witness instances like mine in which disappointed vanity ambition or interest have changed this love into deadly hate my father who felt the inconvenience of my mother accompanying him on forced marches and who perhaps being disappointed in his hopes of a pension thought that he might as well recover the emperors favour and look for the brigade now proposed that my mother should return with her two children to her parents this my mother who had always gained the upperhand positively refused to accede to she did however allow me and my brother auguste to be sent to her parents care at deux ponts and there we remained while my father followed the fortunes of the emperor and my mother followed the fortunes of my father i have little or no recollection of my maternal grandfather and grandmother i remember that i lived with them as i remained there with my brother till i was seven years old at which period my paternal grandmother offered to receive my brother and me and take charge of our education this offer was accepted and we both went to luneville where she resided i have said that my paternal grandmother offered to receive us and not my paternal grandfather who was still alive such was the case as could he have had his own way he would not have allowed us to come to luneville for he had a great dislike to children but my grandmother had property of her own independent of her husband and she insisted upon our coming very often after we had been received into her house i would hear remonstrance on his part relative to the expense of keeping us and the reply of my grandmother which would be eh bien monsieur chatenoeuf cest mon argent que je depense i must describe monsieur chatenoeuf as i before stated he had been an officer in the french army but had now retired upon his pension with the rank of major and decorated with the legion of honour at the time that i first saw him he was a tall elegant old man with hair as white as silver i heard it said that when young he was considered one of the bravest and handsomest officers in the french army he was very quiet in his manners spoke very little and took a large quantity of snuff he was egotistic to excess attending wholly to himself and his own comforts and it was because the noise of children interfered with his comfort that he disliked them so much we saw little of him and cared less if i came into his room when he was alone he promised me a good whipping i therefore avoided him as much as i could the association was not pleasant luneville is a beautiful town in the department of meurthe the castle or rather palace is a very splendid and spacious building in which formerly the dukes of lorraine held their court it was afterwards inhabited by king stanislaus who founded a military school a library and a hospital the palace was a square building with a handsome facade facing the town and in front of it there was a fountain there was a large square in the centre of the palace and behind it an extensive garden which was well kept up and carefully attended to one side of the palace was occupied by the officers of the regiments quartered in luneville the opposite side by the soldiery and the remainder of the building was appropriated to the reception of old retired officers who had been pensioned it was in this beautiful building that my grandfather and grandmother were established for the remainder of their lives except the tuileries i know of no palace in france equal to that of luneville here it was that at seven years old i took up my quarters and it is from that period that i have always dated my existence i have described my grandfather and my residence but now i must introduce my grandmother my dear excellent grandmother whom i loved so much when she was living and whose memory i shall ever revere in person she was rather diminutive but although sixty years of age she still retained her figure which was remarkably pretty and she was as straight as an arrow never had age pressed more lightly upon the human frame for strange to say her hair was black as jet and fell down to her knees it was considered a great curiosity and she was not a little proud of it for there was not a grey hair to be seen although she had lost many of her teeth her skin was not wrinkled but had a freshness most remarkable in a person so advanced in years her mind was as young as her body she was very witty and coquettish and the officers living in the palace were continually in her apartments preferring her company to that of younger women partial to children she would join in all our sports and sit down to play hunt the slipper with us and our young companions but with all her vivacity she was a strictly moral and religious woman she could be lenient to indiscretion and carelessness but any deviation from truth and honesty on the part of my brother or myself was certain to be visited with severe punishment she argued that there could be no virtue where there was deceit which she considered as the hotbed from which every vice would spring out spontaneously that truth was the basis of all that was good and noble and that every other branch of education was comparatively speaking of no importance and without truth of no value she was right my brother and i were both sent to dayschools the maid catherine always took me to school after breakfast and came to fetch me home about four oclock in the afternoon those were happy times with what joy i used to return to the palace bounding into my grandmothers apartment on the ground floor sometimes to frighten her leaping in at the window and dropping at her feet the old lady scolding and laughing at the same time my grandmother was as i observed religious but she was not a devotee the great object was to instil into me a love of truth and in this she was indefatigable when i did wrong it was not the fault i had committed which caused her concern it was the fear that i should deny it which worried and alarmed her to prevent this the old lady had a curious methodshe dreamed for my benefit if i had done wrong and she suspected me she would not accuse me until she had made such inquiries as convinced her that i was the guilty person and then perhaps the next morning she would say as i stood by her side valerie i had a dream last night i cant get it out of my head i dreamt that my little girl had forgotten her promise to me and when she went to the storeroom had eaten a large piece of the cake she would fix her eyes upon me as she narrated the events of her dream and as she proceeded my face would be covered with blushes and my eyes cast down in confusion i dared not look at her and by the time that she had finished i was down on my knees with my face buried in her lap if my offence was great i had to say my prayers and implore the divine forgiveness and was sent to prison that is locked up for a few hours in my bedroom catherine the maid had been many years with my grandmother and was to a certain degree a privileged person at all events she considered herself warranted in giving her opinion and grumbling as much as she pleased and such was invariably the case whenever i was locked up toujours en prison cette pauvre petite it is too bad madam you must let her out my grandmother would quietly reply catherine you are a good woman but you understand nothing about the education of children sometimes however she obtained the key from my grandmother and i was released sooner than was originally intended the fact is that being put in prison was a very heavy punishment as it invariably took place in the evenings after my return from school so that i lost my playhours there were a great many officers with their wives located in the palace and of course no want of playmates the girls used to go to the bosquet which adjoined the gardens of the palace collect flowers and make a garland which they hung on a rope stretched across the courtyard of the palace as the day closed in the party from each house or apartments rather brought out a lantern and having thus illuminated our ballroom by subscription the boys and girls danced the ronde and other games until it was bedtime as the window of my bedroom looked out upon the court whenever i was put into prison i had the mortification of witnessing all these joyous games without being permitted to join in them to prove the effect of my grandmothers system of dreaming upon me i will narrate a circumstance which occurred my grandfather had a landed property about four miles from luneville a portion of this land was let to a farmer and the remainder he farmed on his own account and the produce was consumed in the housekeeping from this farm we received milk butter cheese all kinds of fruit and indeed everything which a farm produces in that part of france they have a method of melting down and clarifying butter for winter use instead of salting it this not only preserves it but to most people makes it more palatable at all events i can answer for myself for i was inordinately fond of it there were eighteen or twenty jars of it in the storeroom which were used up in rotation i dared not take any out of the jar in use as i should be certain to be discovered so i went to the last jar and by my repeated assaults upon it it was nearly empty before my grandmother discovered it as usual she had a dream she commenced with counting over the number of jars of butter and how she opened such a one and it was full and then the next and it was full but before her dream was half over and while she was still a long way from the jar which i had despoiled i was on my knees telling her the end of the dream of my own accord for i could not bear the suspense of having all the jars examined from that time i generally made a full confession before the dream was ended but when i was about nine years old i was guilty of a very heavy offence which i shall narrate on account of the peculiar punishment which i received and which might be advantageously pursued by the parents of the present day who may happen to cast their eyes over these memoirs it was the custom for the children of the officers who lived in the palace that is the girls to club together occasionally that they might have a little fete in the garden of the palace it was a sort of picnic to which every one contributed some would bring cakes some fruit some would bring money a few sous to purchase bonbons or anything else which might be agreed upon on those occasions my grandmother invariably gave me fruit a very liberal allowance of apples and pears from the storeroom for we had plenty from the orchard of the farm but one day one of the elder girls told me that they had plenty of fruit and that i must bring some money i asked my grandmother but she refused me and then this girl proposed that i should steal some from my grandfather i objected but she ridiculed my objections and pressed me until she overcame my scruples and i consented but when i left her after she had obtained my promise i was in a sad state i knew it was wicked to steal and the girl had taken care to point out to me how wicked it was to break a promise i did not know what to do all that evening i was in such a state of feverish excitement that my grandmother was quite astonished the fact was that i was ashamed to retract my promise and yet i trembled at the deed that i was about to do i went into my room and got into bed i remained awake and about midnight i got up and creeping softly into my grandfathers room i went to his clothes which were on a chair and rifled his pockets oftwo sous having effected my purpose i retired stealthily and gained my own room what my feelings were when i was again in bed i cannot well describethey were horriblei could not shut my eyes for the remainder of the night and the next morning i made my appearance haggard pale and trembling it proved however that my grandfather who was awake had witnessed the theft in silence and informed my grandmother of it before i went to school my grandmother called me in to her for i had avoided her come here valerie said she i have had a dreama most dreadful dreamit was about a little girl who in the middle of the night crept into her grandfathers room i could bear no more i threw myself on the floor and in agony screamed out yes grandmamma and stole two sous a paroxysm of tears followed the confession and for more than an hour i remained on the floor hiding my face and sobbing my grandmother allowed me to remain thereshe was very much annoyedi had committed a crime of the first magnitudemy punishment was severe i was locked up in my room for ten days but this was the smallest portion of the punishment every visitor that came in i was sent for and on my making my appearance my grandmother would take me by the hand and leading me up would formally present me to the visitors permettez madame ou monsieur que je vous presente mademoiselle valerie qui est enfermee dans sa chambre pour avoir vole deux sous de son grandpere oh the shame the mortification that i felt this would take place at least ten times a day and each succeeding presentation was followed by a burst of tears as i was again led back to my chamber severe as this punishment was the effect of it was excellent i would have endured martyrdom after what i had gone through before i would have taken what was not my own it was a painful but a judicious and most radical cure for five years i remained under the care of this most estimable woman and under her guidance had become a truthful and religious girl and i may conscientiously add that i was as innocent as a lambbut a change was at hand the emperor had been hurled from his throne and was shut up on a barren rock and soon great alterations were made in the french army my fathers regiment of huzzars had been disbanded and he was now appointed to a dragoon regiment which was ordered to luneville he arrived with my mother and a numerous family she having presented him with seven more children so that with auguste and me he had now nine children i may as well here observe that my mother continued to add yearly to the family till she had fourteen in all and out of these there were seven boys so that had the emperor remained on the throne of france my father would certainly have secured the pension the arrival of my family was a source both of pleasure and pain to me i was most anxious to see all my brothers and sisters and my heart yearned towards my father and mother although i had no recollection of them but i was fearful that i should be removed from my grandmothers care and she was equally alarmed at the chance of our separation unfortunately for me it turned out as we had anticipated my mother was anything but gracious to my grandmother notwithstanding the obligations she was under to her and very soon took an opportunity of quarrelling with her the cause of the quarrel was very absurd and proved that it was predetermined on the part of my mother my grandmother had some curious old carved furniture which my mother coveted and requested my grandmother to let her have it this my grandmother would not consent to and my mother took offence at her refusal i and my brother were immediately ordered home my mother asserting that we had been both very badly brought up and this was all the thanks that my grandmother received for her kindness to us and defraying all our expenses for five years i had not been at home more than a week when my fathers regiment was ordered to nance but during this short period i had sufficient to convince me that i should be very miserable my mothers dislike to me which i have referred to before now assumed the character of positive hatred and i was very illtreated i was employed as a servant and as nurse to the younger children and hardly a day passed without my feeling the weight of her hand we set off for nance and i thought my heart would break as i quitted the arms of my grandmother who wept over me my father was very willing to leave me with my grandmother who promised to leave her property to me but this offer in my favour enraged my mother still more she declared that i should not remain and my father had long succumbed to her termagant disposition and yielded implicit obedience to her authority it was lamentable to see such a fine soldierlike man afraid even to speak before this woman but he was completely under her thraldom and never dared to contradict as soon as we were settled in the barracks at nance my mother commenced her system of persecution in downright earnest i had to make all the beds wash the children carry out the baby and do every menial office for my brothers and sisters who were encouraged to order me about i had very good clothes which had been provided me by my grandmother they were all taken away and altered for my younger sisters but what was still more mortifying all my sisters had lessons in music dancing and other accomplishments from various masters whose instructions i was not permitted to take advantage of although there would have been no addition to the expense oh my father cried i why is thiswhat have i doneam not i your daughteryour eldest daughter i will speak to your mother replied he and he did venture to do so but by so doing he raised up such a tempest that he was glad to drop the subject and apologise for an act of justice poor man he could do no more than pity me i well remember my feelings at that time i felt that i could love my mother love her dearly if she would have allowed me so to do i had tried to obtain her goodwill but i received nothing in return but blows and at last i became so alarmed when in her presence that i almost lost my reason my ears were boxed till i could not recollect where i was and i became stupefied with fear all i thought of all my anxiety at last was to get out of the room where my mother was my terror was so great that her voice made me tremble and at the sight of her i caught my breath and gasped from alarm my brother auguste was very nearly as much an object of dislike to my mother as i was chiefly because he had been brought up by my grandmother and moreover because he would take my part the great favourite of my mother was my second brother nicolas he was a wonderful musician could play upon any instrument and the most difficult music at sight this talent endeared him to my mother who was herself a firstrate musician he was permitted to order me about just as he pleased and if i did not please him to beat me without mercy and very often my mother would fly at me and assist him but auguste took my part and nicolas received very severe chastisement from him but this did not help me on the contrary if auguste interfered in my behalf my mother would pounce upon me and i may say that i was stunned with her blows auguste appealed to his father but he dared not interfere he was coward enough to sit by and see his daughter treated in this way without remonstrance and in a short time i was fast approaching to what my mother declared me to bea perfect idiot i trust that my own sex will not think me a renegade when i say that if ever there was a proof that woman was intended by the creator to be subject to man it is that once place power in the hands of woman and there is not one out of a hundred who will not abuse it we hear much of the rights of woman and their wrongs but this is certain that in a family as in a state there can be no divided ruleno equality one must be master and no family is so badly managed or so badly brought up as where the law of nature is reversed and we contemplate that most despicable of all lusi naturaea henpecked husband to proceed the consequence of my mothers treatment was to undermine in me all the precepts of my worthy grandmother i was a slave and a slave under the continual influence of fear cannot be honest the fear of punishment produced deceit to avoid it even my brother auguste from his regard and pity for me would fall into the same error valerie he would say running out to me as i was coming home with my little brother in my arms your mother will beat you on your return you must say so and so this so and so was of course an untruth and in consequence my fibs were so awkward and accompanied by so much hesitation and blushing that i was invariably found out and then punished for what i did not deserve to be and when my mother obtained such triumphant proof against me she did not fail to make the most of it with my father who by degrees began to consider that my treatment was merited and that i was a bad and deceitful child my only happiness was to be out in the open air away from my mothers presence and this was only to be obtained when i was ordered out with my little brother pierre whom i had to carry as soon as i had done the household work if pierre was fractious my mother would order me out of the house with him immediately this i knew and i used to pinch the poor child to make him cry that i might gain my object and be sent away so that to duplicity i added cruelty six months before this had any one told me that i ever would be guilty of such a thing with what indignation i should have denied it although my mother flattered herself that it was only in her own domestic circle that her unnatural conduct towards me was known such was not the case and the treatment which i received from her was the occasion of much sympathy on the part of the officers and their wives who were quartered in the barracks some of them ventured to remonstrate with my father for his consenting to it but although he was cowed by a woman he had no fear of men and as he told them candidly that any future interference in his domestic concerns must be answered by the sword no more was said to him on the subject strange that a man should risk his life with such indifference rather than remedy an evil and yet be under such thraldom to a womanthat one who was always distinguished in action as the most forward and the most brave should be a trembling coward before an imperious wife but this is a world of sad contradictions there was a lady in the barracks wife to one of the superior officers who was very partial to me she had a daughter a very sweet girl who was also named valerie when i could escape from the house i used to be constantly with them and when i saw my namesake caressing and caressed in the arms of her mother as i was sitting by on a stool the tears would run down at the thoughts that such pleasure was debarred from me why do you cry valerie oh madam why have i not a mother like your valerie why am i to be beat instead of being caressed and fondled like her what have i donebut she is not my motherim sure she cannot bei will never believe it and such had really become my conviction and in consequence i never would address her by the title of mother this my mother perceived and it only added to her illwill only permit any one feeling or passion to master youallow it to increase by never being in the slightest degree checked and it is horrible to what an excess it will carry you about this time my mother proved the truth of the above observation by saying to me as she struck me to the ground ill kill you cried she and then catching her breath said in a low determined tone oh i only wish that i dared chapter two one day a short time after this i was walking out as usual with my little brother pierre in my arms i was deep in thought in imagination i was at luneville with my dear grandmother when my foot slipped and i fell in trying to save my brother i hurt myself very much and he poor child was unfortunately very much hurt as well as myself he cried and moaned piteously and i did all that i could to console him but he was in too much pain to be comforted i remained out for an hour or two not daring to go home but the evening was closing in and i returned at last the child who could not yet speak still moaned and cried and i told the truth as to the cause of it my mother flew at me and i received such chastisement that i could be patient no longer and i pushed my mother from me i was felled to the ground and left there bleeding profusely after a time i rose up and crawled to bed i reflected upon all i had suffered and made up my mind that i would no longer remain under my fathers roof at daybreak i dressed myself hastened out of the barracks and set off for luneville which was fifteen miles distant i had gained about half the way when i was met by a soldier of the regiment who had once been our servant i tried to avoid him but he recognised me i then begged him not to interfere with me and told him that i was running away to my grandmothers jacques for that was his name replied that i was right and that he would say nothing about it but mademoiselle continued he you will be tired before you get to luneville and may have a chance of a conveyance if you have money to pay for it he then slipped a fivefranc piece into my hand and left me to pursue my way i continued my journey and at last arrived at the farm belonging to my grandfather which i have before mentioned as being about four miles from the town i was afraid to go direct to luneville on account of my grandfather who i knew from motives of parsimony would be unwilling to receive me i told my history to the farmers wife showing her my face covered with bruises and scars and entreated her to go to my grandmothers and tell her where i was she put me to bed and the next morning set off for luneville and acquainted my grandmother with the circumstances the old lady immediately ordered her charabanc and drove out for me there was proof positive of my mothers cruelty and the good old woman shed tears over me when she had pulled off the humble blue cotton dress which i wore and examined my wounds and bruises when we arrived at luneville we met with much opposition from my grandfather but my grandmother was resolute since you object to my receiving her in the house said she at all events you cannot prevent my doing my duty towards her and doing as i please with my own money i shall therefore send her to school and pay her expenses as soon as new clothes could be made for me i was sent to the best pension in luneville shortly afterwards my father arrived he had been despatched by my mother to reclaim me and bring me back with him but he found the tide too strong against him and my grandmother threatened to appeal to the authorities and make an exposure this he knew would be a serious injury to his character and he was therefore compelled to go back without me and i remained a year and a half at the pension very happy and improving very fast in my education and my personal appearance but i was not destined to be so happy long true it was that during this year and a half of tranquillity and happiness the feelings created by my mothers treatment had softened down and all animosity had long been discarded but i was too happy to want to return home again at the expiration of this year and a half my fathers regiment was again ordered to shift their quarters to a small town the name of which i now forget but luneville lay in their route my mother had for some time ceased to importune my father about my return the fact was that she had been so coldly treated by the other ladies at nance in consequence of her behaviour to me that she did not think it advisable but now that they were about to remove she insisted upon my father taking me with him promising that i should be welltreated and have the same instruction as my sisters in fact she promised everything acknowledging to my grandmother that she had been too hasty to me and was very sorry for it even my brother auguste thought that she was now sincere and my father my brother and even my dear grandmother persuaded me to consent my mother was now very kind and affectionate towards me and as i really wanted to love her i left the pension and accompanied the family to their new quarters but this was all treachery on the part of my mother regardless of my advantage as she had shown herself on every occasion she had played her part that she might have an opportunity of discharging an accumulated debt of revenge which had been heaped up in consequence of the slights she had received from other people on account of her treatment of me we had hardly been settled in our new abode before my mother burst out again with a virulence which exceeded all her former cruelty but i was no longer the frightened victim that i had been i complained to my father and insisted upon justice but that was useless my brother auguste now took my part in defiance of his father and it was one scene of continual family discord i had made many friends and used to remain at their houses all day as for doing household work notwithstanding her blows i refused it one morning my mother was chastising me severely when my brother auguste who was dressed in his hussar uniform came in and hastened to my assistance interposing himself between us my mothers rage was beyond all bounds wretch cried she would you strike your mother no replied he but i will protect my sister you barbarous woman why do you not kill her at once it would be a kindness it was after this scene that i resolved that i would again return to luneville i did not confide my intentions to anyone not even to auguste there was a great difficulty in getting out of the front door without being perceived and my bundle would have created suspicion by the back of the house the only exit was through a barred window i was then fourteen years old but very slight in figure i tried if my head would pass through the bars and succeeding i soon forced my body through and seizing my bundle made all haste to the diligence office i found that it was about to start for luneville which was more than half a days journey distant i got in very quickly and the conducteur knowing me thought that all was right and the diligence drove off there were two people in the coupe with me an officer and his wife before we had proceeded far they asked me where i was going i replied to my grandmothers at luneville thinking it however strange that i should be unaccompanied they questioned until they extracted the whole history from me the lady wished me to come to her on a visit but the husband more prudent said that i was better under the care of my grandmother about midday we stopped to change horses at an auberge called the louis dor about a quarter of a mile from luneville here i alighted without offering any explanation to the conducteur but as he knew me and my grandmother well that was of no consequence my reason for alighting was that the diligence would have put me down at the front of the palace where i was certain to meet my grandfather who passed the major portion of the day there basking on one of the seats and i was afraid to see him until i had communicated with my grandmother i had an uncle in the town and i had been very intimate with my cousin marie who was a pretty kindhearted girl and i resolved that i would go there and beg her to go to my grandmother the difficulty was how to get to the house without passing the front of the palace or even the bridge across the river at last i decided that i would walk down by the river side until i was opposite to the bosquet which adjoined the garden of the palace and there wait till it was low water when i knew that the river could be forded as i had often seen others do so when i arrived opposite to the bosquet i sat down on my bundle by the banks of the river for two or three hours watching the long feathery weeds at the bottom which moved gently from one side to the other with the current of the stream as soon as it was low water i pulled off my shoes and stockings put them into my bundle and raising my petticoats i gained the opposite shore without difficulty i then replaced my shoes and stockings crossed the bosquet and gained my uncles house my uncle was not at home but i told my story and showed my bruises to marie who immediately put on her bonnet and went to my grandmother that night i was again installed in my own little bedroom and most gratefully did i pray before i went to sleep this time my grandmother took more decided steps she went to the commandant of the town taking me with her pointing out the treatment which i had received and claiming his protection she stated that she had educated me and brought me up and that she had a claim upon me my mothers treatment of me was so notorious that the commandant immediately decided that my grandmother had a right to detain me and when my father came a day or two after to take me back he was ordered home by the commandant with a severe rebuke and the assurance that i should not return to a father who could permit such cruelty and injustice i was now once more happy but as i remained in the house my grandfather was continually vexing my grandmother on my account nevertheless i remained there more than a year during which i learnt a great deal particularly lacework and fine embroidery at which i became very expert but now there was another opposition raised which was on the part of my uncle who joined my grandfather in annoying the old lady the fact was that when i was not there my grandmother was very kind and generous to my cousin marie who certainly deserved it but now that i was again with her all her presents and expenses were lavished upon me and poor marie was neglected my uncle was not pleased at this he joined my grandfather and they pointed out that i was now more than fifteen and my mother dare not beat me and as my father was continually writing for me to return it was her duty not to oppose between the two my poor grandmother was so annoyed and perplexed that she hardly knew what to do they made her miserable and at last they worried her into consenting that i should return to my family which had now removed to colmar i did not know this it was my grandmothers birthday i had worked for her a beautiful sachet in lace and embroidery which with a large bouquet i brought to her as a present the old lady folded me in her arms and burst into tears she then told me that we must part and that i must return to my fathers had a dagger been thrust to my heart i could not have received more anguish yes dear valerie continued she you must leave me tomorrow i can no longer prevent it i have not the health and spirits that i had i am growing oldvery old i did not remonstrate or try to make her alter her decision i knew how much she had been annoyed and worried for my sake and i felt that i would bear everything for hers i cried bitterly the next morning my father made his appearance and embraced me with great affection he was much pleased with my personal improvement i was now fast budding into womanhood although i had the feelings of a mere child i bade farewell to my grandmother and also to my grandfather whom i never saw again as he died three months after i quitted luneville i trust my readers will not think that i dwell too long upon this portion of my life i do it because i consider it is necessary they should know in what manner i was brought up and also the cause of my leaving my family as i afterwards did if i had stated merely that i could not agree with my mother who treated me cruelly they might have imagined that i was not warranted in a moment of irritation in taking such a decided step but when they learn that my persecutions were renewed the moment that i was again in my mothers power and that nothing could conquer her inveteracy against me neither time nor absence nor submission on my part nor remonstrance from others not even a regard for her own character nor the loss of her friends and acquaintances they will then acknowledge that i could have done no otherwise unless i preferred being in daily risk of my life on my arrival at colmar my mother received me graciously but her politeness did not last long i now gave a new cause of offenceone that a woman proud of her beauty and jealous of its decay does not easily forgive i was admired and paid great attention to by the officers much more attention than she received herself m chatenoeuf the officers would say you have begotten a daughter much handsomer than yourself my mother considered this as a polite way to avoid saying that i was much handsomer than she was if she thought so she did herself a great injustice for i could not be compared to what she was when she was of my age she was even then a most splendid matron but i had youth in my favour which is more than half the battle at all events the remarks and attentions of the officers aroused my mothers spleen and she was more harsh in language than ever although i admit that it was but seldom that she resorted to blows i recollect that one day when i was not supposed to be in hearing one of the officers said to another ma foi elle est jolieelle a besoin de deux ans et elle sera parfaite so childish and innocent was i at that time that i could not imagine what they meant why was i to be two years older i thought and puzzled over it till i fell fast asleep the attentions of the officers and the flattery he received from them on my account appeared to have more effect on my father than i could have imagined perhaps he felt that i was somebody to be proud of and his vanity gave him that courage to oppose my mother which his paternal feelings had not roused i recollect one instance particularly there was a great ceremony to be performed in the church no less than the christening of the two new bells previous to their being hoisted up in the belfry the officers told my father that i must be present and on his return home he stated to my mother his intention of taking me with him on the following day to see the ceremony she cant goshe has no clothes fit to wear cried my mother why has she not madame replied my father sternly let her have some ready for tomorrow and without fail my mother perceived that my father was not to be trifled with and therefore thought proper to acquiesce pity it was that he did not use his authority a little more after he had discovered that he could regain it if he pleased on the following day i accompanied my father who was one of the officers on duty in the interior of the church and as he stood in advance of his men i remained at his side and of course had a very complete view of the whole ceremony i was very neatlydressed and my father received many compliments upon my appearance at last the ceremony began the church was lined with troops to keep back the crowd and the procession entered the church the bishop walking under a canopy attended by the priests then the banners and pretty children dressed as angels tossing frankincense from silver censers the two bells were in the centre of the church both of them dressed in white petticoats which covered them completely ornamented with ribbons and a garland of flowers upon the head of eachif i may so designate their tops the godmothers dressed in white as on baptismal ceremonies and the godfathers in court suits stood on each side they had been selected from the elite of the families in the town the organ and the military band relieved each other until the service commenced the bishop read the formula the godmothers and godfathers gave the customary security the holy water was sprinkled over the bells and thus were they regularly baptised one was named eulalie and the other lucile it was a very pretty ceremony and i should have liked to have been present at their premiere communion if it ever took place my english readers may consider this as a piece of mummery at the time i did not as a good catholic which i was at that time and a pretty frenchwoman i thought that nothing could be more correct than the decoration des belles i believe that it has always been the custom to name bellsto consecrate them most certainlyand if we call to mind what an important part they perform in our religion i do not wonder at it by being consecrated they receive the rites of the church why therefore should they not receive the same rites in baptism but why baptise them because they speak to us in many ways and with their loud tongues express the feelings and make known the duties imposed upon us is there cause for the nation to rejoice their merry notes proclaim it from afar in solemn tones they summon us to the house of prayer to the lifting of the host and to the blessing of the priest and it is their mournful notes which announce to us that one of our generation has been summoned away and has quitted this transitory abode their offices are christian offices and therefore are they received into the church chapter three an elder sister of my mothers resided at colmar and i passed most of my time with her during our stay when my fathers regiment was ordered to paris this lady requested that i might remain with her but my mother refused telling her sister that she could not conscientiously as a mother allow any of her daughters to quit her care for any worldly advantage that this was mere hypocrisy the reader will imagine indeed it was fully proved so to be in two hours afterwards by my mother telling my father that if her sister had offered to take clara my second sister she would have consented the fact was that the old lady had promised to dower me very handsomely for she was rich and my mother could not bear any good fortune to come to me we passed through luneville on our road to paris and i saw my dear grandmother for the last time she requested that i might be left with her making the same offer as she did before of leaving me all her property at her death but my mother would not listen to any solicitation now as our family was now fourteen in number she surely might in either of the above instances have well spared me and it would have been a relief to my father but this is certain she would not spare me although she never disguised her dislike and would if she had dared have treated me as she had formerly done i was very anxious to stay with my dear grandmother she had altered very much since my grandfathers death and was evidently breaking up fast but my mother was inexorable we continued our route and arrived at paris where we took up our quarters in the barracks close to the boulevards my mother was as harsh as ever and now recommenced her boxes of the earwhich during the time we were at colmar had but seldom been applied in all my troubles i never was without friends i now made an acquaintance with the wife of the colonel of the regiment who joined us at paris she had no children i imparted all my troubles to her and she used to console me she was a very religious woman and as i had been brought up in the same way by my grandmother she was pleased to find piety in one so young and became much attached to me she had a sister a widow of large fortune who lived in the rue st honore a very pleasant lively woman but very sarcastic when she pleased and not caring what she said if her feelings prompted her i constantly met her at the colonels house and she invited me to come and see her at her own but i knew that my mother would not permit me so i did not ask as the colonel was my fathers superior officer all attempts to break off my intimacy with her which my mother made were unavailing and i passed as usual all my time in any other house except my home i have now to record but two more beatings the reader may think that i have recorded enough already but as these were the two last and they were peculiar i must beg him to allow me so to do the first beating was given me for the following cause a very gentlemanlike young officer in the regiment was very particular in his attentions to me i liked his company but my thoughts had never been directed towards marriage for i was too childish and innocent one morning it appeared that he proposed to my father who immediately gave his consent provided that i was agreeable and this he ventured to do without consulting my mother perhaps he thought it a good opportunity to remove me from my mothers persecution at all events when he made known to her what he had done and requested her to sound me on the subject she was in no pleasant humour when she did so my reply was he being a very darkcomplexioned man although wellfeatured non maman je ne veux pas il est trop noir to my astonishment my mother flew at me and i received such an avalanche of boxes on the ears for this reply that i was glad to make my escape as fast as i could and locked myself up in my own room now i really believe that i was almost a single instance of a young lady having her ears well boxed for refusing to marry a man that she did not care forbut such was my fate the treatment i received in this instance got wind in the barracks and my cause was warmly taken up by every one finding myself thus supported i one day ventured to refuse to do a very menial and unpleasant office and for this refusal i received the second beating it was the last certainly but it was the most severe for my mother caught up a hearthbrush and struck me for several minutes such a succession of severe blows that my face was so disfigured that i was hardly to be recognised my head cut open in several places and the blood pouring down me in every direction at last she left me for dead on the floor after a time i recovered my recollection and when i did so i sprang away from the servants who had been supporting me and with my hair flying in the wind and my face and dress streaming with blood i ran across the barrackyard to the colonels house and entering the room in which she was sitting with her sister sank at her feet choking with the blood which poured out of my mouth who is it exclaimed she springing up in horror and amazement valeriepauvre valerie moaned i with my face on the floor they raised me up sent for the servants took me into a bedroom and sent for the surgeon of the regiment who lived in the barracks as soon as i was somewhat recovered i told them that it was my mothers treatment and i became so excited that as soon as the surgeon had left the house i cried never madam will i again enter my fathers house never while i liveif you do not protect meor if nobody else willif you send me back again i will throw myself in the seine i swear it as i kneel what is to be done sister said the colonels wife i will see at all events valerie i will keep you here a few days till something can be arranged it is now quite dark and you shall stay here and sleep on this bed or the bed of the river replied i i care not if it were that for i should not rise up to misery i have made a vow and i repeat that i never will enter my fathers house again my dear valerie said the colonels wife in a soothing tone leave her to me sister said the other who was busy arranging my hair now that my wounds had stopped bleeding i will talk to her the colonel will be home directly and you must receive him madame allarde for that was the colonels wifes name left the room as soon as she was gone madame dalbret her sister said to me valerie i fear that what you have said you will adhere to and you will throw yourself into the river yes if i am taken back again replied i i hope god will forgive me but i feel i shall for my mind is overthrown and i am not sane at times my poor child you may go back again to your fathers house because my sister and her husband in their position cannot prevent it but believe me you shall not remain there as long as i have a home to offer you shall never want one but you must listen to me i wish to serve you and to punish your unnatural mother and i will do so but valerie you must well weigh circumstances before you decide i say that i can offer you a home but recollect life is uncertain and if it pleases god to summon me you will have a home no longer what will you do thenfor you will never be able to return to your fathers house you are very kind madam replied i but my resolution is formed and i will work for my daily bread in any way that i can rather than return put me but in the way of doing that and i will for ever bless you you shall never work for your bread while i live valerie but if i die you will have to do something for your own support and recollect how friendless you will be and so young can i be more friendless than i am at home madame said i shaking my head mournfully your father deserves punishment for his want of moral courage as well as your mother replied madame dalbret you had better go to bed now and tomorrow give me your decision tomorrow will make no change madame answered i but i fear that there is no chance of my escape tomorrow my father will arrive for me as usual andbut i have said it you may preserve my life madame but how i know not and i threw myself down on the bed in despair chapter four about an hour afterwards madame dalbret who had left me on the bed while she went down to her sister came up again and spoke to me but from weakness occasioned by the loss of blood and from excitement i talked for many minutes in the most incoherent manner and madame dalbret was seriously alarmed in the meantime the colonel had come home and his wife explained what had happened she led him up to my room just at the time that i was raving he took the candle and looked at my swelled features and said i should not have recognised the poor girl mort de ma vie but this is infamous and monsieur de chatenoeuf is a contemptible coward i will see him tomorrow morning the colonel and his wife then left the room by this time i had recovered from my paroxysm madame dalbret came to me and putting her face close to mine said valerie yes madame replied i are you more composed now do you think that you could listen to me yes madame and thankfully replied i well then my plan is this i am sure that the colonel will take you home tomorrow let him do so in the morning i will tell you how to behave tomorrow night you shall escape and i will be with a fiacre at the corner of the street ready to receive you i will take you to my house and no one not even my sister shall know that you are with me they will believe that you have thrown yourself into the seine and as the regiment is ordered to lyons and will leave in ten days or a fortnight there will be no chance if you are concealed till their departure of their knowing that you are alive thank you thank you madame you know not how happy you have made me replied i pressing my hand to my heart which throbbed painfully with joy god bless you madame dalbret oh how i shall pray for you kind madame dalbret madame dalbret shed tears over me after i had done speaking and then wishing me goodnight told me that she would see me in the morning and let me know what was going on and then give me further directions for my conduct she then left me and i tried to go to sleep but i was in too much pain once i did slumber and dreamt that my mother was beating me again i screamed with the pain that the blows gave me and awoke i slept no more that night at daylight i rose and as may be supposed the first thing that i did was to look into the glass i was terrified my face was swelled so that my features were hardly distinguishable one eye was closed up and the blood had oozed out through the handkerchief which had been tied round my head by the surgeon i was indeed an object the servant brought me up some coffee which i drank and then remained till the colonels wife came up to me it was the first and only time that i ever beheld that good woman angry she called from the top of the stairs for her husband to come up he did so looked at me said nothing but went down again about halfanhour afterwards madame dalbret and the surgeon came up together the latter was interrogated by her as to the effects of the injuries i had received and after examination he replied that although it would take some days for the inflammation and marks of the blows to go away yet he did not consider that eventually i should be in any way disfigured this gave me great pleasure as i suspect it would have done any other pretty girl in my situation madame dalbret waited till the surgeon was gone and then gave me some further instructions which i obeyed to the letter she also brought me a black veil in case i had not one of my own she then left me saying that the colonel had sent for my father and that she wished to be present at the interview my father came and the colonel after stating the treatment which i had received loaded him with reproaches told him his conduct was that of a coward to allow his wife to be guilty of such cruelty towards his child then he sent madame dalbret to bring me down when i entered my father started back with surprise he had answered the colonel haughtily but when he beheld the condition i was in he said colonel you are right i deserve all you have said and even more but now do me the favour to accompany me home come valerie my poor child your father begs your pardon as my father took my hand to lead me away madame dalbret said to the colonel my dear allarde do you not incur a heavy responsibility in allowing that girl to go back again you know what she said yesterday yes ma chere i have been told by your sister but it was said in a state of excitement and i have no doubt that kindness will remove all such ideas monsieur de chatenoeuf i am at your orders i never said a word during all this interview madame dalbret tied the black veil round my head and let it fall to conceal my features and i was led home by my father accompanied by the colonel we went into the room where my mother was sitting my father lifted the veil from my face madame said my father in a severe tone do you see the condition to which your barbarity has reduced this poor girl i have brought monsieur allarde here to tell you before him that your conduct has been infamous and that mine has been unpardonable in not having protected her from your cruelty but i now tell you that you have bent the bow till it has broken and your power in this house is ended for ever my mother was so much astonished at this severe rebuke before witnesses that she remained with her mouth open and her eyes staring at last she gave a sort of chuckling laugh madame i am in earnest continued my father and you shall find that in future i command here to your room madame immediately the last word was pronounced in a voice of thunder my mother rose and as she retired burst into a passionate flood of tears the colonel then took his leave saying to my father tenezvous la my father remained a quarter of an hour with me consoling me and blaming himself and promising that in future he would see me done justice to i heard him without reply the tears started in my eyes at his kind expressions but i felt there was no security for his adhering to all he promised and i trembled as i thought so he left me and went out my mother who had been watching as soon as she saw that he had left the house hastened downstairs from her room and came into the one where i was sitting alone so mademoiselle said she panting and apparently striving to contain herself my power in this house is gone for ever and all through you ha ha ha we shall see we shall see dye hear me creature continued she with her clenched hand close to my face no not yet said she after a pause and then she left the room if my fathers kindness had somewhat staggered my resolution this conduct of my mothers confirmed it i felt that she was right in what she said and that in a month she would regain her sway and drive me to desperation during the whole of that day i made no reply to anything that was said to me by my brothers and sisters who came in by stealth to see me in this i followed the advice of madame dalbret and at the same time my own feelings and inclinations the servants who offered me dinner and coaxed me to take some nourishment could not get any answer from me and at last one of them who was a kindhearted girl burst out into tears crying that mademoiselle was folle my father did not come home to dinner my mother remained in her room till he came in in the evening and then he went up to her it wanted but halfanhour of the time that i had agreed to meet madame dalbret i waited that time during which i heard sounds of high altercation above stairs i was quite alone for my mother had prevented the children coming to me and as the clock struck i dropped my veil over my face and quietly walking out of the house made for the rendezvous agreed i found the fiacre with madame dalbret waiting for me and stepping into it i was in a few minutes safely lodged in her splendid comfortable apartments madame dalbret put me in a little cabinet inside of her own room so that no one except one servant whom she could trust knew of my being on the premises there i was left to recover from my bruises and regain if possible my good looks on the following day she repaired to the barracks and remained with her sister till the evening when she returned and came up to me all has happened as i wished said she as she took off her bonnet you are nowhere to be found and they have not the least suspicion that you are here when you were first missed they thought you had returned to the colonels and your father did not think it advisable to make inquiry until the next morning when to his surprise he learnt that you had never been there the dismounted hussar who was sentry during the evening was then examined and he replied that about halfpast eight oclock a young person who by her figure he presumed to be mademoiselle chatenoeuf had gone out of the gates but that she had a thick veil over her face and he could not see it when your father and the colonel had interrogated the man and dismissed him my poor sister burst into tears and said alas alas then she has kept her word and has thrown herself into the seine oh monsieur allarde my sister said you would incur a heavy responsibility by sending that poor girl back and now it has proved but too true poor dear valerie your father and the colonel were almost as much distressed as my sister and it was just at that time that i came in sister cried madame allarde to me valerie has left the barracks what exclaimed i when oh my fear was too true said i clasping my hands and then taking out my handkerchief i covered my face and sobbed i tell you valerie that nothing but my affection for you would have induced me to be so deceitful but under the circumstances i hope i was justified my assumed grief and distress quite removed any suspicion of your being here and shortly afterwards the colonel made a sign to your father and they both left the barracks i have no doubt they went down to the morgue to ascertain if their fears had already been proved correct what is the morgue madame said i do you not know my child it is a small building by the side of the seine where all bodies which are found in the river are laid out for the examination of the friends of those who are missing below the bridges there is a large strong net laid across which receives all the bodies as they are swept away by the tide that is it receives many if not most of them but some are never found again madame allarde did not fail to return to the barracks on the next day and found that a general excitement prevailed not only among the officers but the men my supposed suicide had been made known my father had visited the morgue a second time and the police had been on the search without success my mother dared not even show herself at the window of her apartments and found herself avoided even by her own children as for my father he was half mad and never met her but to load her with reproaches and to curse his own folly in having so long submitted to her imperious will at all events one good has arisen from your supposed death valerie said madame dalbret which is that your father has completely resumed his authority and i do not think will ever yield it up again my poor father replied i shedding tears i feel for him he is certainly to be pitied replied madame dalbret but it is his own conscience which must be his greatest tormentor he was selfish enough not to feel for you during your years of persecution and rather than have his own comforts invaded by domestic brawls for a short period he allowed you to be sacrificed but observe valerie if you have still a wish to return to your parents it is not too late the regiment does not leave paris till next thursday oh no no cried i my mother would kill me dont mention that again madame continued i trembling i will not my child for to tell you the truth you would not appear in so favourable a light if you were now to return you have caused much grief to my sister and husband and they would not receive you with cordiality after having thus trifled with their feelings it would also be a victory for your mother and i doubt not but that in a short time she would again recover that power which for the present she has lost you never can be happy in your family after what has passed and i think that what has been done is for the best your father can well spare one child out of fourteen having little more than a long sword for their support your supposed death will be the cause of your father retaining his lawful authority and preventing any of the remaining children receiving such injustice as you have done and remorse will check if it does not humanise your mother and i trust that the latter will be the case i had well weighed all this in my mind my dear valerie before i made the proposal and i consider still that for your sake and for the sake of others it is better that you should be the sacrifice nevertheless i repeat consult your own feelings and if you repent the step which you have taken there is yet time for you to return my dear madame return i never will unless i am taken by force all i feel is that i should like that my fathers bitter anguish was assuaged by his knowledge of my being still in existence and so should i valerie were it possible that the communication could be made and the same happy results be arrived at but that cannot be unless it should please heaven to summon your mother and then you might safely inform your father of your existence you are right madame yes i think i am valerie for after all your father duly deserves his severe penance which is to visit the morgue every day but painful as is the remedy it is necessary for the cure yes madame replied i sobbing all you say is true but still i cannot help weeping and pitying my poor father not that it alters my determination but i cannot command my feelings your feelings do you honour valerie and i do not blame you for your grief do not however indulge it to excess for that is turning a virtue into a failing there were still three days remaining previous to the departure of the regiment for lyons i was sorely distressed during this time i pictured to myself my fathers remorse and would gladly have hastened to the barracks and thrown myself into his arms but my mothers image rose before me and her last words we shall see if my power is gone for ever rung in my ears her clenched hand was apparently close to my face and then my resolution remained fixed the swelling of my features had now subsided and i had in some degree recovered my good looks still my eye and cheeks were tinged black and yellow in various places and the cuts on my head not quite healed however i was satisfied that the surgeon of the regiment was correct in his assertion that i should not be the least disfigured by the treatment which i had received i have news for you said madame dalbret as she returned from the barracks where she had been to see her sister off on her journey your brother auguste who you know has been away has returned to rejoin his regiment but has since obtained his rank in another which is stationed at brest why has he done so madame do you know have you seen him yes he was at the colonels he stated that he could not remain in the regiment if his mother continued with his father that he should never be able after what had happened to treat his mother with common courtesy still less with the duty of a son and therefore he preferred leaving the regiment and my father madame your father allows him to act as he pleases indeed he feels the force of what your brother says and so does my brotherinlaw who has given his assent as commanding officer to your brothers exchange auguste laments you very much and the poor fellow looks very ill i think he has done right although it is a severe blow to your mother but for her i have no compassion my mother never liked auguste madame no i believe that but what annoys her is the cause of his leaving his regiment as it is open condemnation of her conduct yes i can understand that feeling on her part replied i well valerie i did not return until the regiment was gone and the barracks cleared you know the commandant always goes the last i saw my sister safe off and now i am here to tell you that you are no longer a prisoner but may make yourself comfortable by roving through my apartments but the first affair which we must take in hand is your wardrobe i am rich enough to furnish you so that shall be seen to immediately and valerie dear let me now say once for all what i do not intend to repeat in words but i hope to prove by my actions look upon me as your mother for i have not taken you away from your family without the resolution of supplying as far as i can not the mother you have lost but the mother which in your dreams you have fancied i love you my child for you are deserving of love treat me therefore with that unlimited confidence and affection which your young and pure heart yearns to pour out bless you madame bless you cried i bursting into tears and burying my face in her lap i feel that now i have a mother chapter five for several days i remained quiet in the little antechamber during which madame dalbret had been busy every morning driving in her carriage and ordering me a wardrobe and as the various articles came in i was as much surprised as i was pleased at the taste which had been shown and the expense which must have been incurred my dear madame cried i as each parcel was opened these are much too good for me recollect i am but a poor soldiers daughter you were so replied madame dalbret but you forget continued she kissing my forehead that the poor soldiers daughter was drowned in the seine and you are now the protegee of madame dalbret i have already mentioned to all my friends that i expect a young cousin from gascony whom i have adopted having no children of my own your own name is noble and you may safely retain it as there are no want of chatenoeufs in gascony and there have been former alliances between them and the dalbrets i have no doubt that if i were to refer back to family records that i could prove you to be a cousin some three hundred times removed and that is quite enough as soon as you are quite well and i think in a week all vestiges of your illtreatment will be effaced we will go down to my chateau for a few months and we will return to paris in the season has madame paon been here yes my dear madame she has and has taken my measure for the dresses but dont scold me i must cry a little for i am so happy and so grateful my heart will burst if i do not bless you bless you dear madame little did i think before i saw you that i should ever cry for joy madame dalbret embraced me with much affection and allowed me to give vent to my feelings which i did bedewing her hands with my tears a week afterwards everything was ready and we set off for the chateau in brittany travelling in madame dalbrets postchariot with an avant courier and without regard to expense and now i must make the reader somewhat better acquainted with my kind protectress i little thought at the time that she offered me her protection that she was a personage of such consequence but the fact was that her sister having made a very inferior match to her own she out of delicacy while the colonel and his wife were at paris avoided anything like state in paying them a visit and i supposed that she was much in the same rank and society as they were but such was not the case madame dalbret had married into one of the highest and most noble families of france her husband had died three years after their marriage and having no children had left her a large revenue entirely at her own disposal during her life and wishing her to marry again had the property entailed upon her children if she had any if not after her death it was to go to a distant brand of the dalbret family i was informed that her income amounted to livres per annum besides her chateau in the country and the hotel in the rue st honore which belonged to her although she only occupied a portion of it her husband had now been dead more than ten years and madame dalbret had not been persuaded by her numerous suitors to marry again she was still handsome about thirtyfour years of age and i hardly need say was in the very best society in paris such was the person who came to the barracks in so unassuming a manner and whose protection i was so fortunate as to obtain i could dwell long upon the happy days that i passed at the chateau there was no want of society and the reunions were charming and being in the country i was allowed to join them having been formally introduced by madame dalbret to all her visitors as her cousin my time was fully occupied madame dalbret perceiving that i had great talent for music and a fine voice had procured me good masters and wishing to prove my gratitude by attention i was indefatigable and made so rapid a progress that my masters were surprised music and embroidery at which i had before mentioned i was very expert were my only occupationsand on the latter my talents were exerted to please madame dalbret by offering her each piece as they were successively taken from the frame so far from wishing to return to paris i was unhappy at the idea of leaving the chateau indeed if the reader will recall what i have narrated of my former life he will at once perceive that i could but be in a state of perfect happiness until i was received by madame dalbret i had lived a life of persecution and had not known kindness fear was the passion which had been acted upon and which i may say had crushed both mind and body now all was kindness and love praise which i had never before received was now lavished upon me and i felt my energies and talents roused and developing themselves in a way that astonished myself i had not known what i was or what i was capable of i had had no confidence in myself and i had believed myself to be almost as incapable as my mother would have persuaded me and everybody else this sudden change of treatment had a most surprising effect in the course of a few months i had grown nearly three inches taller and not only my figure but my features had become so improved that although not vain it was impossible for me not to believe what every one said and what my glass told me that i was very handsome and that i should make a great sensation when i was introduced at paris but although i believed this i felt no desire i was too happy as i was and would not have exchanged the kindness of madame dalbret for the best husband that france could produce and when anything was mentioned by ladies who visited madame dalbret to that effect and they talked about my future establishment my reply invariably was je ne veux pas i had always expressed my regrets that we should be obliged to go to paris for the season and madame dalbret who of course had no wish to part with me so soon and who felt that i was still young enough to remain for some years single made me very happy by telling me that she did not intend to stay long in the capital and that although i should appear at her parties she did not intend that i should be much at public places and so it proved we went to paris and the best masters were procured for me but i did not go out with madame dalbret except occasionally in her morning drives and once or twice to the opera and theatres my music occupied the major portion of my time and having expressed a wish to learn english i had a good master but i had another resource from an intimacy having arisen between me and madame paon whom i believe i have before mentioned as the first milliner in paris this intimacy was brought about in the following manner being very clever with my needle and having a great taste for dress i used to amuse myself at the chateau with inventing something new not for myself but for madame dalbret and very often surprised and pleased her by making alterations or additions to her dresses which were always admired and declared to be in the best taste on our arrival at paris madame paon was visited of course that the new fashions might be ascertained and she immediately remarked and admired my little inventions i was therefore consulted whenever a new dress was to be made for madame dalbret and as madame paon was a very ladylike and superior person of a decayed but good family we soon became very intimate we had been at paris about two months when one morning madame paon observed to madame dalbret that as i was learning english it would not be a bad plan if madame dalbret was to drop me at her establishment when she took her morning airing as she had two highly respectable english modistes in her employ who she found were necessary for her english customers and that i should learn more english by an hours conversation with them than a master could supply madame dalbret agreed with her i was pleased at the idea and consequently three or four mornings in the week were passed at madame paons but the reader must be introduced to the establishment of madame paon or he may imagine that it was too condescending for a young lady in my position to visit at a milliners madame paon was the first milliner at paris and as is generally the case was on the most intimate terms with all the ladies she made for the court and indeed for every lady to whom she could dedicate her time as it was almost a favour to be permitted to be one of her customers her establishment was in the rue st honore i forget the name of the hotel but it was one of the largest the suite of apartments were magnificent you passed from one room to another each displaying every variety of rich and graceful costume in every room were demoiselles welldressed to attend to the customers and everything bespoke a degree of taste and elegance quite unparalleled at last you arrived at the receptionroom of madame which was spacious and most superbly furnished there were no men in the establishment except in one room called the comptoir in which were six clerks at their desks when i add that madame paon was elegant in her manners and handsome in her person very tall and majestic that she was rich kept several servants a handsome carriage and had a maison de campagne to which she retired every saturday afternoon the reader may acknowledge that she was a person whom madame dalbret might permit me to visit this intimacy soon became very great there was a certain degree of eclat at my being so constantly in the house and moreover as i had a decided taste for dress i often brought forward some new invention which was not only approved of but a source of profit to madame paon everything was submitted to my judgment as madame paon more than once observed what a firstrate modiste you would make mademoiselle but unfortunately for the fashions there is no chance of your being so employed at last the paris season was nearly over and truly glad was i when madame dalbret mentioned the day of our departure i had very much improved in my music and my english during our residence at paris i had not been out except to small parties and had no wish whatever to go out at all i was satisfied with madame dalbrets company and had no wish to leave her i may say that i was truly happy and my countenance was radiant and proved that i was so my thoughts would occasionally revert to my father and my brother auguste and make me melancholy for the time but i felt that all was for the best and i built castles in which i imagined my suddenly breaking in upon them throwing myself in my fathers arms and requesting him to share the wealth and luxury with which i fancied myself to be endowed i was now nearly eighteen years old i had been one year under the protection of madame dalbret and the old dowagers who visited us at the chateau were incessantly pointing out to madame dalbret that it was time to look out for an establishment for me madame dalbret was to a certain degree of their opinion but she did not wish to part with me and i was resolute in my determination not to leave her i had no wish to be married i had reflected much upon the subject the few married lives i had witnessed were not to my taste i had seen my kindhearted amiable grandmother thwarted by a penurious husband i had witnessed my father under the control of a revengeful woman and when i beheld as i did every day the peace and happiness in the establishment of madame dalbret as a single woman i felt certain that marriage was a lottery in which there were thousands of blanks to one prize when therefore any of madame dalbrets acquaintances brought up the subject when they left the room i earnestly implored madame dalbret not to be influenced by their remarks as i had made up my mind to remain single and that all i asked was to remain with her and prove my gratitude i believe you valerie replied madame dalbret but i should not be doing my duty if i permitted you to act upon your own feelings a girl like you was not intended by heaven to pine away in celibacy but to adorn the station in life in which she is placed at the same time i will not press the matter but if an advantageous offer were to be made i shall then consider it my duty to exert my influence with you to make you change your mind but at the same time i will never use anything more than persuasion i am too happy with you as a companion to wish to part with you but at the same time i should be very selfish if i did not give you up when your own interest told me that such was my duty well madame i thank heaven that i have no fortune and that will i trust be a bar to any proposals from the interested gentleman of the present day that may not save you valerie replied madame dalbret laughing gentlemen may be satisfied with expectancies nay it is possible that one may be found who may be satisfied with your own pretty self and ask no more i rather think not madame replied i you have too good an opinion of me and must not expect others to view me with your partial eyes all i can say is that if such a gentleman could be found his disinterestedness would make me think more highly of him than i do of the sex at present although not sufficiently well to wish me to change my present condition well well we shall see replied madame dalbret the carriage is at the door so bring me my bonnet and cashmere a few weeks after our return to the chateau a monsieur de g of an old family in brittany who had been for the last two years in england returned to his fathers house and called upon madame dalbret she had known him from childhood and received him most cordially i must describe him fully as he played no small part in my little drama he was i should think nearly thirty years of age small in person but elegantly made with a very handsome but rather effeminate face his address and manners were perfect he was very witty and apparently very amiable his deportment towards our sex was certainly most fascinatingso tender and so respectful i certainly never had before seen so polished a man he sang well and played upon several instruments drew caricaturedindeed he did everything well that he attempted to do i hardly need say that with such qualifications and being so old a friend that he was gladly welcomed by madame dalbret and became a daily visitor at the chateau i was soon intimate with him and partial to his company but nothing more indeed his attentions to madame dalbret were quite as great as to me and there was nothing to permit any one to suppose that he was paying his court either to her or to me madame dalbret thought otherwise because we sang together and because he talked to me in english and she as well as others rallied me in consequence after two months had passed away monsieur de gwas supposed to be paying his attentions more particularly to me and i thought so myself madame dalbret certainly did and gave him every opportunity he was the heir to a large property and did not require money with his wife about this time an english lady of the name of bathurst who was travelling with a niece a little girl about fourteen years old had accepted an invitation from monsieur de gs father to pass a week with them at their chateau which was about five miles from that of madame dalbret and this lady was introduced she was apparently very amiable and certainly very distinguee in her manners and we saw a great deal of her as she was a great favourite with madame dalbret a few weeks after the introduction of this english lady i was one day on the terrace alone when i was accosted by monsieur de g after a remark or two upon the beauty of the autumnal flowers he observed how different are the customs of two great nations with but a few leagues of water between themi refer to the french and the english you would be surprised to see how great they are if you were ever to go to englandin none perhaps more so than in the affairs of the heart in france we do not consult the wishes or the feelings of the young lady we apply to her parents and if the match is considered equally advantageous the young lady is told to prepare herself for changing her condition in england the very reverse is the case we apply to the young lady gain her affections and when certain of them we then request the sanction of those who are her guardians which do you think is the most natural and satisfactory mademoiselle de chatenoeuf i have been brought up in france monsieur de g and i prefer the mode of france our parents and our guardians are the people most able to decide upon the propriety of a match and i think that until that point is ascertained no affections should be engaged as should the marriage not be considered advisable much pain and disappointment will be prevented in some instances i grant that such may be the case replied he but still is it not treating your sex like slaves to permit no love before marriage and is it agreeable for ours that we lead to the altar a person who may consent from a sense of duty without having the least regard for her husband nay perhaps feeling an aversion i do not think that any kind parents would force their child to marry a man for whom she felt an aversion replied i and if there is not much love before marriage there may be a great deal after but the fact is it is a subject upon which i am not able nor do i wish to give my opinion as you disagree with me mademoiselle de chatenoeuf replied he i fear you will not be pleased at my courting you in the english fashion and previous to addressing myself to madame dalbret making known to you my sincere regard for you and my humble hopes that i am not indifferent to you i will answer you very plainly monsieur de g and perhaps it is as well you have taken this unusual step as it will save you the trouble of making any application to madame dalbret flattered as i am by your compliment i beg to decline the honour you propose and now that you know my feelings you will of course not be so ungenerous as to make any application to madame dalbret certainly mademoiselle replied he with great pique but on one condition which is that you will promise me that you will not mention to madame dalbret what has now passed between us that i willingly promise monsieur de g as i may consider it as your secret and i trust continued he that you will not discard me from your friendship but receive me as before i shall always be happy to receive the friends of madame dalbret replied i and now i wish you a goodmorning i went to my own room and reflected upon what had passed i was angry with monsieur de gfor what i considered the unwarrantable liberty he had taken the greater as he must have known my utter dependence upon madame dalbret and how unlikely it was that i would form any such engagement without her knowledge and sanction that i had no love for monsieur de gwas certain although i was pleased with his company and conversation i was sorry on reflection that i had given my promise not to mention what had passed but having made the promise although hastily i resolved to adhere to it i took it for granted that he would gradually withdraw himself and that we should see little more of him but in this i was mistaken he was as frequent in his visits as before dividing his attentions between madame dalbret and me this annoyed me and i avoided him as much as i could and the consequence was that he was oftener with madame dalbret than with me at first when madame dalbret perceived this she appeared to be vexed as she had evidently set her mind upon the match and expected daily to receive a formal proposal from him in my behalf but gradually why i know not it gave her no further concern and i was permitted to leave the room and do as i pleased without being subjected to any remarks such was the state of affairs when the paris season drew near madame bathurst had been induced to remain in brittany and was continually with us she had often asked me to come over to england and pass a few weeks with them and i had jokingly replied that i would one morning madame dalbret said to me my dear valerie madame bathurst has again requested me to allow you to go to england with her now if you think that you would like to pass a short time with her instead of remaining at paris during the season i really have no objection if it would give you pleasure my dear madame i was only joking when i said so well you have made madame bathurst think you were in earnest my dear replied she and i thought so too and have this morning promised that you shall go with her i thought you would perfect yourself in english and it would be a good opportunity of relieving you for a short time of your constant attendance upon me so my dear valerie i advise you to go it will amuse you and a little change will do you good besides my dear i perceive that the attentions of monsieur de gare not agreeable to you and it is as well to break it off by a short absence i shall not dispute your wishes madame replied i mournfully for my heart misgave me why i knew not but if i do go it will be to oblige you and not because i really wish it my dear valerie i think it will be for the best and therefore you will oblige me i have promised for you and i should be sorry to have to recall my promiseso consent my dear and i will write to madame bathurst that she may be prepared to receive you certainly madame replied i your wishes will ever be a law to me and so saying i left the room and going to my own chamber i threw myself down on the bed and wept bitterly without knowing why about ten days after this madame bathurst called for me to take me to the chateau of monsieur de gs father where i was to remain till the next morning when we were to post to paris it was with great pain that i quitted madame dalbret but her kindness to me appeared to have increased rather than diminished after the proposal of our short separation god bless you my dear valerie she said you must write to me twice a week i shall be most impatient for your return i parted from her with many tears and did not leave off weeping till we arrived at the chateau at which madame bathurst resided i was received with formal politeness by the old gentleman and monsieur de g who was also at home and in an excessive gay humour alas mademoiselle cried he what a desert you will leave behind you it is too cruel this travelling mania on your part we never shall see you again there was so much irony in his face as he said this that i hardly knew what to make of it but it made me feel anxious and dissatisfied i would have given much to have abandoned the journey but madame dalbrets wishes were a law to me to avoid reflection which was painful i talked with caroline the niece of madame bathurst and as we were to set off at daylight we retired early the following morning we set off and in due time arrived at paris where we remained but one day and then proceeded to boulogne where we embarked it was now november and halfway across the channel we were enveloped in a fog and it was with difficulty that we made the harbour we set off for london the fog continued during the whole day and on our arrival at the suburbs it was thicker than ever and the horses were led through the streets by people carrying flambeaux i had heard that england was a triste pays and i thought it so indeed at last i observed to madame bathurst estce quil ny a jamais de soleil dans ce pays madame oh yes replied she laughing and a very beautiful sun too the next day we set off for madame bathursts country seat to pass the christmas before we were three miles out of london the fog had disappeared the sun shone out brilliantly and the branches of the leafless trees covered with rime glittered like diamond wands as we flew past them what with the change in the weather and the rapid motion produced by the four english posthorses i thought england beautiful but i must say that the first two days were a trial the more so as i was very despondent from having quitted madame dalbret i was delighted with madame bathursts country seat the wellarranged gardens the conservatories the neatness displayed in every thing so different from france the cleanness of the house and furniture the london carpets over the whole of the rooms and staircases were in my opinion great improvements but i cared little for the society which i found not only dull but it appeared to me to be selfish i found a lively companion in caroline and we sat up in a little boudoir where we were never interrupted here i practised my music and at madame bathursts request spoke alternately english and french with my little companion for our mutual improvement i had written twice to madame dalbret and had received one very kind answer but no mention was made of my return although it was at first arranged that my visit was to be three weeks or a month a fortnight after my arrival at fairfield i received a second letter from madame dalbret kind as usual but stating to my great grief that she was not well having had an attack on her chest from having taken a violent cold i answered the letter immediately requesting that i might be permitted to return home and nurse her for i felt very uneasy for three weeks during which i had no reply i was in a state of great anxiety and distress as i imagined that madame dalbret must have been too ill to write and i was in a fever of suspense at last i received a letter from her stating that she had been very ill and that she had been recommended by the physicians to go to the south of france for the winter at the same time as she could not put off her departure she wrote to madame bathurst requesting if not inconvenient that she would allow my visit to be extended till the spring at which season she expected to return to paris madame bathurst read her letter to me and stated how happy she should be for me to remain i could do no otherwise but thank her although i was truly miserable i wrote to madame dalbret and stated what my feelings were but as she had by what was said in her letter already left for the south of france i knew that my letter would arrive too late to enable her to alter her determination all i requested was that she would give me continual intelligence of her health i was however much consoled in my distress by the kindness of madame bathurst and affectionate manners of her niece caroline who was my constant companion there was a great deal of company not only visiting but staying in the house but although there was much company there was very little society horses dogs guns were the amusements of the gentlemen during the day in the evening we saw little of them as they seldom left the dinnertable before caroline and i had retired to our rooms and the ladies appeared to me to be all afraid of each other and to be constantly on the reserve christmas had passed and i had not heard again from madame dalbret which was a source of great vexation and many bitter tears i fancied her dying in the south of france without anyone to take care of her i often spoke to madame bathurst on the subject who offered all the excuses that she could devise but i thought at the same time appeared to be very grave and unwilling to continue the conversation at last i thought of madame paon and i wrote to her inquiring whether she knew how madame dalbret was detailing to her how i had come to england and how madame dalbret had been seriously indisposed stating my fears from not having received any reply to my last letters the day after i had written to madame paon caroline who was sitting with me in the boudoir observed i heard mrs corbet say to my aunt that she had seen madame dalbret at paris about ten days ago impossible replied i she is in the south of france so i understood replied caroline but she did say so and my aunt immediately sent me out of the room on a message i am sure it was to get rid of me that she might talk to mrs corbet what can this mean exclaimed i oh my heart forebodes evil excuse me caroline but i feel very miserable and i laid my face down on the table covering it with my hands and tears trickled fast through my fingers speak to my aunt said caroline consolingly do not cry valerie it may be all a mistake i will at once speak to madame bathurst said i raising my head it will be the best plan i went into my room bathed my eyes and then sought madame bathurst whom i found in the conservatory giving directions to the gardener after a time she took my arm and we walked down the terrace madame bathurst said i i have been made very miserable by caroline stating that mrs corbet had told you that she met madame dalbret at paris how can this be i cannot imagine more than yourself my dear valerie replied madame bathurst except that mrs corbet was mistaken do you think it was madame i cannot say valerie but i have written to paris to ascertain the fact which is to me incomprehensible a few days will let us into the truth i cannot believe itindeed if it were true i shall consider that madame dalbret has treated me ill for much as i am pleased to have you here she has not been candid with me in proposing that you should remain the winter upon the plea of her being obliged to go to the south when she is still at paris i cannot understand it and until confirmed i will not believe it mrs corbet is not an acquaintance of hers and may therefore be mistaken she must be madame replied i still it is strange that i do not hear from her i am fearful something is wrong and what it can be i cannot surmise let us talk no more about it my dear valerie a few days will decide the point a few days did decide the point for i received an answer from madame paon in which she said my dear mademoiselle chatenoeufyou may imagine my surprise at receiving your letter and i fear you must prepare yourself for unpleasant intelligence madame dalbret is in paris and has never been in the south of france that i have heard when she first called i inquired after you the reply was that you were on a visit to a lady in england that you had left her that you had a manie pour langleterre and so saying she shrugged up her shoulders i was about to inquire more particularly but she cut the conversation short by asking to see a new pelisse and i perceived at once that there was something wrong but what i could not comprehend i did not see her till four or five weeks afterwards when she called accompanied by a monsieur de g a person well known in paris where he bears a very indifferent character as a desperate gambler and a man of very bad disposition concealed under a very polished exterior but his character is better known in england which country i am told he was obliged to quit in consequence of some gaming transaction anything but honourable i again made inquiries after you and this time the reply was given by monsieur de g who replied that you were an ingrate and your name must not be in future mentioned by anyone to madame dalbret the handsome face of monsieur de g was changed to that of a demon when he made this remark and fully proved to me the truth of the report that he was a person of very bad disposition madame dalbret made no remark except that she should be careful how she ever engaged a demoiselle de compagnie again i was struck at this remark from her as i always considered that you were and indeed i know you were at one time viewed in a very different light and i was quite mystified about a fortnight afterwards madame dalbret called upon me and announced her intended marriage to monsieur de g and requested me to make her wedding dresses here the whole mystery was out but why because she marries monsieur de g you should lose her protection and why monsieur de gshould be so inveterate against you is more than i can tell i have now my dear mademoiselle given you a detail of all i know and shall be most happy to hear from you if you will please to write to me etcetera etcetera emile paon nee merce here was a solution of the whole mystery i read the letter and fell back on the sofa gasping for breath it was some time before i could recover myself i was alone in my bedroom my head and eyes swimming but i staggered to the washingstand and obtained some water it was halfanhour before i could recall my astonished senses and then everything appeared as clear to me as if it had been revealed monsieur de gs double attentions his spiteful look at my refusal his occupying himself wholly with madame dalbret after i refused him her wishing to get rid of me by sending me to england with madame bathurst and her subsequent false and evasive conduct monsieur de ghad had his revenge and gained his point at the same time he had obtained the wealth of madame dalbret to squander at the gamingtable and had contrived by some means or another to ruin me in her good opinion i perceived at once that all was lost and when i considered the awkwardness of my position i was almost in despair chapter six as i continued for more than an hour on the sofa gloomily passing in review my short career my present position and occasionally venturing a surmise upon the future a feeling which i had not had beforeone which had hitherto been latentpride gradually was awakened in my bosom and as it was aroused it sustained me i have before observed that fear had been my predominating feeling till i had quitted my parents love and gratitude had succeeded it but now smarting under injustice pride and with pride many less worthy passions were summoned up and i appeared in the course of two short hours to be another being i felt confidence in myself my eyes were opened all at once as it were to the heartlessness of the world the more i considered the almost hopeless condition in which i was in the more my energy was roused i sat down on the sofa a confiding clinging girl i rose up a resolute clearsighted woman i reflected and had made up my mind that madame dalbret would never forgive one whom she had injured as she had me she had induced me to break off all family and parental ties such as they were she had made me wholly dependent upon her and had now cast me off in a cruel and heartless manner she had used deceit because she knew that she could not justify her conduct she had raised calumnies against me accusing me of ingratitude as an excuse for her own conduct anything like a reconciliation therefore was impossible and any assistance from her i was determined not to accept besides was she not married to monsieur de g whom pique at my refusal had made my enemy and who had in all probability as he pressed his own suit perceived the necessity independent of the gratification it afforded him to be my ruin of removing me as a serious obstacle to madame dalbrets contracting a new alliance from that quarter therefore there was nothing to be expected or hoped for even if it were desired and what was my position with madame bathurst on a visit at the termination of which i was houseless that madame bathurst would probably offer me a temporary asylum for she would hardly turn me out of doors i felt convinced but my newborn pride revolted at the idea of dependence upon one on whom i had no claim whatever what then was to be done i examined my capital i was handsome but that was of no use to me the insidious conduct of monsieur de ghad raised to positive dislike the indifference that i felt for his sex and i had no inclination to make a market of my personal advantages i could sing and play well i spoke french and english and understood italian i could embroider the work well with my needle such were my capabilities my stockintrade with which to commence the world i was therefore competent to a certain degree to give lessons in music and in french or to take a governesss place or to become a modiste i thought of madame paon but when i reflected in what manner i had visited her the respect and homage i may say which had been offered up to me and how different my reception and treatment would be if i entered the establishment as one of themselves the reflection was too mortifying and i determined that if i were driven to such an employment for my livelihood it should be where i was not known after much consideration i decided that i would see madame bathurst make known to her my intentions and ask her assistance and recommendation to procure me a situation i arranged my hair removed all traces of my late agitation and went down to her i found her alone and asking her whether she could spare me a few minutes of her time i handed to her the letter which i had received from madame paon and then made her acquainted with that portion of my history with which she had been unacquainted as i spoke my courage revived and my voice became firm i felt that i was no longer a girl madame bathurst i have confided this to you because you will agree with me that there can be nothing more between madame dalbret and me for even if she made an offer i would never accept it i am now in a very false position owing to her conduct i am here on a visit supposed by you to be the protegee of that lady and a person of some consequence her protection has been taken away from me and i am now a beggar with nothing but my talents for my future support i explain this to you frankly because i cannot think of remaining as your visitor and if i do not ask too much all that i wish of your friendship is that you will give me such a recommendation as you think i deserve by which i may obtain the means of future livelihood my dear valerie replied madame bathurst i will not hurt your feelings it is a heavy blow and i am glad to perceive that instead of being crashed by it you appear to rise i have heard of madame dalbrets marriage and the deceit which she has been practising evidently to get rid of you not many days ago i wrote to her pointing out the variance between what she stated in her letters and her actual position and requesting to know what was to be done relative to you her answer i have received this day she states that you have cruelly deceived her that at the very time that you professed the utmost gratitude and affection you were slandering her and laughing at her behind her back particularly to monsieur de g to whom she is now married and that however she might be inclined to forgive and overlook your conduct herself that monsieur de gis resolute and determined that you never shall come again under his roof she has therefore transmitted a billet of francs to enable you to return to your fathers house then replied i it is as i suspected monsieur de gis the cause of all why did you trust him valerie or rather why were you so imprudent and i must add ungrateful to speak of madame dalbret as you did and you believe it madame bathurst you believe that i did so i can only say that if such is your belief the sooner we part the better i then told her what i had omitted in my narrative how i had refused monsieur de g and explaining his character showed that he had acted thus out of interest and revenge i believe it all now valerie and i must beg your pardon for having supposed that you had been ungrateful this explanation relieves me and enables me to make you the offer which i had thought of doing had i not been checked by this calumny against you i say therefore for the present my dear valerie remain here you are quite equal to be governess to caroline but i prefer you should remain with me more as a friend than as a governess i say this because i fear you will be too proud to remain as a dependent without making yourself useful you know that i did intend to take a governess for caroline as soon as we went to london i will now take you if you will consent and shall feel the obligation on my side as i shall not only have retained a capable person but shall also not lose a dear young friend i thank you for the offer my dear madame replied i rising and courtseying i trust however that you will allow me a little time for reflection before i decide you must admit that this is a most critical epoch in my life and i must not make one false step if it is possible to prevent it certainly replied madame bathurst certainly you are right valerie in reflecting well before you decide but i must say that you are rather haughty in your manner towards me i may have been my dear madame bathurst but if so take my excuses recollect the valerie of yesterday who was your visitor and young friend is not the valerie of today and with these words i took up the cheque for francs which madame bathurst had laid on the table left the room and returned to my own apartment i returned to my room and was glad to be once more alone for although i bore up well under the circumstances still the compressed excitement was wearying to the frame i had resolved to accept the offer of madame bathurst at the time that she made it but i did not choose to appear to jump at it as she probably expected that i would i felt no confidence in anyone but my own self after the treatment of madame dalbret and i considered that madame bathurst would probably dismiss me as soon as my services were no longer required with as little ceremony as had madame dalbret that i was capable of taking charge of and instructing caroline i knew well and that madame bathurst would not easily procure a governess so capable in singing and music as myself there would be consequently no obligation and i resolved that i would reject her terms if they were not favourable i had some money for i had spent but a small portion of twenty sovereigns which madame dalbret had given me in a purse when i quitted her i had therefore the means of subsistence for some little time should i not come to terms with madame bathurst after an hours reflection i sat down and wrote a letter to madame paon stating what had occurred and my determination to obtain my own livelihood and adding that as i was not sure whether i should accept of madame bathursts offer i wished her to give me a letter of introduction to some french acquaintance of hers in london as i was an utter stranger to everything and without advice should probably be cheated in every way as soon as this letter was finished i commenced another to madame dalbret which was in the following words my dear madame yes i will still say my dear madame for although you will never hear of me again you are still dear to me more dear perhaps than you were when i considered you my patroness and my more than mother and why sobecause when those we love are in misfortune when those who have benefited us are likely to soon want succour themselves it is then the time that we should pour out our gratitude and love i do not consider it your fault my dear madame dalbret that you have been deceived by a base hypocrite who wears so captivating a mask i do not blame you that you have been persuaded by him that i have slandered and behaved ungratefully to you you have been blinded by your own feelings towards him and by his consummate art i am also to blame for not having communicated to you that he made me a proposal of marriage but a short time previous to my departure and which i indignantly rejected because he had taken such an unusual step without any previous communication with you on the subjectnot that i would have accepted him even if you had wished it for i knew how false and unworthy he was considered to be i should have told you my dear madame of this offer of marriage on his part but he requested me as a favour not to mention it to you and i did not then know that he was a ruined man a desperate gambler and that he had been obliged to quit this country for dishonourable practices at the gamingtable as you may easily discover to be true for even madame paon can give you all the necessary information and into this mans hands have you fallen my dear madame dalbret alas how you are to be pitied my heart bleeds for you and i fear that a few months will suffice to prove to you the truth of what i now write that i am a sufferer by the conduct of monsieur de gis true i have lost a kind patroness an indulgent mother and am now left to obtain my own livelihood how i can all my visions all my dreams of happiness with you all my wishes of proving my gratitude and love for your kindness have vanished and here i am young alone and unprotected but i think not of myself at all events i am freei am not chained to such a person as monsieur de g and it is of you and all that you will have to suffer that my thoughts and heart are full i return you the cheque for francsi cannot take the money you are married to monsieur de g and i can accept nothing from one who has made you believe that valerie could be calumnious and ungrateful adieu my dear madame i shall pray for you and weep over your misfortunes yours ever gratefully valerie de chatenoeuf that there was a mixed feeling in this letter i confess as i said in it i really pitied madame dalbret and forgave her her unkindness but i sought revenge upon monsieur de g and in seeking that i planted daggers into the heart of madame dalbret but i did not at the time that i wrote reflect upon this what i wished to do was to vindicate myself and that i could not do without exposing monsieur de g and exposing him in his true colours was of course awakening madame dalbret to her position sooner than she would have been and filling her mind with doubts and jealousy that this was not kind i felt when i had perused what i had written previous to folding the letter but i felt no inclination to alter it probably because i had not quite so wholly forgiven madame dalbret as i thought that i had be it as it may the letter was sealed and despatched by that nights post as well as that written to madame paon i had now only to arrange with madame bathurst and i went down into the drawingroom where i found her alone i have considered my dear madame bathurst said i your kind proposal i certainly have had a little struggle to get over as you must admit that it is not pleasant to sink from a visitor in a family into a dependent as i must in future be if i remain with you but the advantages of being with a person whom i respect as much as i do you and of having charge of a young person to whom i am so attached as i am to caroline have decided me on accepting your offer may i know then what may be the terms upon which i am received as governess valerie i feel that this is all pride replied madame bathurst but still it is not disreputable pride and though i shall yield to it i would have made no terms but retained you as a dear friend my purse and everything in the house at your command and i hoped that you would have allowed me so to do but as you will not i have only to say that i should have expected to pay any governess whom i might have retained for caroline a salary of pounds per annum and that i offer you the same it is more than sufficient my dear madame replied i and i accept your offer if you will take me on trial for six months valerie you make me laugh and make me angry at the same time but i can bear much from you now for you have had a heavy blow my poor child now lets say no more on the subject all is settled and the arrangement will remain a secret unless you publish it yourself i certainly shall make no secret of it madame bathurst i should be sorry to show false colours and be supposed by your friends to be otherwise than what i really am i have done nothing that i ought to be ashamed of and i abhor deceit whatever may be my position in life i trust that i shall never disgrace the name that i bear and i am not the first of a noble name who has had a reverse in fortune how strange that i now for the first time in my life began to feel pride in my family name i presume because when we have lost almost everything we cherish more that which remains to us from the time that madame bathurst had first known me till the last twentyfour hours not a symptom of pride had ever been discovered in me as the protegee and adopted daughter of madame dalbret with brilliant prospects i was all humilitynow a dependent with a salary of pounds per annum valerie was as proud as lucifer himself madame bathurst perceived this and i must do her the justice to say that she was very guarded in her conduct towards me she felt sympathy for me and treated me with more kindness and i may say with more respect than she did when i was her visitor and her equal the next day i informed caroline of the change in my prospects and of my having accepted the office of governessthat was to say on a six months trial i pointed out to her that it would now be my duty to see that she did not neglect her studies and that i was determined to do justice to madame bathursts confidence reposed in me caroline who was of a very amiable and sweet disposition replied that she should always look upon me as her friend and companion and from her love for me would do everything i wished and she kept her word the reader will agree with me that it was impossible for any one to have been lowered down in position more gently than i was in this instance the servants never knew that i had accepted the offer of governess for i was invariably called valerie by madame bathurst and her niece and was treated as i was before when a visitor to the house i bestowed much time upon caroline and taught myself daily that i might be more able to teach her i went back to the elements in everything that i might be more capable of instructing and caroline made rapid progress in music and promised to have in a few years a very fine voice we went to town for the season but i avoided company as much as possibleso much so that madame bathurst complained of it valerie you do wrong not to make your appearance you retire in such a way that people naturally put questions to me and ask if you are the governess or what you are i wish them to do so my dear madame and i want you to reply frankly i am the governess and do not like anything like concealment but i cannot admit that you are what may be called a governess valerie you are a young friend staying with me who instructs my niece that is what a governess ought to be replied i a young friend who instructs your children i grant it replied madame bathurst but i fear if you were to take the situation in another family you would find that a governess is not generally so considered or so treated i do not know any class of people who are more to be pitied than these young people who enter families as governesses not considered good enough for the drawingroom they are too good for the kitchen they are treated with hauteur by the master and mistress and only admitted or suffered for a time to be in their company by the servants they are considered as not having claims to those attentions and civilities for which they are paid and fed because receiving salaries or wages like themselves as they assert they are not entitled in their opinion to be attended upon thus are they in most houses neglected by all parties unhappy themselves they cause illwill and dissension and more servants are dismissed or given warning on account of the governesses than from any other cause in the drawingroom they are a check upon conversation in the schoolroom if they do their duty they are the cause of discontent pouting and tears like the bat they are neither bird nor beast and they flit about the house like illomens they lose the lightheartedness and spring of youth become sour from continual vexation and annoyance and their lives are miserable tedious and full of repining i tell you this candidly it is a harsh picture but i fear too true a one with me i trust you will be happy but you will run a great risk if you were to change and go into another family i have heard as much before my dear madame replied i but your considerate kindness has made me forget it i can only say that it will be a melancholy day when i am forced to quit your roof visitors announced interrupted the conversation i have before mentioned the talent i had for dress and the kindness of madame bathurst induced me to exert all that i possessed in her favour every one was pleased and expressed admiration at the peculiar elegance of her attire and asked who was the modiste she employed and madame bathurst never failed to ascribe all the merit to me time passed on rapidly and the season was nearly over madame bathurst had explained to her most intimate friends the alteration which had taken place in my prospects and that i remained with her more as a companion than in any other capacity this procured me consideration and respect and i very often had invitations to parties but i invariably refused except occasionally accepting a seat in the box at the opera and french plays i was content to remain quiet madame paon had as i requested sent me a letter of introduction to a friend of hers a monsieur gironac who lived in leicester square he was a married man without family he obtained his livelihood by giving lessons on the flute on the guitar and in teaching french during the day and at night was engaged as second violin in the orchestra of the opera house so that he had many strings to his bow besides those of his fiddle his wife a pretty little lively woman taught young ladies to make flowers in wax and mended lace in the evenings they were a very amiable and amusing couple always at goodnatured warfare with each other and sparring all day long from the time they met until they parted their battles were the most comical and amusing i ever witnessed and generally ended in roars of laughter they received me with the greatest kindness and consideration treating me with great respect until our extreme intimacy no longer required it and our friendship increased more than it could have done from caroline expressing a wish to learn to model flowers and becoming the pupil of madame gironac such was the state of affairs when the london season was over and we once more returned to the country the time flew away rapidly madame bathurst treated me with kindness and respect caroline with affection and i was again quite happy and contented i was earnest in my endeavours to improve caroline and moreover had the satisfaction to feel and hear it acknowledged that my attempts were not thrown away i looked forward to remaining at least till carolines education was complete which it could not be under two or three years and feeling security for such a period i gave myself little thought of the future when a circumstance occurred which put an end to all my calculations i have stated that caroline was the niece of madame bathurst she was the daughter of a younger sister who had contracted an unfortunate marriage having eloped with a young man who had not a shilling that he could call his own and whose whole dependence was upon an uncle without a family this imprudent match had however raised the indignation of his relative who from that moment told him he was to expect nothing from him either before or after his death the consequence was that madame bathursts sister and husband were in a state of great distress until madame bathurst by exerting herself in his behalf procured for him a situation of pounds per annum in the excise upon this sum and the occasional presents of madame bathurst they contrived to live but having two boys and a girl to educate madame bathurst took charge of the latter who was caroline promising that she would either establish her in life or leave her a sufficiency at her death madame bathurst had a very large jointure and could well afford to save up every year for caroline which she had done ever since she had taken charge of her at seven years old at the time that i have been speaking of it appeared that the uncle of the father of caroline died and notwithstanding his threat bequeathed to his nephew the whole of his large property by which he became even more wealthy than madame bathurst the consequence was that madame bathurst received a letter announcing this intelligence and winding up with a notification that caroline was to be immediately taken back to her fathers house in the letterwhich i read for madame bathurst who was in great distress handed it to me observing at the time this concerns you as well as me and carolinethere were not any expressions of gratitude for the great kindness which they had received from her hands it was an unkind unfeeling letter and i was disgusted when i had gone through it is this all the return that you receive for what you have done for your sister and her husband observed i the more i see of this world the more i hate it it is indeed most selfish and unfeeling replied madame bathurst caroline has been so long with me that i have looked upon her as my own child and now she is to be torn from me without the least consideration of my feelings it is very cruel and very ungrateful madame bathurst after this remark rose and left the room as i afterwards discovered she replied to the letter pointing out how long she had had charge of caroline and now considered her as her daughter and requesting her parents to allow her to return to her after she paid them a visit pointing out how unkind and ungrateful it was of them to take her away now that their circumstances were altered and how very painful it would be for her if they did so to this appeal on her part she received a most insulting answer in which she was requested to make out an account of the expenses incurred for the education and maintenance of her niece that they might be reimbursed forthwith on this occasion for the first time i saw madame bathurst really angry and certainly not without good cause she sent for caroline who as yet had only been informed that her father and mother had succeeded to a large inheritance and put the letter into her hands with a copy of her own requesting that she would read them watching her countenance with the severest scrutiny as she complied with the injunction as if to discover if she inherited the ingratitude of her parents such was not the case for poor caroline sunk covered her face with her hands and then rushing to madame bathurst fell on her knees before her and burying her face in her aunts lap cried as if her heart would break after a few minutes madame bathurst raised up her niece and kissed her saying i am satisfied my dear caroline at least is not ungrateful now my child you must do your duty and obey your parentsas we must part the sooner we part the better valerie will you see that everything is ready for carolines going away tomorrow morning saying this madame bathurst disengaged herself from caroline and quitted the room it was a long while before i could reason the poor girl into anything like composure i could not help agreeing with her that the conduct of her parents was most ungracious towards madame bathurst but at the same time i pointed out to her how natural it was that having but one daughter her parents should wish for her return to their own care that the resigning her to madame bathurst must have been a severe trial to them and that it could only be from consulting her advantage that they could have consented to it but notwithstanding all that i could urge carolines indignation against her parents of whom she knew but little was very great and her dislike to return home as strong however there was no help for it as madame bathurst had decided that she was to go and i persuaded her to come with me and prepare her clothes ready for packing up we did not meet at dinner that day madame bathurst sending an excuse that she was too much out of spirits to leave her room caroline and i were equally so and we remained where we were in the evening madame bathurst sent for me i found her in bed and looking very ill valerie said she i wish caroline to start early tomorrow morning that as you accompany her you may be able to return here before night i shall not be able to see her tomorrow morning i must therefore bid her farewell this night bring her here and the sooner it is over the better i went for caroline and a bitter parting it was i hardly know which of the three cried the most but after halfanhour madame bathurst signed to me to take caroline away which i did and afterwards put her into bed as soon as i could having remained with her till she had sobbed herself to sleep i went down to the servants and gave madame bathursts directions for the next morning and then retired myself worn out as i was with such a day of anxiety and distress i could not close my eyes for some time reflecting upon what might be the issue of this breaking up of the connection to myself i had been engaged as governess to caroline and i could not well expect that madame bathurst would wish to retain me now that caroline was removed from her care neither indeed would my pride permit me to accept such an offer if made as i should become a mere dependent on her bounty with no services to offer in return that i must leave madame bathurst was certain and that i must look out for some other situation i took it for granted that madame bathurst would not permit me to leave immediately but allow me a short time to look out for a suitable situation but whether i should decide upon taking the situation of a governess after what madame bathurst had told me or what situation i should seek was the cause of much thought and indecision at last i could make no mind up and decided that i would trust to providence and having so far come to a conclusion i fell asleep after an early breakfast i set off in the carriage with caroline in charge and before noon we arrived at her fathers house the servants dressed in very gaudy liveries ushered us into the library where we found her father and mother waiting to receive her a first glance satisfied me that they were swelled with pride at the change in their fortunes caroline was not received with great cordiality there was a stiffness on the part of her parents which would have checked any feelings of affection on her part had she been inclined to show them which i was sorry to perceive she did not indeed her feelings appeared rather those of resentment for the conduct they had shown to her aunt after the salutation of meeting caroline sat down on a sofa opposite to her father and mother i remained standing and when the pause took place i said i was deputed by madame bathurst to convey your daughter safe to you and as soon as the horses are baited i am to return home who may this person be caroline demanded her mother i must apologise to mademoiselle de chatenoeuf for not having introduced her replied caroline blushing with annoyance she is a very dear friend of mine and my aunts latterly i have been the governess of your daughter madame said i oh said the lady will somebody ring the bell i presumed by this somebody it was intended to convey to me that i was to perform that office but as they had not had the common civility to ask me to take a chair i took no notice will you ring the bell my dear said the lady to her husband the gentleman complied and when the servant entered the lady said show the governess into the small breakfastroom and tell the coachman to put up his horses and bait them he must be round again in an hour the man stood with the door in his hand waiting for me to follow him not a little indignant i turned to caroline and said to her i had better wish you goodbye now yes indeed valerie you had replied caroline rising from the sofa for i am ashamed to look you in the face after such treatment as you have received will you continued she with great spirit accept my apology for the behaviour of my parents towards one who is of a much higher family and much higher breeding than they can boast of hush caroline said i recollect i do recollect and shall continue to recollect the insults to my dear aunt in the first place and now the insult to you my dear valerie retorted caroline who then put her arms round my neck and kissed me several times having so done she darted from me threw herself on the sofa and burst into tears while i hastened to follow the servant to escape from such an unpleasant scene i was shown into a small room where i remained some little time thinking how true were madame bathursts observations as to what i might expect in the position of a governess when a servant came in and in a condescending manner asked if i did not wish to have some lunch i replied in the negative you can have a glass of wine if you choose continued he you may leave the room i replied calmly i wish for nothing the man went out slamming the door and i was again alone i reflected upon the scene i had just been witness to and i own that i was surprised at carolines conduct who had always appeared so mild and amiable but the fact appeared to me to be that when parents give up their children to the care of another they surrender at the same time all those feelings which should exist between parent and child to the party who undertakes the charge of them the respect and love which by nature belonged to them were now transferred to her aunt to whom caroline was always obedient and attached the insult to me was resented by caroline as if it had been offered by perfect strangers to her caroline not feeling herself at all checked by filial duty there appeared to be little prospect of any addition to the happiness of either of the parties by the return of caroline to her fathers house and how it would end i could not surmise at last my reverie was interrupted by the servant coming in and telling me that the carriage was at the door i immediately followed him and set off on my return during which i resolved that i would not leave my own expectations any longer in doubt but come immediately to an understanding with madame bathurst as it was late when i arrived i did not see madame bathurst that evening but she came down to breakfast the next morning when i informed her of all that had occurred at her sisters and the unceremonious manner in which i had been treated and having done so i then observed that of course i did not expect to remain with her now that caroline was gone and begged she would give me her advice and assistance in procuring another situation at all events do not be in a hurry valerie replied madame bathurst i trust you will not refuse to be my visitor until you are suited to your liking i will not ask you to stay with me as i know you will refuse and i do not pay unnecessary compliments and yet why should you not i know you well and am attached to you i shall feel the loss of caroline severely why not remain many thanks my dear madame replied i for your kind wishes and expressions but you know my resolution has been made to earn my own livelihood i know that but a resolution may be altered when circumstances demand it madame dalbret was no more related to you than i am and yet you accepted her offer i did madame replied i bitterly and you know the result i would have staked my life upon her sincerity and affection and yet how was i cast away with every feeling of gratitude my dear madame i cannot accept your offer for i never will put myself in a similar position a second time you do not pay me a very great compliment by that remark valerie said madame bathurst somewhat harshly indeed my dear madame i should be sorry if anything i have said should annoy one who has been so kind and considerate to me as you have been but i know that i should be miserable and unhappy if not independent and i never can risk a second shock like that i received from the conduct of madame dalbret i entreat as a favour that you will not continue the subject well valerie i will not perhaps had i been treated as you have been i might feel the same what then do you propose to seek is it the situation of a governess anything in preference my dear madame i was sufficiently humiliated yesterday i should prefer that of a ladysmaid although i hope not to descend quite so low there are so few situations for a person educated as you have been there is a companion for a lady which i believe is anything but pleasant there is that of amanuensis but it is seldom required you might certainly go out and give lessons in music and singing and in the french language but there are so many french masters and mistresses and for music and singing a master is always preferred why i do not exactly know however i think something may be done when we go to town but till then all that we can do is to talk the matter over perhaps something may turn up when we least expect it i will however now that i know your decision make every inquiry and give you all the assistance in my power i expressed my thanks and gratitude and the conversation ended i did not however trust altogether to madame bathurst i wrote a letter to my acquaintance madame gironac in leicester square stating what had occurred and what my ideas and intentions were requesting her to give me her advice and opinion as to the best plan i could follow in a few days i received from her the following reply which i insert as characteristic of the party my dear mademoiselle your letter gave great pain to me and as for my husband he was quite furious and declared that he would not live a minute longer in such an abominable world however to oblige me he has not yet made away with himself it really is dreadful to see a young ladylike you in such an awkward position from the weakness and follies of others but we must submit to what the bon dieu disposes and when things come to the worst hope that a change will take place as any change must then be for the better i have consulted my husband about what you propose but he negatives everything he says you are too good for a governess would be thrown away as a companion to a lady that you must not be seen in a cab going about giving lessonsin fact he will listen to nothing except that you must come and live with us i can only say my dear mademoiselle that i join in the latter request and that it would make me perfectly happy and that the honour and pleasure of your company would be more than a compensation still it is but a poor home to offer to you but at all events one that you might condescend to take advantage of rather than remain to be mortified by those who think as they do in this country that money is everything do pray then come to us if you feel inclined and then we can talk over things quietly and wait upon providence my husband has now hardly time to eat his dinner he has so many pupils of one kind and the other and i am happy to say that i have also most of my time occupied and if it pleases god to continue us in good health we hope to be able to put by a little money for a rainy day as they say in this country where it is always raining assure yourself my dear mademoiselle of our love respect consideration annette gironac we went to town earlier than usual madame bathurst feeling lonely in the country after the departure of caroline from whom she had not received a line since her quitting her this of course was to be ascribed to her parents who thus returned all madame bathursts kindness as soon as they no longer required her assistance i know not how it was but gradually a sort of coolness had arisen between madame bathurst and me whether it was that she was displeased at my refusing her offer to remain with her or thought proper to wean herself from one who was so soon to quit her i know not i did nothing to give offence i was more quiet and subdued perhaps than before because i had become more reflective but i could not accuse myself of any fault or error that i was aware of we had been about a week in london when an old acquaintance of madame bathursts who had just returned from italy where she had resided for two years called upon her her name was lady r she was the widow of a baronet not in very opulent circumstances although with a sufficiency to hire if not keep a carriage she was moreover an authoress having written two or three novels not very good i was told but still emanating from the pen of a lady they were well paid she was very eccentric and rather amusing when a woman says everything that comes into her head out of a great deal of chaff there will drop some few grains of wheat and so sometimes more by accident than otherwise she said what is called a good thing now a good thing is repeated while all the nonsense is forgotten and lady rwas considered a wit as well as an authoress she was a tall woman i should think very near if not past fifty years of age with the remains of beauty in her countenance apparently she was strong and healthy as she walked with a spring and was lively and quick in all her motions cara mia exclaimed she as she was announced running up to madame bathurst and how have you been all this whilemy biennial absence in the land of poetryin which i have laid up such stores of beauteous images and ideas in my mind that i shall make them last me during my life have you read my last its surprising every one says and proves the effect of climate on compositionquite newan italian story of thrilling interest and you have something new here i perceive continued she turning to me not only new but beautifulintroduce me i am an enthusiast in the sublime and beautiful is she any relation no relationmademoiselle de chatenoeufwhat a pretty name for a novel i should like to borrow it and paint the original from nature will you sit for your likeness that lady rallowed no one to talk but herself was evident madame bathurst who knew her well allowed her to run on and i not much valuing the dose of flattery so unceremoniously bestowed upon me took an opportunity when lady rturned round to whisper something to madame bathurst to make my escape from the room the following morning madame bathurst said to me valerie lady rwas very much pleased with your appearance when she made her visit yesterday and as she told me after you had left the room that she wanted just such a person as yourself as a companion and amanuensis i thought it right to say that you were looking out for something of the kind and that you were remaining under my protection until you could procure it we had more conversation on the subject and she said before she left that she would write to me on the subject her note has just been put into my hands you can read it she offers you a salary of one hundred pounds per annum all your expenses paid except your dress as far as salary goes i think her terms liberal and now as to lady r my opinion of her is in few words you saw her yesterday and i never knew her otherwise never more or less rational she is an oddity but she is goodnatured and i am told more liberal and charitable than many others who can afford it better now you know all i can tell you about her and you must decide for yourself here is her note you need not give me an answer till tomorrow morning i made one or two observations and then left the room the note was very kind certainly but it was as flighty as her manners i hastened to my own bedchamber and sat down to reflect i felt that i was not exactly comfortable with madame bathurst and certainly was anxious to be independent but still i could not exactly make up my mind to accept the offer of lady r she was so different from those i had been accustomed to live with i was still deliberating when mrs bathursts maid came into my room telling me it was time to change my dress for dinner as she was assisting me she said and so miss chatenoeuf you are about to quit us i find i am so sorryfirst miss caroline now you i hoped you would stay with us and i should soon have become an expert milliner under your directions who told you mason that i was going to leave you mrs bathurst told me so and not a quarter of an hour ago replied the woman well replied i she told you truly mason such is the case for this information of masons decided me upon accepting the offer of lady r for madame bathurst it appeared to me had certainly decided it for me by making such a premature communication to her servant the reader may suppose that when i made this discovery i felt little pain at the idea of parting with madame bathurst and the following morning i coolly announced my intention of accepting the offer of lady r madame bathurst looked at me very hard as if surprised at not hearing from me any regrets at leaving her and expressions of gratitude for all favours but i could not express what i really did not feel at the time afterwards i thought that i had been wrong as to a certain degree i was under obligations to her not that i think had she been ever so inclined to get rid of me she could have well turned me out of the house although i had been foisted upon her in such a way by madame dalbret still i was under obligations to her and should have expressed myself so if it had not been for the communication made to me by the maid which proved that her expressions to me were not sincere well then replied madame bathurst at last i will write to lady rimmediately i presume i may say that you are at her commands as soon as she can receive you yes madame at an hours notice replied i you really appear as if you were anxious to quit me mademoiselle said madame bathurst biting her lip i certainly am replied i you informed mason that i was to go previous to having my decision and therefore i gladly withdraw myself from the company of those who have made up their minds to get rid of me i certainly did tell mason that there was a prospect of your quitting me replied madame bathurst colouring up buthowever its no use entering into an investigation of what i really said or catechising my maid one thing is clear we have been mutually disappointed with each other and therefore it perhaps is better that we should part i believe that i am in your debt mademoiselle de chatenoeuf have you reckoned how long you have been with me i have reckoned the time that i instructed caroline miss caroline if you please mademoiselle de chatenoeuf well then madame miss caroline since you wish it it is five months and two weeks replied i rising from my chair you may sit down mademoiselle while i make the calculation said madame bathurst it is too great an honour for a chatenoeuf to sit in your presence replied i quietly remaining on my feet madame bathurst made no reply but calculating the sum of money due to me on a sheet of note paper handed it to me and begged me to see if it was correct i have no doubt of it madame replied i looking at it and then laying it down on the desk before her madame bathurst put the sum in banknotes and sovereigns down before me and said do me the favour to count it and see if it is correct and then rising said your wishes will be complied with by my servants as usual mademoiselle as long as you remain under my roof i wish you farewell the last words were accompanied with a low courtesy and she then quitted the room i replied with a salute as formal as her own and mortified at the treatment i had received i sat down and a few tears escaped but my pride came to my assistance and i soon recovered myself this scene was however another proof to me of what i must in future expect and it had the effect of hardening me and blunting my feelings miss caroline said i to myself when the protegee of madame dalbret and the visitor of madame bathurst it was caroline and dear valerie she might have allowed me to quit her without pointing out to me in so marked a manner how our relative positions have been changed however i thank you madame bathurst what obligations i may have been under to you are now cancelled and i need not regret the weight of them as i might have done ah madame dalbret you took me from my home that i might not be buffeted by my mother and now you have abandoned me to be buffeted by the whole world well be it so i will fight my way nevertheless and as i left the room to pack up my trunks i felt my courage rise from this very attempt on the part of madame bathurst to humiliate me the letter of madame bathurst to lady r brought the latter to the house that afternoon i was up in my room when i was informed by the servants that she waited below to see me when i entered she was alone madame bathurst having gone out in her carriage and as soon as she saw me she rushed into my arms almost taking me by both hands and saying how happy she was that she had acquired such a treasure as a friend and companion wished to know whether i could not come with her immediately as her carriage was at the door and went on for nearly ten minutes without a check asking fifty questions and not permitting me to answer one at last i was able to reply to the most important which was that i would be happy to come to her on the following morning if she would send for me she insisted that i should come to breakfast and i acceded to her request as madame bathurst who was not an early riser would not be down at the hour mentioned and i wished to leave the house without seeing her again after our formal adieux having arranged this she appeared to be in a great hurry to be off and skipped out of the room before i could ring the bell to order her carriage i completed my preparations for departure and had some dinner brought into my own room sending down an excuse for not joining madame bathurst stating that i had a bad headache which was true enough the next morning long before madame bathurst was up i was driven to baker street portman square where lady rresided i found her ladyship in her robe de chambre well said she this is delightful my wishes are crowned at last i have passed a night of uncertainty rolling about between hopes and fears as people always do when they have so much at stake let me show you your room i found a very wellfurnished apartment prepared for me looking out upon the street see you have a front view she said not extensive but still you can rise early and moralise you can see london wake up first the drowsy policeman the tired cabman and more tired horse after a night of motion seeking the stable and repose the housemaid half awake dragging on her clothes the kitchenwench washing from the steps the dirt of yesterday the milkmaids falsetto and the dustmans bass the bakers boys the early post delivery and thus from units to tens and from tens to tens of thousands and london stirs again there is poetry in that and now let us down to breakfast i always breakfast in my robe de chambre you must do the same that is if you like the fashion wheres the page lady rrang the bell of the sittingroom which she called a boudoir and a lad of fourteen in a blue blouse and leather belt made his appearance lionel breakfast in a moment vanish before the leviathan can swim a leaguebring up hot rolls and butter yes my lady replied the lad pertly ill be up again before the chap can swim a hundred yards and he shot out of the room in a second theres virtue in that boy he has wit enough for a prime minister or a clown at astleys i picked him up by a mere chance he is one of my models what her ladyship meant by models i could not imagine but i soon found out the return of the lad with breakfast put an end to her talking for the time being when we had finished the page was again summoned now then lionel do your spiriting gently i know said the boy im not to smash the cups and saucers as i did yesterday the lad collected the breakfast things on a tray with great rapidity and disappeared with such a sudden turn round that i fully anticipated he would add to yesterdays damage before he was down the stairs as soon as he was gone lady rcoming up to me said and now let me have a good look at you and then i shall be content for some time yes i was not mistaken you are a perfect model and must be my future heroine yours is just the beauty that i required there that will do now sit down and let us converse i often have wanted a companion as for an amanuensis that is only a nominal task i write as fast as most people and i cannot follow my ideas let me scribble for life as i may say and as for my writing being illegible thats the compositors concern not mine its his business to make it out and therefore i never have mine copied but i wanted a beautiful companion and friendi wouldnt have an ugly one for the world she would do me as much harm as you will do me service i am sure i hardly know how i am to do you service lady r if i do not write for you i daresay not but when i tell you that i am more than repaid by looking at you when i feel inclined you will acknowledge that you do me service but we will not enter into metaphysics or psychological questions just now it shall all be explained byandbye and now the first service i ask of you is at once to leap over the dull fortnight of gradual approaching which at last ends in intimacy i have ever held it to be a proof of the suspiciousness of our natures and unworthy you must allow me to call you valerie at once and i must entreat of you to call me sempronia your name is delightful fit for a firstclass heroine my real baptismal name is one that i have abjured and if my godfathers and godmothers did give it to me i throw it back to them with contempt what do you think it wasbarbara barbara indeed my mother had a maid called barbara shakespeare says and such a name should be associated with brooms and yellow soap call me sempronia from this time forward and you confer a favour on me and now i must write a little so take a book and a seat on the sofa for at the opening of this chapter my heroine is exactly in that position in maiden meditation fancy free chapter seven lady rsat down before her writing materials and i took my seat on the sofa as she had requested and was soon occupied with my reading i perceived that as she wrote her ladyship continually took her eyes off her paper and fixed them upon me i presumed that she was describing me and i was correct in my idea for in about halfanhour she threw down her pen and cried there i am indebted to you for the best picture of a heroine that i ever drew listen and her ladyship read to me a most flattering description of my sweet person couched in very highflown language i think lady r said i when she had finished that you are more indebted to your own imagination than to reality in drawing my portrait not so not so my dear valerie i may have done you justice but certainly not more there is nothing like having the living subject to write from it is the same as painting or drawing it only can be true when drawn from nature in fact what is writing but painting with the pen as she concluded her sentence the page lionel came in with a letter on a waiter and hearing her observation as he handed the letter he impudently observed heres somebody been painting your name on the outside of this paper and as theres pence to pay i think its rather dear for such a smudge you must not judge from outside appearance lionel replied lady r the contents may be worth pounds it is not prepossessing i grant in its superscription but may like the toad ugly and venomous wear a precious jewel in its head that was a vulgar error of former days lionel which shakespeare has taken advantage of yes that chap painted with a pen at a fine rate replied the boy as lady ropened the letter and read it you may go lionel said she putting the letter down i just wanted to know now that youve opened your toad if you have found the jewel or whether its a vulgar error its a vulgar letter at all events lionel replied her ladyship and concerns you it is from the shoemaker at brighton who requests me to pay him eighteen shillings for a pair of boots ordered by you and not paid for well my lady i do owe for the boots true enough but its impossible for me always to recollect my own affairs i am so busy with looking after yours well but now you are reminded of them lionel you had better give me the money and i will send it to him at this moment lady rstooped from her chair to pick up her handkerchief there were some sovereigns lying on the desk and the lad winking his eye at me took one up and as lady rrose up held it out to her in silence thats right lionel said lady r i like honesty yes madame replied the impudent rogue very demurely like most people who tell their own stories i was born of honest but poor parents i believe your parents were honest and now lionel to reward you i shall pay for your boots and you may keep your sovereign thank your ladyship replied the lad i forgot to say that the cook is outside for orders lady rrose and went out of the room and mr lionel laughing at me put the sovereign down with the others now i call that real honesty you saw me borrow it and now you see me pay it yes but suppose her ladyship had not given you the sovereign how would it have been then said i i should have paid her very honestly replied he if i wished to cheat her or rob her i might do so all day long she leaves her money about everywhere and never knows what she has besides if i wanted to steal i should not do so with those bright eyes of yours looking at me all the time you are a very saucy boy replied i more amused than angry its all from reading and its not my fault for her ladyship makes me read and i never yet read any book about old times in which the pages were not saucy but ive no time to talk just nowmy spoons are not clean yet so saying he quitted the room i did not know whether i ought to inform her ladyship of this freak of her pages but as the money was returned i thought i had better say nothing for the present i soon found out that the lad was correct in asserting that she was careless of her money and that if he chose he might pilfer without chance of discovery and moreover that he really was a good and honest lad only full of mischief and very impudent owing however to lady rs treatment of him for she rather encouraged his impudence than otherwise he was certainly a very clever witty boy and a very quick servant so quick indeed at his work that it almost appeared as if he never had anything to do and he had plenty of time for reading which he was very fond of lady rreturned and resumed her writing you sing do you not i think mrs bathurst told me you were very harmonious now valerie do me a favour i want to hear a voice carolling some melodious ditty i shall describe it so much better if i really heard you sing i do like reality of course you must sing without music for my country girl cannot be crossing the mead with a piano in one hand and a pail of water in the other i should think not replied i laughing but am not i too near yes rather i should prefer it on the stairs or on the first floor landing but i could not be so rude as to send you out of the room but i will go without sending replied i and i did so and having arrived at my station i sang a little french refrain which i thought would answer her ladyships purpose on my return her ladyship was writing furiously and did not appear to notice my entrance i took my seat quietly and in about ten minutes she again threw down the pen exclaiming i never wrote so effective a chapter valerie you are more precious to me than fine gold and as shylock said of his ring i would not change thee for a wilderness of monkeys i make the quotation as expressive of your value it was so kindhearted of you to comply with my wish you dont know an authors feelings you have no idea how our selflove is flattered by success and that we value a good passage in our works more than anything else in existence now you have so kindly administered to my ruling passion twice in one morning that i love you exceedingly i daresay you think me very odd and people say that i am so i may ask you to do many odd things for me but i shall never ask you to do what a lady may not do or what would be incorrect for you to do or for me to propose that you may depend upon valerie and now i close my manuscript for the present being well satisfied with the days work lady rrang the bell and on lionel making his appearance she desired him to take away her writing materials put her money into her purseif he knew where the purse wasand then asked him what were her engagements for the evening i know we have an engagement replied the boy i cant recollect it but i shall find it in the drawingroom he went out and in a minute returned i have found it my lady said he heres the ticket mrs allwood at home nine oclock mrs allwood my dear valerie is a literary lady and her parties are very agreeable the page looked at me from behind lady rs chair and shook his head in dissent shall we go continued lady r if you please madame replied i well then we will take a drive before dinner and the evening after dinner shall be dedicated to the feast of reason and the flow of soul dear me how i have inked my fingers i must go upstairs and wash them as soon as lady rleft the room master lionel began feast of reason and flow of soul i dont like such entertainment give me a good supper and plenty of champagne why what matter can it make to you said i laughing it matters a good deal i object to literary parties replied he in the first place for one respectable carriage driving up to the door there are twenty cabs and jarveys so that the company isnt so good and then at parties when there is a good supper i get my share of it in the kitchen you dont think we are idle down below i have been to mrs allwoods twice and theres no supper nothing but feast of reason which remains upstairs and theyre welcome to my share of it as for the drink its negus and cherrywater nothing else and if the flow of soul is not better than such stuff they may have my share of that also no music no dancing nothing but buzz buzz buzz wont you feel it stupid why one would think you had been upstairs instead of down lionel of course i am they press all who have liveries into the service and i hand the cakes about rather than kick for hours at the legs of the kitchentable i hear all thats said just as well as the company and ive often thought i could have given a better answer than ive heard some of your great literaries when i hand the cakes tonight take them i point out to you theyll be the best why how can you tell because i try them all before i come in the room you ought to be ashamed to acknowledge it all comes of reading miss replied he i read that in former times great people kings and princes and so on always had their victuals tasted first lest there should be poison in them so i taste upon that principle and i have been halfpoisoned sometimes at these cheap parties but im getting cunning and when i meet a suspiciouslooking piece of pastry i leave it for the company but i cant wait to talk any longer miss i must give coachman his orders i never asked you to talk mr lionel said i no you didnt but still i know you like to hear me you cant deny that now to use my ladys style i am to tell the coachman to put a girdle round the park in forty minutes so saying the lad vanished as he usually did in a second the lad was certainly right when he said that i did like to hear him talk for he amused me so much that i forgave his impudence and familiarity shortly afterwards we went out in the carriage and having driven two or three times round the park returned home to dinner at ten oclock we went to mrs allwoods party i was introduced to a great many great literary stars whom i had never before heard of but the person who attracted the most attention was a russian count who had had his ears and nose cut off by the turks it certainly did not add to his beauty however it might have to his interest however lionel was right it was a very stupid party to me all talking at once and constantly on the move to find fresh listeners it was all buzz buzz buzz and i was glad when the carriage was announced such were the events of the first day which i passed under the roof of lady r indeed this first day may be taken as a sample of most others and a month passed rapidly away each day however was marked with some peculiar eccentricity on her part but these diverted me i was often requested to do strange things in my position as a model but with all her oddities lady rwas a gentlewoman in manner and in feeling and what i should certainly have refused to anyone else i did for her without reluctance i now called her sempronia as she requested and moreover i became very intimate with master lionel who would be intimate whether or no and who like lady r was a source of great amusement at times when i was alone and communed with myself i could not help surveying my peculiar position i was engaged at a large salaryfor what to look handsome to put myself in attitudes and to do nothing this was not flattering to my talents such as i had but still i was treated with kindness and confidence was the companion of her ladyship was introduced and taken to all the parties to which she was asked and never made to feel my dependence i had already imbibed a strong friendship for lady r and i was therefore content to remain one morning she said to me my dear valerie do me the favour to tighten the laces of my stays she was as usual writing in her dressinggown oh tighter yet as tight as you can draw them that will do nicely why you can hardly breathe sempronia but i can write my dear child and as i before observed the mind and the body influence each other i am about to write a strictly moral dialogue and i never could do it unless i am straitlaced now i feel fit for the wife of cato and of rome a few days afterwards she amused me still more after writing about halfanhour she threw down her pen i never can do it come upstairs my dear valerie and help me off with my stays i must be a labandon i followed her and having removed these impediments we returned to the boudoir there said she sitting down i think i shall manage it now i feel as if i could manage what inquired i my dear i am about to write a love scene very warm and impassioned and i could not do it confined as i was now that i am loose i can give loose to the reins of my imagination and delineate with the arrow of cupids self my heroine is reclining with her hand on her cheek put yourself in that attitude my dear dear valerie as if you were meditating upon the prolonged absence of one dear to you exactly beautifultrue to naturebut i forgot a page entersdont move ill ring the bell lionel answered quickly as usual here lionel i want you to play the page ive no time for play my lady im page in earnest theres all the knives to clean never mind the knives just now observe lionel you are supposed to be sent a message to that lovely girl who is sitting absorbed in a soft reverie you enter her presence unperceived and are struck with her beauty you lean against a tree in a careless but graceful attitude with your eyes fixed upon her lovely features now lean against the door as i have described and then i shall be able to write i could not help smiling at the absurdity of this scene the more so as lionel just passing his fingers through his hair and then pulling up his shirt collar took his position saying now miss valerie well see who performs best i think you will be sooner tired of sitting than i shall be of looking at you excellent lionelexactly the position that i wished said lady r scribbling as fast as she could that stare of yours is true to naturecymon and iphigeniaa perfect tableaudont move i beg i only require ten minutes i looked up at master lionel and he made such a grimace that i could hardly keep my countenance and i did not exactly feel satisfied at thus performing as it were with a servant but still that servant was lionel who was very unlike other servants in ten minutes as promised we were released much to my satisfaction lionel went off to clean his knives and i took up my book and really when i perceived the delight of lady r at what she called her success i no longer felt anything like annoyance at having complied with her wishes one morning when lady rhad walked out and the page lionel was in the room i entered into conversation with him and asked how it was that he had been so much better educated than were lads in his position in general thats a question that i often ask myself miss valerie replied he as they say in some autobiographies the first recollection i have of myself was finding myself walking twoandtwo in a suit of pepperandsalt along with about twenty other very little boys at a cheap preparatory school kept by the misses wiggins there i remainednobody came to see me other boys talked of their papas and mammasi had none to talk about they went home at the holidays and brought back toys and plumcakes i enjoyed my holidays alone scraping holes in the gravel for want of better employment between my meals and perhaps not opening my mouth or hearing the sound of my own voice more than three or four times in the twentyfour hours as i had plenty of time for reflection during the vacations as i grew bigger i began to imagine that somehow or another i must have had a father and mother like the other boys and began to make very impertinent as i was told inquiries about them the misses wiggins gave me a good wigging as they call it for my unwarranted curiosity pointing out the indelicacy of entering upon such subjects and thus was my mouth stopped at last i grew up too big for the school and was not to be managed by two old maids and i presume it was through their representations that i was at last honoured by a visit from an old housekeeper a woman above fifty whom i never saw before i ventured to put the forbidden questions to her and she replied that i had neither father nor mother that they were both dead and that i was educated by the kindness of a great lady whose dependents they had been and that the great lady would call and see me perhaps or if she did not would send for me and do something for me well about four years ago i was then twelve years old i was told but my idea is that i am older than they say i was sent for by lady r and at first i was dressed in a turban and red jacket and sat on the floor i was told that i was to be her page and i liked it very much as i did nothing but run messages and read books which i was very fond of and lady rtook some pains with me but as i grew bigger so did i fall off from my high estate and by degrees descended from the drawingroom to the kitchen my finery was not renewed at first i had a plain suit and did my work under the footman and two years ago when the footman was sent away rather than be under the orders of another i volunteered to do the work which i have done ever since and now receive high wages and wear sugarloaf buttons as you perceive now miss valerie thats all i know of myself but i suspect that lady rknows more still it may be that what the old woman told me was correct and that i was the child of one of her favourite dependents and was educated by her in the manner that i was for you know how many odd things she does what is your other name lionel bedingfield i am told is my name replied he have you ever spoken to lady r inquired i relative to your parents i once did but she said they were sir richards people not hers that is her fathers the late baronets and that she knew nothing about them except that my father was a steward or bailiff to him in the country and that he had left directions that she should do something for me her ladyship did not appear to be inclined to talk about them much and sent me away as soon as she had told me what i now repeat to you however i have found out something since thatbut theres her ladyships knockso saying lionel vanished soon after her ladyships return madame gironac who had called upon me two or three times was announced i went out of the room and when i met her in the diningparlour she told me that she had brought some of her imitations of flowers on wax to show them to her ladyship i immediately went up and asked lady rif she would like to see them to which proposal she assented when madame gironac displayed her performances which were very natural and beautiful her ladyship was delighted and purchased several of them after which i again went downstairs and had a long conversation with my warmhearted little friend i dont like this situation of yours mademoiselle said she nor does my husband now i was thinking mademoiselle de chatenoeuf that it would not be a bad plan if you were to learn how to make those flowers i will teach you for nothing and i will teach you what i never teach my pupils which is how to prepare the wax and a great many other little secrets which are worth knowing i shall be very glad to learn my dear madame replied i but i can afford to pay you for your time and trouble and must insist upon doing so if not i will not be your pupil well well we must not quarrel about that i know that no one likes to be under an obligation especially one like youbut learn you must so let us arrange for the lessons i did so and from that day until i quitted lady r i applied myself so assiduously to the art that with the unreserved communications of madame gironac i became a proficient and could equal her own performancesmadame gironac declared that i excelled her because i had more tastebut to return after i had parted with madame gironac i went upstairs and found lady rsitting at the table looking at the purchases she had made my dear valerie cried she you dont know how you have obliged me by introducing that little woman and her flowers what a delightful and elegant employment for a heroine to undertakeso ladylike i have determined that mine shall support herself by imitating flowers in wax i am just at the point of placing her in embarrassed circumstances and did not well know how she was to gain her livelihood but thanks to you that is selected and in a most charming and satisfactory manner it is so hard to associate poverty with clean hands about a fortnight afterwards after some other conversation lady r said my dear valerie i have a surprise for you the season is nearly over and what is more important my third volume will be complete in a fortnight last night as i was wooing somnus in vain an idea came into my head i proposed going to pass the autumn at brighton as you know but last night i made up my mind that we would go over the water but whether it is to be havre or dieppe or paris or anywhere else i cannot say but certainly la belle france how do you like the idea i think of making a sort of sentimental journey we will seek adventures shall we go like rosamond and celia i with gallant curtal axe dressed as a youth shall we be mad valerie what say you i hardly knew what to say lady rappeared to have a most unusual freak in her head and to be a little more odd than usual now i had no wish to go to france as i might fall in with people whom i did not wish to see and moreover from what i had heard of her ladyships adventures in italy i was convinced that she was one of many i may say who fancy that they may do as they please out of their own country and i certainly did not wish to figure in her train i therefore replied i know my own country well lady r and there cannot be a less eligible one for a masquerade we should meet with too many desagremens if unprotected by male society and our journey would be anything but sentimental but if you do go to france does lionel accompany you well i do not know but i should like him to learn the language i think i shall take him he is a clever boy very replied i where did you pick him up he is a son of my late fathersa son of exclaimed itenant or something i was going to say continued lady r colouring but i could not recollect exactly what the man was bailiff i think i know nothing about his father but he was recommended to me by sir richard before he died recommended as a servant replied i he appears to me to be too good for so menial a position i have made him above his position valerie not that he was recommended as a servant but recommended to my care perhaps some day i may be able to do more for him you know that we are to go to lady gs ball tonight it will be a very brilliant affair she gives but one during the season and she always does the thing in good style bless me how late it is the carriage will be round in two minutes ive a round of visits to pay will you excuse me i have promised to take a lesson of madame gironac very true then i must enter upon my melancholy task alone what can be so absurd as a rational and immortal soul going about distributing pasteboard we went to lady gs ball which was very splendid i had been dancing for although i was not considered probably good enough among the young aristocrats to be made a partner for life as a partner in a waltz or quadrille i was rather in request for the odium of governess had not yet been attached to my name having never figured in that capacity in the metropolis where i was unknown i had but a short time taken my seat by lady r when the latter sprang off in a great hurry after what i could not tell and her place was immediately occupied by a lady who i immediately recognised as a lady m who had with her daughters composed a portion of the company at madame bathursts country seat have you forgotten me mademoiselle de chatenoeuf said lady m extending her hand no my lady i am glad to see you looking so well i hope your daughters are also quite well thank you they look very well in the evening but rather pale in the morning it is a terrible thing a london season very trying to the constitution but what can we do we must be out and be seen everywhere or we lose casteso many balls and parties every night the fact is that if girls are not married during the three first seasons after they come out their chance is almost hopeless for all the freshness and charm of youth which are so appetising to the other sex are almost gone no constitution can withstand the fatigue ive often compared our young ladies to the carriage horsesthey are both worked to death during the season and then turned out to grass in the country to recover themselves and come up fresh for the next winter it really is a horrible life but girls must be got off i wish mine were for what with fatigue and anxiety im worn to a shadow come mademoiselle de chatenoeuf let us go into the next room it is cooler and we shall be more quiet take my arm perhaps we shall meet the girls i accepted her ladyships invitation and we went into the next room and took a seat upon a sofa in a recess here we can talk without being overheard said lady m and now my dear young lady i know that you have left madame bathurst but why i do not know is it a secret no my lady when caroline went away i was of no further use and therefore i did not wish to remain you may perhaps know that i went to madame bathursts on a visit and that an unforeseen change of circumstances induced me to remain for some time as instructress to her niece i heard something of that sort a kind of friendly arrangement at which madame bathurst had good cause to be content im sure i should have been had i been so fortunate and now you are residing with lady r may i inquire without presuming too much in what capacity you are with lady r i went there as an amanuensis but i have never written a line lady ris pleased to consider me as a companion and i must say that she has behaved to me with great kindness and consideration i have no doubt of it replied lady m but still it appears to me excuse the liberty i take or ascribe it to a feeling of goodwill that your position with lady ris not quite what those who have an interest in you would wish everyone knows how odd she is to say the least of it and you may not be perhaps aware that occasionally her tongue outruns her discretion in your presence she of course is on her guard for she is really goodnatured and would not willingly offend anyone or hurt their feelings but when led away by her desire to shine in company she is very indiscreet i have been told that at mrs ws dinnerparty the other day to which you were not invited on your name being brought up she called you her charming model i think was the phrase and on an explanation being demanded of the term she said you stood for her heroines putting yourself in postures and positions while she drew from nature as she termed it and that moreover on being complimented on the idea and some of the young men offering or rather intimating that they would be delighted to stand or kneel at your feet as the hero of the tale she replied that she had no occasion for their services as she had a page or footman i forget which who did that portion of the work surely this cannot be true my dear mademoiselle de chatenoeuf oh how my blood boiled when i heard this how far it was true the reader already knows but the manner in which it was conveyed by lady m quite horrified me i coloured up to the temples and replied lady m that lady rhas very often when i have been sitting and she has been writing told me that she was taking me as a model for her heroine is very true but i have considered it as a mere whim of hers knowing how very eccentric she is i little thought from my having goodnaturedly yielded to her caprice that i should have been so mortified as i have been by what you have communicated to me that she must have been indiscreet is certain for it was known only to herself and me and the footman footman my lady there is a boya sort of page there exactly a lad of fifteen or sixteen a precocious pert boy who is much indulged by lady r and if report says true is nearer related to her than she is willing to acknowledge did you never observe that there is a strong likeness good heavens my lady you surprise me and i fear have also annoyed you but continued lady m laying her hand on mine i thought it kinder to let you know your peculiar position than to sneer and ridicule as others do behind your back this is a sad world in one respect if there is any scandal or false report spread against us it is known to everyone but ourselves we cannot find but rarely a friend who is so really our friend as to tell us of it the poison is allowed to circulate without the power being given to us of applying an antidoteso hollow is friendship in this world my dear mademoiselle i have done otherwise whether you thank me for it or not i cannot tell perhaps not for those who communicate unpleasant intelligence are seldom looked kindly upon lady m replied i i do thank you most heartily i do consider that you have acted a friendly part that i have been dreadfully shocked and mortified i admit continued i wiping away the tears that forced their passage but i shall not give an opportunity for future unjust insinuations or remarks as i have made up my mind that i shall leave lady ras soon as possible my dear mademoiselle i did not venture to make you acquainted with what i knew would to a person of your sensitive mind be the cause of your quitting the protection of lady rwithout having considered whether an equivalent could not be offered to you and i am happy to say that i can offer you a home and i trust comfort and consideration if you will accept of them the fact is that had i known that you had any idea of quitting madame bathurst i should have made the offer thennow i do so with all sinceritybut at present you are agitated and annoyed and i will say no more if i send the carriage for you tomorrow at two oclock will you do me the favour to come and see me i would call upon you but of course the presence of lady rwould be a check to our free converse say my dear will you come i replied in the affirmative and lady mthen rose and giving me her arm we walked back to the bench which i had left where i found lady rin a hot dispute with a member of parliament i sat down by her unnoticed and lady mhaving smiled an adieu i was left to my own reflections which were anything but agreeable my head ached dreadfully and i looked so ill that lady rs warm antagonist perceived it and pointed it out to her saying your protegee is not well i fear lady r i replied to lady r that i had a violent headache and wished to get home if it were possible she immediately consented and showed great concern as soon as we were home i need hardly say that i hastened to my room i sat down and pressed my forehead with my hands my knowledge of the world was increasing too fast i began to hate ithate men and women even more than men what lessons had i learnt within the last year first madame dalbret then madame bathurst and now lady r was there no such thing as friendship in the worldno such thing as generosity in my excited state it appeared to me that there was not all was false and hollow self was the idol of mankind and all worshipped at its altar after a time i became more composed i thought of little madame gironac and the recollection of her disinterested kindness put me in a better frame of mind mortified as i was i could not help feeling that it was only the vanity of lady rand her desire to shine to which i had been made a sacrifice and that she had no intention of wounding my feelings still to remain with her after what had been told to me by lady mwas impossible and then i reflected upon what steps i should take i did not like to tell lady rthe real grounds of my leaving her i thought it would be prudent to make some excuse and part good friends at last it occurred to me that her intention of going to france would be a good excuse i could tell her that i was afraid of meeting my relatives having decided upon this point i then canvassed the words of lady m what could she offer me in her house she had three daughters but they were all out as the phrase is and their education supposed to be completed this was a mystery i could not solve and i was obliged to give up thinking about it and at last i fell asleep the next moment i woke up jaded in mind and with a bad headache but i dressed and went down to breakfast lady rasked after my health and then said i observed you talking very confidentially with lady m i was not aware that you knew her between ourselves valerie she is one of my models indeed replied i i do not think that her ladyship is aware of the honour conferred upon her very likely not but in the last work she was portrayed to the life lady mis a schemer always plotting her great object now is to get her three daughters well married i believe that most mothers wish that lady r i grant it and perhaps manoeuvre as much but with more skill than she does for every one sees the game that she is playing and the consequence is that the young men shy off which they probably would not if she were quiet for they are really clever unaffected and natural girls very obliging and without any pride but how came you to be so intimate with lady m lady mand her eldest daughter were staying for some time with madame bathurst in the country when i was there oh i understand that accounts for it i am going to call upon lady m if she sends her carriage for me replied i she told me that she would if she could at two oclock she has proposed my paying her a visit i presume it will be after she leaves town but that you will not be able to do valerie you forget our trip to france i did not think that you were serious replied i you mentioned it as the resolution of a night and i did not know that you might not think differently upon further consideration oh no my resolutions are hastily formed but not often given up go to paris we certainly shall if you are determined upon going lady r i am afraid that i cannot accompany you indeed exclaimed her ladyship in surprise may i ask why not simply because i might meet those i am most anxious to avoid there is a portion of my history that you are not acquainted with lady r which i will now make known to you i then told her as much as i thought necessary relative to my parents and stated my determination not to run the risk of meeting them lady rargued persuaded coaxed and scolded but it was all in vain at last she became seriously angry and left the room lionel soon afterwards made his appearance and said to me in his usual familiar way whats the matter miss valerie the governess is in a rage about something she gave me a box on the ear i suppose you deserved it lionel replied i well there may be differences of opinion about that replied the boy she went on scolding me at such a rate that i was quite astonished and all about nothing she blew up cookdidnt sheblew her half up the chimneyand then she was at me again at last i could bear it no longer and i said dont flare up my lady dont my lady me cried she or ill box your ears well then as she is always angry if you call her my lady i thought she was angry with me for the same reason so i said sempronia keep your temperand didnt i get a box on the ear i could not help laughing at this recital of his cool impudence the more so as he narrated it with such an air of injured innocence indeed lionel said i at last you well deserved the box on the ear if you ever quit the service of lady r you will find that you must behave with proper respect to those above you if not you will not remain an hour in any other house lady ris very odd and very goodtempered and permits more liberties than any other person would i will however tell you why lady ris displeased it is because she wishes me to go to france with her and i have refused then you are going to leave us inquired lionel mournfully i suppose so replied i then i shall go too said the boy im tired of it but why should you go lionel you may not find another situation half so comfortable i shall not seek one i have only stayed here with the hope that i may find out from her ladyship who and what my parents were and she will not tell me i shall live by my wits never fear the worlds my oyster as shakespeare says and i think ive wit enough to open it i had not forgotten the observations of lady mrelative to lionel and what the lad now said made me surmise that there was some mystery and on examination of his countenance there was a family likeness to lady r i also called to mind her unwillingness to enter upon the subject when i brought it up but lionel said i after a pause what is it that makes you suppose that lady rconceals who were your parentswhen we last talked on the subject you said you had found out somethingshe told me that your father was a bailiff or steward to sir richard which i have proved to be false she told me that my father was sir richards butler that i have also discovered to be false for one day the old housekeeper who called upon me at school came here and was closeted with lady rfor halfanhour when she went away i called a hackneycoach for her and getting behind it went home with her to her lodgings when i found out where she lived i hastened back immediately that i might not be missed intending to have made a call upon her the next day lady rgave me a letter to put in the twopennypost it was directed to a mrs green to the very house where the hackneycoach had stopped so i knew it was for the old housekeeper instead of putting the letter in the post i kept it till the evening and then took it myself mrs green said i for i found her at home with another old woman sitting over their tea i have brought you a letter from lady r this is about a year ago miss valerie mercy on me said she how strange that lady rshould send you here not strange that she should send a letter by a servant said i only strange that i should be a servant i said this miss valerie as a random throw just to see what answer she would make why who has been telling you anything said she looking at me through her spectacles ah replied i thats what i must keep to myself for im under a promise of secrecy mercy on me it couldnt beno thats impossible muttered the old woman as she opened the letter and took out a banknote which she crumpled up in her hand she then commenced reading the letter i walked a little way from her and stood between her and the window every now and then she held the letter up to the candle and when the light was strong upon it i could read a line from where i stood for i have been used to her ladyships writing as you know one line i read was remains still at culverwood hall another was the only person now left in essex i also saw the words secrecy and ignorant at the bottom of the page the old woman finished the letter at last but it took her a good while to get through it well says she have you anything more to say no says i you are well paid for your secrecy mrs green what do you mean said she oh im not quite so ignorant as you suppose replied i ignorant said she confused ignorant of what when were you last in essex said i when why whats that to you you impudent boy nay then ill put another question to you how long is it since you were at culverwood hall culverwood hall what do you know about culverwood hall the boys mad i believe go away youve done your message if you dont ill tell her ladyship certainly mrs green said i i wish you a goodnight i left the room slamming the door but not allowing the catch to fall in so that i held it a little ajar and then i heard mrs green say to the other woman somebodys been with that boy i wonder who it can be hes put me in such a flurry well these things will out yes yes its like murder replied the other not that i know what its all about only i see theres a secretperhaps youll tell me mrs green all i dare tell you is that there is a secret replied mrs green and the boy has got an inkling of it somehow or another i must see my ladyno i had better not added she for she is so queer that shell swear that ive told him now theres only one besides myself and her ladyship who knows anything and ill swear that he could not have been with the boy for hes bedridden im all of a puzzle and thats the truth what a wind there is why the boy has left the door open boys never shut doors mrs green got up and slammed the door to and i walked off and now miss valerie thats all that i know of the matter but why i should be sent to a good school and wear pepper and salt and to be taken away to be made first a page and now a footman i cant tell but you must acknowledge that there is some mystery after what i have told you it certainly is strange lionel replied i but my advice is that you remain patiently till you can find it out which by leaving lady ryou are not likely to do i dont know that miss valerie let me get down to culverwood hall and i think i would find out something or my wits were given me to no purpose but i hear her ladyship coming upstairs so goodbye miss valerie and lionel made a hasty retreat lady rslowly ascended the stairs and came into the room her violence had been exhausted but she looked sullen and moody and i could hardly recognise her for i must do her the justice to say that i had never before seen her out of temper she sat down in her chair and i asked her whether i should bring her her writing materials a pretty state i am in to write replied she leaning her elbows on the table and pressing her hands to her eyes you dont know what a rage i have been in and how i have been venting it upon innocent people i struck that poor boyshame on me alas i was born with violent passions and they have been my curse through life i had hoped that years had somewhat subdued them but they will occasionally master me what would i not give to have had your placid temper valerie how much unhappiness i should have been spared how much error should i have avoided i was going to say how much crime lady rwas evidently more talking to herself than to me when she said the last words and i therefore made no reply a silence of more than a quarter of an hour followed which was broken by lionel coming in and announcing the carriage of lady m that woman is the cause of all this said lady r i am sure that she is pray do not wait valerie go and see her i shall be better company when you come back i made no reply but left the room and putting on my bonnet was driven to lady ms she received me with great cordiality and so did her daughters who were in the room but they were dismissed by their mother who then said i told you last night my dear mademoiselle de chatenoeuf that i wished you to reside with me you may say in what capacity and i acknowledge that i hardly know what answer to give not as governess certainly for i consider it an odious position and one that i could not offer you indeed my girls do not require teaching as they have finished their studies in only one thing you could be of advantage to them in that respect which is in music and singing but i wish you to come as their companion as i am convinced that they will gain much by your so doing i wish you therefore to be considered by others as a visitor at the house but at the same time i must insist that from the advantages my girls will derive from your assisting them in music and singing you will accept the same salary per annum which you have from lady r do you understand me i wish you to remain with me not as a model after the idea of lady r but as a model for my girls to take pattern by i shall leave it to yourself to act as you please i am sure my girls like you already and will like you better i do not think that i can say more except that i trust you will not refuse my offer there was a delicacy and kindness in this proposal on the part of lady mwhich i felt gratefully but it appeared to me that after all it was only an excuse to offer me an asylum without any remuneration on my part and i stated my feeling on that point do not think so replied lady m i avoided saying so because i would not have you styled a musicmistress but on that one point alone you will more than earn your salary as i will prove to you by showing you the annual payments to professors for lessons but you will be of great value to me in other points i have no doubt may i therefore consider it as an affaire arrangee after a little more conversation i acquiesced and having agreed that i would come as soon as lady rwent to the continent or at all events in three weeks when lady mquitted london i took my leave and was conveyed back to lady r in the carriage which had been sent for me on my return i found lady rseated where i had left her well said she so you have had your audience and i have no doubt but that you were most graciously received oh i know the woman and i have been reflecting upon it during your absence and i have discovered what she wants you for but this she has not mentioned not even hinted at she knows better but when once in her house you will submit to it rather than be again in search of a home i really do not know what you mean lady r said i has not lady masked you to come as a visitor without specifying any particular employment no she has not she has proposed my staying in the house to give lessons to her daughters in music and to be their companion but there is nothing stated as to a fixed residence with her well valerie i know that i am odd but you will soon find out whether you have gained by the change lady r i really do not consider you should be so sarcastic or unkind towards me i do not like to go to france with you for reasons which i have fully explained at the expense of disclosing family affairs which i had much rather not have mentioned you leave me by myself and i must seek protection somewhere it is kindly offered by lady m and in my unfortunate position i have not to choose be just and be generous well well i will said lady r the tears starting in her eyes but you do not know how much i am annoyed at your leaving me i had hoped with all my faults that i had created in you a feeling of attachment to megod knows that i have tried if you knew all my history valerie you would not be surprised at my being strange that occurred when i was of your age which would have driven some people to despair or suicide as it is it has alienated me from all my relations not that i have many my brother i never see or hear from and have not for years i have refused all his invitations to go down to see him and he is now offended with me but there are causes for it and years cannot wipe away the memory of what did occur i assure you lady r i have been very sensible of your kindness to me replied i and shall always remember it with gratitude and if you think i have no regard for you you are mistaken but the subject has become painfulpray let us say no more well valerie be it so perhaps it is the wisest plan to change the conversation i saidis not your brother the present baronet yes replied lady r and where does he reside in essex at culverwood hall the seat of all my misfortunes i started a little at the mention of the place as it was the one which the reader may remember was spoken of by lionel i then turned the conversation to other matters and by dinnertime lady rhad recovered herself and was as amiable as ever from that day until lady rset off for paris there was not a word said relative to lady m she was kind and polite but not so warm and friendly as she had been before and in her subdued bearing towards me was more agreeable her time was now employed in making preparations for her tour lionel was the only one who was to accompany her except her own maid at last she fixed the day of her departure and i wrote to lady m who returned an answer that it suited her exactly as she would go to the country the day after the evening before lady rwas to start was passed very gloomily i felt great sorrow at our separation more than i could have imagined but when you have been associated with a person who is goodtempered and kind you soon feel more for them than you would suppose until you are about to quit them lady rwas very much dispirited and said to me valerie i have a presentiment that we never shall meet again and yet i am anything but superstitious i can truly say that you are the only person to whom i have felt real attachment since my youth and i feel more than i can describe something whispers to me do not go to france and yet something impels me to go valerie if i do come back i trust that you will consider my house your home if at any time you cannot place yourself more to your satisfaction i will not say more as i know that i am not exactly a lovable person and my ways are odd but do pray look upon me as your sincere friend who will always be ready to serve you i have to thank you for a few happy months and that is saying much god bless you my dear valerie i was moved to tears by what lady rsaid and i thanked her with a faltering voice come now said she i shall be off too early in the morning to see you let us take our farewell lady rput a small packet into my hand kissed me on the forehead and then hastened up to her own room that people love change is certain but still there is a mournfulness connected with it even in a change of residence the packing up the litter attending it the corded trunks and packages give a forlorn appearance to the house itself to me it was peculiarly distressing i had changed so often within the last year and had such a precarious footing wherever i went i felt myself to be the sport of fortune and a football to the whims and caprices of others i was sitting in my bedroom my trunks packed but not yet closed down thinking of lady rs last conversation and very triste the packet was lying on the table before me unopened when i was roused by a knock at the door i thought it was lady rs maid and i said come in the door opened and lionel made his appearance is it you lionel what do you want i knew that you were up and i recollected as we leave before you do tomorrow that you would have no one to cord your luggage so i thought i would come up and do it for you tonight miss valerie if it is ready thank you lionel it is very considerate of you i will lock the trunks up and you can cord them outside lionel took out the trunks and corded them in the passage when he had finished he said to me good bye miss valerie you will see me again very soon see you very soon lionel i am afraid there is no chance of that for lady rintends to stay abroad for six months i do not replied he why lionel it would be very foolish for you to give up such a good situation you have such unusual wages twenty pounds a year is it not yes miss valerie i should not get half that in another situation but that is one reason why i am going to leave why should she give me twenty pounds a year i must find out why and find out i will as i said to you before she dont give me twenty pounds for my beauty although she might give you a great deal more and yet not pay you half enough well lionel i think you have been here long enough it is too late to sit up to pay compliments fare you well i shut my door upon him gently and then went to bed as usual after excitement i slept long and soundly when i awoke the next morning i found it was broad day and nearly ten oclock i rang the bell and it was answered by the cook who told me that she and i were the only people in the house i rose and as i passed by my table i perceived another package lying by the side of the one which lady rhad given me it was addressed to me and i opened it it contained a miniature of lady rwhen she was about my age and very beautiful she must have been it was labelled sempronia at eighteen keep it for my sake dear valerie and do not open the paper accompanying it until you have my permission or you hear of my being no more i laid the miniature down and opened the first packet given me by lady r it contained banknotes to the amount of one hundred pounds nearly double the salary due to me the contents of both these packets only made me feel more melancholy and i sighed heavily as i put them in my dressingcase but time ran on and i had agreed to be at lady ms at one oclock when the carriage would be sent for me i therefore hastened my toilet closed the remainder of my luggage and went down to the breakfast which the cook had prepared for me while i was at breakfast a letter was brought by the post it had been directed to madame bathurst and was redirected to lady rs address it was from madame paon and as follows my dear mademoiselle de chatenoeuf as i take it for granted that you do not see the french papers i write to tell you that your predictions relative to monsieur g have all proved correct a month after the marriage he neglected madame and spent his whole time at the gamingtable only returning home to obtain fresh supplies from her these were at last refused and in his rage he struck her a suit for separation of person and property was brought into court last week and terminated in favour of madame dalbret who retains all her fortune and is rid of a monster she came to me yesterday morning and showed me the letter which you had written to her asking me whether i did not correspond with you and whether i thought that after her conduct you could be prevailed upon to return to her of course i could not give any opinion but i am convinced that if you only say that you forgive her that she will write to you and make the request i really do not well see how you can do otherwise after the letter which you wrote to her but of course you will decide for yourself i trust mademoiselle you will favour me with a speedy answer as madame dalbret is here every day and is evidently very impatienti am my dear mademoiselle yours emile paon nee merce to this letter i sent the following reply by that days post my dear madame paon that i sincerely forgive madame dalbret is true i do so from my heart but although i forgive her i cannot listen to any proposal to resume the position i once held recollect that she has driven all over paris and accused me among all her friends of ingratitude and slander how then after having been discarded for such conduct could i again make my appearance in her company either i have done as she has stated and if so am unworthy of her patronage or i have not done so and therefore have been cruelly used made to feel my dependence in the bitterest way having been dismissed and thrown upon the world with loss of character could i ever feel secure or comfortable with her after such injustice or could she feel at her ease on again presenting one as her protegee whom she had so illtreated would she not have to blush every time that she met with any of our former mutual friends and acquaintances it would be a series of humiliations to us both assure her of my forgiveness and goodwill and my wishes for her happiness but to return to her is impossible i would rather starve if she knew what i have suffered in consequence of her hasty conduct towards me she would pity me more than she may do now but what is done is done there is no remedy for it adieu madame paon many thanks for your kindness to one so fallen as i am yours truly and sincerely valerie i wrote the above under great depression of spirits and it was with a heavy heart that i afterwards alighted at lady ms residence in st jamess square if smiles however and cordial congratulations and shakes of the hand could have consoled me they were not wanting on the part of lady mand her daughters i was shown all the rooms below then lady ms room the young ladies rooms and lastly my own and was truly glad when i was at last left alone to unpack and arrange my things the room allotted to me was very comfortable and better furnished than those in which the young ladies slept and as far as appearances went i was in all respects treated as a visitor and not as a governess the maid who attended me was very civil and as she assisted and laid my dresses in the wardrobe made no attempt to be familiar i ought to have informed the reader that lady mwas a widow lord mhaving died about two years before her eldest son the present lord m was on the continent dinner was announced there were only two visitors and i was treated as one of the company in fact nothing could be more gratifying than the manner in which i was treated in the evening i played and sang the young ladies did the same their voices were good but they wanted expression in their singing and i perceived that i could be useful lady masked me when we were not overheard what i thought of her daughters singing i told her frankly it is impossible to doubt the truth of what you say my dear mademoiselle de chatenoeuf after having heard your performance i knew that you were considered a good performer but i had no idea of the perfection which you have arrived at if your daughters are really fond of music they would soon do as well my lady replied i impossible exclaimed her ladyship but still they must gain something from listening to you you look fatigued do you wish to go to bed augusta will go up with you i have a nervous headache replied i and i will accept your ladyships considerate proposal augusta the eldest daughter lighted a chambercandle and went up with me into my room after a little conversation she wished me goodnight and thus passed the first day in st jamess square chapter eight as arranged by lady m the next day we went to harking castle the family seat in dorsetshire and i was not sorry to be again quiet after the noise and bustle of a london season as lady mhad observed the young ladies were sadly jaded with continual late hours and hot rooms but they had not been a week in the country before they were improved in appearance and complexion they certainly were amiable nice girls clever and without pride and i soon became attached to them i attended to their music and they made great progress i also taught them the art of making flowers in wax which i had so lately learned myself this was all i could do except mildly remonstrating with them when i saw what did not appear to me to be quite correct in their conduct and deportment lady mappeared quite satisfied and treated me with great consideration and i was in a short time very happy in my new position for the first month there were no visitors in the house after that invitations were sent out lady mhad said that she would have a months quiet to recover herself from the fatigues of the season and i had no doubt but that she also thought her daughters would be much benefited as they really were by a similar retirement it was on the monday that company was expected and on friday lady mdesired augusta the eldest daughter to put on a new dress which had just been made by the two ladysmaids and come down in it that she might see it on when augusta made her appearance and her mother had surveyed the dress she said i do not quite like it augusta and yet i do not exactly know where its wrong but something requires to be altered it does not hang gracefully as she said this i was reading a book and i naturally looked up and immediately perceived the alteration which the dress required i pointed it out and with a few pins made the dress sit well why this is a new talent my dear mademoiselle de chatenoeuf one that i had no idea that you possessed although i admit that no one dresses more elegantly than you do said lady m how much i am obliged to you for taking so much trouble i am most happy to be of any service lady m and you may always command me replied i i have the credit of being a very good milliner i believe you can do anything replied lady m augusta go up to benson and show her the alterations that are required and tell her to make them directly after all continued lady m to me it is bad economy making dresses at home but i really cannot afford to pay the extravagant prices charged by madame desbelli my bills are monstrous and my poverty but not my will consents still it does make such a difference in the appearance being welldressed that if i could i never would have a dress made at home but the saving is astonishing nearly twothirds i assure you if you will allow me to interfere a little my lady replied i i think you can have them as well made at home as by madame desbelli i think i can be useful you are very kind mademoiselle de chatenoeuf but it will be taxing you too much not at all lady m if i have your sanction you shall do just as you please my dear replied lady m i give you full authority over the whole household if you wish it but indeed i think benson will be much obliged to you for any slight hint that you may give her and i am sure that i shall but the carriage is at the doordo you drive today not today i thank you lady m replied i well then i will take hortense and amy with me and leave augusta with you after lady ms departure i went up to the room where the maids were at work i altered the arrangement of augustas dress so as to suit her figure and cut out the two others for hortense and amy wishing to please lady m i worked myself at augustas dress and had it completed before lady mhad returned from her drive it certainly was now a very different affair and augusta looked remarkably well in it she was delighted herself and hastened down to her mother to show it to her when i came down to dinner lady mwas profuse in her acknowledgments the two other dresses when finished gave equal satisfaction and from that time till the period of my quitting lady m all the dresses not only of the young ladies but those of lady m were made at home and my taste and judgment invariably appealed to and most cheerfully given i felt it my duty to be of all the use that i could be and perhaps was not a little gratified by the compliments i received upon my exquisite taste time passed on during the shooting season augusta the eldest daughter received a very good offer which was accepted and at the christmas festivities hortense the second girl accepted another proposal which was also very favourable lady mwas delighted at such success is it not strange my dear mademoiselle de chatenoeuf that i have been fagging two seasons night and day to get husbands for those girls and now alone here in solitude and retirement almost they have both obtained excellent establishments i do really declare that i believe it is all owing to you and the delightful manner in which you have dressed them i should rather think that it is owing in the first place to their having so much improved in personal appearance since they have been down in the country replied i and further to the gentlemen having now an opportunity of discovering their truly estimable qualities which they were not likely to do at almacks or other parties during a london season you may think so replied lady m but it is my conviction that all is owing to their being so tastefullydressed why every one admires the elegance of their costume and requests patterns well now i have only amy on my hands and i think that her sisters high connections will assist in getting her off she is a sweet girl amy replied i and were i you lady m i should be in no hurry to part with her indeed but i am replied lady m you dont know the expense of girls and my jointure is not so very large however i must not complain dont you think amy looks better in lilac than any other colour she looks well in almost any colour replied i yes with your taste i grant replied lady m are you aware that we go to town in a fortnight we must look after the trousseaux it was arranged last night that both marriages shall take place in february amy will of course be one of the bridesmaids and i trust to you my dear mademoiselle de chatenoeuf to invent something very distingue for her on that occasion who knows but that it may get her off but its late so goodnight i could not admire lady ms apparent hurry to get rid of her daughters but it certainly was the one thing needful which had occupied all her thoughts and attention during the time that i had been with her that it was natural she should wish that her children were well established i granted but all that she appeared to consider was good connection and the means of living in good style every other point as to the character of the husbands being totally overlooked a fortnight after christmas we all went to london and were as lady m had observed very busy with the trousseaux when one day the butler came to say that a young gentleman wished to see me and was waiting in the breakfast parlour below i went down wondering who it could be when to my surprise i found lionel the page of lady r dressed in plain clothes and certainly looking very much like a gentleman he bowed very respectfully to me when he entered much more so than he had ever done when he was a page with lady r and said miss valerie i have ventured to call upon you as i thought when we parted that you did me the honour to feel some little interest about me and i thought you would like to know what has taken place i have been in england now four months and have not been idle during that time i am certainly glad to see you lionel although i am sorry you have left lady r and i hope you have been satisfied with the result of your inquiries it is rather a long story miss valerie and if you wish to hear it you will oblige me by sitting down while i narrate it to you i hope it will not be too long lionel as i shall be wanted in an hour or so to go out with lady m but i am ready to hear you continued i sitting down as he requested lionel stood by me and then commencedwe arrived at dover the evening of the day that we left miss valerie and lady r who had been in a state of great agitation during the journey was so unwell that she remained there four or five days as soon as she was better i thought it was advisable that she should settle my book and pay me my wages before we left england and i brought it to her stating my wish as the sum was then very large and what do you want money for said she rather angrily i want to place it in safety my lady replied i thats as much as to say that it is not safe with me no my lady replied i but suppose any accident were to happen to you abroad would your executors ever believe that you owed more than pounds besides a years wages to a page like me they would say that it could not be and would not pay me my money neither would they believe that you gave me such wages well she replied there is some truth in that and it will perhaps be better that i do pay you at once but where will you put the money lionel i will keep the check my lady if you please then i will write it to order and not to bearer replied she and then if you lose it it will not be paid for it will require your own signature thank you my lady replied i having examined my accounts and my wages due she gave me a check for the full amount the next morning the packet was to sail at nine oclock we were in good time and as soon as lady rwas on board she went down into the cabin her maid asked me for the bottle of salts which i had purposely left under the sofa pillow at the ship hotel i told her that i had left it and as there was plenty of time would run and fetch it i did so but contrived not to be back until the steamer had moved away from the pier and her paddles were in motion i called out stop stop knowing of course that they would not although they were not twenty yards away i saw lady rs maid run to the captain and speak to him but it was of no use and thus i was left behind without lady rhaving any suspicion that it was intentional on my part i waited at the pier till the packet was about two miles off and then walked away from the crowd of people who were bothering me with advice how to proceed so that i might join my mistress at calais i returned to the hotel for a portion of my clothes which i had not sent on board of the packet but had left in charge of the boots and then sat down in the tap to reflect upon what i should do my first object was to get rid of my sugarloaf buttons for i hated livery miss valerie perhaps it was pride but i could not help it i walked out till i came to a slopsellers as they call them at seaports and went in there was nothing hanging up but seamens clothes and on reflection i thought i could not do better than to dress as a sailor so i told the man that i wanted a suit of sailors clothes you want to go to sea i suppose said the man not guessing exactly right considering that i just refused to embark however i bargained first for a complete suit and then sold him my liveries exchanging my dress in the back parlour i then returned to the tap obtained my other clothes and as soon as the coach started got outside and arrived in london i called upon you at this house and found that you were in the country and then i resolved that i would go down to culverwood hall and now you must leave off lionel for the present said i for i must go out with lady m come tomorrow early and i shall have leisure to hear the rest of your story the following morning lionel returned and resumed his history miss valerie little things often give you more trouble than greater and i had more difficulty to find out where culverwood hall was than you may imagine i asked many at the inn where i put up but no one could tell me and at such places i was not likely to find any book which i could refer to i went to the coach offices and asked what coaches started for essex and the reply was where did i want to go and when i said culverwood hall no one could tell me by which coach i was to go or which town it was near at last i did find out from the porter of the saracens head who had taken in parcels with that address and who went to the coachman who said that his coach passed within a mile of sir alexander moystyns who lived there i never knew her ladyships maiden name before i took my place by the coach for i had gone to the bankers in fleet street and received the money for my check and started the next morning at three oclock i was put down at a village called westgate at an inn called the moystyn arms i kept to the dress of a sailor and when the people spoke to me on the coach kept up the character as well as i could which is very easy to do when you have to do with people who know nothing about it i shivered my timbers and all that sort of thing and hitched up my trousers as they do at the theatres the coachman told me that the inn was the nearest place i could stop at if i wanted to go to the hall and taking my bundle i got down and he drove off a sailorboy is a sort of curiosity in a country village miss valerie and i had many questions put to me but i answered them by putting others i said that my friends were formerly living at the hall in the old baronets time but that i knew little about them as it was a long while ago and i asked if there were any of the old servants still living at the place the woman who kept the inn told me that there was one old roberts who still lived in the village and been bedridden for some years this of course was the person i wanted and i inquired what had become of his family the reply was that his daughter who had married green was somewhere in london and his son who had married kitty wilson of the village had gone to reside as gamekeeper somewhere near portsmouth and had a large family of children youre right enough replied i laughing we are a large family what are you old roberts grandson exclaimed the woman well we did hear that one of them harry i think did go to sea well now perhaps youll tell me where i am to find the old gentleman replied i come with me said she he lives hardby and glad enough hell be poor man to have any one to talk with him a bit for its a lonesome life he leads in bed there i followed the woman and when about a hundred yards from the inn she stopped at the door of a small house and called to mrs meshin to go up and tell old roberts that one of his grandsons is here a snuffy old woman made her appearance peered at me through her spectacles and then stumped up a pair of stairs which faced the door shortly afterwards i was desired to come up and did so i found an old man with silver hair lying in bed and the said mrs meshin with her spectacles smoothing down the bedclothes and making the place tidy what cheer old boy said i after tp cookes style what do you say im hard of hearing rather replied the old man how do you find yourself sir said i oh pretty well for an old man and so youre my grandson harry glad to see youyou may go mrs meshin and shut the door and do you hear dont listen at the keyhole the stately lady mrs meshin growled and then left the room slamming the door she is very cross grandson said the old man and i see nobody but her its a sad thing to be bedridden this way and not to get out in the fresh air and sadder still to be tended by a cross old woman who wont talk when i want her and wont hold her tongue when i want her im glad to see you boy i hope you wont go away directly as your brother tom did i want somebody to talk to me sadly and how do you like being at sea i like the shore better sir ay so all sailors say i believe and yet i would rather go to sea than lie here all day long its all owing to my being out as i used to do night after night watching for poachers i had too little bed then and now ive too much of it but the sea must be grand as the bible says they who go upon the great waters they see the wonders of the deep i was glad to find that the old man was so perfect in all his mental faculties and after having listened to rather than replied to observations about his son and my supposed brothers and sisters by which i obtained a pretty accurate knowledge of them i wished him goodbye and promised to call and have a long talk in the morning on my return to the inn i was able to reply to all the interrogatories which were put to me relative to my supposed relations thanks to the garrulity of old roberts and put many questions relative to the family residing at the hall which were freely answered as the evening advanced many people came in and the noise and smoking were so disagreeable to me that i asked for a bed and retired the next morning i repaired to old roberts who appeared delighted to see me you are a good boy said he to come and see a poor bedridden old man who has not a soul that comes near him perhaps in a week and now tell me what took place during your last voyage the last vessel i was on board of replied i was a packet from dover to calais well that must be pleasant so many passengers yes sir and who do you think i saw on board of the packet the other daysomebody that you know ay who why lady r replied i and that young gentleman who i heard say once lived with her as her servant ay said the old man indeed then she has done justice at last im glad on it harry glad on it for its a relief to my mind i was bound to the secret and have kept it but when a man is on the brink of the grave he does not like to have a secret like that upon his mind and ive more than once talked to my daughter about what aunt green yes your aunt green but she would never listen to me we both took our oath and she said it was binding besides we were paid for it well well i thank god for its a great load off my mind yes sir replied i you need not keep the secret any longer now and how has he grown up said the old man is he goodlooking very much so sir replied i and looks very much like a gentleman i could not help laughing at this part of lionels story although i could not but admit the truth lionel observed it and said you cannot be surprised at my giving myself a good character miss valerie for as they say in the kitchen its all that a poor servant has to depend upon go on replied i he was a very fine child while he lived with us but he was taken away at six years old and i have never seen him since some people say that he is very like lady r well why should he not be ay she was once a very beautiful young person well grandfather i have never heard the rights of that story said i and now that you are at liberty to tell it perhaps you will let me have the whole history well said the old man as there is no longer a secret i do not know but that i may your aunt green you know was nurse to lady r and remained in the family for years afterwards for old sir alexander moystyn was confined to his room for years with gout and other complaints and your aunt green attended him it was just as sir alexander had recovered from a very bad fit that miss ellen who was lady rs sister and years younger than she was made her runaway match with colonel dempster a very fashionable gay young man who had come down here to shoot with the present baronet everyone was much surprised at this for all the talk was that the match would be with the eldest sister lady r and not the youngest they went off somewhere abroad old sir alexander was in a terrible huff about it and was taken ill again and lady r who was then miss barbara appeared also much distressed at her sisters conduct well a year or more passed away when one day miss barbara told your aunt green that she wished her to go with her on a journey and she set off in the evening with four posthorses and travelled all night till she arrived at southampton there she stopped at a lodging and got out spoke to the landlady and calling my daughter out of the chaise desired her to remain below while she went upstairs my daughter was tired of staying so long for she remained there for five hours and miss barbara did not make her appearance but they appeared to be very busy in the house running up and downstairs at last a grave person who appeared to be a doctor came into the parlour followed by the landladyin the parlour in which my daughter was sitting its all over mrs wilson said he nothing could save her but the child will do well i have no doubt whats to be done sir oh replied the doctor the lady above stairs told me that she was her sister so of course we must look to her for all future arrangements after giving a few directions about the infant the doctor left the house and soon after that miss barbara came downstairs im quite worn out martha said she let us go to the hotel as fast as we can you sent away the carriage of course i would it had remained for i shall hardly be able to walk so far she took her arm and as the landlady opened the door she said i will call tomorrow and give directions about the infant and everything which is necessaryi never went through such a trying scene said miss barbara she was an old schoolfellow of mine who entreated me to come to her in her distress she died giving birth to her infant and it was i presume with that presentiment that she sent for me and entreated me on her deathbed to protect the unfortunate child for she has been cast away by her relations in consequence of her misconduct you have never had the smallpox martha have you no miss she replied you know i never have well it was having the smallpox at the same time that she was confined that has caused her death and that was the reason why i did not send for you to come up and assist my daughter made no answer for miss barbara was of a haughty temper and she was afraid of her but she did not forget that the doctor had told the landlady that miss barbara had stated the lady to be her sister my daughter had thought it very odd that miss barbara had not told her during their journey where she was going and who she was going to see for miss barbara had wrapped herself up in her cloak and pretended to be asleep during the whole time only waking up to pay the postboys but miss barbara was of a very violent temper and had since her sisters marriage been much worse than before indeed some said that she was a little mad and used to walk at moonlights when they arrived at the hotel miss barbara went to bed and insisted upon my daughter sleeping in the same room as she was afraid of being alone in an hotel my daughter thought over the business as she lay in bed and at last resolved to ascertain the truth so she got up early the next morning and walked to the lodginghouse and when the door was opened by the landlady pretended to come from her mistress to inquire how the infant was the reply was that it was doing well and then a conversation took place in which my daughter found out that the lady did not die of the smallpox as miss barbara had stated the landlady asked my daughter if she would not like to come up and look at the corpse my daughter consented as it was what she was about to request and when she went up sure enough it was poor mrs dempster miss ellen that was who had run away with the colonel ant it a pity maam said the landlady her husband died only two months ago and they say he was so handsome a man indeed he must have been for heres his picture which the poor lady wore round her neck when your aunt had satisfied herself and cried a little over the body for she was very fond of miss ellen she went back to the hotel as fast as she could and getting a jug of warm water from the kitchen she went into miss barbaras room and had just time to throw off her bonnet and shawl when miss barbara woke up and asked who was there its me miss replied my daughter ive just gone down for some warm water for you for its past nine oclock and i thought you would like to be up early yes i must get up martha for i intend to return home today its no use waiting here i will have breakfast and then walk to the lodgings and give directions you may pack up in the meantime for i suppose you do not wish to go with me oh no miss replied your aunt i am frightened out of my wits at having been in the house already now that i know that the lady died of the smallpox well miss barbara went away after breakfast and remained for two or three hours when she returned a servant bringing the baby with her my daughter had packed up everything and in halfanhour they were on the road back the baby with them in my daughters arms now you see if it had not been for the accidental remark of the doctors in your aunts presence she would have been completely deceived by miss barbara and never would have known whose child it was but your aunt kept her own counsel indeed she was afraid to do otherwise as they went home miss barbara talked a great deal to your aunt telling her that this mrs bedingfield was a great friend of hers with whom she had corresponded for years after they had left school that her husband had been killed in a duel a short time before that he was a gambler and a man of very bad character nevertheless she had promised mrs bedingfield before she died that she would take care of the child and that she would do so she then said martha i should like your mother to take charge of it do you think that she would but it must be a secret for my father would be very angry with me and besides there might be unpleasant reports your aunt replied that she thought that her mother would and then miss barbara proposed that your aunt should get out of the chaise when they stopped to change horses at the last stage when it was dark and no one could perceive it and walk with the infant until she could find some conveyance to my house this was done the child was brought to your grandmother who is now in heaven and then your aunt made known to us what she had discovered and whose child it was i was very angry and if i had not been laid up at the time with the rheumatism would have gone right into sir alexanders room and told him who the infant was but i was overruled by your grandmother and your aunt who then went away and walked to the hall so we agreed that we would say exactly what miss barbara said to us when she came over to us on the next day well then lionel i have to congratulate you on being the son of a gentleman and the nephew of lady r i wish you joy with all my heart said i extending my hand thank you miss valerie it is true that i am so but proofs are still to be given but of that hereafter lionel you have been standing all this while i think it would be most uncourteous if i did not request you to take a chair lionel did so and then proceeded with the old mans narrative about a month after this sir richard rcame down and after three weeks was accepted by miss barbara it was a hasty match everyone thought especially as the news of mrs dempsters death had as it was reported been received by letter and all the family had gone into mourning poor old sir alexander never held up his head afterwards and in two months more he was carried to the family vault your aunt then came home to us and as you have heard married poor green who was killed in a poaching business about three months after his marriage then came your poor grandmothers death of a quinsy and so i was left alone with your aunt green who then took charge of the child who had been christened by the name of lionel bedingfield there was some talk about the child and some wonders whose it could be but after the death of sir alexander and miss barbara had gone away with her husband nothing more was thought or said about it and now boy ive talked enough for today tomorrow ill tell you the rest of the history perhaps miss valerie you think the same of me and are tired with listening observed lionel not at all and i have leisure now which i may not have another time besides your visits if so frequent may cause inquiries and i shall not know what to say well then ill finish my story this morning miss valerie the next day old roberts continued it was about three months after sir alexanders death when her brother the new baronet came down to culverwood hall that miss barbara made her appearance again as lady r your grandmother was just buried and poor green had not been dead more than a month your aunt who was much afflicted at the loss of her husband and was of course very grave and serious began to agree with me that it would be very wicked of us knowing whose child it was to keep the secret moreover you aunt had become very fond of the infant for it in a manner consoled her for the loss of her husband lady r came to the cottage to see us and we then both told her that we did not like to keep secret the childs parentage as it was doing a great injustice if injustice had not been done already lady rwas very much frightened at what we said and begged very hard that we would not expose her she would be ruined she said in the opinion of her husband and also of her own relations she begged and prayed so hard and made a solemn promise to us that she would do justice to the child as soon as she could with prudence that she overcame our scruples and we agreed to say nothing at present she also put a banknote for pounds into my daughters hands to defray expenses and pay for trouble and told her that the same amount would be paid every year until the child was taken away i believe this did more to satisfy our scruples than anything else it ought not to have done so but we were poor and money is a great temptation at all events we were satisfied with lady rs promise and with her liberality and from that time till the child was seven years old we received the money and had charge of the boy he was then taken away and sent to school but where we did not know for some time lady rwas still very liberal to us always stating her intention of acknowledging the child to be her nephew at last my daughter was summoned to london and sent to the school for the boy lady rstating it to be her intention of keeping him at her own house now that her husband was dead this rejoiced us very much but we had no idea that it was as a servant that he was to be employed as your aunt afterwards found out when she went up to london and called unexpectedly upon lady r however lady rsaid that what she was doing was for the best and was more liberal than usual and that stopped our tongues three years back your aunt left this place to find employment in london and has resided there ever since as a clearstarcher and getterup of lace but she often sends me down money quite sufficient to pay for all the few comforts and expenses required by a bedridden old man there harry now ive told you the whole story and i am glad that i am able to do so and that at last she has done justice to the lad and there is no further a load upon my conscience which often caused me to lay down my bible when i was reading and sigh but said i are you sure that she has acknowledged him as her nephew am i sure why did not you say so no i only said that he was with her travelling in her company well buti understood you that it was all right it may be all right replied i but how can i tell i only saw them together lady rmay still keep her secret for all i can say to the contrary i dont wonder at its being a load on your mind i shouldnt be able to sleep at nights and as for my reading my bible i should think it wicked to do so with the recollection always before me that i had been a party in defrauding a poor boy of his name and perhaps fortune dear me dear me ive often thought as much harry yes grandfather and as you say on the brink of the grave who knows but you may be called away this very night yes yes who knows boy replied the old man looking rather terrified but what shall i do i know what i would do replied i id make a clean breast of it at once id send for the minister and a magistrate and state the whole story upon affidavit then you will feel happy again and ease your mind and not before well boy i believe you are right ill think about it leave me now think about your own soul sirthink of your own danger and do not mind lady r there can be but a bad reason for doing such an act of injustice i will come again in an hour sir and then you will let me know your decision think about what the bible says about those who defraud the widow and orphan goodbye for the present no stop boy ive made up my mind you may go to mr sewell the clergyman he often calls to see me and i can speak to him ill tell him i did not wait for the old man to alter his mind but hastened as fast as i could to the parsonagehouse which was not four hundred yards distant i went to the door and asked for mr sewell who came out to me i told him that old roberts wanted to see him immediately as he had an important confession to make is the old man going then i did not hear that he was any way dangerously ill no sir he is in his usual health but he has something very heavy on his conscience and he begs your presence immediately that he may reveal an important secret well my lad go back to him and say that i will be there in two hours you are his grandson i believe i will go and tell him sir replied i evading the last question i returned to old roberts and informed him that the clergyman would be with him in an hour or two but i found the old man already hesitating and doubting again you didnt tell him what it was for did you for perhaps yes i did i told him you had an important secret to communicate that lay heavy on your conscience im sadly puzzled said the old man musing well replied i im not puzzled and if you dont confess i must i wont have my conscience loaded poor fellow that i am and if you choose to die with the sin upon you of depriving the orphan i will not ill telltell it allits the best way replied old roberts after a pause there now said i the best thing to be done is for me to get paper and pen and write it all down for mr sewell to read when he comes then you need not have to repeat it all again yes that will be best for i couldnt face the clergyman then how can you expect to face the almighty replied i truevery true get the paper said he i went to the inn and procured writing materials and then returned and took down his confession of what i have now told you miss valerie when mr sewell came i had just finished it and i then told him that i had written it down and handed it to him to read mr sewell was much surprised and shocked and said to roberts you have done right to make this confession roberts for it may be most important but you must now swear to it in the presence of a magistrate and me of course you have no objection no sir im ready to swear to the truth of every word well then let me see why there is no magistrate near us just now but sir thomas moystyn and as it concerns his own nephew there cannot be a more proper person i will go up to the hall immediately and ask him to come with me tomorrow morning mr sewell did so and the next day he and sir thomas moystyn came down in a phaeton and went up to old roberts i rather turned away that my uncle as he now proves to be might not when i was regularly introduced to him as i hope to be as his nephew recognise me as the sailor lad who passed off as the grandson of old roberts then you admit that you have been playing a very deceitful game yes miss valerie i have a conscience and i admit that i have been playing what may be called an unworthy game but when it is considered how much i have at stake and how long i have been defrauded of my rights by the duplicity of others i think i may be excused if i have beat them at their own weapons i admit that there is great truth in your observations lionel and that is all the answer i shall give i remained outside the door while old roberts signed the paper and the oath was administered sir thomas put many questions afterwards he inquired the residence of his daughter mrs green and then they both went away as soon as they were gone i went in to old roberts and said well now sir do you not feel happier that you have made the confession yes replied he i do boy but still i am scared when i think of lady rand your aunt green theyll be so angry ive been thinking that i had better go up to mrs green i said and prepare her for it i can pacify her im sure when i explain matters i must have gone away the day after tomorrow and ill go up to london tomorrow well perhaps it will be as well replied old roberts and yet i wish you could stay and talk to meive no one to talk to me now thinks i i have made you talk to some purpose and have no inclination to sit by your bedside any longer however i kept up the appearance to the last and the next morning set off for london i arrived three days before i saw you first which gave me time to change my sailors dress for the suit i now wear i have not yet been to mrs green for i thought i would just see you and ask your advice and now miss valerie you have my whole history i once more congratulate you with all my heart replied i offering my hand to lionel he kissed it respectfully and as he was in the act one of the maids opened the door and told me that lady mhad been some time waiting to see me i believe i coloured up although i had no cause for blushing and wishing lionel goodbye i desired him to call on sunday afternoon and i would remain at home to see him it was on thursday that this interview took place with lionel and on the saturday i received a letter from lady rs solicitor by which i was shocked by the information of her ladyship having died at caudebec a small town on the river seine and begging to know whether i could receive him that afternoon as he was anxious to communicate with me i answered by the person who brought the letter that i would receive him at three oclock and he made his appearance at the hour appointed he informed me that lady rhad left havre in a fishing boat with the resolution of going up to paris by that strange conveyance and having no protection from the weather she had been wet for a whole day without changing her clothes and on her arrival at caudebec had been taken with a fever which from the ignorance of the faculty in that sequestered place had proved fatal her maid had just written the intelligence enclosing the documents from the authorities substantiating the fact you are not perhaps aware miss that you are left her executrix i her executrix exclaimed i with astonishment yes replied mr selwyn before she left town she made an alteration in her will and stated to me that you would be able to find the party most interested in it and that you had a document in your hands which would explain everything i have a sealed paper which she enclosed to me desiring i would not open it unless i heard of her death or had her permission it must be that to which she refers i presume replied he i have the will in my pocket it will be as well to read it to you as you are her executrix mr selwyn then produced the will by which lionel dempster her nephew was left her sole heir and by a codicil she had for the love she bore me as she stated in her own handwriting left me pounds as her executrix and all her jewels and wearing apparel i congratulate you on your legacy miss de chatenoeuf said he and now perhaps you can tell me where i can find this nephew for i must say it is the first that i ever heard of him i believe that i can point him out sir replied i but the most important proofs i suspect are to be found in the paper which i have not yet read i will then if you please no longer trespass on you said mr selwyn when you wish me to call again you will oblige me by sending word or writing by post the departure of mr selwyn was quite a relief to me i longed to be alone that i might be left to my own reflections and also that i might peruse the document which had been confided to me by poor lady r i could not help feeling much shocked at her deathmore so when i considered her liberality towards me and the confidence she reposed in one with whom she had but a short acquaintance it was like her nevertheless who but lady rwould ever have thought of making a young person so unprotected and so unacquainted as i was with businessa foreigner to bootthe executrix of her will and her death occasioned by such a mad freakand lionel now restored to his position and his fortunealtogether it was overwhelming and after a time i relieved myself with tears i was still with my handkerchief to my eyes when lady mcame into the room crying miss chatenoeuf said her ladyship it is at the departure of a very dear friend there was a sort of sneer on her face as she said this and i replied yes my lady it is for the departure of a dear friend for lady ris dead mercy you dont say so and what are these gentlemen who have been calling upon you one is her solicitor madam replied i and the other is a relative of hers a relation but what has the solicitor called upon you for if it is not an intrusive question no my lady lady rhas appointed me her executrix executrix well i now do believe that lady rwas mad exclaimed lady m i wanted you to come up to my boudoir to consult you about the pink satin dress but i fear your important avocation will not allow you at present so i will leave you till you are a little recovered i thank you my lady said i i will be more myself tomorrow and will then be at your disposal her ladyship then left the room i was not pleased at her manner which was very different from her usual courtesy towards me but i was not in a state of mind to weigh well all that she said or how she said it i hastened to my room to look for the paper which lady rhad enclosed to me previous to her departure i will give the whole contents to my readers my dear valerie i will not attempt to account for the extreme predilection which i an old woman in comparison immediately imbibed for you before we had been an hour in company some feelings are unaccountable and inexplicable but i felt a sympathy a mesmeric attraction if i may use the term which was uncontrollable at our first meeting and which increased every day during our residence together it was not the feeling of a mother towards a childat least i think not for it was mingled with a certain degree of awe and presentiment of evil if ever we parted again i felt as if you were my fate and never has this feeling departed from me on the contrary now that we separate it has become stronger than ever how little do we know of the mysteries of the mind as well as of the body we know that we are fearfully and wonderfully made and that is all that there are influences and attractions uncontrollable and unexplained i feel certain often have i reflected and wondered on this as i have lain in bed and meditated even to madness but have been unable to remove the veil alas poor lady r thought i i doubt it not you were madder than i thought you were imagine then my grief and horror when i found that you were determined to leave me dear valerie it was to me as the sentence of death but i felt that i could not resist it was my fate and who can oppose its decrees it would indeed have pained your young and generous heart if you knew how i suffered and still suffer from your desertion but i considered it as a judgment on mea visitation upon me for the crimes of my early years and which i am now about to confide to you as the only person in whom i feel confidence and that justice may be done to one whom i have greatly injured i would not die without reparation and that reparation i entrust to you as from my own pen i can explain that without which with all my good intentions towards the party reparation might be difficult but i must first make you acquainted with the cause of crime and to do this you must hear the events of my early life my father sir alexander moystyn had four children two sons and two daughters i was the firstborn then my two brothers and afterwards at an interval my sister so that there was a difference of eight years between me and my sister ellen our mother died in giving birth to ellen we grew up my brothers went to eton and college i remained the sole mistress of my fathers establishment haughty by nature and my position the power it gave me the respect i receivedand if you will look at the miniature i enclose with this i may without vanity add my beauty made me imperious and tyrannical i had many advantageous offers which i rejected before i was twenty years of age my power with my father was unbounded his infirmities kept him for a long time a prisoner in his room and my word was law to him as well as to the whole household my sister ellen still a child i treated with harshnessfirst i believe because she promised to rival me in good looks and secondly because my father showed greater affection towards her than i liked she was meek in temper and never complained time pasti refused many offers of marriage i did not like to resign my position for the authority of a husband and i had reached my twentyfifth year and my sister ellen was a lovely girl of seventeen when it was fated that all should be changed a colonel dempster came down with my eldest brother who was a captain in the same regiment of guardsa more prepossessing person i never beheld and for the first time i felt that i would with pleasure give up being at the head of my fathers establishment to follow the fortunes of another man if my predilection was so strong i had no reason to complain of want of attention on his part he courted me in the most obsequious manner the style more suited to my haughty disposition and i at once gave way to the feelings with which he had inspired me i became fervently in love with him and valued one of his smiles more than an earthly crown two months passed his original invitation had been for one week and he still remained the affair was considered as arranged not only by myself but by everybody else my father satisfied that he was a gentleman by birth and being able to support himself by his own means in so expensive a regiment made no inquiries leaving the matter to take its own course but although two months had passed away and his attentions to me were unremitting colonel dempster had made no proposal which i ascribed to his awe of me and his diffidence as to his success this rather pleased me than otherwise but my own feelings now made me wish for the affair to be decided and i gave him every opportunity that modesty and discretion would permit i saw little of him during the mornings as he went out with his gun with the other gentlemen but in the evenings he was my constant and devoted attendant i received many congratulations from female acquaintances friends i had none upon my having conquered one who was supposed to be invulnerable to the charms of our sex and made no disclaimer when spoken to on the subject every hour i expected the declaration to be made when imagine my indignation and astonishment at being informed one morning when i arose that colonel dempster and my sister ellen had disappeared and it was reported that they had been seen in a carriage driving at furious speed it was but too true it appeared that colonel dempster who had been informed by my brother of my temper and disposition and who was aware that without paying court to me his visit would not be extended and who had fallen in love with ellen almost as soon as he saw her had practised this dissimulation towards me to enable him without my knowledge to gain my sisters affections that his mornings were not spent in shooting with my brother as was supposed but in my sister ellens company my brother to whom he had acknowledged his attachment conniving with him to deceive me a letter from the colonel to my father excusing himself for the step he had taken and requesting him to pardon his daughter was brought in the same morning and read by me very foolish of him said my father what is the use of stealing what you may have for asking he might have had ellen if he had spoken to me but i always thought that he was courting you barbara this letter proving the truth of the report was too much for me i fell down at my fathers feet in a violent fit and was carried to my bed the next day i was seized with a brain fever and it was doubtful if ever my reason would return but it did gradually and after a confinement to my room of three months i recovered both health and reason partially i may say for i doubt not but that the shock i then received has had a lasting effect upon me and that it has caused me to be the unsettled restless wandering thing that i now am only content when in motion and using my pen to create an artificial excitement i believe most people are a little cracked before they begin to write i will not assert that it is a proof of madness but it is a proof that a very little more would make them mad shakespeare says the lover the lunatic and the poet are of an imagination all compact it matters little whether it is prose or poetry there is often more imagination and more poetry in prose than in rhyme but to proceed i arose with but one feelingthat of revenge i say but one feeling alas i had forgotten to mention hatred the parent of that revenge i felt myself mortified and humiliated cruelly deceived and mocked my love for him was now turned to abhorrence and my sister was an aversion i felt that i never could forgive her my father had not replied to the colonels letter indeed the gout in his hand prevented him or he would probably have done so long before i left my room now that i was once more at his side he said to me barbara i think it is high time to forgive and forget i would have answered the colonels letter before but i could not now we must write and ask them to come and pay us a visit i sat down and wrote the letter not according to his dictation which was all kindness but stating that my father would never forgive him or my sister and requested all correspondence might cease as it would be useless read what you have said barbara i read the letter as if it was written according to his wishes that will do dearesttheyll come back fast enough i long to have ellen in my arms againshe was very precious to me that child for she cost the life of your dear mother i want to ask her why she ran away i really believe that it was more from fear of your anger than of mine barbara i made no reply but folded the letter and sealed it as i always opened the postbag i prevented my father from ever receiving the many letters written by my poor sister imploring his forgiveness and did all i could to excite his anger against her at last i found out from her letters that they had gone to the continent months passed my poor father fretted sadly at the silence of ellen and the supposed rejection of his kind overtures his unhappy state of mind had evidently an effect upon his body he grew weaker and more querulous every day at last a letter arrived from ellen which i now blush to say gave me inexpressible joy it announced the death of her husband a trifling wound on the thumb having terminated in lockedjaw and death he is dead then thought i if i lost him she has no longer possession of him alas what a demon had taken possession of me the letter further said that she was coming over directly and that she expected to be shortly confined this letter was addressed to me and not to my father the death of her husband did not diminish my hatred against my sister on the contrary i felt as if i had her now in my power and that my revenge upon her was about to be accomplished after meditating upon what course i should pursue i determined to write to her i did so stating that my fathers anger was not to be appeased that i had tried all i could to soften his wrath but in vain that he was growing weaker every day and i thought her rash conduct had been the cause of it that i did not think that he could last much longer and i would make another appeal to him in her favour which the death of her husband would probably occasion to be more successful in a fortnight i had a reply in which my poor sister invoked blessings on my head for my supposed kindness and told me that she was in england and expected every hour to be confined that she was ill in body and in spirits and did not think that she could get over it she begged me by the remembrance of our mother who died giving her birth that i would come to her surely i might have forgiven my enmity after all that the poor girl had suffered but my heart was steeled on consideration i now thought proper to tell my father that colonel dempster was dead and my sister returned to englandadding her request that i would attend her in her confinement and my willingness so to do my poor father was much shocked and begged me in a tremulous voice to set off immediately i promised so to do but requested that he would not say a word to anyone as to the cause of my absence until he heard from me as it would occasion much talk among the servants and perhaps illnatured remarks might be made he promised and i departed with a maid who had been my nurse and upon whose secrecy i thought i could rely what my intentions were i can hardly say all i knew was that my revenge was not satiated and i would leave no opportunity of wreaking it that offered i found my sister in the very pangs of labour heartbroken at the supposed resentment of my father and his refusal of his forgiveness i did not alleviate her misery by telling her the truth which i might have done i was indeed a demon or possessed by one she died giving birth to a boy i then felt sorrow until i looked at the child and saw that it was the image of the colonelthe man who had caused me such misery again my passions were roused and i vowed that the child should never know his father i made my maid believe that the lady i visited was an old schoolfellow and never mentioned my sisters name at least i thought so at the time but i afterwards found that i had not deceived her i persuaded her to take the child to her fathers saying that i had promised my friend on her deathbed that i would take care of it but that it must be a secret or invidious remarks would be made i then returned to culverwood hall dropping my nurse and the child on my way and reported to my father my sisters death of course concealing that the child was living sir alexander was much affected and wept bitterly indeed from that day he rapidly declined i had now satiated my revenge and was sorry when i had done so until then i had been kept up by excitement now all excitement was over and i had time for reflection i was miserable and in a state of constant warfare with my conscience but in vain the more i reflected the more i was dissatisfied with myself and would have given worlds that i could recall what i had done at this time sir richard rcame down on a visit he admired me proposed and was accepted chiefly that i might remove from the hall than for any other cause i thought that new scenes and change of place would make me forget but i was sadly mistaken i went away with my husband and as soon as i was away i was in a constant fright lest my nurse should betray me to my father and begged sir richard to shorten his intended tour and allow me to return to the hall as the accounts of my fathers health were alarming my husband consented and i had not been at the hall more than a fortnight when my fathers death relieved me from further anxiety on that score another fear now possessed me i saw by my fathers will that he had left pounds to me and also to my sister in case of one dying the survivor to have both sums but the same cause of alarm was in my great aunts will my great aunt had left pounds to me and pounds to my sister ellen to be settled upon us at our marriage and in case of either dying without issue the survivor to be legatee thus in two instances by concealing the birth of the child i was depriving it of its property and obtaining it for myself that i was ignorant of these points is certain and unfortunate it was that it was so for had i known it i would not have dared to conceal the birth of the child lest i should have been accused of having done so for pecuniary considerations and i well knew that if betrayed by my nurse such would be the accusation made against me i would willingly even now have acknowledged the child as my nephew but knew not how to do so as my husband had possession of the money and i dared not confess the crime that i had been guilty of if ever retribution fell upon any one it fell upon me my life was one of perfect misery and when i found that my nurse and her father objected to keeping the secret any longer i thought i should have gone distracted i pointed out to them the ruin they would entail upon me and gave my solemn promise that i would see justice done to the child this satisfied them for several years i lived an unhappy life with my husband until i was at last relieved by his death you may ask how it was that i did not acknowledge the child at his death the fact was that i was afraid i had put him to school and he was then twelve or thirteen years old i removed him to my own house with the intention of so doing and because my nurse and her father reminded me of my promise but when he was in my house i could not see my way or how i could tell the story without acknowledging my guilt and this pride prevented i remained thus irresolute every day putting off the confession till the boy from first being allowed to remain in the drawingroom sank down into the kitchen yes valerie lionel the page the lacquey is lionel dempster my nephew i said that i could not bear to make the avowal and such is the case at last i satisfied myself that what i did was for the boys good alas how easy we satisfy ourselves when it suits our views i had left him my property i had educated him and i said by being brought up in a humble position he will be cured of pride and will make a better man bad reasoning i acknowledge valerie i have left you my executrix for even after my death i would as much as possible avoid exposure i would not be the tale of the town even for a fortnight and it certainly will not help lionel when it is known to all the world that he has served as a footman my solicitor knows not who my nephew is but is referred to you to produce him in a small tin box in the closet of my bedroom you will find all the papers necessary for his identification and also the names and residence of the parties who have been my accomplices in this deed also all the intercepted letters of my poor sisters you must be aware that lionel is not only entitled to the property i have left him but also to his fathers property which in default of heirs passed away to others consult with my solicitor to take such steps as are requisite without inculpating me more than is necessary but if required let all be known to my shame rather than the lad should not be put in possession of his rights you will i am afraid hate my memory after this sad disclosure but in my extenuation recall to mind how madly i loved how cruelly i was deceived remember also that if not insane i was little better at the time i was so criminal and may it prove to you a lesson how difficult it is when once you have stepped aside into the path of error ever to recover the right track you now know all my sufferings all my crimes you now know why i have been not without truth considered as a person eccentric to folly and occasionally on the verge of madness forgive me and pity me for i have indeed been sufficiently punished by an ever torturing conscience barbara r chapter nine i put the papers down on the table as soon as i had finished them and for a long while was absorbed in meditation is it possible thought i that love disappointed can turn to such furycan so harden the heart to all better feelingsinduce a woman to shorten the days of her parentto allow a sister to remain in painful error on her deathbed and wreak vengeance upon an innocent being regardless of all justice grant then that i may never yield to such a passion who would have ever imagined that the careless eccentric lady rhad such a load of crime weighing her down and daily and hourly reminded of it by the presence of the injured party how callous she must have become by habit to still delay doing an act of justicehow strange that the fear of the world and its opinion should be greater than the fear of god this last remark proved how little i yet knew of the world and then my thoughts went in a different direction as i have already said i had been brought up as a catholic but after my grandmothers death i had little encouragement or example shown me in religious duties now having been more than two years in england and continually with protestants i had gone to the established protestant church with those i resided with at first because i considered it better to go to that church although i knew it to be somewhat at variance with my own rather than go to no church at all and by habit i was gradually inclining to protestantism but now the idea came across my mind if lady rhad confessed as we catholics do this secret could not have been kept so long and if she withheld herself from the confessional had her agents been catholics the secret would have been divulged to the priest by them and justice would have been done to lionel and having made this reflection i felt as it were that i was again a sincere catholic after a little more reflection i put away the papers wrote a letter to mr selwyn the solicitor requesting that he would call upon me the following morning and then went down to lady m i suppose that we shall not have much of the pleasure of your company miss de chatenoeuf said her ladyship now that you have such a novel occupation it is a very distressing one replied i and i wish lady rhad not paid me such a compliment might i trespass upon your ladyships kindness to request the loan of the carriage for halfanhour to obtain some papers from lady rs house in baker street oh certainly replied her ladyship pray have you seen lady rs will yes madame and how has she disposed of her property she has left it all to her nephew lady m nephew i never heard her speak of a nephew before sir richard had no nephews or nieces for he was an only son and the title has now gone into the vivian branch and i never heard of her having a nephew and what has she left you mademoiselle if it is not asking too much lady rhas left me pounds my lady indeed well then she pays you for your trouble but really miss de chatenoeuf i do wish you could put off this business until after the marriages i am so hurried and worried that i really do not know which way to turn and really i have felt your loss these last two days more than you can imagine you are so clever and have so much taste that we cannot get on without you its all your own fault continued her ladyship playfully you are so goodnatured and have made us so dependent upon you that we cannot let you off now nothing in the trousseaux is approved of unless stamped by the taste of mademoiselle valerie de chatenoeuf now a week cannot make a great difference and lawyers love delay will you oblige me therefore by leaving lady rs affairs for the present certainly lady m replied i i will stop a letter i was about to send to her solicitor and write another to the effect you wish and i will not repeat my request for the carriage until after the marriages have taken place many thanks replied her ladyship and i went out took my letter from the hall table and wrote another to mr selwyn stating that i could not enter into any business until the following week when i should be prepared to receive him i wrote another to the same effect to lionel requesting him not to call again but that i would write and let him know where to meet me as soon as i was more at leisure indeed i was glad that lady mhad made the request as the trouble and chattering and happy faces which were surrounding the trousseaux and the constant employment and appeals made to me drove away the melancholy which lady rs affairs had occasioned me i succeeded to a great degree in recovering my spirits and exerted myself to my utmost so that everything was complete and satisfactory to all parties two days before the wedding was to take place at last the morning came the brides were dressed and went down into the drawingroom frightened and perplexed but their tears had been shed above the procession of carriages moved on to hanover square there was a bishop of course and the church was filled with gay and tastefullydressed women the ceremony was performed and the brides were led into the vestryroom to recover and receive kisses and congratulations then came the banquet which nobody hardly tasted except the bishop who had joined too many couples in his lifetime to have his appetite at all affected by the ceremony and some two or three others who were old stagers on the road of life and who cared little whether it was a weddingbreakfast or refreshments after a funeral at last after a most silent entertainment the brides retired to change their dresses and when they reappeared they were handed into the carriages of their respective bridegrooms as soon as they could be torn away from the kisses and tears of lady m who played the part of a bereaved mother to perfection no one to have seen her then raving like another niobe would have imagined that all her thoughts and endeavours and manoeuvres for the last three years had been devoted to the sole view of getting them off but lady mwas a perfect actress and this last scene was well got up as her daughters were led down to the carriages i thought that she was going to faint but it appeared on second thoughts that she wished first to see the girls depart in their gay equipages she therefore tottered to the window saw them get in looked at newmans greys and gay postillionsat the white and silver favoursthe dandy valet and smart ladysmaid in each rumble she saw them start at a rattling pace watched them till they turned the corner of the square and then and not till thenfell senseless in my arms and was carried by the attendants into her own room after all the poor woman must have been very much worn out for she had been for the last six weeks in a continual worry lest any contretemps should happen which might have stopped or delayed the happy consummation the next morning her ladyship did not leave her room but sent word down that the carriage was at my service but i was fatigued and worn out and declined it for that day i wrote to lionel and to mr selwyn desiring them to meet me in baker street at two oclock the next day and then passed the day quietly in company with amy the third daughter of lady m whom i have before mentioned she was a very sweet unaffected girl and i was more partial to her than to her sisters who had been just married i had paid great attention to her for she had a fine voice and did credit to my teaching and there was a great intimacy between us arising on my part from my admiration of her ingenuous and amiable disposition which even her mothers example to the contrary could not spoil after some conversation relative to her sisters and their husbands she said i hardly know what to do valerie i love you too well to be a party to your being illtreated and yet i fear that you will be pained if i tell you what i have heard about you i know also that you will not stay if i do tell you and that will give me great pain but that is a selfish feeling which i could overcome what i do not like is hurting your feelings now tell me candidly ought i to tell you or not i will give you my opinion candidly replied i you have said too little or too much you speak of my being illtreated certainly i should wish to guard against that although i cannot imagine who is my enemy had i not heard it i could not have believed it either replied she i thought that you had come here on a visit as a friend but what makes me think that i ought to tell you is that there will be something said against your character which i am sure must be false now indeed i must request that you will tell me everything and soften nothing down but tell me the whole truth who is it that intends to attack my character i am sorryvery sorry to say it is mamma replied she wiping away a tear lady m exclaimed i yes replied she but now you must listen to all i have to say i am sure that i am doing right in telling you and therefore nothing shall prevent me i love my motherwhat a sad thing it is that i cannot respect her i was in the dressingroom when my mother was lying on the sofa in her bedroom this morning when her great friend mrs germane came up she sat talking with my mother for some time and they appeared either to forget or not to care if i heard them for at last your name was mentioned well she does dress you and your girls beautifully i must say said mrs germane who is she they say that she is of a good family and how came she to live with you as a milliner my dear mrs germane that she does live with me as a milliner is true and it was for that reason only i invited her to the house but she is not aware that i retain her in that capacity she is i understand from mrs bathurst of a noble family in france thrown upon the world by circumstances very talented and very proud her extreme taste in dress i discovered when she was living with mrs bathurst and when i found that she was about through my management to leave lady r i invited her here as a sort of friend and to stay with my daughtersnot a word did i mention about millinery i had too much tact for that even when her services were required i made it appear as her own offer and expressed my thanks for her condescension and since that by flattery and management she has continued to dress my daughters for me and i must say that i do believe it has been owing to her exquisite taste that my daughters have gone off so well well you have managed admirably replied mrs germane but my dear lady m what will you do with her now oh replied lady m as amy will now come out i shall retain her in my employ until she is disposed of and then yes then will be the difficulty replied mrs germane after having allowed her to live so long with you as a visitor i may say how will you get rid of her why i was puzzling myself about that and partly decided that it should be done by mortifying her and wounding her feelings for she is very proud but fortunately i have found out something which i shall keep to myself until the time comes and then i can dismiss her at a moments warning indeed said mrs germane what could you have found out well i will tell you but you must not mention it again my maid entered the room the other day when mademoiselle was receiving a young man who called upon her and she found them kissing you dont say so yes a kiss was given and my maid saw it now i can easily make it appear that my maid never mentioned it to me till the time that it may be convenient to make use of it and then i can send her away and if any questions are asked hint at a little impropriety of conduct and very properly too replied mrs germane had i not better hint a little beforehand to prepare people why it may be as well perhaps but be cautious very cautious my dear mrs germane mademoiselle de chatenoeuf i am sorry that i am obliged in doing my duty to you to expose mamma said amy rising up from her chair but i am sure that you could not be guilty of any impropriety and i will not allow you to be accused of it if it is to be prevented many thanks replied i my dear amy you have behaved like a kind friend i have only in duty to myself to clear up the charge against me of impropriety you must not imagine me guilty of that it is true that your mothers maid did come in when a young lad of seventeen who was grateful to me for the interest i took in his welfare and who was taking leave of me at the time did raise my hand to his lips and kiss it and had he done so before your mother i should not have prevented it this was the kiss which as your mother asserts passed between us and this is the only impropriety that took place oh what a sad treacherous selfish wicked world this is cried i throwing myself on the sofa and bursting into tears amy was making every attempt to console me and blaming herself for having made the communication when lady mcame downstairs into the room what is all thiswhat a scene exclaimed she mademoiselle de chatenoeuf have you had any bad news yes my lady replied i so bad that i am under the necessity of leaving you directly indeed may i inquire what has happened no my lady it is not in my power to tell you i have only to repeat that i must with your permission leave this house tomorrow morning well mademoiselle replied her ladyship i do not want to pry into your secrets but this i must say that where there is concealment there must be wrong but i have lately discovered so much that i do not wonder at concealmentnor am i indeed surprised at your wish to leave me lady m replied i haughtily i have never done anything during the time that i have been under your roof which i have to blush fornor indeed anything that requires concealment this i can proudly say if i conceal now it is to spare others and i may add to spare you do not oblige me to say more in presence of your daughter it will be sufficient for me to hint to you that i am now aware why i was invited to your house and what are your plans for dismissing me when it suits you eavesdropping then is a portion of your character mademoiselle cried lady m colouring up to the temples no madam such is not the case and that is all the answer i shall give it is sufficient for you that you are exposed and i do not envy your present feelings i have only to repeat that i shall leave this house tomorrow morning and i will not further trouble your ladyship with my company i then walked out of the room and as i passed lady m and observed her confusion and vexation i felt that it was she who was humiliated and not me i went up to my room and commenced my preparations for immediate departure and had been more than an hour busy in packing up when amy came into my room oh valerie how sorry i ambut you have behaved just as i think that you ought to have done and how very kind of you not to say that i told you my mother was so angry after you left said that the maids must have been listening and declares she will give them all warning but i know that she will not do that she spoke about your meeting a young man and kissing going on but you have already explained all that amy replied i after i am gone take an opportunity of saying to lady m that you mentioned this to me and tell her that my reply was if lady mknew who that young man was how he is connected and how large a fortune he will inherit she would be very glad to see him kiss one of her daughters hands with a different feeling from that which induced him to kiss mine i will depend upon it said amy and then mamma will think that she has lost a good husband for me she will meet him some of these days replied i and what is more he will defend me from any attack made on that score i will tell her that also said amy it will make her careful of what she says one of the servants then knocked at the door and said that lady m wished to see miss amy wish me goodbye now said i for you may not be permitted to see me again the dear girl embraced me cordially and with tears in her eyes left the room i remained till i had finished packing and then sat down shortly afterwards her ladyships maid came in and delivered me an envelope from her ladyship enclosing the salary due to me with lady ms compliments written outside i saw no more of lady mor her daughter that evening i went to bed and as in my former changes i reflected what steps i should take as for the treatment i had received i was now to a certain degree hardened to it and my feelings certainly were not so acute as when the first time i had received a lesson of what i might expect through life from the heartlessness and selfishness of the world but in the present case there was a difficulty which did not exist in the formeri was going away without knowing where i was to go after a little thought i determined that i would seek madame gironac and ascertain whether she could not receive me until i had decided upon my future plans my thoughts then recurred to other points i recollected that i had to meet mr selwyn and lionel in baker street and i resolved that i would go there with my effects early the next morning and leave them in charge of the cook who was taking care of the house i calculated also the money that i had in possession and in prospect i had such a good stock of clothes when i came to england with madame bathurst that i had no occasion during the two years and more that i had now been in england to make any purchases of consequenceindeed i had not expended more than the twenty pounds i had brought with me i had received some few presents from lady mand madame bathurst and a great many from lady r altogether i calculated that i had about two hundred and sixty pounds in my desk for lady rhad given me one hundred pounds for only a portion of the year then there was the five hundred pounds which she had left me besides her wearing apparel and trinkets which last i knew to be of value it was a little fortune to one in my position and i resolved to consult mr selwyn as to the best way of disposing of it having wound up my meditations with the most agreeable portion of them i fell asleep and in the morning woke up refreshed lady ms maid who had always been partial to me for i had taught her many things valuable to a ladysmaid came in early and said that she knew that i was going away which she regretted very much i replied that i should leave as soon as possible but i wanted some breakfast this she brought up to my room i had not finished when amy came in the room and said i have permission to come and wish you goodbye valerie i told mamma what you said about the person who was seen to kiss your hand she acknowledges now that it was your hand that was kissed and she was so astonished for she knows that you never tell stories and what do you think she desired me to find out what was the young gentlemans name that had so large a fortune i said i would if i could and so i will by asking you outright not by any other means i dont want to know his name continued she laughing but im sure mamma has in her mind fixed upon him for a husband for me and would now give the world that you were not going away that through you he might be introduced to her i cannot tell you my dear replied i i am not at liberty to mention it at present otherwise i would with pleasure i am going now may god bless you my dearest and may you always continue to be the same frank and amiable creature that you are now i leave you with regret and i pray earnestly for your happiness you have made me very happy by telling me that your mamma acknowledges that it was my hand that was kissed after that she will hardly attempt to injure me as she proposed oh no valerie i think she is afraid to do so now this young man of fortune has made her think differently he would of course protect you from slander and expose her if she attempted it then goodbye we embraced and then i ordered a hackneycoach to be called and drove with my luggage to baker street the cook welcomed me saying that she expected my coming as mr selwyn had called to tell her of lady rs death and that when she asked to whom she was to look for her wages he had told her that i was the person who was to settle all her ladyships affairs as everything was left on my hands she showed me a letter from martha lady rs maid by which i found that they would probably arrive in baker street that very day with all her ladyships effects i suppose you will sleep here miss said the cook i have aired your bed and your room is all ready i replied that i wished to do so for a night or two at all events as i had a good deal to attend to but that mr selwyn would call at one oclock and that i would speak to him on the subject i had requested lionel to call at twelve an hour previous to mr selwyn that i might make him acquainted with the contents of lady rs papers addressed to me he was punctual to the time and i shook hands with him saying lionel i congratulate you at now having proofs of your being the nephew of lady r and also at her having left you considerable property you will be surprised to hear that she has appointed me her executrix i am not at all surprised replied lionel i am sure she has done a wise thing at last that is more than i am replied i but i appreciate the compliment but lionel there is no time to be lost as mr selwyn the lawyer is coming here at one oclock and before he comes i wish you to read over lady rs confession if i may so call it which will explain the motives of her conduct towards you i am afraid that it will not extenuate her conduct but recollect that she has now made all the reparation in her power and that we must forgive as we hope to be forgiven sit down and read these papers while i unpack one or two of my boxes upstairs the last time that we were here i corded them up for you miss valerie i hope that you will allow me to assist you again thank you but you will have no time to read what lady rhas said and the cook and i can manage without you i then left the room and went upstairs i was still busy in my room when a knock at the street door announced the arrival of mr selwyn and i went down into the drawingroom to meet him i asked lionel who was walking up and down the room whether he had finished the papers and he replied by a nod of the head the poor lad appeared very miserable but mr selwyn entered and i could not say more to him i hope i have not kept you waiting mademoiselle de chatenoeuf said he no indeed i came here at ten oclock for i have left lady m and i may as well ask at once whether there is any objection to my taking a bed in this house for a few nights objection why mademoiselle you are sole executrix and everything is at present yours in fact for the time you have therefore a right to take possession until he appears and the will is proved the hero is before you mr selwyn allow me to introduce you to mr lionel dempster the nephew of lady r mr selwyn bowed to lionel and congratulated him upon his accession to the property lionel returned the salute and then said mademoiselle de chatenoeuf i am convinced that in this case mr selwyn must have been made a party to all that has occurred the reading of these papers has rather disturbed me and it would be painful to me to hear everything repeated in my presence with your permission i will walk out for an hour and leave you to explain everything to mr selwyn for i am sure that i shall need his advice here is the confession of old roberts which i shall leave for his perusal goodmorning then for the present so saying lionel took up his hat and quitted the room he is a very prepossessing young man observed mr selwyn what a fine eye he has yes replied i and now that he has so large a property others will find out that he is a prepossessing young man with fine eyes but sit down mr selwyn for you have to listen to a very strange narrative when he had finished it he laid it down on the table saying this is perhaps the strangest history that has ever come to my knowledge during thirty years of practice and so she brought him up as a footman i now recognise him again as the lad who has so often opened the door for me but i confess i never should have done so if i had not heard what you have now communicated he was always much above his position replied i he is very clever and very amusing at least i found him so when he served me in his menial capacity and certainly was much more intimate with him than i ever thought i could be with a servant at all events his education has not been neglected strange very strange observed mr selwyn this is a curious world but i fear that his history cannot be kept altogether a secret for you must recollect mademoiselle that his fathers property must be claimed and no doubt it will be disputed i must go to doctors commons and search out the will at once of colonel dempster he intends as i presume he does by what he said just now to employ me after all it will if known be but a nine days wonder and do him no harm for he proves his birth by his appearance and his breeding is so innate as to have conquered all his disadvantages when i knew him as a servant i thought him an intelligent and witty lad but i never could have believed that he would have become so improved in such a short time not only his manners but his language is so different it was in him replied mr selwyn as a domestic the manners and language of a gentleman would have been out of place and he did not attempt them now that he knows his position he has called them forth we must find out this mrs green and have her testimony as soon as possible of course after the deposition of old roberts sir thomas moystyn will not be surprised when i communicate to him the confession of lady r and the disposition of her property in fact the only difficulty will be in the recovery of the property of his father colonel dempster and a knock at the street door announced the return of lionel when he entered the room mr selwyn said mr dempster that you are the nephew of lady r to whom she has bequeathed her property and what was your own is sufficiently established in my opinion i will therefore with your permission read her ladyships will lionel took a seat and the will was read when it was finished mr selwyn said having been lady rs legal adviser for many years i am able to tell you within a trifle what property you will receive there are three per cents this house and furniture which i purchased the lease of for her and which is only saddled with a groundrent for the next forty years and i find a balance of pounds at the bankers your fathers property mr dempster of course i know nothing about but will ascertain this tomorrow by going to doctors commons i think i may venture to assure the executrix that she will run no risk in allowing you to take any sum of money you may require from the balance in the bank as soon as the will is proved which had better be done tomorrow if it suits mademoiselle de chatenoeuf certainly replied i i am anxious to get rid of my trust as soon as possible and give mr dempster possession there is a tin box of papers mr selwyn which i cannot get at till the return of lady rs maid as the keys are with lady rs effects which she is bringing home with her yes they will no doubt be important replied mr selwyn and now mr dempster if you are in want of any ready cash i shall be your banker with pleasure till you can have possession of your own i thank you sir i am not in want of any replied lionel for the present but as soon as i may be permitted to have money from the bank i shall be glad as it is not my intention to remain in england indeed exclaimed i no mademoiselle valerie said lionel i am but too well aware of many deficiencies which must arise from the position i have been so long in not to wish to remedy them as soon as possible and before i appear as the heir of lady r it is my intention as soon as i can to go to paris and remain there for two years or perhaps until i am of age and i think in that time to improve myself and make myself more what the son of colonel dempster should be i am young yet and capable of instruction you propose a very proper step mr dempster said mr selwyn and during your absence all legal proceedings will be over and if the whole affair is made public it will be forgotten again by the time that you propose to return i am sure that the executrix will be most happy to forward such very judicious arrangements i will now take my leave and beg mademoiselle de chatenoeuf to meet me at doctors commons at three oclock tomorrow that will give me time to look for colonel dempsters will goodmorning mademoiselle goodmorning mr dempster mr selwyn went out and left us alone may i ask miss valerie whether you have left lady m yes replied i and i told him what had passed adding i stay here for a night or two and shall go then to madame gironacs why not stay here altogether i hope you will i shall go abroad as soon as possible yes and you are right in so doing but lionel you forget that my duty as executrix will be to make the best of the estate for you until you are of age and this house must be let furnished mr selwyn told me so while you were away besides i am not a young lady of fortune but one most unfortunately dependent upon the caprices of others and i must submit to my fate lionel made no reply for some little while and then he said i am very glad that lady rhas showed the high opinion she had of you but i cannot forgive her treatment of my mother it was too cruel but i had better not talk any more about it and i am sure miss valerie you must be anxious to be alone good afternoon miss valerie goodbye lionel for the present replied i bythebye did the cook recognise you yes and i told her that i had given up going out to service i think that you had better not come here lionel till i have dismissed lady rs maid which i shall do the day after her arrival i will meet you at mr selywns officeit will be better to this lionel agreed and we parted the next day the will was proved and mr selwyn then informed us that he had found the will of the late colonel dempster which had left his property to his child unborn as might be supposed with a jointure on the estate which was entailed the will in consequence of the supposed nonexistence of lionel had been proved by the next of kin a gentleman of large property and of whom report spoke highly it was the intention of mr selwyn to communicate with him directly the probateduty etcetera had required a large portion of the pounds left in the bank but there was still enough to meet all lionels wants for a year if he wished to go abroad immediately and another dividend would be due in a month so that there could be no difficulty mr selwyn explained all this as we drove to his chambers where i signed some papers at his request and lionel received a check on the bank and i sent by mr selwyn instructions to meet his drafts for the future this affair being arranged lionel stated his intention of quitting immediately for paris he said that he would go for his passport that afternoon as there was time enough left for him to give in his name at the office and that he would call tomorrow afternoon to bid me farewell he then took his leave and left me with mr selwyn with whom i had a long conversation during which i stated to him that i had some money of my own as well as what had been left me by lady r which i wished to put in safety he recommended that i should lodge what i then had at a bankers and as soon as i had received the rest he would look out for a good mortgage for me he then handed me into a coach and bade me farewell stating that he would call on the day after the morrow at three oclock as by that time lady rs maid must have arrived and i should have obtained possession of the key of the tin box the papers in which he was anxious to examine on my return to baker street i found that lady rs maid had arrived and i of course immediately took possession of everything i then paid her her wages and dismissed her giving her permission to remain and sleep in the house and promising her a character it appeared very summary to dismiss her so soon but i was anxious she should not see lionel and i told her that as executrix i was not warranted in keeping her a day longer than was necessary as i was answerable for all expenses having now the keys i was able to examine everything i first found the tin box with various papers in it among others a packet on which was written papers relative to my sister ellen and her child i thought i would not open them till mr selwyn was present as it might appear as if i was curious so i laid them aside i then despatched the cook with a note to madame gironac requesting that she would come and spend the evening with me as i had much to communicate to her indeed i felt dull alone in such a large house and i also felt the want of a sincere friend to talk with having nothing better to do i opened the various drawers and cupboards which contained the apparel etcetera of lady r and found such a mass of things that i was astonished in her whimsical way she had at times purchased silks and various jewels which she had never made use of but thrown on one side there were more stuffs for making up dresses than dresses made upi should say nearly double i found one large bundle of pointlace some of it of great beauty which i presume had belonged to her mother and of other laces there was a great quantity the jewels which she had taken abroad with her were very few and such as she wore in common her diamonds and all that was of value i knew she had sent to her bankers a day or two previous to her departure and i thought i would wait till i had seen mr selwyn again before i claimed them madame gironac came as requested and i then communicated to her all that had taken place she was delighted at my good fortune and said she hoped that i would now come and live with them as i had the means of living without being subject to the caprices of others but i could give no answer till i knew what my property might amount to all i could promise was to go to her as soon as i had finished my business in baker street and then i would afterwards decide what steps it would be advisable for me to take after a long conversation during which madame gironac was as lively as ever we separated madame gironac promising to come and pass the next day with me and assist me in looking over lady rs wardrobe during the afternoon i had selected a good many of lady rs dresses and some which did not please my taste or had been much worn i gave to her maid on the following morning before her departure this pleased her very much as she knew that her mistresss wardrobe had been bequeathed to me and did not expect to obtain any portion of it but the drawers and closets were so loaded that i could well afford to be generous madame gironac came to breakfast the next morning accompanied by her husband who was delighted to see me and having as usual quarrelled after their fashion he bounced out of the room declaring that he never would see that odious little woman any more oh monsieur gironac you forget you promised to come and dine here well well so i did but mademoiselle valerie that promise has prevented a separation it is very unlucky that you asked him mademoiselle valerie replied his wife all my hopes are destroyed goodbye monsieur gironac and be grateful that you have been prevented from committing a folly now go we are to be very busy and dont want you i will go madame and hear me said monsieur gironac with mock solemnity as i live i will not returntill dinnertime he then bounced out of the room we then proceeded to sort and arrange madame gironac who was a good judge stated the laces to be worth at least pounds and the other articles such as silks etcetera with the dresses and lace at about pounds more the laces and silks not made up she proposed selling for me which she said that she could to various customers and the dresses and lace she said could be disposed of to a person she knew who gained her livelihood by remaking up such things we were thus employed when lionel called he had obtained his passport and had come to wish me goodbye when he rose to say farewell he said miss valerie i can hardly say what my feelings are towards you your kindness to me when i was a supposed footman and the interest you always took in anything concerning me have deeply impressed me with gratitude but i feel more you are much too young for my mother but i feel the reverence of a son and if i did dare to use the expression i feel towards you what i think are the feelings that a brother should have towards a sister i am flattered by your saying so lionel replied i you are now in a much higher position or rather soon will be than i shall ever obtain in this world and that you have such feelings towards me for any little kindness i have shown to you is highly creditable to your heart have you any letters of introduction to anyone in paris but now i think of it you cannot well have no replied he i may have by and bye but how could i possibly obtain one at present a thought struck me well lionel you do not know my history but i was once very intimate with a lady at paris and although we parted bad friends she has since written kindly to me and i believe her to have been sincere in so doing i will give you a letter of introduction to her but do not blame me if i have been deceived in her a second time i went to the table and wrote the following short note my dear madame dalbret this letter will be presented to you by a mr lionel dempster a young englishman of fortune and a great friend of mine he is going to reside at paris to improve himself until he comes of age and i give him this introduction to you for two reasons the first because i want to prove to you that although my feelings would not permit me to accept your last kind offer i have long forgotten and forgiven any little injustice you did me and the second because i feel convinced that in your society and that which you keep he will gain more advantage than perhaps in any other in parisyours with esteem valerie de chatenoeuf there lionel this may be of use to you if not write and let me know you will of course let me hear from you occasionally may heaven preserve you miss valerie replied lionel i only hope the time may arrive when i may be able to prove my gratitude lionel kissed my hand and the tears rolled down his cheeks as he quitted the room he is a charming young man said madame gironac as soon as the door was shut he is a very superior young man in my opinion replied i and i am most anxious that he should do well i did not think it possible that i ever could have written again to madame dalbret but my goodwill towards him induced me there is monsieur gironacs knock so now for a quarrel or a reconciliation which is it to be oh we must reconcile first and then have a quarrel afterwards that is the established rule monsieur gironac soon joined us we passed a very lively evening and it was arranged that i should in three days take up my quarters at their house the next day mr selwyn called at the time appointed and i made over to him the box and papers he told me that he had seen mrs green and had had her full confession of what took place in corroboration of all that was stated by lady rand old roberts and that he had written to mr armiger dempster who had succeeded to the property of lionels father i then told him that i wished to go with him to the bank to lodge the money i then had and to obtain lady rs jewelcase which was deposited there nothing like the time present said mr selwyn my carriage is at the door i will have the pleasure of taking you there and then returning with you but i have another appointment and must be so impolite as to request that you will hurry your toilet as much as possible this was done and in an hour i had lodged my money and obtained the jewelcase mr selwyn took me back again and having put the tin box into the carriage wished me farewell i told him that i was about to take up my residence with the gironacs gave him their address and then we parted that evening i opened the jewelcase and found it well stocked the value of its contents i could not possibly be acquainted with but that so many diamonds and other stones were of value i knew well i placed the other caskets of lady rin the case and then proceeded to make up my packages ready for transportation to madame gironacs for there were a great many trunks full i occupied myself with this for the remainder of the time that i was in baker street and when monsieur gironac and his wife called according to promise to take me to their home it required two coaches and well loaded to take all the luggage a third conveyed monsieur and madame gironac myself and the jewelcase i found a very cheerful room prepared for me and i had the pleasant feeling as we sat down to our small dinner that i had a home madame gironac was indefatigable in her exertions and soon disposed of all the laces and wardrobe that i had decided upon parting with and i paid the sum that they realised viz pounds into the bankers the disposal of the jewels was a more difficult affair but they were valued by a friend of monsieur gironacs who had once been in the trade at pounds after many attempts to dispose of them more favourably i succeeded in obtaining for them the sum of pounds mr selwyn had called upon me once or twice and i had received my legacy with interest deducting the legacy duty of pounds it came to pounds i had therefore the following sums in all pounds of my savings pounds for the wardrobe and laces pounds for the jewels and pounds for the legacy amounting in all to pounds who would have imagined three months before that i should ever have possessed such a sum i did not certainly mr selwyn as soon as he knew what sum i had to dispose of viz pounds for i had retained the pounds for my expenses procured me a mortgage at five per cent on excellent landed security and thus did the poor forlorn valerie possess an income of pounds per annum as soon as this was all arranged i felt a tranquillity i had not known before i was now independent i could work it is true if i felt inclined and had an opportunity i could however do without work the gironacs finding that i insisted upon paying for my board and knowing that i could now afford it agreed to receive forty pounds per annummore they would not listen to oh what a balm to the feelings is the consciousness of independence especially to one who had been treated as i had been there were two situations to which i had taken a violent abhorrencethat of a governess and now that of a milliner and i thanked heaven that i was no longer under any fear of being driven into either of those unfortunate employments for the first month that i remained with the gironacs i absolutely did nothing but enjoy my emancipation after that i began to talk over matters with monsieur gironac who pointed out to me that now that i could live upon my own means i should endeavour to increase them so as to be still more at my ease what do you propose that i should do then monsieur replied i i should propose that you establish yourself as a musicmistress and give lessons on the pianoforte and singing by degrees you will get a connection and you will still be your own mistress and when you have nothing else to do mademoiselle you must make flowers in wax said madame gironac you make them so well that i can always sell yours when i cannot my own i must not interfere with you elise said i that would be very ungrateful on my part poohnonsensethere are customers enough for us both i thought this advice to be very good and made up my mind to follow it i had not money sufficient to purchase a piano just then as it would be five months before the halfyears interest of the mortgage would be due so i hired one from a dealer with whom monsieur gironac was intimate and practised several hours every day fortune appeared inclined to favour me for i obtained employment from four different channels the first and most important was this i went every sunday to the catholic chapel with madame gironac and of course i joined in the singing on the third sunday as i was going out i was touched on the arm by one of the priests who requested to speak with me in the vestry madame gironac and i followed him and he requested us to sit down who have i the pleasure of addressing said he to me mademoiselle de chatenoeuf sir replied i i am not aware of your circumstances mademoiselle said he but the name is one well known in france still those who hold our best names are very often not in affluent circumstances in this country i trust let it be as it may that you will not be offended but the fact is your singing has been much admired and we would wish for your service gratuitous if you are in good circumstances but well paid for if you are not in the choir mademoiselle chatenoeuf is not i am sorry to say in good circumstances monsieur replied madame gironac then i will promise that she shall be well rewarded for her exertions if she will consent to sing in the chapelbut do you consent i have no objection sir replied i allow me then to call the gentleman who presides over the choir said the priest going out accept by all means mademoiselle valerie it will be an introduction for you as a musicmistress and very advantageous i agree with you replied i and i like singing sacred music the priest returned with a gentleman who told me that he had listened with great pleasure to my singing and begged as a favour that i would sing him a solo which he had brought with him as i could sing at sight i did so he was satisfied and it was agreed that i should come on saturday at twelve to practice with the rest of the choir the following sunday i sang with them and also sang the solos after the service was over i received three guineas for my performance and was informed that a similar sum would be given to me every sunday on which i sang my voice was much admired and when it was known that i gave lessons i very soon had engagements from many catholic families my charges to them were moderate five shillings a lesson of one hour the next channel was through monsieur and madame gironac he recommended me to a gentleman whom he taught as a musicmistress for his sisters and daughters and she to all her various customers and employers i soon obtained several pupils by her exertions the third was from an intimacy i had formed with an acquaintance of madame gironac with a mademoiselle adele chabot who was of a good french family but earning her livelihood as a french teacher in one of the most fashionable schools in kensington through her recommendation i obtained the teaching of the young ladies at the school but of her more hereafter the fourth channel was through the kindness of mr selwyn the lawyer to whom i shall now again revert i had several visits from mr selwyn after i had left baker street and on one of these he informed me that upon the proofs of lionel dempsters identity being examined by the legal advisers of mr dempster of yorkshire they were considered so positive that the aforenamed gentleman immediately came to terms agreeing to give up the property to lionel provided in consequence of the great improvements he had made he was not come upon for arrears of income arising from it that mr selwyn advised this offer to be accepted as it would prevent any exposure of lady r and the circumstances under which lionel had been brought up from being made public lionel had written to say that he was anxious that any sacrifice should be made rather than the affair should be exposed and the terms were consented to and lionel came into possession of further property to the amount of pounds per annum as we became more intimate mr selwyn asked me many particulars relative to myself and by his habit of crossexamining soon gained the best portion of my history only one point i did not mention to himthat my family supposed that i was dead chapter ten one day he came accompanied by mrs selwyn who joined him very earnestly in requesting me to pass a day or two with them at their country house at kew i accepted the invitation and they called for me in their carriage on their way down it was summer time and i was very glad to be out of london for a day or two i found a charming family of two sons and three daughters grown up and who appeared very accomplished mr selwyn then for the first time asked me whether i was settled or not i told him nothat i was giving lessons in musicthat i sang at the chapel and that i was laying by money he said i was right and that he hoped to be able to procure me pupils but now said he as i did not know that you had a voice i must be permitted to hear it as otherwise i shall not be able to make my report i sat down immediately and sang and he and mrs selwyn as well as the daughters were highly pleased with my performance during my stay mr selwyn treated me in i may say almost a parental manner and extracted something more from me relative to my previous life and he told me that he thought i had done wisely in remaining independent and not again trusting to lady mor madame dalbret i went afterwards several times to their town house being invited to evening parties and people who were there and heard my singing sent for me to teach their daughters in six months after i had taken up my residence with the gironacs i was in flourishing circumstances i had twentyeight pupils ten at five shillings per lesson and eight at seven shillings and they took lessons twice a week i had also a school for which i received about five guineas per week and the singing at the chapel for which i received three in fact i was receiving about eighteen pounds a week during the winter season but it must be confessed that i worked hard for it and expended two or three pounds a week in coach hire nevertheless although i now spent more money on my appearance and had purchased a piano before the year was over i had paid pounds into mr selwyns hands to take care of for me when i thought of what might have still been my position had it not been for the kindness of poor lady r when i reflected how i had been cast upon the world young and friendless by madame dalbret and that i was now making money rapidly by my own exertions and that at such an early age for i was but little past twenty years old had i not reason to be grateful i was so and most truly so and moreover i was happy truly happy all my former mirth and vivacity which had been checked during my sojourn in england returned i improved every day in good looks at least so everybody told me but mr selwyn and i gained that which to a certain degree my figure required more roundness and expansion and this was the poor valerie supposed to have been drowned in the river seine i forgot to say that about three weeks after lionel went to paris i received a letter from madame dalbret in which she thanked me warmly for my having introduced the young englishman to her as she took it as a proof of my really having forgiven her what she never should forgive herself she still indulged the hope that she might one day embrace me with respect to lionel she said that he appeared a modest unassuming young lad and that it should not be her fault if he did not turn out an accomplished gentleman that he had already the best fencing and musicmasters and was working very hard at the language as soon as he could speak french tolerably he was to commence german and italian she had procured him a pension in an excellent french family and he appeared to be very happy i could not help reflecting as i read the contents of this letter upon the change which had taken place in lionel dempster as soon as he found himself established in his rights from an impudent talkative page he at once became a modest respectful and silent young man what could have caused this change was it because when a page he felt himself above his condition and now that he had gained a name and fortune that he felt himself beneath it i decided when i remembered how anxious he was to improve himself that such was the case and i further inferred that it showed a noble generous and sensitive mind and i now felt very glad that i had written to madame dalbret and all my objections to seeing her again were removed why so because i was independent it was my dependence that made me so proud and unforgiving in fact i was on better terms with the world now that i had somewhat raised myself in it i was one day talking over my life with mr selwyn and after pointing out how i had been taken in by my ignorance and confidence how much wiser i had become already from experience and my hopes that i should one day cease to be a dupe he replied my dear miss valerie do not say so to have been a dupe is to have lived we are dupes when we are full of the hope and warmth of youth i am an old man my profession has given me great knowledge of the world knowledge of the world has made me cautious and indifferent but this has not added to my happiness although it may have saved my pocket no no when we arrive at that point when we warm before no affection doubting its truth when we have gained this agebought experience which has left our hearts as dry as the remainder biscuits after a long voyagethere is no happiness in this valerie better to be deceived and trust again i almost wish that i could now be the dupe of a woman or a false friend for i should then feel as if i were young again but sir replied i your conduct is at variance with your language why else such kindness shown to me a perfect stranger and one without claims upon you you overrate my little attention my dear valerie but that proves that you have a grateful heart i speak of myself as when in contact with the world you forget that i have domestic ties to which the heart is ever fresh were it not for home and the natural affections we men would be brutes indeed the heart when in conflict with the world may be compared to a plant scorched by the heat of the sun but in the shade of domestic repose it again recovers its freshness for the time i have stated that through the recommendation and influence of a mademoiselle adele chabot i taught music at an establishment for young ladies at kensington it was what is called a finishingschool the terms were very high and the young ladies did not always sit down to boiled mutton but from what i learnt from adele in other points it was not better than schools in general but it had a reputation and that was sufficient one day i was informed by mrs bradshaw the proprietress of the establishment that i was to have a new pupil the next quarter which was very near and when it did arrive and the young lady was brought in who should it be but caroline my former companion and pupil at madame bathursts valerie exclaimed she rushing into my arms my dear caroline this is an unexpected pleasure said i but how came you here i will tell you some day replied caroline not wishing to talk about her family while the teacher who came in with her was present i hope madame bathurst is well inquired i quite well when i saw her last said caroline well my dear we must work and not talk for my time is valuable said i so sit down and let me hear whether you have improved since i last gave you a lesson the teacher then left the room and caroline having run over a few bars stopped and said i never can play till i have talked to you valerie you asked me how i came here at my own request or if a girl may use such language because i insisted upon it i was so uncomfortable at home that i could bear it no longer i must speak against my father and motheri cannot help it for it is impossible to be blind they are so strange so conceited so spoiled by prosperity so haughty and imperious and so rude and uncouth to any whom they consider beneath them that it is painful to be in their company servants will not remain a month in the housethere is nothing but exchange and everything is uncomfortable after having lived with my aunt bathurst who you will acknowledge to be a lady in every respect i really thought that i was in a hopital de fous such assumption such pretension such absurdities to all which they wished to make me a party i have had a wilderness of governesses but not one would or could submit to the humiliations which they were loaded with at last by rebelling in every way i gained my point and have escaped to school i feel that i ought not to speak disparagingly of my parents but still i must speak the truth to you although i would say nothing to others so do not be angry with me valerie i am more sorry that it is so than that you should tell me of it caroline but from what i saw during my short visit i can fully give credit to all you have said but is it not a hard case valerie when you cannot respect your parents replied caroline putting her handkerchief to her eyes it is my dear but still on the whole it is perhaps for the best you were taken from your parents and were well brought up you return to them and find them many degrees below you in the scale of refinement and therefore you cannot respect them now if you had never left them you would of course have remained down at their level and would have respected them having imbibed the same opinions and perceiving nothing wrong in their conduct now which of the two would you prefer if you had the power to choose most certainly to be as i am replied caroline but i cannot but grieve that my parents should not have been like my aunt bathurst i agree with you in that feeling but what isis and we must make the best of it you must excuse your parents faults as much as you can since your education will not permit you to be blind to them and you must treat them with respect from a sense of duty that i have always done replied caroline but it too often happens that i have to decide between the respect i would show to my parents and a sense of justice or a love of truth opposed to itthat is the greatest difficulty very true replied i and in such cases you must act according to the dictates of your own conscience well replied caroline i think i have done wisely in getting away altogether i have seen little of my aunt bathurst since you took me to my fathers house for although some advances were made towards a reconciliation as soon as my aunt was told that my father and mother had stated that i had been most improperly brought up by her she was so angry at the false accusation that all intercourse is broken off i fear for ever oh how i have longed to be with my aunt again but valerie i never heard why you left her some one did say that you had gone but why was not known i went away caroline because i was no longer of any use in the house after you had been removed and i did not choose to be an incumbrance to your aunt i preferred gaining my livelihood by my own exertions as i am now doing and to which resolution on my part i am indebted for the pleasure of our again meeting ah valerie i never loved you so much as i did after i had lost you said caroline that is generally the case my dear replied i but now if you please we will try this sonata we shall have plenty of time for talking as we shall meet twice a week caroline played the sonata and then dropping her fingers on the keys said now valerie do you know what was one of my wild dreams which assisted in inducing me to come here ill tell you i know that i shall never find a husband at my fathers house all wellbred people if they once go there do not go a second time and whatever may be the merits of the daughter they have no time to find them out and leave the house with the supposition that she having been educated in so bad a school must be unworthy of notice now i mean if i can to elope from school that is if i can find a gentleman to my fancynot to gretna green but as soon as i am married to go to my aunt bathurst direct and you know that once under a husbands protection my father and mother have no control over me will you assist my views valerie its the only chance i have of happiness a very pretty confession for a young lady not yet eighteen replied i and a very pretty question to put to me who have been your governess caroline i am afraid that you must not look to me for assistance but consider it as you termed it at first a wild dream nevertheless dreams come true sometimes replied caroline laughing and all i require is birth and character you know that i must have plenty of money but my dear caroline it is not people of birth and character who prowl round boardingschools in search of heiresses i know that and that was why i asked you to help me at all events ill not leave this place till i am married or going to be married thats certain if i stay here till im twentyfive well do not make rash resolutions but surely caroline you have not reason to complain of your parents treatment they are kind and affectionate towards you indeed they are not nor were they from the time that i returned to them with you they try by force to make me espouse their own incorrect notions of right and wrong and it is one scene of daily altercation they abuse and laugh at aunt bathurst i believe on purpose to vex me and having never lived with them from my infancy of course when i met them i had to learn to love them i was willing so to do notwithstanding their unkindness to my aunt whom i love so dearly but they would not let me and now i really believe that they care little about me and would care nothing if i were not their only daughter for you know perhaps that both my brothers are now dead i knew that one was replied i the other william died last year replied caroline his death was a release poor fellow as he had a complaint in the spine for many years do you know what i mean to do i shall write to aunt bathurst to come and see me well i think you will be right in so doing but will not your father and mother come to you no for they are very angry and say that until i come to my senses and learn the difference between people who are somebodies and people who are nobodies they will take no notice of me and that i may remain here till i am tired which they think i shall soon be and write to come back again the last words of my father when he brought me here and left me werei leave you here to come to your senses he was white with anger but i do not wish to talk any more about them and your time is up caroline so you must go and make room for another pupil miss greaves is the next shortly after my meeting with caroline i received a letter from lionel stating that it was his intention to come over to england for a fortnight and asking whether he could execute any commissions for me in paris previous to his departure he also informed me that he had received a very kind letter from his uncle the baronet who had had several interviews with mr selwyn and who was fully satisfied with his identity and acknowledged him as his nephew this gave me great pleasure i replied to his letter stating that i should be most happy to see him but that as for commissions i was too poor to give him any madame dalbret had sent her kind souvenirs to me in lionels letter and i returned them in my reply indeed now that i was earning a livelihood and by my own exertions i felt that i was every day adding to my means and future independence a great change i may safely say for the better took place in me my pride was lessened that is my worst pride was superseded by a more honest one i had a strange revulsion in feeling towards madame dalbret madame bathurst and lady m and i felt that i could forgive them all i was no longer brooding over my dependent position fancying perhaps insults never intended or irritated by real slights everything was couleur de rose with me and that couleur was reflected upon everything ah mademoiselle valerie said madame gironac to me one day i had no idea when i first made your acquaintance that you were so witty my husband and all the gentlemen say that you have plus desprit than any woman they ever conversed with when i first knew you annette i was not happy now i am happy almost too happy and that is the reason i am so gay and i dont think you hate the men so much as you did continued she i am in a humour to hate nobody replied i that is true and mademoiselle valerie you will marry one of these days mind continued she putting up her finger i tell you so and i tell you no replied i i think there is only one excuse for a woman marrying which is when she requires some one to support her that is not my case for i thank heaven i can support myself nous verrons replied madame gironac caroline did however find the restraint of a school rather irksome and wished very much to go out with me when the holidays arrived and the other young ladies had gone home i spoke to mrs bradshaw and as she was very partial to me and knew my former relations with caroline she gave her consent shortly afterwards mrs bradshaw accepted an invitation to pass three weeks with some friends and i then proposed that caroline should pass the remainder of the holidays with me to which mrs bradshaw also consented much to carolines delight madame gironac had made up a bed for her in my room and we were a very merry party a few days after caroline came to the house lionel made his appearance i should hardly have believed it possible that he could have so improved in appearance in so short a time he brought me a very kind letter from madame dalbret in which she begged as a proof of my having forgiven her that i would not refuse a few presents she had sent by lionel they were very beautiful and expensive and when i had had some conversation with lionel i made up my mind that i would not return them which certainly i at first felt more inclined to do than to keep them when lionel took leave promising to come to dinner caroline asked me who that gentlemanly young man was i replied that it was a mr lionel dempster the nephew of lady r but further conversation was interrupted by the arrival of young mr selwyn who came with a message from his father inviting me to kew i declined the invitation on the plea of caroline being with me mr selwyn remained some time conversing with me and at last inquired if i should like to go to the next meeting at the horticultural gardens at the same time offering me two tickets as i was anxious to see the gardens i accepted them he told me that his father would call for us and his mother and sisters were to be there and then he took leave who is mr selwyn inquired caroline i told her well said she i have seen two nice young men this morning i dont know which i like best but i think mr selwyn is the more manly of the two i should think so too caroline replied i mr selwyn is twentyfour years old i believe and mr dempster is younger i think than you are i did not think he was so young but valerie are we not to go to the national gallery yes when monsieur gironac comes home to escort us we may as well put on our bonnets for he will be here in a few minutes oh valerie how fortunate it was that i came to mrs bradshaws said caroline and that i met you i should have been moped that is certain if i had not but now im so happythats monsieur gironacs knock im sure but caroline was wrong for it was mademoiselle chabot of whom i have before spoken who made her appearance mademoiselle chabot was an acquaintance of madame gironac and it was through my having become intimate with her that i obtained the teaching of mrs bradshaws adele chabot was a very pretty person thoroughly french and dressed with great taste she was the resident french teacher in mrs bradshaws establishment and although twentyfive years old did not look more than eighteen she was very amusing and rather wild although she looked very demure i never thought that there was anything wrong in adele but at the same time i did not consider that caroline would derive any good from her company as caroline required to be held in check as it was but as is usually the case the more i attempted to check any intimacy between them the more intimate they became adele was of a good family her father had fallen at montmartre when the allies entered paris after the battle of waterloo but the property left was very small to be divided among a large family and consequently adele had first gone out as a governess at paris and ultimately accepted the situation she now held she spoke english remarkably well indeed better than i ever heard it spoken by a frenchwoman and everybody said so as well as me well adele i thought you were at brighton said caroline i was yesterday and i am here today i am come to dine with you replied adele taking off her bonnet and shawl and smoothing her hair before the glass wheres madame gironac gone out to give a lesson in flowermaking replied i yes she is like the little busy bees always on the wing and as the hymn says how neat she spread her wax and monsieur where is he gone out to give a lesson also replied i yes hes like the wind always blowing one hour the flute another the french horn then the bassoon or the bugle always blowing and always shifting from one point to the other never a calm with him for when he comes home theres a breeze with his wife a laimable to be sure yes replied caroline always blowing but never coming to blows you are witty mademoiselle caroline said adele with your paradox do you know that i had an adventure at brighton and i am taken for you by a very fashionable young man how can you have been taken for me said caroline the gentleman wished to find out who i was and i would not tell him he inquired of the chambermaid of the lodginghouse and bribed her i presume for the next day she came up to my room and asked me for my card that her mistress might write my name down correctly in the book i knew that the mistress had not sent her as i had by her request entered my own name in the book three days before and i was therefore certain that it was to find out who i was for the gentleman who followed me everywhere i recollected that i had a card of yours in my case and i gave it to her very quietly and she walked off with it the next day when i was at the library the gentleman addressed me by your name i told him that it was not my name and requested that he would not address me again when i left brighton yesterday i discovered the chambermaid copying the addresses i had put on my trunks which was your name at mrs bradshaws so now i think we shall have some fun but my dear adele you have not been prudent you may compromise caroline very much said i recollect that men talk and something unpleasant may occur from this want of discretion on your part be not afraid valerie i conducted myself with such prudery that an angels character could not suffer i do not mean to hint otherwise adele but still you must acknowledge that you have done an imprudent thing well i do confess it but valerie every one has not your discretion and good sense at all events if i see or hear any more of the gentleman i can undo it againbut that is not very likely we have had two gentlemen here today adele said caroline and one dines with us indeed well im in demitoilette and must remain so for i cannot go all the way back to mrs bradshaws to dress he is a very handsome young man is he not valerie yes replied i and of large fortune too well i shall not have a fair chance then said adele for go back i cannot now adele you know how much more becoming the demitoilette is to you than the evening dress replied caroline so dont pretend to deny it i deny nothing and i admit nothing replied adele laughing except that i am a woman and now draw your own inferences and conclusionsce mest egal we had a very pleasant dinnerparty adele tried to flirt with lionel but it was in vain he had no attentions to throw away except upon me once he whispered i should not feel strange at being seated with others but to be by your side does make me awkward old habits are strong and every now and then i find myself jumping up to change your plate its a great pleasure to me lionel to find you in the position you are entitled to from your birth you will soon sit down with people of more consequence than valerie de chatenoeuf but never with anyone that i shall esteem or respect so much be they who they may replied lionel during dinner i mentioned that mr selwyn had called and engaged caroline and me to go to the horticultural fete i wish madame gironac was going continued i she is so fond of flowers never mind my dear valerie i will stay at home and earn some money madame cried monsieur gironac pretending to be very angry and striking with his fist on the table so as to make all the wine glasses ring you shall do no such thing you shall not always oppose my wishes you shall not stay at home and earn some money you shall go out and spend money yes madame i will be obeyed you shall go to the horticultural fete and i invite monsieur lionel and mademoiselle adele to come with us that they may witness that i am the master yes madame resistance is useless you shall go in a remise de ver or glasscoach as round as a pumpkin but you shall not go in glass slippers like cinderella because they are not pleasant to walk in how cinderella danced in them has always been a puzzle to me ever since i was a child and of what kind of glass they were made of perhaps isinglass said lionel no sir not isinglass it must have been fairy glass but never mind i ask you madame gironac whether you intend to be an obedient wife or intend to resist my commands barbare replied madame gironac am i then to be forced to go to a fete ah cruel man youll break my heart but i submit to my unhappy destiny yes i will go in the remise de ver pity me my good friends but you dont know that man i am satisfied with your obedience madame and now i permit you to embrace me madame gironac who was delighted at the idea of going to the fete ran to her husband and kissed him over and over again adele and lionel accepted monsieur gironacs invitation and thus was the affair settled in monsieur gironacs queer way the day of the horticultural fete arrived it was a lovely morning we were all dressed and the glasscoach was at the door when mr selwyn arrived in his carriage and caroline and i stepped in i introduced caroline who was remarkably welldressed and very pretty mr selwyn had before told me that he was acquainted with madame bathurst having met her two or three times and sat by her at a dinnerparty he appeared much pleased with caroline but could not make out how she was in my company of course he asked no questions before her on our arrival at the gardens we found young mr selwyn waiting at the entrance to take us to mrs selwyn and his sisters who had come from their house at kew about halfanhour afterwards we fell in with monsieur gironac madame adele and lionel mr selwyn greeted lionel warmly introducing him to his family and on my presenting the gironacs and adele was very polite and friendly for he knew from me how kind they had been adele chabot never looked so well her costume was most becoming she had put on her air mutine and was admired by all that passed us we were all grouped together close to the band when who should appear right in front of us but madame bathurst at that time caroline was on the one arm of mr selwyn and i on the other caroline exclaimed madame bathurst and you here turning to me while she remained in astonishment caroline ran up and kissed her you recollect mr selwyn aunt do you not yes said madame bathurst returning the salute of mr selwyn but still i am surprised come with me aunt and i will tell you all about it caroline then walked to a seat at a little distance sat down and entered into conversation with madame bathurst in a few minutes madame bathurst rose and came up to our party with caroline on her arm she first thanked mr selwyn for his kindness in bringing her niece to the fete and then turning to me said with some emotion as she offered her hand valerie i hope we are friends we have mistaken each other i felt all my resentment gone and took her offered hand she then led me aside and said i must beg your pardon valerie i did not nay replied i interrupting her i was too hasty and too proud you are a good kindhearted girl valeriebut let us say no more about it now introduce me to your friends i did so madame bathurst was most gracious and appeared very much struck with adele chabot and entered into conversation with her and certainly adele would not have been taken for a french teacher by her appearance there was something very aristocratic about her while they were in converse a very gentlemanlike man raised his hat to madame bathurst as i thought and passed on adele coloured up i observed as if she knew him but did not return the salute which madame bathurst did do you know that gentleman mademoiselle chabot inquired caroline i thought he bowed to you and not to aunt i have seen him before replied adele carelessly but i forget his name then i can tell you added madame bathurst it is colonel jervis a very fashionable man but not a very great favourite of mine not that i have any thing to accuse him of particularly except that he is said to be a very worldly man is he of good family inquired adele oh yes unexceptionable on that point but it is time for me to go there it my party coming down the walk caroline dear i will call upon you tomorrow at three oclock and then we will make our arrangements madame bathurst then bade adieu to mr selwyn and the rest saying to me au revoir valerie shortly afterwards we agreed to leave as mr selwyn was returning to kew i would not accept the offer of his carriage to take caroline and me to london the glasscoach round as a pumpkin would hold six and we all went away together i was very much pleased at thus meeting with madame bathurst and our reconciliation and quite as much so for carolines sake for although she had at first said that she would write to her aunt she had put it off continually for reasons which she had never expressed to me i rather think that she feared her aunt might prove a check on her and i was therefore very glad that they had met as now madame bathurst would look after her during the evening i observed that adele and caroline had a long conversation sotto voce i suspected that the gentleman at whose appearance she had coloured up was the subject of it the next day madame bathurst called and heard a detailed account of all that had passed from caroline and from me since we had parted she said that as caroline was put to the school by her father of course she could not remove her but that she would call and see her as often as she could she congratulated me upon my little independence and trusted that we should ever be on friendly terms and that i would come and visit her whenever my avocations would permit me as there were still three weeks of the holidays remaining she proposed that we should come and pass a portion of the time with her at a villa which she had upon the banks of the thames she said that carolines father and mother were down at brighton giving very gay parties having arranged the time that the carriage should come for us on the following day she kissed us both affectionately and went away the next day we were at richmond in a delightful cottage ornee and there we remained for more than a fortnight to me it was a time of much happiness for it was like the renewal of old times and i was sorry when the visit was over on my return i found a pressing invitation for caroline and me to go to kew and remain two or three days and as we had still time to pay the visit it was accepted but before we went adele came to see us and after a little general conversation requested that she might speak to me in my own room valerie said adele as soon as we were seated i know that you think me a wild girl and perhaps i am so but i am not quite so wild as i thought myself for now that i am in a critical position i come to you for advice and for advice against my own feelings for i tell you frankly that i am very much in loveand moreoverwhich you may well suppose most anxious to be relieved from the detestable position of a french teacher in a boardingschool i now have the opportunity and yet i dread to avail myself of it and i therefore come to you who are so prudent and so sage to request after you have heard what i have to impart you will give me your real opinion as to what i ought to do you recollect i told you a gentleman had followed me at brighton and how for mere frolic i had led him to suppose that i was caroline stanhope i certainly did not expect to see him again but i did three days after i came up from brighton the girl had evidently copied the address on my trunk for him and he followed me up and he accosted me as i was walking home he told me that he had never slept since he had first seen me and that he was honourably in love with me i replied that he was mistaken in supposing that i was caroline stanhope that my name was adele chabot and that now that i had stated the truth to him he would alter his sentiments he declared that he should not pressed me to allow him to call which i refused and such was our first interview i did not see him again until at the horticultural fete when i was talking to madame bathurst he had told me that he was an officer in the army but he did not mention his name you recollect what madame bathurst said about him and who he was since you have been at richmond he has contrived to see me every day and i will confess that latterly i have not been unwilling to meet him for every day i have been more pleased with him on our first meeting after the fete i told him that he still supposed me to be caroline stanhope and that seeing me walking with carolines aunt had confirmed him in his idea but i assured him that i was adele chabot a girl without fortune and not as he supposed a great heiress his answer was that any acquaintance of madame bathursts must be a lady and that he had never inquired or thought about my fortune that my having none would prove the disinterestedness of his affection for me and that he required me and nothing more i have seen him every day almost since then he has given me his name and made proposals to me notwithstanding my reiterated assertions that i am adele chabot and not caroline stanhope one thing is certain that i am very much attached to him and if i do not marry him i shall be very miserable for a long time and here adele burst into tears but why do you grieve adele said i you like him and he offers to marry you my advice is very simplemarry him yes replied adele if all was as it seems i agree with you that my course is clear but notwithstanding his repeated assertions that he loves me as adele chabot i am convinced in my own mind that he still believes me to be caroline stanhope perhaps he thinks that i am a romantic young lady who is determined to be married pour ses beaux yeux alone and conceals her being an heiress on that account and he therefore humours me by pretending to believe that i am a poor girl without a shilling now valerie here is my difficulty if i were to marry him as he proposes when he comes to find out that he has been deceiving himself and that i am not the heiress will he not be angry and perhaps disgusted with mewill he not blame me instead of himself as people always do and will he not illtreat me if he did it would break my heart for i love himlove him dearly then on the other hand i may be wrong and he may be as he says in love with adele chabot so that i shall have thrown away my chance of happiness from an erroneous idea what shall i do valerie do advise me much will depend on the character of the man adele you have some insight into peoples characters what idea have you formed of his i hardly can say for when men profess to be in love they are such deceivers their faults are concealed and they assume virtues which they do not possess on my first meeting with him i thought that he was a proud manperhaps i might say a vain manbut since i have seen more of him i think i was wrong no adele depend upon it you were right at that time you were not blinded as you are now do you think him a goodtempered man yes i firmly believe that he is i made a remark at brighton a child that had its fingers very dirty ran out to him and as it stumbled printed the marks of its fingers upon his white trousers so that he was obliged to return home and change them instead of pushing the child away he saved it from falling saying well my little man its better that i should change my dress than that you should have broken your head on the pavement well adele i agree with you that it is a proof of great good temper well then valerie what do you think i think that it is a lottery but all marriages are lotteries with more blanks than prizes you have done all you can to undeceive him if he still deceives himself you can do no more i will assume that he does deceive himself and that disappointment and irritation will be the consequence of his discovery that you have been telling the truth if he is a vain man he will not like to acknowledge to the world that he has been his own dupe if he is a goodhearted man he will not long continue angry but adele much depends upon yourself you must forbear all recriminationyou must exert all your talents of pleasing to reconcile him to his disappointment and if you act wisely you will probably succeed indeed unless the man is a badhearted man you must eventually succeed you best know your own powers and must decide for yourself it is that feelingthat almost certain feeling that i shall be able to console him for his disappointment that impels me on valerie i will make him love me i am determined and when a woman is determined on that point she invariably succeeds in the end adele this is supposing that he is deceiving himself which may not be the case adele for i do think you have sufficient attractions to make a man love you for yourself alone and recollect that such may be the case in the present instance it may be that at first he followed you as an heiress and has since found out that if not an heiress you are a very charming woman and has in consequence been unable to resist your influence however there is only one to whom the secrets of the heart are known i consider that you have acted honourably and if you choose to risk the hazard of the die no one can attach blame to you thank you valerie you have taken a great load off my heart if you think i am not doing wrong i will risk every thing well adele let you decide how you may i hope you will prosper for my part i would not cross the street for the best man that ever was created as friends they are all very well as advisers in some cases they are useful but when you talk of marrying one and becoming his slave that is quite another affair what were you and caroline talking about so earnestly in the corner i will confess the truth it was of love and marriage with an episode about mr charles selwyn of whom caroline appears to have a very good opinion well adele i must go down again now if you wish any advice at any future time such as it is it is at your service you are making a bold stroke for a husband thats certain however the title of another play is alls well that ends well well i will follow out your playing upon plays valerie by saying that with you loves labours lost exactly replied i because i consider it much ado about nothing the next day lionel came to bid me farewell as he was returning to paris during our sojourn at madame bathursts he had been down to see his uncle and had been very kindly received i wrote to madame dalbret thanking her for her presents which valuable as they were i would not return after what she had said and confided to lionel a box of the flowers in wax that i was so successful in imitating and which i requested her to put on her side table in remembrance of me mr selwyn sent the carriage at the time appointed and we went down to kew where i was as kindly received as before what adele told me of the conversation between caroline and her made me watchful and before our visit was out i had made up my mind that there was a mutual feeling between her and young mr selwyn when we were going away this was confirmed but i took no notice but although i made no remark this commencement of an attachment between caroline and him occupied my mind during the whole of our journey to town in carolines position i was not decided if i would encourage it and assist it charles selwyn was a gentleman by birth and profession a very goodlooking and very talented young man all his family were amiable and he himself remarkably kindhearted and welldisposed that caroline was not likely to return to her fathers house where i felt assured that she was miserable was very evident and that she would soon weary of the monotony of a school at her age was also to be expected there was therefore every probability that she would if she found an opportunity run away as she stated to me she would and it was ten chances to one that in so doing she would make an unfortunate match either becoming the prey of some fortunehunter or connecting herself with some thoughtless young man could she do better than marry mr selwyn certainly not that her father and mother who thought only of dukes and earls would give their consent was not very likely should i acquaint madame bathurst that would be of little use as she would not interfere should i tell mr selwyns father no if a match at all it must be a runaway match and mr selwyn senior would never sanction any thing of the kind i resolved therefore to let the affair ripen as it might it would occupy caroline and prevent her doing a more foolish thing even if it were to be ultimately broken off by unforeseen circumstances caroline was as much absorbed by her own thoughts as i was during the ride and not a syllable was exchanged between us till we were roused by the rattling over the stones my dear caroline what a reverie you have been in said i and you valerie why i have been thinking certainly when i cannot have a more agreeable companion i amuse myself with my own thoughts will you tell me what you have been thinking about yes caroline provided you will be equally confiding i will i assure you well then i was thinking of a gentleman and so was i replied caroline mine was a very handsome clever young man and so was mine replied she but i am not smitten with him continued i i cannot answer that question replied caroline because i do not know who you were thinking about you must answer the question as to the gentleman you were thinking of caroline i repeat that i am not smitten with him and that his name is mr charles selwyn i was also thinking of mr charles selwyn replied caroline and you are not smitten with him any more than i am or he is with you continued i smiling and looking her full in the face caroline coloured and said i like him very much from what i have seen of him valerie but recollect our acquaintance has been very short a very proper answer my dear caroline and given with due maidenly decorumbut here we are and there is madame gironac nodding to us from the window the next day caroline went back to mrs bradshaws and i did not see her till the musiclesson of wednesday afterwards caroline who had been watching for me met me at the door oh valerie i have a great deal to tell in the first place the establishment is in an uproar at the disappearance of adele chabot who has removed her clothes and gone off without beat of drum one of the maids states that she has several times seen her walking and talking with a tall gentleman and mrs bradshaw thinks that the reputation of her school is ruined by adeles flight she has drunk at least two bottles of eaudecologne and water to keep off the hysterics and is now lying on the sofa talking in a very incoherent way miss phipps says she thinks her head is affected i should think it was replied i well is that all all why valerie you appear to think nothing of an elopement all why is it not horrible i do not think it very horrible caroline but i am glad to find that you have such correct ideas on that point as it satisfies me that nothing would induce you to take such a step well replied caroline quickly what i had also to communicate is that i have seen my father who informed me that on their return from brighton in october they expect that i will come home he said that it was high time that i was settled in life and that i could not expect to be married if i remained at a boardingschool well and what did you say i said that i did not expect to be married and i did not wish it that i thought my education was far from complete and that i wished to improve myself well then he said that he should submit to my caprices no longer and that i should go back in october as he had decided well well i said no more and he went away having received all this intelligence i went up stairs i found mrs bradshaw crying bitterly and she threw herself into my arms oh mademoiselle chatenoeufthe disgracethe ruini shall never get over it exclaimed she i see no disgrace or ruin mrs bradshaw adele has told me that a gentleman had proposed marriage to her and asked my advice indeed exclaimed mrs bradshaw yes well that alters the case but still why did she leave in this strange way i presume the gentleman did not think it right that she should marry out of a young ladies establishment madam very true i did not think of that after all what is it your french teacher is marriedsurely that will not injure your establishment no certainlywhy should itbut the news came upon me so abruptly that it quite upset me i will lie down a little and my head will soon be better time went on so did the school miss adele that was sent no weddingcake much to the astonishment of the young ladies and it was not till nearly three weeks afterwards that i had a letter from adele chabot now mrs jervis but before i give the letter to my readers i must state that mr selwyn junior had called upon me the day before caroline went to school and had had a long conversation with her while i went out to speak with madame gironac on business further that mr selwyn junior called upon me a few days afterwards and after a little commonplace conversation a langlaise about the weather he asked after miss caroline stanhope and then asked many questions as i knew what he wished i made to him a full statement of her position and the unpleasant predicament in which she was placed i also stated my conviction that she was not likely to make a happy match if her husband were selected by her father and mother and how much i regretted it as she was a very amiable kindhearted girl who would make an excellent wife to anyone deserving of her he thought so too and professed great admiration of her and having as he thought pumped me sufficiently he took his leave a few days afterwards he came upon some pretended message from his father and then i told him that she was to be removed in october this appeared to distress him but he did not forget to pull out of his pocket a piece of music sealed up telling me that by mistake caroline had left two pieces of music at kew and had taken away one belonging to his sister mary that he returned one but the other was mislaid and would be returned as soon as it was found and would i oblige him so far as to request miss stanhope to send him the piece of music belonging to his sister if she could lay her hand upon it well i will do your bidding mr selwyn replied i it is a very proper message for a musicmistress to take and i will also bring back your sisters music when caroline gives it me and you can call here for it if i am out you can ask madame gironac to give it to you upon which with many thanks and much gratitude for my kindness mr selwyn withdrew having made all this known to the reader he shall now have the contents of adeles letter chapter eleven we must now read adeles letter my dear valeriethe die is cast and i have now a most difficult game to play i have risked all upon it and the happiness of my future life is at stake but let me narrate what has passed since i made you my confidante of course you must know the day on which i was missing on that day i walked out with him and we were in a few minutes joined by a friend of his whom he introduced as major argat after proceeding about one hundred yards farther we arrived at a chapel the doors of which were open and the verger looking out evidently expecting somebody my dear angel said the colonel i have the licence in my pocket i have requested the clergyman to attend he is now in the chapel and all is ready my friend will be a witness and there are others in attendance you have said that you love me trust yourself to me prove now that you are sincere and consent at once that our hands as well as our hearts be united oh how i trembled i could not speak the words died away upon my lips i looked at him imploringly he led me gently for my resistance was more in manner than in effect and i found myself within the chapel the verger bowing as he preceded us and the clergyman waiting at the altar to retreat appeared impossible indeed i hardly felt as if i wished it but my feelings were so excited that i burst into tears what the clergyman may have thought of my conduct and my being dressed so little like a bride i know not but the colonel handed the licence to his friend who took it to the clergyman while i was recovering myself at last we went up to the altar my head swam and i hardly knew what was said but i repeated the responses and i wasa wife when the ceremony was over and i was attempting to rise from my knees i fell and was carried by the colonel into the vestry where i remained on a chair trembling with fear after a time the colonel asked me if i was well enough to sign my name to the marriage register and he put the pen in my hand i could not see where to sign my eyes were swimming with tears the clergyman guided my hand to the place and i wrote adele chabot the knowledge what the effect of this signature might possibly have upon my husband quite overcame me and i sank my head down upon my hands upon the table i will send for a glass of water sir said the clergyman leaving the vestry to call the verger or clerk the lady is fainting after he went out i heard the colonel and his friend speaking in low tones apart probably they thought that i was not in a condition to pay attention to thembut i had too much at stake yes replied the colonel she has signed as you say but she hardly knows what she is about depend upon it it is as i told you i did not hear the majors reply but i did what the colonel said its all the better the marriage will not be legal and i can bring the parents to my own terms all doubt was now at an end he had married me convinced and still convinced that i was caroline stanhope and not adele chabot and he had married me supposing that i was an heiress my blood ran cold and in a few seconds i was senseless and should have fallen under the table had they not perceived that i was sinking and ran to my support the arrival of the clergyman with the water recovered me my husband whispered to me that it was time to go and that a carriage was at the door i do not recollect how i left the church the motion of the carriage first roused me up and a flood of tears came to my relief how strange is it valerie that we should be so courageous and such cowards at the same time would you believe when i had collected myself with a certain knowledge that my husband had deceived himselfa full conviction of the danger of my position when he found out his mistake and that my future happiness was at stakei felt glad that the deed was done and would not have been unmarried again for the universe as i became more composed i felt that it was time to act i wiped away my tears and said as i smiled upon my husband who held my hand in his i know that i have behaved very ill and very foolishly but i was so taken by surprise do you think that i love you the less for showing so much feeling my dearest he replied no no it only makes you still more dear to me as it convinces me what a sacrifice you have made for my sake now valerie could there be a prettier speech or one so apparently sincere from a newlymarried man to his bride and yet recollect what he said to his friend not a quarter of an hour before about having my parents in his power by the marriage not being legal i really am inclined to believe that we have two souls a good and an evil one continually striving for the mastery one for this world and the other for the next and that the evil one will permit the good one to have its influence provided that at the same time it has its own or an equal share in the direction of us for instance i believe the colonel was sincere in what he said and really does love me supposing me to be caroline stanhope with the mundane advantages to be gained by the marriage and that these better feelings of humanity are allowed to be exercised and not interfered with by the adverse party who is satisfied with its own mammon share but the struggle is to come when the evil spirit finds itself defrauded of its portion and then attempts to destroy the influence of the good he does love me now and would have continued to love me if disappointment will not tear up his still slightlyrooted affections now comes my task to cherish and protect it till it has taken firm root and all that woman can do shall be done i felt that all that i required was time where are we going said i about twenty miles from london replied my husband after which that is tomorrow you shall decide upon our future plans i care not where replied i with you place is indifferent only do not refuse me the first favour that i request of you depend upon it i will not replied he it is this dearest take me where you will but let it be three months before we return or come near london you must feel my reason for making this request i grant it with pleasure replied he for three months i am yours and yours only we will live for one another yes and never let us mention any thing about future prospects but devote the three months to each other i understand you replied the colonel and i promise you it shall be so i will have no correspondence eventhere shall be nothing to annoy you or vex you in any way for three months said i extending my hand agreed said he and to tell you the truth it would have been my own feeling had it not been yours when you strike iron you should do it when it is hot but when you have to handle it you had better wait till it is cool you understand me and now the subject is dropped my husband has adhered most religiously to his word up to the present time as you will see by the date of this letter we are now visiting the lakes of cumberland never could a spot be better situated for the furtherance of my wishes the calm repose and silent beauty of these waters must be reflected upon the mind of any one of feeling which the colonel certainly does not want and when you consider that i am exerting all the art which poor woman has to please i do hope and pray to heaven that i may succeed in entwining myself round his heart before his worldly views are destroyed by disappointment pray for me dear valeriepray for one who loves you dearly and who feels that the whole happiness of her life is at stakeyours adele so far all goes well my dear adele thought i but we have yet to see the end i will pray for you with all my heart for you deserve to be happy and none can be more fascinating than you when you exert yourself what is it in women that i do not feel which makes them so mad after the other sex instinct certainly for reason is against it well i have no objection to help others to commit the folly provided that i am not led into it myself such were my reflections as i closed the letter from adele a few days afterwards i received a note from mr selwyn junior informing me that his father had been made a puisne judge what that was i did not know except that he was a judge on the bench of some kind he also stated his intention of calling upon me on the next day yes thought i to receive the music from caroline of course she will return it to me when i give her a lesson today i was right in my supposition caroline brought me a piece of music with a note saying here is the music belonging to miss selwyn valerie will you take an opportunity of returning it to her any time will do i presume she is in no hurry and caroline coloured up when her eyes met mine to punish her i replied oh no there can be no hurry i shall be down at kew in a fortnight or three weeks i will take it with me then but my note thanking mr selwyn will be of very long date replied caroline and i want the other piece of music belonging to me which i left at kew well caroline you cannot expect me to be carrying your messages and going to the chambers of a handsome young chancerybarrister bythebye i had a note from him this morning telling me that his father is advanced to the bench what does that mean that his father is made a judge is that all he said replied caroline carelessly why now i think of it he said that he would call upon me tomorrow so i can give him this music when he calls at this intelligence carolines face brightened up and she went away mr selwyn called the next day and i delivered the music and the note he informed me that he had now all his fathers private as well as chancery business and wished to know whether he was to consider himself my legal adviser i replied certainly but that he could not expect the business of a teacher of music to be very profitable no nor do i intend that it shall be but it will be a great pleasure replied he very gallantly i hope you have some money to put by yes replied i i have some but not quite enough by the end of the year i hope to have pounds i am glad that you have told me as a profitable investment may occur before that time and i will secure it for you he asked permission to read carolines note and then said that he would find the other piece of music and leave it at monsieur gironacs in the course of a day or twoafter which he took his leave i received that evening a letter from lionel which had a great effect upon me in it he stated that at the fencingschool he had made acquaintance with a young officer a monsieur auguste de chatenoeufthat he had mentioned to him that he knew a lady of his name in england that the officer had asked him what the age of the lady might be and he had replied strange said the officer i had a very dear sister who was supposed to be drowned although the body was never found can you tell me the baptismal name of the lady you mention it then occurred to me continued lionel that i might be imprudent if i answered and i therefore said that i did not know but i thought you had been called by your friends annette then it cannot be she replied he for my sisters name was valerie but she may have changed her namedescribe to me her face and figure as i at once felt certain that you were the party and was aware that the early portion of your life was never referred to by you i thought it advisable to put him off the scent until i had made this communication i therefore replied that excuse me you were very plain with a pug nose and very short and fat then it must be somebody else replied the officer you made my heart beat when you first spoke about her for i loved my sister dearly and have never ceased to lament her loss he then talked a great deal of you and gave me some history of your former life i took the opportunity to ask whether your unnatural mother was alive and he said yes and that your father was also alive and well i did not dare to ask more have i done right or wrong my dear mademoiselle chatenoeuf if wrong i can easily repair the error your brother for such i presume he is i admire very much he is very different from the officers of the french army in general quite subdued and very courteous and there is a kind spirit in all he says which makes me like him more you have no idea of the feeling he showed when he talked about youthat is if it is youwhich i cannot but feel almost certain that it is one observation of his i think it right to make known to you which is that he told me that since your supposed death your father had never held up his head indeed he said that he had never seen him smile since the above extract from lionels letter created such a revulsion that i was obliged to retire to my chamber to conceal my agitated feelings from madame gironac i wept bitterly for some time i thought of what my poor father must have suffered and the regrets of poor auguste at my supposed death and i doubted whether i was justified in the act i had committed by the treatment i had received from my mother if she had caused me so much pain was i right in having given so much to others who loved me my poor father he had never smiled since should i permit him to wear out his days in sorrowing for my lossoh no i no longer felt any animosity against others who had illtreated me surely i could forgive even my mother if not for love of her at all events for love of my father and my brother yes i would do so i was now independent of my mother and all the family i had nothing to fear from her i could assist my family if they required it such were my first feelingsbut then came doubts and fears could not my mother claim me insist upon my living with her prevent my earning my livelihood or if i did employ myself could she not take from me all my earnings yes by the law of france i thought she could then again would she forgive me the three years of remorse the three years during which she had been under the stigma of having by her barbarity caused her child to commit selfdestruction the three years of reproach which she must have experienced from my fathers clouded brow would she ever forgive me for having obtained my independence by the very talents which she would not allow me to cultivate no never unless her heart was changed after many hours of reflection i resolved that i would make known my existence to auguste and permit him to acquaint my father under a promise of secrecy but that i would not trust myself in france or allow my mother to be aware of my existence until i could ascertain what her power might be over me but before i decided upon any thing i made up my mind that i would make a confidant and obtain the opinion of judge selwyn by the evenings post i wrote a note to him requesting that he would let me know when i might have an interview an answer arrived the next day stating that judge selwyn would call and take me down with him to kew where i should sleep and return to town with him on the following morning this suited me very well and as soon as the carriage was off the stones i said that i was now about to confide to him that portion of my life with which he was unacquainted and ask his advice how i ought to proceed in consequence of some intelligence lately communicated by lionel i then went into the whole detail until i arrived at my being taken away from the barracks by madame dalbret the remainder of my life he knew sufficient of and i then gave him lionels letter to read and when he had done so i stated to him what my wishes and what my fears were and begged him to decide for me what was best to be done this is an eventful history valerie said the old gentleman i agree with you on the propriety of making your existence known to your brother and also to your father who has been sufficiently punished for his cowardice whether your father will be able to contain his secret i doubt very much and from what you have told me of your mother i should certainly not trust myself in france i am not very well informed of the laws of the country but it is my impression that children are there under the control of their parents until they are married go to france i therefore would not unless it were as a married woman then you will be safe when does lionel come over he will come at any time if i say i wish it then let him come over and invite your brother to come with him then you can arrange with him i really wish you were married valerie and i wish also that my son was married i should like to be a grandfather before i die with respect to my marrying sir i see little chance of that i dislike the idea and in fact it would be better to be with my mother at once for i prefer an old tyranny to a new one it does not follow my dear valerie depend upon it there are many happy marriages am i a tyrant in my own house does my wife appear to be a slave there are many happy exceptions my dear sir replied i with respect to your sons marrying i think you need not despair of that for it is my opinion that he very soon will bebut this is a secret and i must say no more indeed replied the judge i know of no one and he would hardly marry without consulting me yes sir i think that he will and i shall advise him so to doas it is necessary that nothing should be known till it is over trust to me sir that if it does take place you will be quite satisfied with the choice which he makes but i must have your pledge not to say one word about it you might spoil all the old judge fell back in his carriage in a reverie which lasted some little while and then said valerie i believe that i understand you now if it is as i guess i certainly agree with you that i will ask no more questions as i should for many reasons not wish it to appear that i know any thing about it soon afterwards we arrived at kew and after a pleasant visit on the following morning early i returned to town with the judge i then wrote to lionel making known to him as much as was necessary under pledge of secrecy and stating my wish that he should follow up my brothers acquaintance and the next time that he came over persuade him to accompany him but that he was not to say any thing to him relative to my being his sister on any account whatever young selwyn called the same day that i came from kew with the piece of music which was missing i made no remarks upon the fact that the music might have been delivered to me by his sister because i felt assured that it contained a note more musical than any in the score i gave it to caroline and a few days afterwards observing that she was pale and restless i obtained permission for her to go out with me for the day mr selwyn happened to call a few minutes after our arrival at madame gironacs and that frequently occurred for nearly two months when the time arrived that she was to be removed from the school the reader will of course perceive that i was assisting this affair as much as i could i admit it and i did so out of gratitude to mr selwyns father for his kindness to me i knew caroline to be a good girl and well suited to mr selwyn i knew that she must eventually have a very large fortune and provided that her father and mother would not be reconciled to their daughter after the marriage that mr selwyn had the means by his practice of supporting her comfortably without their assistance i considered that i did a kindness to caroline and to mr selwyn and therefore did not hesitate besides i had other ideas on the subject which eventually turned out as i expected and proved that i was right on the last day of september caroline slipped out and followed me to madame gironacs mr selwyn was ready with the licence we walked to church the ceremony was performed and mr selwyn took his bride down to his fathers house at kew the old judge was somewhat prepared for the event and received her very graciously mrs selwyn and his sisters were partial to caroline and followed the example of the judge nothing could pass off more quietly or more pleasantly for reasons which i did not explain i requested mr selwyn for the present not to make known his marriage to carolines parents as i considered it would be attended with great and certain advantage and he promised me that he would not only be silent upon the subject but that all his family should be equally so if mrs bradshaw required two bottles of eaudecologne and water to support her when she heard of the elopement of adele chabot i leave the reader to imagine how many she required when an heiress entrusted to her charge had been guilty of a similar act as caroline had not left with me i was not implicated and the affair was most inscrutable she had never been seen walking or known to correspond with any young man i suggested to mrs bradshaw that it was the fear of her father removing her from her protection which had induced her to run away and that most probably she had gone to her aunt bathursts upon this hint she wrote to mr stanhope acquainting him with his daughters disappearance and giving it as her opinion that she had gone to her aunts being very unwilling to return home mr stanhope was furious he immediately drove to madame bathursts whom he had not seen for a long time and demanded his daughter madame bathurst declared that she knew nothing about her mr stanhope expressed his disbelief and they parted in high words a few days afterwards the colonel and adele came to town the three months acceded to her wishes having expired and now i must relate what i did not know till some days afterwards when i saw adele and who had the narrative from her husband it appeared that as soon as the colonel arrived in london still persuaded that he had married caroline stanhope and not adele chabot without stating his intention to her he went to grosvenor square and requested to see mr stanhope this was about a fortnight after carolines elopement with mr selwyn he was admitted and found mr and mrs stanhope in the drawingroom he had sent up his card and mr stanhope received him with great hauteur what may your pleasure be with me sir looking at the card colonel jervis i think you call yourself now colonel jervis was a man well known about town and in his own opinion not to know him argued yourself unknown he was therefore not a little angry at this reception and being a really wellbred man was also much startled with the vulgarity of both parties my name mr stanhope as you are pleased to observe said the colonel with hauteur is jervis and my business with you is relative to your daughter my daughter sir our daughter why you dont mean to tell us that you have run away with our daughter screamed mrs stanhope yes madam such is the fact she is now my wife and i trust that she is not married beneath herself a colonela paltry colonela match for my daughter why with her fortune she might have married a duke screamed mrs stanhope ill never speak to the wretch again a colonel indeed i suppose a militiacolonel i daresay you are only a captain after all well take her to barracks and to barracks yourself you may leave the house not a pennyno not a penny do you get does he stanhope not one half a farthing replied mr stanhope pompously go sir mrs stanhopes sentiments are mine the colonel who was in a towering passion at the treatment he received now started up and said sir and madam you appear to me not to understand the usages of good society and i positively declare that had i been aware of the insufferable vulgarity of her parents nothing would have induced me to marry the daughter i tell you this because i care nothing for you you are on the stilts at present but i shall soon bring you to your senses for know sir and madam although i did elope with and married your daughter the marriage is not legal as she was married under a false name and that was her own actnot mine you may therefore prepare to receive your daughter back when i think fit to send herdisgraced and dishonoured and then try if you can match her with a duke i leave you to digest this piece of information and now wish you goodmorning you have my address when you feel inclined to apologise and do me the justice which i shall expect before a legal marriage takes place so saying the colonel left the house and it would be difficult to say which of the three parties was in the greatest rage the colonel who had become sincerely attached to adele who had well profited by the time which she had gained returned home in no very pleasant humour throwing himself down on the sofa he said to her in a moody way ill be candid with you my dear if i had seen your father and mother before i married you nothing would have persuaded me to have made you my wife when a man marries i consider connexion and fortune to be the two greatest points to be obtained but such animals as your father and mother i never beheld good heaven that i should be allied to such people may i ask you dearest to whom you refer and what is the meaning of all this my father and mother why colonel my father was killed at the attack of montmartre and my mother died before him then who and what are you cried the colonel jumping up are you not caroline stanhope i thank heaven i am not i have always told you that i was adele chabot and no other person you must admit that my father and mother were no vulgar people dearest husband and my family is as good as most in france come over with me to paris and you will then see who my relatives and connexions are i am poor i grant but recollect that the revolution exiled many wealthy families and mine among the rest although we were permitted eventually to return to france what can have induced you to fall into this error and still persist notwithstanding my assertions to the contrary that i am the daughter of those vulgar upstarts who are proverbial for their want of manners and who are not admitted into hardly any society rich as they are supposed to be the colonel looked all amazement im sorry you are disappointed dearest continued adele if you are so i am sorry that im not caroline stanhope with a large fortune but if i do not bring you a fortune by economy i will save you one let me only see that you are not deprived of your usual pleasures and luxuries and i care not what i do or how i live you will find no exacting wife in me dearest troubling you for expenses you cannot afford i will live but to please you and if i do not succeed i will dieif you wish to be rid of me adele resumed her caresses with the tears running down her cheeks for she loved her husband dearly and felt what she said the colonel could not resist her he put his arms round her and said do not cry adele i believe you and moreover i feel that i love you i am thankful that i have not married caroline stanhope for i presume she cannot be very different from her parents i admit that i have been deceiving myself and that i have deceived myself into a better little wife than i deserve perhaps i really am glad of my escape i would not have been connected with those people for the universe we will do as you say we will go to france for a short time and you shall introduce me to your relations before the next morning adele had gained the victory the colonel felt that he had deceived himself that he might be laughed at and that the best that could be done was to go to paris and announce from thence his marriage in the papers he had a sufficiency to live upon to command luxury as well as comforts and on the whole he was now satisfied that a handsome and stronglyattached wife who brought him no fortune was preferable to a marriage of mere interest i may as well here observe that adele played her cards so well that the colonel was a happy and contented man she kept her promise and he found with her management that he had more money than a married man required and he blessed the day in which he had married by mistake and now to return to the stanhopes although they were too angry at the time to pay much heed to the colonels parting threats yet when they had cooled and had time for reflection mr and mrs stanhope were much distressed at the intelligence that their daughter was not legally married for some days they remained quiet at last they thought it advisable to come to terms to save their daughters honour but during this delay on their part adele had called upon me and introduced her husband and made me acquainted with all that had passed they stated their intention of proceeding to paris immediately and although i knew that adeles relations were of good family yet i thought an introduction to madame dalbret would be of service to her i therefore gave her one and it proved most serviceable for the colonel found himself in the first society in paris and his wife was well received and much admired when therefore mr stanhope made up his mind to call upon the colonel at the address of the hotel where they had put up he found they had left and nobody knew where they had gone this was a severe blow and mr and mrs stanhope were in a state of the utmost uncertainty and suspense now was the time for mr selwyn to come forward and i despatched a note to him requesting him to come to town i put him in possession of adeles history her marriage with the colonel and all the particulars with which the reader is acquainted and i pointed out to him how he should act when he called upon mr stanhope which i advised him to do immediately he followed my advice and thus described what passed on his return i sent up my card to mr and mrs stanhope and was received almost as politely as the colonel i made no remark but taking a chair which was not offered to me i said you have my card mr stanhope i must in addition to my name inform you that i am a barrister and that my father is judge selwyn who now sits on the kings bench you probably have met him in the circles in which you visit although you are not acquainted with him your sister madame bathurst we have the pleasure of knowing this introduction made them look more civil for a judge was with them somebody my object in coming here is to speak to you relative to your daughter do you come from the colonel then said mrs stanhope sharply no madam i have no acquaintance with the colonel then how do you know my daughter sir i had the pleasure of meeting her at my fathers she stayed a short time with my family at our country seat at kew indeed exclaimed mrs stanhope well i had no idea of that im sure the judge was very kind but sir you know that my daughter has married very unfortunately that she has married madam i am aware but i trust not unfortunately why sir she has married a colonela fellow who came here and told us it was no marriage at all it is to rectify that mistake madam which has induced me to call the colonel madam did hear that your daughter was at mrs bradshaws establishment and wished to carry her off supposing that she was a very rich prize but madam he made a slight mistakeinstead of your daughter he has run away and married the french teacher who has not a sixpence he has now found out his mistake and is off to paris to hide himself from the laughter of the town this intelligence was the cause of much mirth and glee to mr and mrs stanhope the latter actually cried with delight and i took care to join heartily in the merriment as soon as it had subsided mrs stanhope said but mr selwyn you said that my daughter was married how is that why madam the fact is that your daughters affections were engaged at the time of this elopement of the colonels and it was her intention to make known to you that such was the case presuming that you would not refuse to sanction her marriage but when the elopement took place and it was even reported that she had run away her position became very awkward and the more so as some people declared as the colonel asserted that she was not legally married on consulting with the gentleman of her choice it was argued thus if miss stanhope goes back to her fathers house after this report that she is not legally married it will be supposed that the colonel finding that he was disappointed in his views had returned her dishonoured upon her parents hands and no subsequent marriage would remove the impression it was therefore considered advisable both on her parents account and on her own that she also should elope and then it would be easily explained that it was somebody else who had eloped with the colonel and that miss stanhope had married in a secret way miss stanhope therefore was properly married in church before respectable witnesses and conducted immediately afterwards by her husband to his fathers house who approved of what was done as now no reflection can be made either upon miss stanhope or her respectable parents well let us all know the person to whom she is married to myself madam and your daughter is now at judge selwyns where she has been ever since her marriage with my mother and sisters my father would have accompanied me to explain all this but the fact is that his lordship is now so much occupied that he could not he will however be happy to see mr stanhope who is an idle man either at his town house or at his country seat i trust madam as i have the honour to be your soninlaw you will permit me to kiss your hand caroline may have done worse my dear said the lady to her husband who was still wavering mr selwyn may be a judge himself or he may be a lord chancellor recollect that mr selwyn you are welcome and i shall be most happy to see his lordship and my husband shall call upon him when we know when he will be at leisure oh that colonel but hes rightly served a french teacher ha ha ha and mrs stanhopes mirth was communicated to her husband who now held out his hand to me in a most patronising manner well sir i give you joy i believe you have saved my daughters character and my dear added he very pompously we must do something for the young people i trust sir i bear your forgiveness to caroline yes you do mr selwyn said the lady bring her here as soon as you please oh that colonel ha ha ha and it is capital a french teacher ha ha ha such was the winding up of this second marriage had not mr and mrs stanhope been much subdued by the intelligence received from the colonel of the marriage being illegal and had they not also been much gratified at the mistake of the colonel things might not have gone off so pleasantly i have only to add that mr stanhope who appeared to obey his wife in every thing called upon the judge and their interview was very amicable mr stanhope upon the judge stating that his son had sufficient income immediately became profuse and settled pounds per annum upon his daughter during his life with a promise of much more eventually caroline was graciously received by her mother and presented with some splendid diamonds the judge told me that he knew the part i had taken in the affair and shook his finger at me thus ended this affair and madame gironac when she heard how busy i had been in the two elopements said ah valerie you begin by marrying other people you will end in finding a husband for yourself that is quite another thing madam i replied i have no objection in assisting other people to their wishes but it does not follow that therefore i am to seek for myself what i do not wish valerie i am a prophetess you will be married some time next year mark my words i will not forget them and at the end of the year we shall see who is right and who is wrong after all this bustle and turmoil there was a calm which lasted the whole winter i followed up my usual avocations i had as many pupils as i could attend to and saved money fast the winter passed away and in the spring i expected lionel with my brother auguste i looked forward to seeing my brother with great impatience not a day that he was out of my thoughts i was most anxious to hear of my father my brothers and sisters and every particular connected with the family even my mother was an object of interest although not of regard but i had forgiven all others who had illtreated me and i felt that i forgave and forgot if she would behave as a mother towards me i had received kind letters from madame dalbret and adele the letters of the latter were most amusing madame bathurst had called upon me several times i was at peace with all the world and with myself at last i received a letter from lionel stating that he was coming over in a few days that he had great difficulty in persuading my brother to come with him as he could not afford the expense out of his own means and did not like to lie under such an obligation at last he had been overruled and was coming with him then i shall see you again dear auguste thought i you who always loved me always protected me and took my part and who so lamented my supposed death and my thoughts turned to the time when he and i were with my grandmother in the palace and our early days were passed over in review my poor grandmother how i loved you and how you deserved to be loved and then i calculated what i might have been had i been left with my grandmother and had inherited her small property and on reflection i decided that i was better off now than i probably should have been and that all was for the best i thought of the future and whether it was likely i ever should marry and i decided that i never would but that if i ever returned to my family i would assist my sisters and try to make them happy yes thought i marry i never willthat is decidednothing shall ever induce me my reverie was interrupted by the entrance of a stranger who apologising to me stated that he had come to seek monsieur gironac i replied that he was not at home and probably it would be half an hour before he returned to dinner with your leave mademoiselle said he gracefully bowing i will wait till he returns i will not however trespass upon your time if it is disagreeable perhaps the servant will accommodate me with a chair elsewhere i requested that he would be seated as there was no fire in any other room and he took a chair he was a frenchman speaking good english but he soon discovered that i was his countrywoman and the conversation was carried on in french he informed me that he was the comte de chavannes but i must describe him he was rather small in stature but elegantly made his features were if anything effeminate but very handsome they would have been handsome in a woman the effeminacy was however relieved by a pair of moustaches soft silky and curling his manners were peculiarly fascinating and his conversation lively and full of point i was much pleased with him during the half hour that we were together during which we had kept up the conversation with much spirit the arrival of monsieur gironac put an end to our teteatete and having arranged his business with him which was relative to some flutemusic which the comte wished to be published after a few minutes more conversation he took his leave now theres a man that i would select for your husband valerie said monsieur gironac after the comte had left is he not a very agreeable fellow yes he is i replied he is very entertaining and very wellbred who is he his history is told in few words replied monsieur gironac his father emigrated with the bourbons but unlike most of those who emigrated he neither turned musicteacher dancingmaster hairdresser nor teacher of the french language he had a little money and he embarked in commerce he went as supercargo and then as travelling partner in a house to america the havannah and the west indies and after having crossed the atlantic about twenty times in the course of the late war he amassed a fortune of about pounds at the restoration he went to paris resumed his title which he had laid aside during his commercial course was well received by louis xviii and made a colonel of the legion of honour he returned to this country to settle his affairs previous to going down to brittany and died suddenly leaving the young man you have just seen who is his only son and heir alone on the wide world and with a good fortune as soon as he came of age at the time of his fathers death he was still at school now he is twentyfour years old and has been for three years in possession of the property which is still in the english funds he appears to like england better than france for most of his time is passed in london he is very talented very musical composes well and is altogether a most agreeable young man and fit for the husband of mademoiselle valerie de chatenoeuf now you have the whole history the marriage is yet to take place your last observation is correct or rather it is not for the marriage will never take place mais que voulezvous mademoiselle cried monsieur gironac must we send for the angel gabriel for you no replied i he is not a marrying man any more than i am a marrying woman is it not sufficient that i admit your count to be very agreeablethat wont content you you want me to marry a man whom i have seen for one half hour are you reasonable monsieur gironac he has rank wealth good looks talent and polished manners and you admit that you do not dislike him what would you have more he is not in love with me and i am not in love with him mademoiselle valerie de chatenoeuf you are une enfant i will no longer trouble myself with looking out for a husband for you you shall die a sour old maid and monsieur gironac left the room pretending to be in a passion a few days after the meeting with count de chavannes lionel made his appearance my heart beat quick as i welcomed him he is here said he anticipating my question but i called just to know when we should come and whether i was to say any thing to him before he came no no tell him nothingbring him here directlyhow long will it be before you return not half an hour i am at my old lodgings in suffolk street so goodbye for the present and lionel walked away again monsieur and madame gironac were both out and would not return for an hour or two i thought the half hour would never pass but it did at last and they knocked at the door lionel entered followed by my brother auguste i was surprised at his having grown so tall and handsome madame gironac is not at home mademoiselle said lionel no monsieur lionel allow me to present to you monsieur auguste de chatenoeuf a lieutenant in the service of his majesty the king of the french auguste bowed and as i returned the salute looked earnestly at me and started excuse me mademoiselle said he coming up to me and speaking in a tremulous voice butyes you must be valerie yes dear auguste cried i opening my arms he rushed to me and covered me with kisses and then staggering to a chair sat down and wept so did i and so did lionel for sympathy and company why did you conceal this from me lionel said he after a time see how you have unmanned me i only obeyed orders auguste replied lionel but now that i have executed my commission i will leave you together for you must have much to say to each other i will join you at dinnertime lionel went out and left us together we renewed our embraces and after we were more composed entered into explanations i told him my history in as few words as possible promising to enter into details afterwards and then i inquired about the family auguste replied i will begin from the time of your disappearance no one certainly had any suspicion of madame dalbret having spirited you away indeed she was as you know constantly at the barracks till my father left and expressed her conviction that you had destroyed yourself the outcry against your mother was universal she dared not show herself and your father was in a state to excite compassion four or five times a day did he take his melancholy walk down to the morgue to ascertain if your body was found he became so melancholy morose and irritable that people were afraid lest he would destroy himself he never went home to your mother but there was a scene of reproaches on his part and defence on hers that was a scandal to the barracks all her power over him ceased from that time and has ceased for ever since and perhaps you know that he has retired how should i know auguste yes he could not bear to look the other officers in the face he told me that he considered himself from his weakness and folly to have been the murderer of his child that he felt himself despicable and could not longer remain with the regiment as soon as the regiment arrived at lyons he sent in his retirement and has ever since been living at pau in the south of france upon his halfpay and the other property which he possesses my poor father exclaimed i bursting into tears as for me you know that i obtained leave to quit the regiment and have ever since been in the st of the line i have obtained my grade of lieutenant i have seen my father but once since i parted with him at paris he is much altered and his hair is grey is he comfortable where he is auguste yes valerie i think that he did wisely for it was ruinous travelling about with so many children he is comfortable and i believe as happy as he can be oh if he did but know that you were alive it would add ten years to his life he shall know it my dear auguste exclaimed i as the tears coursed down my cheeks i feel now that i was very selfish in consenting to madame dalbrets proposal but i was hardly in my senses at the time i cannot wonder at your taking the step nor can i blame you your life was one of torture and it was torture to others to see what you underwent i pity my father for weak as he was the punishment has been too severe but you will make him happy now and he will rejoice in his old days and now auguste tell me about nicolashe never liked me but i forgive himhow is he he is i believe well but he has left his home left home you know how kind your mother was to himi may say how she doted upon him well one day he announced his intention of going to italy with a friend he had picked up who belonged to naples his mother was frantic at the idea but he actually laughed at her and behaved in a very unfeeling manner your mother was cut to the heart and has never got over it but valerie the children who are spoiled by indulgence always turn out the most ungrateful have you heard of him since yes he wrote to me telling me that he was leading an orchestra in some small town and advancing rapidlyyou know his talent for music but not one line has he ever written to his mother ah me sighed i and that is all the return she has for her indulgence to him now tell me about clara she is well married and lives at tours her husband is an employe but i dont exactly know what and sophie and elisee are both well and promise to grow up fine girls but not so handsome as you are valerie it was the wonderful improvement in your person that made me doubt for a moment when i first saw you and dear little pierre that i used to pinch that i might get out of the house poor fellow is a fine boy and makes his father very melancholy and his mother very angry by talking about you and now auguste one more question on what terms are my father and mother and how does she conduct herself my father treats her with ceremony and politeness but not with affection she has tried every means to resume her empire over him but finds it impossible and she has now turned devote they sleep in separate rooms and he is very harsh and severe to her at times when the fit comes on him indeed valerie if you sought revenge which i know you do not do you have had sufficient for her brow is wrinkled with care and mortification but do you think she is sorry for what she has done i regret to say i do not i think she is sorry for the consequences but that her animosity against you would be greater than ever if she knew that you were alive and if you were again in her power she would wreak double vengeance many things have occurred to confirm me in this belief you have overthrown her power which she never will forgive and as for her religion i have no faith in that it is then as i feared auguste and if i make known my existence to my father it must be concealed from my mother i agree with you that it will be best for there is no saying to what point the vengeance of an unnatural mother may be carried but let us quit this subject for the present at least and now tell me more about yourself i willbut there is lionels knock so i must defer it till another opportunity dear auguste give me one more kiss while we are alone chapter twelve in a few minutes after lionels return which he had considerably postponed until monsieur gironacs dinner hour had all but arrived my good host first and then kind merry little madame made their appearance and a little while was consumed in introductions exclamations admirations and congratulations all tinctured not a little by that national vivacity which other folks are in the habit of calling extravagance and which as my readers well know already the good gironacs had by no means got rid of even in the course of a long sejour in the matteroffact metropolis of england fortunately my friends were for the most part au fait to the leading circumstances of my life so that little explanation was needed and more fortunately yet like tide and time dinner waits for no man nor have i ever observed in all my adventurous life that the sympathy of the most sentimental the grief of the most woebegone or the joy of the happiest ever induces them to neglect the summons of the dinnerbell and the calls of the responsive appetite in the midst of the delight of madame at having at last to receive the brother of cette chere valerie and that brother too si bel homme et brave officier et dune ressemblance si parfaite a la charmante soeur dinner was luckily announced and the torrenttide of madames hospitality was cut short by her husbands declaration that we were all like himself dying of hunger and that not a word more must be spoken touching sympathies or sentiments until we had partaken of something nutritious de quoi soutenir lepuisement des emotions si dechirantes madame laughed declared that he was un barbare un malheureux sans grandeur de lame and taking possession of auguste led him away into the diningroom where though she told me afterwards that she was au comble de desespoir at having to sit us down to so everyday a meal we found an excellent dinner and spent a very pleasant hour until coffee was served when with it not a little to my surprise nor very much to my delight monsieur de chavannes made his appearance there was a quizzical look on monsieur gironacs face and a roguish twinkle in his eye which led me to believe that what was really a matter of surprise to me was none to my worthy host for the count de chavannes had never visited the house before in the evening nor from what i had understood was he on terms of particular intimacy with the gironacs i was foolish enough to be at first a little put out at this and having manifested some slight embarrassment on his first entrance which i learned afterwards did not escape his eye though he was far too wellbred to show it i made the matter worse by calling my pride to my aid incited thereto by madame gironacs glance and smile at my blushing confusion and certainly in no respect contributed to the gaiety of the evening nothing however i must admit could have been more gentlemanly or in better taste than the whole demeanour of monsieur de chavannes and i could not help feeling this and comparing it mentally with the inferior bearing of others i had seen even in the midst of my fit of hauteur and frigidity he neither immediately withdrew himself on learning that my brother whom i had not seen for many years had but just arrived as any halfbred person would have done under the like circumstances with an awkward apology for his presence tending only to make every one else more awkward yet nor made set speeches nor foolish compliments on a subject too important for such trifling he did not trouble me with any attentions which he perceived would be at that moment distasteful but exhibited the most marked desire to cultivate the acquaintance of auguste to whom he showed a degree of deference though himself somewhat the senior as to a military man that flattered his esprit de corps mingled with a sort of frank cordiality which except from countryman to countryman in a foreign land would perhaps have been a little overdone but under the actual circumstances it could not have been improved for the short time he remained he conversed well and wittily yet with a strain of fancy and feeling blended with his wit which rendered it singularly original and attractive and perfectly succeeded though i know not whether he intended it or not in directing the attention of the company from my altered and somewhat unamiable mood among other things i remember that in the course of conversation while tendering some civilities to auguste the use of his riding horses his cabriolet or his services in showing him some of the lions of london he observed that monsieur de chatenoeuf must not consider such an offer impertinent on his part since he believed if our genealogy were properly traced some sort of cousinship could be established as more than one of the de chavannes had intermarried in old times with the chatenoeufs of gascony when both the families like their native provinces had been acting in alliance with the english plantagenets against the french kings of the house of valois a few words were said in connexion with this touching the singularity of the fact that it would seem as if england had something to do with the associations of the two families but i do not think the remark was made by de chavannes and whatever it was it was not sufficiently pointed to be in any way offensive or annoying on the whole hurt as i was in some sort by the idea which had taken hold of me that the gironacs through a false and indelicate idea of advancing my welfare were endeavouring to promote a liking between myself and the count i cannot deny that the evening on the whole was a pleasant one and that if at first it had been my impression that de chavannes was agreeable entertaining and wellbred i was now prepared to admit he had excellent taste and delicate feelings into the bargain still i felt that i did not like him or perhaps i should rather say his attentionsthough in fact he had paid me noneand was rather relieved when he made his bow and retired shortly afterwards auguste observed that i seemed dull and tired and madame gironac followed suit by saying that it was no wonder if the excitement and interest created by the unexpected arrival of so dear a brother had proved too much for my nerves thereupon after promising to return early in the morning so that we might have a long talk about the past and a long consultation about the future lionel and auguste bade us goodnight also but not before lionel had said to me as he was taking leave i think mademoiselle that it will be no more than proper that i should drive down to kew tomorrow morning and wait upon judge selwyn who has always been so kind to mehave you any message for him oh yes i beg you will tell him that auguste has come and that i request he will let me know when we may wait on him and the answer will be mademoiselle his waiting upon you is that what you desire i only desire what i stateto know when and how we may see him for i know very little of augustes heart if he does not wish to return thanks to one who except our dear friends here has been poor valeries surest confidant and protector but you will find the judges family increased since you saw him his son has persuaded my pretty little friend caroline stanhope to become his wife and she is living with the judges family at present lionel expressed his surprise and pleasure at the news but i thought at the moment that the pleasure was not real though i have since had reason to believe that the gravity which came over his face as he spoke was the gravity of thought rather than that as i fancied at the time of disappointment nothing more passed worthy of record and after shaking hands with lionel and kissing my longlost brother i was left alone with the gironacs half expectant of a playful scolding well mademoiselle valerie de chatenoeuf began monsieur as soon as the gentlemen had left us is it because you have found out that you have got a handsome brother that you are determined to drive all other handsome young men au desespoiror is it that you wish to break the heart especially of this pauvre monsieur de chavannes that you have treated us all with an air si hautaine si hautaine that if you had been the queen of france it could not have been colder i told you once before monsieur gironac i replied that your count de chavannes does not care a straw how i treat him or with what air and if he did i do nothe is simply a civil agreeable gentleman who looks upon me as he would upon any other young lady whom he is glad to talk to when she is in the humour to talk and whom when she is not he leaves to herself as all wellbred men do but i repeat i do not care enough about him to think for one moment whether he is hautaine or not and he feels just the same about me i am certain what brings him here then ehwhere he never came before tonight not for the beaux yeux of madame i believe with a quizzical bow to his wife or for the grand esprit of myself i have an eye i tell you as well as other people and i can see one petit peu i have no doubt you can monsieur i answered rather pettishly for i suppose you asked him yourself and if you did so on my account i must beg you will omit that proof of kindness in future for i do not wish to see him oh monsieur gironac for shame you have made her very angry with your ridiculous badinageyou have made her angry really and i do not wonder who ever heard of teasing a young lady about a gentleman she has never seen only three times and who has never declared any preference madame replied her husband in great wrath either real or simulated vous etes une ingrateuneunewords fail me to express what i think of your enormous and unkind ingratitude i am homme incompris and mademoiselle heremademoiselle is either une enfant or she does not know her own mind shall i give the comte chavannes his conge or shall i not i shall notfor if she be une enfant it is fit her friends look after her if she does not know her own mind it is good she have some one who dovoila tout here is why i shall not go congedier monsieur le comte why rather i shall request him to dine with me tomorrow the next day the day after if he do not i swear by my honour foi de gironac i will dine at home again never more i could not help laughing at this tirade of the kindhearted little man on the strength of which he patted me on the head and said i was bonne enfant if i were not si diablement entetee and bade me go to bed and sleep myself into a better humour a piece of advice which appeared to me so judicious that i proceeded at once to obey it and bidding them both a kind goodnight betook myself to my own room to ponder rather than to sleep and in truth i felt that i had need of reflection for with the return of auguste a tide of feelings which had long lain dormant rather than dead within me had almost overwhelmed me and the hardness which had its origin in the bitterness of conscious dependence and which had gained strength from the pride of selfacquired independence began to thaw in my heart and to give way to milder and gentler feelings the thoughts of home the desire for my country the love for my father who though weak and almost imbecile had ever been kind to me in person the craving affection for my brothers and my sisters nay something approaching to pity or regret for the mother who had proved herself but a stepmother towards me all revived in increased and reinvigorated force byandbye too i began to feel that i should be very wretched after the parting with my beloved brother at the end of so brief a renewal of love and intimacy to be aware of what i had scarcely felt before in the selfconfidence of the position i had wonthat it is a sad and lonely thing to be a sojourner in a foreign land with no natural friends no kind kindred on whom to rely in case of sickness or misfortuneand to consider how dark and grave a thing must be solitary old age and perhaps a solitary deathbed far from the home of ones youth the friends of ones childhood then there arose another thought connected with the preceding by that extraordinary and inexplicable chain which seems to run through the whole mind of man linking together things apparently as far asunder as the poles which have however in reality a kindred origin that thought was wherefore should my life be solitary why should i stand apart and alone from my race relying on myself only and depriving myself for the sake of a perhaps imaginary independence of all the endearments of social life all the sweet ties of family perhaps the very presence of my brother had opened my eyes to the truth that there is no such thing in the world as real independence to realise that possession most coveted and most unattainable one must be a robinson crusoe alone on his desert islanda sort of independence which no one i should think would practically desire to enjoy before sleep came i believe that i began to muse about monsieur de chavannes but it was only to think that i did not care in the least about him nor he about me and that so far as he was concerned i had seen no cause to change my decided resolution that i would never marry all this was perhaps in reality the best of proofs that i did already care something about him and was very likely before long to care something more for some one has said and he by the way no ordinary judge of human nature that if he desired to win a womans fancy or affection his first step would be to make her think about himeven if it were to hate him anything before the absence of all thought the blank void of real absolute indifference indeed i believe it is nearly true that a woman rarely begins to think often of a man even if it be as she fancies in dislike but when however she may deceive herself she is on the verge of loving him was such the case with me at least if it were so i was then so far from knowing it that i did not even ask myself the question but i remember that when i fell asleep i dreamed that i was standing at the altar with the count de chavannes when a band of all those who had ever wronged me my mother madame dalbret madame bathurst the stanhopes lady m rushed between us and tore us forcibly asunderand i wept so loud that my sorrow awoke me and it was some time before i was sure it was a dream early the next morning auguste came again to see me and as monsieur gironac was abroad giving lessons on the flute and guitar while madame either was or pretended to be excessively busy with her waxflowers we had the whole day to ourselves until luncheon time and we profited by it so well that before we were interrupted we had little to learn on either side concerning the passages of our lives and the adventures which both we and all our families had gone through and if i had been a little inclined to be proud of myself before and to give their full value to my energy and decision of character i certainly now stood in no small danger of being spoiled by augustes praises for now half crying at my trials and troublesnow laughing at lady rs absurditiesnow bursting into vehement invective against my enemieshe insisted that i was a perfect heroinethe bravest and most accomplished of women as well as the dearest of sisters but when i had finished my own story which i did not begin until i had extracted from him every particle of information about my family well my little valerie he said caressingly as he put his arm about my waist you have told me everythingall your little sorrows and trials and troublesall your little pleasures and successesall your little schemings and manoeuvrings in the loveaffairs of other people and all about the great little fortune which you have accumulatedquite a millionaire upon my word with your twentyfive hundred livres de rentebut not one word have you told me about your own little affaires de coeur i am afraid little sister mine you are either a very great hypocrite or very coldhearted which is it dearest valerie very coldhearted i believe brother at least i certainly have no affaires de coeur to relate i cannot pretend to say whether it is my fault or that of other people but certainly no one ever fell in love with me if it were not that odious monsieur g and most certainly i have never fallen in love with any one at all auguste gazed earnestly in my face for a moment as if he would have read my heart but i met his eyes with mine quite steadily and calmly till at length i burst into a merry laugh which i could not restrain quite true little sister he said at last after my manner had in some sort convinced him quite true auguste upon my honour i replied well valerie i suppose i must believe that earnest face and that honest little laugh of yours you may just as well do so indeed i replied for no one was ever in love with me i assure you and i do not think i added with a touch of the old pride that a de chatenoeuf is likely to give away a heart that is not desired it is all very strange he added and this monsieur lionel dempster is a little older than poor pierre whom i used to pinch when i wanted to get out of my mothers reach and regards me very much as he would a much elder sisteralmost indeed as a mother a mother indeed valerie he once told me something of the kind he is a very fine young man certainly full of talent and spirit and will make you a very good and agreeable friendbut he is no husband for me i assure you he would do much better for sophie or elisee if he ever should see and like either of them always busy for others valerie and for yourselfwhen will you think for yourself i think i have thought and done too for myself pretty well you forget my twentyfive hundred livres de rente but twentyfive hundred livres de rente are not a husband valerie i am not so sure about that i daresay they would buy one at a pinch i replied laughing at least in our poor country where everyone you meet in society is not a millionaire like those cold islanders i think you have grown almost as cold yourself little sister and as calculating to be sure i have i made answer and to punish me monsieur gironac swears that i shall die a sour old maid and what do you say an old maid very likely but not a sour one at all events but hark there is a carriage at the doorlet me see who it is and i jumped up and running to the window saw the selwyn liveries and lionel en cavalier beside the carriagewindow in a moment the steps were let down and caroline speedily made her appearance commissioned as she said by her motherinlaw to take immediate possession both of myself and auguste and to bring us down straightway to kew her husband she said would certainly have called on monsieur de chatenoeuf and the judge also but that the courts being all in session they were both so completely occupied that except after dinner they had not an hour of the twentyfour disengaged she was commanded moreover she added to invite monsieur and madame gironac to dine at kew on the following day me moreover and auguste she was to carry down forthwith in the carriage so now she said get you gone valerie and pack up as quickly as possible all that you require to make yourself beautiful for a week at least and what do you say to all this messieurs said i laughingly to my brother and lionel for there is much more necessity to consult you lords of the creation as you call yourselves who are in reality vainer by half and care five times as much about your toilettes as we much calumniated womenwhat do you say about this summary packing up and taking flightcan it be accomplished it is accomplished replied lionel in so far at least that i have promised on my own part and for monsieur auguste de chatenoeuf in the bargain to overlook the preparation of his kit as well as my own and to bring them down in a cabriolet while you and your brother are rolling smoothly along in the judges venerable coach all that is arranged then said i and i will not detain you above ten minutes during which time i will send madame gironac to amuse you and you can deliver your own message to her and then without waiting for any answer i hurried upstairs to make my travelling toilette and to put up things for a weeks visit to my good friends in the meantime madame gironac who had always been a great favourite of carolines had taken my place and by the merriment which i could hear going on i could not doubt that on the whole the party had been a gainer by the exchange before i was quite ready to make my reappearance there came a smart double knock at the door and then after a minute or two i could distinguish a gentlemans footstep ascending the staircase to the diningroom my own room looked towards the back of the house so that i had no means of seeing for myself who the new comer was and i did not choose to ask any questions of the servant girl who was bustling in and out of the door with trunks and travellingcases innumerable so i finished my toilette with a heart that beat i must confess a little faster than usual though i should certainly have been puzzled to explain why put on my hat and shawl perhaps a little coquettishly and went down stairs half impatient half embarrassed yet fully persuaded in my own mind that i had not the least expectation of seeing anybody in particular i found all the company assembled round the luncheontable when i entered and busily engaged with the cotelettes a la maintenon and green peas among those present was monsieur le comte de chavannes whom i certainly did not expect to see he rose immediately from the table as i entered and advanced a step or two to meet me with a graceful inclination and a few wellchosen words to the intent that he had called in order to invite monsieur de chatenoeuf to go out and take a promenade a cheval with him in order to see the parks and the beauty of london all this was said with the utmost frankness and in the most unaffected manner in the world and assuredly there was nothing either in the words or in the manner in which they were uttered which should have thrown me into a confusion of blushes and rendered me for a moment almost incapable of answering him it must be remembered however that i had been rallied very much concerning him of late by monsieur gironac and i could scarcely avoid perceiving that this exceeding assiduity in doing the honours to auguste could not but be attributed to some more potent cause than mere civility to a fellowcountryman my confusion produced for a second or two a slight similar embarrassment in the count and the blood mounted highly to his forehead our eyes met too at the same instant and though the encounter was but momentary from that time a sort of secret consciousness was established between us this scene passed in less time than it takes to describe it and becoming aware that every ones eyes were upon us i rallied instinctively replied by a few civil words of thanks and took a place at the table which had been left vacant for me between my brother and lionel dempster this little interruption at an end the conversation returned to the course it had taken before i came in and there was a good deal of very agreeable talk as is sure to be the case whenever four or five pleasant and clever people are thrown together under circumstances which create a sudden and unexpected familiarity each person desirous of amusing and rendering himself pleasant to his companions of an hour but not so anxious to make an impression as to become stiff stilted or affected lionel as i have said long ago was remarkably witty and clever by nature and had profited greatly by his opportunities in france so much so that i have rarely seen a young man of his age at all comparable to him the count was likewise a person of superior abilities and breeding with a touch of english seriousness and soundness engrafted on the stock of french vivacity and my brother auguste was a young ardent soldier full of gay youth high hopes and brilliant aspirations all kindled up by the excitement of thus visiting a foreign country and finding himself in the company of a longlost and muchbeloved sister caroline selwyn was quick bright and lively madame gironac was a perfect mine of life and vivacity and i desirous of atoning for my folly of the past evening did my best to be agreeable i suppose i was not wholly unsuccessful and every time i raised my eyes i was sure to find those of monsieur de chavannes riveted on my face with a deep earnest gaze which though it was instantly averted even before our glances met showed that he was in some sort interested either in myself or in my words before luncheon was finished monsieur gironac made his entree and it was finally arranged that he and madame should join us at kew on the following evening and before we set off caroline expressed a hope to the count de chavannes that he would call upon his friend monsieur de chatenoeuf while he was staying at the judges explaining that it was impossible for mr selwyn or the judge to wait on him for some days until the courts had done sitting when she assured him that they would do so without fail he promised immediately without a moments hesitation that he would do so and i believe a riding party was made up on the spot between himself lionel and auguste for the second or third day as soon as everything was settled caroline hurried us away saying that her motherinlaw would think she had run off and a short agreeable drive carried us down to the judges pleasant villa where i was received almost as one of the family and auguste rather as an old friend than as a stranger and a foreigner the time passed away pleasantly for it was the height of the loveliest spring weather the situation of the villa on the banks of the thames was in itself charming and for once the english month of may was what its poets have described itthat is to say what it is once in every hundred years every one wished to please and to be pleased and the selwyns were of that very rare class of people whom you like the more the more you see of themthe very reverse of the world in generalnothing could be more delightful than the week which we passed there from the judge i had no concealments and regarding him almost in the light of a second father while auguste was prepared to love him for his love to me we had many long conversations and consultations concerning my affairs and the propriety of disclosing my existence to my father this i was resolved upon and both the judge and auguste approving it was decided that it should be done the only question then which remained to be disposed of was how far my disclosures should be carried and whether it would be practicable and if practicable safe that i should return to france at present or indeed at all while in my present condition auguste gave me his opinion as he had done repeatedly that my mother never had laid aside and never would lay aside her rancour towards me and that she would grasp at the first opportunity of taking any vengeance upon me which my presence should afford her he did not believe he said that my father would be able long to preserve from her the secret of my being alive and of my having raised myself to a condition of comparative affluence nor did he feel by any means assured that while labouring under the revulsion of feelings which the happy tidings would work upon his mind my mother would not recover her ascendancy over him beyond this he could say nothing for as a young frenchman and more especially a young french soldier he knew even less about the laws of france and the rights of parents over children than did judge selwyn only like the judge he was inclined to the opinion that i had better not trust myself within the limits of any jurisdiction which might be called upon to hand me over to the parental authority until such time as i should be completely my own mistress as regarded them which probably could only be effected by ceasing to be my own mistress as regarded some one else for be assured valerie he added that the possession of your person for the purpose of annoying you and avenging herself on you for all the sufferings she has undergone in consequence of your supposed suicide will become the darling object of her life so sure as she learns that you are in the land of the living and the fact of your having secured to yourself a little fortune will not act as a check upon her inclinations i sighed deeply for although i felt and knew the truth of all he said and expected that he would say it his words seemed to extinguish the last spark of hope in my heart and it is a bitter and painful thing in any case for a daughter to feel that she shall in all probability never again be permitted to see the authors of her life or the companions and scenes of her childhood but it is doubly so when she feels it to be the fault of the wickedness or weakness of those whom she would fain love and esteem but cannot the good judge marked my emotion and laying his hand kindly on my shoulder said you must not give way my dear girl you have done all that is right and true and honest and the course which you have taken has been forced upon you to yield now and return home to be tortured and despoiled of the little all which your own good sense and your own good conduct have procured youfor apart from good sense and good conduct there is no such thing in the world as good fortunewould not only be positive insanity but positive ingratitude to the giver of all good my advice to you therefore is to remain altogether passive to pursue the career which you have chosen and without yourself taking any steps to disclose your present situation to authorise your brother fully to reveal to your father so much of it as shall appear necessary and desirable to him when on the spot i should not recommend that your place of residence or exact circumstances should be communicated even to him at least for the present and should he desire to write to you the letters should pass through your brothers hands and be forwarded under cover to me which will prevent the gaining of intelligence through the postoffice the rest we must leave to the effects of time and of that providence which has been displayed so singularly in your behalf already and which never deserts those who believe humbly and endeavour sincerely to deserve divine favour so this he added with a smile is the end and sum total of an old lawyers counsel and an old mans sermon and now think over what i have said between you for i believe you will find it the best course although it may now hardly suit your excited feelings and in the meantime let us go on the lawn and join the ladies who seem to have got some new metal of attraction indeed judge i replied i am quite convinced of the wisdom of what you propose and i thank you sincerely for your advice as for all your other goodness towards me no father could be kinder to an only daughter than you have been to me and god will bless you for it but to say the truth i do feel very sad and downcast just at this moment and am not equal to the joining that gay party i will go up to my own room i added for a little while and come down again so soon as i can conquer this foolish weakness do not call it foolish valerie returned the old man with a benignant smile nothing that is natural can be foolishleast of all anything of natural and kindly feeling but do not yield to itdo not yield to it the feelings are good slaves but wretchedly poor masters do as you will my dear child but come to us again as soon as you can in the meantime monsieur de chatenoeuf let us go and see who are these new comers and with these words he turned away leaning familiarly upon my brothers arm and left me to collect myself and recover from the perturbation of my feelings as well and as soon as i could which was not perhaps the more quickly that i had easily recognised in the new arrival the person of the count de chavannes i have entered perhaps more fully into the detail of my sentiments at this period of my life for two reasonsone because of an eventful life this was upon the whole the most eventful momentthe other that having hitherto recorded facts and actions rather than feelings or principles i am conscious that i have represented myself as a somewhat harder and more worldly person than i feel myself in truth to be but the hardness and the worldliness were produced if they existed at all by the hardness of the circumstances into which i was thrown and the worldliness of the persons with whom i was brought into contact adversity had hardened my character and perhaps in some sort my heart also at least it had aroused my pride to the utmost had set me as it were upon the defensive and led me to regard every stranger with suspicion and to look in him for a future enemy good fortune had however altered all this all who had been my enemies who had injured or misrepresented me were disarmed or subdued or repentant i had forgiven all the worldwas at peace with all the world i had achieved what to me was a little competence i was loved and esteemed by those whom i could in return love and esteem and of whose regard i could be honestly proud i had recovered my brother i still hoped to be reconciled to my parentsandandwhy should i conceal iti was beginning to think it by far less improbable that i should one day marryin a word i was beginning to like if not yet to love all these things had been by degrees effecting a change in my thoughts and feelings i had been gradually thawing and was now completely melted so that i felt the necessity of being aloneof giving wayof weeping i went to my own chamber threw myself on my bed and wept long and freely but these were not tears of agony such as i shed when i first learned madame dalbrets cruel conduct towards menor tears of injured pride such as madame bathurst had forced from me by her effort to humiliate me in my own eyesnor yet tears of wrathful indignation such as burst from me when i detected lady m in her base endeavour to destroy my character these were tears of affection of softness almost of joy they flowed noiselessly and gently and they relieved me for my heart was very full and when i was relieved i bathed my face and arranged my hair and descended the staircase almost merrily to join the merry company in the garden i found on my joining them that the count de chavannes had already completely gained the good graces not only of caroline and her young sistersinlaw but of mr selwyn and the judge also he had come down to kew with the particular purpose of engaging my brother and lionel to accompany him on the next day but one to wormwood scrubs where there was to be a grand review in honour of some foreign prince or other of two or three regiments of light cavalry with horseartillery and rockets it was to conclude with a sham fight and which he thought would interest auguste as a military man and especially one who had commenced his service in the hussars though he had been subsequently transferred into the line this plan had been discussed and talked over until the ladies having expressed a laughing desire to see the spectacle it was decided that caroline the two miss selwyns and myself escorted by lionel in the rumble should go down to the review in the judges carriage auguste and the count accompanying us en cavalier and that after the order of the day should be concluded the whole party including the count should return to dinner at kew on the day following as i did not think it either wise or correct to neglect my pupils my chapel or mrs bradshaws school although i had sent satisfactory reasons for taking one weeks leave of absence we were all to return to town i to good monsieur gironacs auguste and lionel to the lodgings of the latter in suffolk street monsieur de chavannes did not stay long after i made my appearance not wishing either to be or to appear de trop on a first visit nor had he any opportunity of addressing more than a few commonplace observations to me had he desired to do so still i observed the same peculiarity in his manner towards me as distinct as possible from the sort of proud humility half badinage half earnest which he put on in talking with other ladies to me he observed a tone of serious softness with something of earnest deference to everything that fell from my lips however light or casual for which he seemed to watch with the utmost eagerness he never joked with me though he was doing so continually with the others not that he was in the least degree grave or formal much less stiff or affected but rather that he seemed desirous of proving to me that he was not a mere butterfly of society but had deeper ideas and higher aspirations than the every day world around us when he was going away he for the first time put out his hand to me a langlaise and as i shook hands with him our eyes met once more and i believe i again blushed a little for though he dropped his gaze instantly and bowed low taking off his hat he pressed my fingers very gently ere he let them fall and then turning to take his leave of the judge and mr selwyn who had just joined us mounted his horsea very fine hunter by the way which he sat admirablyagain bowed low and cantered off followed by his groom as well mounted as himself he was not well out of sight before as usual he became the topic of general discussion what a charming person said caroline so full of spirit and vivacity and yet so evidently a man of mind and good feeling where did you pick him up valerie he is an old friend i told you of monsieur gironacs and was calling there by accident when he met auguste and since that he has been exceedingly kind and civil to him that is the whole i know about him well he is very handsome said caroline dont you think so valerie yes i answered quite composedly very handsome a little effeminatelooking perhaps oh no not in the least said caroline or if he is so quick and clever and spiritedlooking that it quite takes all that away caroline said selwyn laughing you have no right to have eyes to see or ears to hear or mind to comprehend beauty or wit or any other good quality in any one save me your lord and master you you monster she replied laughing gaily i never thought you one bit handsome or witty or dreamed that you had one good quality i only married you you know as well as i do to get away from school and from the atrocious tyranny of my musicmistress there you need not look fie at me valerie for im too big to be put in the corner now and he wont let you whip me i think he ought to whip you himself baby replied the judge who had grown very fond of her and in truth she was a very loveable little person in her way and made her husband a very happy man now judge selwyn interposed i do you remember a conversation we once had together in which you endeavoured to force me to believe that men in general and you in particular were not tyrants to your wives and families and now do i hear you giving your son such advice as that alas what can make women so insane dont you know cant you guess mademoiselle valerie asked the old judge smiling slily and with the least possible wink of his eye when some of the others were looking at us and then he added in a lower voice perhaps it will be your turn soon i think you will soon be able to go to france without much fear of your mothers persecution come he continued offering me his arm as the others had now moved a little way apart come and take a turn with me in the cedarwalk till dinners ready i want to talk to you for who knows when one will get another opportunity i took his arm without reply though my heart beat very fast and i felt uncomfortable knowing as i did perfectly well beforehand what he was going to say to me we turned into the cedarwalk which was a long shadowy aisle or bower overhung with magnificent cedars of lebanon running parallel with the banks of the noble river and so still and secluded that no more proper place could be found for a private consultation well said the old man speaking gently but not looking at me perhaps for fear of embarrassing me by his eye you know i am in some sort not only your legal adviser but your selfconstituted guardian and father confessorso now without farther preamble who is he valerie i will not affect to misunderstand you judge though upon my word you are entirely mistaken in your conjecture upon your word entirely mistaken i think noti am sure not you are indeed i have not seen him above four times nor spoken fifty words to him never mind never mindwho is he an acquaintance of monsieur gironacs monsieur le comte de chavannes his father emigrated hither during the revolution engaged in commerce and made a fortune of some pounds at the restoration the old count returned to france and was made by louis xviii a colonel of the legion of honour and died shortly afterwards there is an estate i believe in brittany but monsieur de chavannes who was at school here and has passed all his younger days in this country is more an englishman than a frenchman and only visits france at rare intervals that is all i know about him and that only by accident monsieur gironac having told me in his lively way what i should not have dreamed of inquiring very proper indeedand very good so far but one would like to know something definite about a man before taking him for ones husband i should think so indeed judge but as i am not going to take him for my husband i am quite contented with knowing what i do know of him and what do you knowof yourselfi speak of your own knowledge no hearsay evidence in the case nothing more than that he is lively and agreeable that he has very good manners and seems very goodnaturedi might say he has been very goodnatured to auguste poor fellow poor fellow yes answered the judge but men are very apt to be goodnatured to poor fellows who have got nice sisters with whom they are in love i dare say judge but to reply in your own phraseologythat is no case in point for granting that augustes sister is nice which i will not be so modest as to gainsay monsieur de chavannes is not the least in love with her perhaps not certainly not well be it so what else do you know about him nothing judge selwyn nothing of his character his principles his morals or his habits really judge one would think to hear you that i was going to hire a footmanwhich i am much too poor to doand that monsieur de chavannes had applied for the place what on earth have i to do with the young gentlemans character or principles i know that he is very gentlemanlike and is neither a coxcomb nor a pedant which is refreshing in these days and as caroline says very handsome eh yes i think he is handsome i replied but that has nothing to do with it not much truly said the judge drily and this is all you know or desire to know it seems to me quite enough to know of an acquaintance of a few days standing wellwell he answered shaking his head a little well he is all that you say a very fine young man he seems i like him well i will make inquiries not on my account i intreat judge selwynsaid i interrupting him eagerly mademoiselle valerie de chatenoeuf he said drily though half in jest my head is an old one yours a very young one i know young folks are apt to think old heads good for nothing i do not i am sure interrupted i again i do not indeed nor i valeriehe answered interrupting me in his turn with a goodnatured smile so you shall let me have my way in this matter but to relieve you my dear permit me to observe that i have two daughters of my own and one young son besides charles who is old enough to take care of himself and though i am very glad to ask a young man to dine in my house who has as you observe very good manners and is neither a fool nor a coxcomb i am not at all willing that he should become what you call an habitue until i know something of his character and principles and now as the dressingbell has rung these ten minutes and it will take you at least halfanhour to beautify your little person i advise you to make the most of your time and by all means valerie stick to your resolutionnever marry my dear never marry for all men are tyrants one might be very sure that i profited by this dismissal and ran across the lawn as fast as i could glad to escape the farsighted experience of the shrewd old lawyer he has seen it then i thought to myself he has observed it even in this little space even in this one interview and he has read it even as i read it i wonder if he has read my heart too no no i continued communing with myself that he cannot have done for i know not yet myself how to interpret it little thought i then that whenever our feelings are deeply interested or when strong passions are at work even in embryo we are for the most part the last persons who discover the secrets which are transparent enough heaven knows to all persons but ourselves i do not know nor did i inquire whether the judge pursued his inquiries concerning the count as he had promised to do much less did i learn what was their result but i do know that the following morning the young gentleman called again at the gate with a led horse for my brother but did not ask if we were at home merely sending his compliments to the ladies and requesting monsieur de chatenoeuf to accompany him for a ride lionel was absent in the city on business so that auguste and the count rode out alone and did not return until it was growing dark when there was scarcely time to dress for dinner the latter again sending in an apology for detaining my brother so long and retiring without getting off his horse this gave me i confess more pleasure than it would have done to see him though that would have given me pleasure too for i saw in it a proof of something more than mere tact of mental delicacy i mean and an anxiety not to obtrude either upon the hospitality of the selwyns or upon my feelings auguste on his return was in amazing spirits and did nothing all dinnertime but expatiate upon the companionable and amiable qualities of de chavannes whom he already liked he said more than any person he had ever seen for so short a timeso clever so highspirited so gallant everything in a word that a man could desire for a friend or a lady for a lover heyday said the judge laughing at this tirade this fine count with his black moustaches seems to have made one conquest mighty quickly i hope it will not run in the company or we shall have more elopementswith a sly glance at caroline mademoiselle valerie here he continued is a terrible person for promoting elopements too but we must have none from my house we continued to be very gay all dinnertime after dinner we had some music and the judge was just pressing me to sing when lionels servant came into the room having hurried down from london in pursuit of his master in consequence of the sudden arrival of a large package of letters from paris endorsed immediate and to be delivered with all speed this incident broke up the party for the moment and indeed threw a chill over us all for the whole evening when it appeared that the principal letter was one to my brother from the commandant of paris of which city his regiment formed a part of the garrison reluctantly revoking his leave of absence in consequence of some expected emeute and intimating that his presence would be expected at headquarters on or before the third day of june an order which it was of course impossible to think of neglecting or disobeying while it would leave him at the furthest but a single week to give to us in london it was a bitter disappointment to be separated after so brief a communion but we consoled ourselves by the recollection that the straits of dover are not the pacific ocean and that paris and london are not a thousand leagues asunder chapter thirteen there never was a finer morning in the world than that appointed for the review it was just the end of may and all the scenery even in the very suburbs of the great city was brilliant with all the characteristic beauty of an english landscape the fine horsechestnut trees and the thick hawthorn hedges were all in full bloom and the air was perfectly scented with perfumes from the innumerable nursery grounds which hedge in that side of london with a belt of flowers the parks and the suburban roads were crowded with neatlydressed modestlooking nurses and nurserymaids leading whole troops of rosycheeked browncurled merry boys and girls to enjoy the fresh morning air and auguste was never tired as we drove along of admiring everything that met his eyes in quick succession the trees the flowery hedges the gay parterres the glimpses of the noble thames white with the sails of innumerable craft the beautiful villas with their small highly cultivated pleasuregrounds the pretty nurserymaids and happy english children all came in for a share of his rapturous admiration and so vivacious and original were his comments on all that he saw that he in some sort communicated the infection of his merry humour to us also and we were all as gay and joyous as the season and the scene when we came to the ground destined for the review my brother was silent and i saw his cheek turn pale for a moment but his eye brightened and flashed as it ran over the splendid lines of the cavalry which at the moment we came upon the ground were parading past the royal personage in honour of whom the review was given and who was on horseback by the side of a somewhat slender elderly gentleman dressed in the uniform of a fieldmarshal whose eagle eye and aquiline nose announced him at a glance the vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre magnifique mais cest vraiment magnifique muttered my brother to himself as the superb lifeguards swept along with their polished steel helmets and breastplates glittering like silver in the sunshine and their plumes and guidons flashing and twinkling in the breeze dieu de dieu quils sont geants les cavaliers quils sont colossaux les chevaux et les allures si lestes si gracieuses comme sils netaient que des juments mais cest un spectacle magnifique a moment afterwards a regiment of lancers passed at a trot with their pennons fluttering in the breeze and their lanceheads glimmering like stars above the clouds of dust which rose from under their horses hoofs and these were followed by several squadrons of hussars with their crimson trousers and their gaily furred pelisses and then troop after troop of horseartillery clattering along the highbred horses whirling the heavy guns and caissons behind them as if they had been mere playthings it certainly was a beautiful and brilliant pageant and the splendid military music of the cavalrybands the clash and clang of the silver cymbals the ringing roll of the kettledrums and the symphonious cadences of the cornets horns and trumpets at the same time delighted and excited me to the utmost but i confess that to me the calm old veteran sitting unmoved amidst all that pomp and clangour and evidently marking only every smallest minutiae of the men the accoutrements the movements was a more interesting a more moving sight than all the pageantry of uniform than all the thrill of music i thought how he had sat as cool and impassive under the iron hail of battle with thousands and thousands of the best and bravest falling around him the fate of nations hanging on a balanced scale in those fights of giantsi thought how he alone of men had faced undaunted and selfconfident that greater than hannibal or alexander that worldconqueror napoleoni thought how he had quelled the might of my own gallant land and my blood seemed to thrill coldly in my veins as it will at the recital of great deeds and noble daringand i knew not altogether whether it was the shudder of dislike or the thrill of admiration that so shook me had he looked proud or selfelate or triumphant i felt that i could have hated him but so impassive and withal now so frail and feeble yet with an eye so calmly firm an expression of rectitude so conscious i could not but perceive that if an enemy of my belle france was before me it was an enemy who had been made such by duty not by choicean enemy who had done nought in hatred all in honour i acknowledged to myself that i was in the presence of the greatest living man and though i could neither love nor worship i felt subdued and awed into a sort of breathless horror as one might fancy humanity to be in the presence of some superior intelligence some being of another world the girls observed my riveted and almost fascinated eye as it dwelt on that mighty soldier and began to whisper to one another with a sort of very natural pride at the evident interest which we took in their favourite hero their tittering attracted my brothers attention and following their eyes he was not long in discovering what it was that had excited their mirth and he looked at me for a moment with something like a frown on his forehead but it cleared away in a moment and he smiled at his own vehemence perhaps injustice at that moment the different regiments began wheeling to and fro in long lines and open columns of troops and performing an infinity of manoeuvres which though i of course did not in the least degree comprehend them were very fine and beautiful to look at from the rapidity of the movements the high spirit of the horses and the gleam and glitter of the arms half seen among the dustclouds my brother however began as i could see to be vehemently excited and his constant comments and exclamations of surprise and admiration bore testimony to the correctness with which every movement was executed then came the roar of the artillery as the guns retreated before the charging horse and even i could comprehend and appreciate the marvellous celerity with which flash followed flash and roar echoed roar from the same piece so speedily that it was scarcely possible to comprehend how the gun should have been loaded and reloaded while the horses were at full gallop by this time all the gentlemen had become so much interested and excited by the scene that lionel having got upon his horse which had been led down to the ground by his servant they asked our permission to leave us for a short time and ride nearer to the spot where the artillery were manoeuvring as we had several servants about us in the first place and as in the second there is not the slightest danger of ladies being treated with incivility by an english crowd unless through their own fault or indiscretion of course no objection was made and our cavaliers galloped away promising to return within a quarter of an hour scarcely were they out of sight before i observed a tall handsome soldierly man though in plain clothes ride past the carriage on a very fine horse followed by a groom in a plain dark frock with a cockade in his hat it seemed to me on the instant that i had seen his face somewhere before and that i ought to know him for the features all seemed familiar although had it been to save my life i could not have said where i had met him i was torturing my memory on this head in vainfor he was evidently an englishman and i had no acquaintance with any english officerwhen he rode past a second time and seemed to be engaged in endeavouring to decipher the arms on our carriage and his object appeared to be the discovery of who i was at least i could not but observe that he looked at me from time to time with a furtive glance from under the brim of his hat as if he too fancied that he knew or remembered me the same thing happened yet a third time and then he called his servant to his side and i saw the man ride up a second afterwards to judge selwyns footman who was standing at a few yards distance from the carriage and ask him some question which he answered by a word or two when the groom rode away the gentleman on receiving the reply nodded his head quietly as if he would have said i thought so and then he looked at me steadily till he caught my eye when he raised his hat made a half military bow and trotted slowly away carolines quick eye caught this action in an instant and turning to me suddenly she cried quickly ah valerie who is that that handsome man who bowed to youwhere have i seen him before the very question which i was asking myself caroline i am quite sure that i have seen his face and yet i cannot remember where it is very strange very replied a strange sneering voice close to my ear with a slightly foreign accent can you say where you have seen mine ingrate i turned my head as quick as lightning for in answering caroline who sat on the side of the carriage next to the military spectacle i had leaned a little inward and there with his effeminate features actually livid with rage and writhing with impotent malignity stood monsieur g the infamous divorced husband of madame dalbret and the first cause of almost all my misfortunes i looked at him steadily and replied with bitter but calm contempt perfectly well monsieur g and very little did i suppose that i should ever see it again i imagined sir that you were in your proper placethe galleys it was wrong doubtless in me so to answer himunfeminine perhaps and too provocative of insult but the blood of my race is hot and vehement to repel insult and when i thought of the sufferings i had endured the trials i had encountered and the contumely which i had borne on account of that man my every vein seemed to overflow with passion ha he replied grinding his teeth with rage and becoming crimson from the rush of blood to his head while he grasped my wrist hard with his hand and shook it furiously ha to the galleys yourselfchienne ingrate perfide traitresse cest aux galeres que jai cru te rencontrerou plutot a la what further atrocity the ruffian was about to utter i know not for while his odious voice was yet hissing in my ear these atrocious epithets before the footman who was standing as i have said a few yards off at the other side of the carriage had time to interfere i heard the sound of a horse at full gallop and the next instant he was dragged forcibly away and i saw him quivering in the furious grasp of the count de chavannes who had it seems been returning to join us when the assault was committed to gallop to my side to spring to the ground to collar the ruffian drag him from the carriage and lash him with his whole strength with a rough jockey whip till he fairly screamed for mercy were but the work of a moment and i could not but marvel afterwards to think how much power and nervous energy his indignant spirit had lent to his slight frame and slender limbs for in size he was by no means superior to g whom he nevertheless handled almost as if he had been a child of five years old want of breath at last rather than want of will compelled him to pause in his exercise and then turning towards us with an air as composed and smiling as if he had been merely dancing a quadrille he took off his hat saying i must implore your pardon ladies yours more especially mademoiselle valerie for enacting such a scene in your presence mais cetait plus fort que moi he added laughing i could not contain myself at seeing a lady so infamously insulted caroline and the misses selwyn were so much frightened by the whole fracas that they were really unable to answer and i was for the moment so much taken by surprise that i could not find words to reply at this moment covered with dust and blood for the whip had cut his face in several places without his hat and with all his gay attire besmeared and rent gagain came up towards the carriage he was very pale nay white even to the lipsbut it was evidently not with terror but with rage as his first words testified monsieur le comte de chavannes he said slowly car je vous connais et vous me connaitrez aussi je vous le jure vous mavez frappe vous me rendrez satisfaction nestce pas oh no no i exclaimed before he could answer clasping my hands eagerly together oh no no not on my account i implore you monsieur le comteno life on my accountabove all not yours he thanked me by one expressive glance which spoke volumes to my heart and perhaps read volumes in return in my pale face and trembling lips then turned with a calm smile to his late antagonist and answered him in english i do not know in the least sir who you are and i do not suppose that i ever shall know i chastised you five minutes since for insulting this lady most grossly lady interrupted the ruffian with a sneer lady lady of plea but the count went on without pausing or seeming to hear himwhich i should have done at all events whether i had known you or not and which i shall most assuredly do again should you think fit to proceed further with your infamies as for satisfaction if i should be called upon in a proper way i shall not refuse it to any person worthy to meet me which this person is not sir interposed yet a third voice and looking up i recognised the officer who had bowed to me which this person is not i assure you and my word is wont to be sufficient in such caseslieutenantcolonel jervishe added with a half bow to melate of his majestyslight dragoons this person is the notorious monsieur g who was detected cheating at ecarte at the travellers was a defaulter on the st leger in the st patricks year has been warned off every racecourse in england by the jockey club besides being horsewhipped by half the legs in england he can get no gentleman to bring you a message sir and if he could you must not meet him gnashing his teeth with impotent rage the detected impostor slunk away while the count bowing to colonel jervis replied quietly i thank you very much colonel i am monsieur de chavannes and i have no doubt what you say is perfectly correct no one but a low ruffian could have behaved as this fellow did it was i assure you no small offence which caused me to strike a blow in the presence of ladies i saw it monsieur le comte answered jervis i saw it from a distance and was coming up as fast as i could make my horse gallop when you anticipated me then seeing that i was not wanted i stood looking on with intense satisfaction for upon my word i never saw a thing better done in my life no offence count but by the way you use your hands i think you ought to have been an englishman rather than a frenchman which i suppose from your namefor you have no french accentyou are i was at school in england colonel answered the count laughing and so learned the use of my hands that accounts for itthat accounts for itfor on my life i never saw a fellow more handsomely horsewhippedand i have seen a good many too did you mademoiselle valerie de chatenoeuf for i believe it is you whom i have the honour of addressing i have been less fortunate than you colonel jervis for i never saw any one horsewhipped before and sincerely hope i shall never see another dont say that my dear lady dont say that i am sure it is a very pretty sight when it is well and soundly done besides it seems ungrateful to the count i would not be ungrateful for the world i replied and i am sure the count needs no assurance of that fact i am for ever obliged by his prompt defence of mebut it is nothing more than i should have expected from him what that he would fight for you valerie whispered caroline maliciously in a tone which perhaps she did not intend to be overheard but if such was her meaning she missed it for all present heard her distinctly i replied however very coolly yes caroline that he would fight for me or you or any lady who was aggrieved or insulted in his presence mille graces for your good opinions said de chavannes with a bow and a glance that was far more eloquent than words a truce to compliments if you will not think me impertinent count said the colonel but i wish to ask this fair lady if she will pardon me one question had you ever a friend called adele chabot i interrupted him and i shall be most enchanted to hear of her or better still to see her as mrs jervis you have anticipated me that is what i was about to say we arrived in town last night and she commissioned me at once to make out your whereabouts for her the gironacs told me that you were staying at kew yes at judge selwyns by the way i added a little mischievously i confess allow me to make known to one another mrs charles selwyn once caroline stanhope and colonel jervis jervis bowed low but his cheek and brow burned a little and he looked sharply at me out of the corner of his eye but i preserved such a demure face that he did not quite know whether i was au fait or not caroline to do her justice behaved exceedingly well her character indeed which had been quite unformed before her marriage had gained solidity and her mind judgment as well as tone since her introduction to a family so superior as that of the selwyns and she now neither blushed nor tittered nor indeed showed any signs of consciousness although she gave me a sly pinch while she was inquiring in her sweetest voice and serenest manner after adele whom she said she had always loved very much and longed to see her sincerely in her new station which she was so admirably qualified to fill i hear she was vastly admired in paris colonel and no wonder for i really think she was the very prettiest creature i ever saw in my life you are a fortunate man colonel jervis i am indeed said he laughing adele is a very good little creature and the people were so goodnatured as to be very civil to her in paris especially your friend madame dalbret mademoiselle de chatenoeuf nothing could exceed her attentions to us we are very much indebted to you for her acquaintance by the way adele has no end of letters and presents of all sorts for you from her when can you come and see adele where are you staying colonel jervis at thomass hotel in berkeley square at present until we can find a furnished house for the season in august we are going down to a little cottage of mine in the highlands and i believe adele has some plan for inducing you to come down and bear her company while i am slaughtering grouse and black cock thanks colonel both to you and adele but i do not know how that will be august is two whole months distant yet and one never knows what may happen in the course of two months do you know i was half thinking of paying a visit to france myself when my brother who is on a visit to me now returns to join his regiment were you indeed asked de chavannes more earnestly than the subject seemed to warrant i had not heard of that scheme before is it likely to be carried into effect mademoiselle i hardly know as yet it is little more than a distant dream but you have not yet answered my question mademoiselle de chatenoeuf said the colonel you have not yet told me when you will come and see adele oh pardon me colonel i return to town tomorrow and i will not lose a moment suppose i say at one oclock tomorrow or two will be better caroline the judge was so good as to say that he would let his carriage take me home i dare say it can drop me at thomass can it not certainly not valerie there dont stare now or look indignant or surprised it served you perfectly right what did you expect me to say or why do you ask such silly questions of course it can take you wherever you please precisely as if it were your own then at two oclock i will be at thomass tomorrow colonel in the meantime pray give adele my best love i will indeed and now i will intrude upon you no longer ladies he added raising his hat in fact i owe you many apologies for the liberty i have taken in introducing myself i hope you will believe i would not have done so under any other circumstances we bowed and without any further remarks he put spurs to his horse and cantered away a very gentlemanly person said caroline i think adele has done very well for herself you had better not let mr charles selwyn hear you say so under all circumstances or i think that very likely the whipping we were talking about in fun yesterday will become real cara mia nonsense for shame you mischievous thing said caroline blushing a little but not painfully who is this colonel jervis asked the count de chavannes i was a little puzzled or rather not a little for at first none of you seemed to know him and after a little while you all appeared to know him quite well pray explain the mystery he is a very gentlemanly person count as mrs selwyn justly observes and as you can perceive a very handsome man further than that he was colonel of one of his majestys crack regiments as they call them and is now on halfpay he is moreover a man of high fashion and of the first standing in society and last of all which is the secret of the whole he is the husband of a very charming little frenchwoman a particular friend of carolines and mine one of the prettiest and nicest persons on earth with whom he ran away some six months since fancying her to be valerie exclaimed caroline blushing fiery red caroline replied i quietly what were you going to say fancying her to be a very great heiress i continued but finding her to be a far better thing a delightful beautiful and excellent wife happy man said de chavannes with a half sigh why do you say so count to have married one for whom you vouch so strongly is that any common fortune it is rather common count just of late i mean said caroline laughing you do not know that among valeries other accomplishments she is the greatest little matchmaker in existence she marries off all her friends as fastoh you cannot think how fast i hope i mean to say i think he corrected himself not without some little confusion that she is not quite so bad as you make her out she has not yet made any match for herself i believe no no i dont believe she is quite so bad i would not be too sure count were i you she answered desirous of paying me off a little for some of the badinage with which i had treated her these ladies with so many strings to their bow it was now my time to exclaim caroline and i did so not without giving some little emphasis of severity to my tone for i really thought she was going beyond the limits of propriety if not of persiflage and i will do her the justice to say that she felt it herself for she blushed very much as i spoke and was at once silent the awkwardness of this pause was fortunately broken by the return of auguste and lionel at a sharp canter for the review was now entirely at an end and they had now for the first moment remembered that having promised to return in a quarter of an hour they had suffered two hours or more to elapse and that we were probably all alone caroline immediately began to rally lionel and auguste the former with whom she was very intimate pretty severely for their want of gallantry in leaving us all alone and unprotected in such a crowd not the least dangernot the least replied lionel hastily had we not known that we should have returned long ago in proof of which no danger we have been all frightened nearly to death mademoiselle valerie de chatenoeuf has been grievously affronted and i am not sure but she would have been beaten by a french chevalier dindustrie had it not been for the gallantry of the count de chavannes and thereupon out came the whole history of monsieur g his horsewhipping the opportune appearance of colonel jervis and all the curious circumstances of the scene i never in my life saw anyone so fearfully excited as auguste he turned white as ashes even to his very lips while his eyes literally flashed fire and his frame shivered as if he had been in an ague fit il me le paiera he muttered between his hardset teeth il me le paiera le scelerat ma pauvre soeurma pauvre petite valerie and then he shook the hand of chavannes with the heartiest and warmest emotion i shall never forget this he said in a thick low voice never never from this time forth de chavannes we are friends for ever but i shall never never be able to repay you nonsense mon cher nonsense replied chavannes i did nothing positively nothing at all i should not have been a man had i done otherwise this had however no effect at all in stopping augustes exclamations and professions of eternal gratitude nor did he cease until monsieur de chavannes said quietly well well if you will have it so say no more about it and one day or other i will ask a favour of you which if granted will leave me your debtor if grantedit is granted exclaimed auguste impetuously what is itname iti say it is granted dont be rash mon cher replied the count laughing it is no slight boon which i shall ask do not be foolish auguste i interposed you are letting your feelings get the better of you strangely and caroline if you do not tell the people to drive home you will keep the judge waiting dinnera proceeding to which you know he is by no means partial you are right as usual valerie always thoughtful for other people so we will go home but just as we were on the point of starting the groom with the cockade whom we had seen following colonel jervis trotted up and touching his hat asked i beg your pardon gentlemen but is any one of you the count de chavannes i am replied the count what do you want with me sir from colonel jervis sir replied the man handing him a visiting card the colonels compliments count and he begs you will do him the favour in case you hear anything more from that fellow as you horsewhipped count to let him know at thomass at once for you must not treat him as a gentleman no how the colonel says and if so be he gives you any trouble the colonel can get his flint fixedthe colonel can thank you my man replied the count give my compliments to your master and i am much obliged for his interest i shall do myself the honour of waiting on the colonel tomorrow be so good as to tell him so i will sir said the man and rode away without another word you see monsieur de chatenoeuf you must not dream of noticing the fellow as a gentleman said the count impossible lionel chimed in almost in the same breath and all the ladies followed suit with their absolute impossible a rapid drive brought us to the judges house at kew where we found dinner nearly ready though not waiting and the events of the day were the topic and the count the hero of the evening the next morning we returned to townauguste and myself i mean monsieur de chavannes having driven up from kew in his own cabriolet after dinner i called according to my promise and found adele alone and delighted to see me and in the highest possible spirits she was the happiest of women she said and colonel jervis was everything that she could wish the kindest most affectionate of husbands and all that she now desired as she declared was to see me established suitably you had better let matters take their course adele i answered though not much of a fatalist i believe that when a persons time is to come it comes it avails nothing to hurrynothing to endeavour to retard it i shall fare i doubt not as my friends before me dear adele and if i can consult as well for myself as i seem to have done for my friends i shall do very well caroline by the way is quite as happy as you declare yourself to be and i doubt not are for i like your colonel amazingly i am delighted to hear it he also is charmed with you but who is the count de chavannes of whom he is so full just now he says he is the only frenchman he ever saw worthy to be an englishmanwhich though we may not exactly regard it as a compliment he considers the greatest thing he can say in any ones favour who is this count de chavannes valerie i told her in reply all that i knew and that you know gentle reader about the count de chavannes et puiset puis asked adele laughing et puis nothing at all i answered no secrets among friends valerie said adele looking me earnestly in the face i had none with you and you helped me with your advice be as frank at least with me if you love me i do love you dearly adele and i have no secrets there is nothing concerning which to have a secret nothingnot this gay and gallant count not even he and you are not about to become madame la comtesse i am not indeed indeedin very deed in veryvery deed well i do not understand it by what jervis told me i presumed it was a settled thing the colonel was mistaken there is nothing settled or unsettled and do you really not like him i really do like him adele as a very pleasant companion for an hour or two and as a very perfect gentleman yes he told me all that but if you like him so well why not like him better why not love him i will be plain and true with you adele i do not choose to consider at all whether i could or could not love him he has never asked me has never spoken of love to me and putting it out of the question that it is unmaidenly to love unasked i am sure it is unwise i understand i understand but he will ask you that is certain and when he does ask what shall you say it will be time enough to consider when that time shall come another way of saying i shall say yes but come valerie you must promise me that if you need my assistance you will call upon me for it you know that anything i can do for you will be done without a thought but how i best may serve you and jervis will do likewise since he as i do considers that under heaven we owe our happiness to you i promise it enough i will ask no more now come up to my room and i will give you madame dalbrets letters and some pretty presents she has sent you do you know valerie nothing could exceed her kindness to us i believe she repents bitterly her unkindness to you i cannot repeat the terms of praise and admiration which she applied to you and do you know adele that it was her infamous and miserable husband monsieur g whom the count horsewhipped this very day for insulting me indeed was it indeed that mans enmity to you will never cease so long as he has life no jervis did not tell me who it was thinking i fancy that neither you nor i would have so much as known his name but never care about the wretch here is madames letter it was as kind a letter as could be written full of thanks for the favour i had shown her in introducing my friends to her and of hopes that we should one day meet again when all the past should be forgotten and i should resume my own place and station in the society of my own land she begged my acceptance of the pretty dresses she sent which she said she had selected not for their value but because they were pretty and in her postscript she added what of course outweighed all the rest of her letter both in interest and importance that she had recently been informed through a strange channel and as it were by accident that my mothers health was failing seriously and that although not attacked by any regular disorder nor in any immediate danger it was not thought probable that she could live much longer in that case valerie she continued for although no one could be so unnatural as to wish for a mothers death how cruel and unmotherly she might be soever it cannot be expected that you should regard her decease with more than decent observation and a proper seriousness and i shall look to see you dwelling again among us and spending the little fortune which i understand you have so bravely earned in the midst of your friends and in your own country that i shall never do i said speaking aloud though in answer partly to her letter partly to my own words that i shall never do visit france i may once and again but in england i shall dwell france banished and repudiated me like a stepmotherengland received me kinder than my own like a mother in england i shall dwell wait till you see the lord of your destinies and learn where he shall dwell you will have to say like the rest of us your country shall be my country and your god my godobserved adele interrupting my musings the first perhapsthe last never never catholic i was born catholic i will die i do not say that i will never marry any but a catholic but i do say that i will never marry but one who will approve my adoring my own god according to my own conscience is the count de chavannes a catholic indeed i know not but he is a breton and the bretons are a loyal race both to their king and their god i now turned to finish my reading which had been for the moment interrupted indeed my dear valerie she concluded her letter i have long felt that although we were certainly justified by the circumstances of your situation in taking the steps we did at that time we have been hardly pardonable in persisting so long in the maintenance of a falsehood which has certainly been the cause of great pain and suffering to both your parents the innocent no less than the guilty i know that your mother can never forgive me for aiding you in your escape from her authority but for my part i am willing to bear her enmity rather than persist in further concealment so that you need not in any degree consider me in any steps which you may think it wise or right to take towards revelation and reconciliation indeed i think valerie that if it can be done with due regard to your own safety and happiness you ought to discover yourself to both your parents and if possible even to visit the most unhappy because the guiltier of the two before her dissolution which i really believe to be now very near at hand everyone knows so well what you have undergone that no blame will attach to you in the least degree allow me to add that should you return to france as i hope you will do i shall never forgive you if you do not make my house your home this postscript as will readily be believed gave me more cause for thought than all the letter beside and rendered me exceedingly uneasy if i had felt illsatisfied before with my condition and my concealment much more was i now discontented with myself and unhappy i was almost resolved to return at all hazards with auguste and indeed when i consulted with adele she leaned very much towards the same opinion i would not however do anything rashly but determined to consult not only with my brother but with the judge in whose wisdom i had no less confidence than i had in his friendship and integrity things however were destined to occur which in some degree altered and hastened all my proceedings for that very evening when the gironacs had retired on my beginning to consult auguste listen to me a moment before you tell me about your letters from france or anything about returning and i entreat you answer me truly and let no false modesty or little missish delicacy prevent your doing so many a life has been rendered miserable by such foolishness i have heard say and being as it were almost alone in the world as if an only brother with an only sister to whom if not to one another should we speak freely you need not have made so long a preamble dear auguste i replied with a smile of course i will answer you and when i say that of course i will answer truly well then valerie do you like this count de chavannes it is an odd question butyes i do like him do you love him valerie oh augustethat is not fair besides he has never spoken to me of love he has neveri do not know whether he loves mei have no reason to believe that he does no reasonhe exclaimed half surprised half indignantno reason i should thinkbut never mindanswer me this if he did love you do you love him or like him enough to take him for your husband he has spoken to you augustehe has spoken to you i exclaimed blushing very deeply but unable to conceal my gratification i am answered valerie by the sparkle of those bright eyes yes he has spoken to me dearest sister and asked my influence with you and my permission to address you and you replied and i replied that my permission was a matter of no consequence for that you were entirely your own mistress and that my influence would be exerted only to induce you to follow your own judgment and inclinations and to consult for your own happiness answered like a good and wise brother and then he asked whether i could form any opinion of the state of your feelings to which i replied that i could only say that i had reason to suppose that your hand and heart were neither of them engaged and that the field was open to him if he chose to make a trial but that i had no opportunity of judging how you felt toward him i also said that i thought you knew very little of each other and that his attachment must have grown up too rapidly to have taken a very strong root but there i found i was mistaken for he assured me that it was from esteem of your character and admiration of your energy courage and constancy under adversity not from the mere prettiness of your face or niceness of your manners that he first began to love you and i since ascertained that there is scarce an incident of your life with which he has not made himself acquainted and that in the most delicate and guarded manner i confess valerie that it has raised him greatly in my estimation to find that he looks upon marriage as a thing so serious and solemn and does not rush into it from mere fancy for a pretty face and ladylike accomplishments i think so too auguste i replied but i wish we knew a little more about him his character and principles i mean auguste looked at me for a moment in great surprise what an exceedingly matteroffact girl you are valerie i never knew any one in the least like you do you know i am afraid you are a little and he paused a moment as if he hardly knew how to proceed a little hard and cold is it not dear auguste said i throwing my arms about him no no indeed i am not but i have been cast so long on my own sole resources and obliged to rely only on my own energy and clearsightedness that i always try to look at both sides of the question and not to let my feelings overpower me until i have proved that it is good and wise to do so consider too auguste that on this step depends the whole happiness or misery of a girls existence you are right valerie and i am wrong but tell me do you love him i do auguste i like him better than any man i have ever seen he is the only man of whom i could think as a husbandand i have for some time past been fearful of liking himloving him too much not knowing though i did believe and hope that he reciprocated my feelings and now if i knew but a little more of his principles and character i would not hesitate then you need not hesitate dearest valerie for as if to obviate this objection he showed me in the most delicate manner private letters from his oldest and most intimate friends and especially from mr a most respectable clergyman who lives at hendon by whom he was educated and with whom he has maintained constant intercourse and correspondence ever since this alone speaks very highly in his favour and the terms in which he writes to his pupil are such as prove them both to be men of the highest character for worth integrity and virtue he has proposed moreover that i should ride down with him tomorrow to hendon to visit mr and to hear from his own lips yet more of his character and conduct that is to say if i can give him any hopes of ultimate success well auguste i replied i think with you that all this speaks very highly in favour of your friend and i think that the best thing you can do is to take this ride which he proposes and see his tutor in the meantime i will drive down to kew and speak with our good friend judge selwyn on the subject tomorrow evening i will see the count and hear whatever he desires to say to me this was a very matteroffact way of dealing with the affair certainly but what auguste had said was in some sort true i was in truth rather a matteroffact girl and i never found that i suffered by it in the least for i certainly was not either worldly or selfish and the feelings do as certainly require to be guided and controlled by sober reason after coming to this conclusion i showed madame dalbrets letter to auguste and we came to the decision also that under the circumstances auguste should immediately on his return communicate the fact of my being alive and in good circumstances to my father leaving it at his discretion to inform my mother of the facts or not as he might judge expedient at a very early hour next morning i took a glasscoach and drove down to kew where i arrived greatly to the astonishment of the whole family just as they were sitting down to breakfast and when i stated that i had come to speak on very urgent business with the judge he desired my carriage to return to town and proposed to carry me back himself so that we might kill two birds as he expressed it with one stone holding a consultation in his carriage while on his way to court as soon as we got into the coach while i was hesitating how to open the subject which was certainly a little awkward for a young girl the judge took up the discourse well valerie he said i suppose you want to know the result of the inquiries which you were so unwilling that i should make about the count de chavannes is not that true it is perfectly true judgethough i do not know how you ever have divined it it is lucky at least that i consulted my own judgment rather than your fancy for otherwise i should have had no information to give you but as it is judge why as it is mademoiselle valerie you may marry him as soon as ever he asks you and think yourself a very lucky young lady into the bargain he has a character such as not one man in fifty can produce he is rich liberal without being extravagant never plays is by no means dissipated and in all respects is a man of honour ability and character such is what i have learned from a quarter where there can be no mistake i was a good deal affected for a moment or two and was very near bursting into tears the good judge took my hand in his and spoke soothingly and almost caressingly bidding me confide in him altogether and he would advise me as if he were my own father i did so accordingly and while he approved highly of all that i had done and of the delicate and gentlemanly manner in which the count had acted he fully advised me to deal frankly and directly with him you like him i am sure valerie indeed i believe i knew that before you did yourself and i have no doubt he will make you an admirable husband tell him all show him this letter of your friend madame dalbrets about your mother and if he desires it as i dare say he will marry him at once and set out together with auguste for france when his leave of absence is expired and go directly to paris with your husband as a married woman your parents will have no authority of any kind over you and i think it is your duty to do so i agreed with him at once and when in the evening auguste returned with the count from a visit to his former tutor which had been in all respects satisfactory and left me alone with monsieur de chavannes everything was determined without difficulty lovescenes and courtships though vastly interesting to the actors are always the dullest things in the world to bystanders i shall therefore proceed at once to the end merely stating that the count was all and did all that the most exigeante of women could have requiredthat from the first to the last he was full of delicacy of tenderness and honour and that after twelve years of a happy life with him i have never had cause to repent for a moment that i consented to give him the hand which he so ardently desired the joy of madame gironac can be imagined better than described as well as the manner in which she bustled about my trousseau and my outfit for france as it was determined that the judges plan should be adopted to the letter and that we should start directly from st georges to dover and calais never perhaps was a marriage more rapidly organised and completed the lawbusiness was expedited with all speed by charles selwyn madame bathurst the jervises the gironacs and the selwyns were alone present at the wedding and though we were all dear friends there was no affectation of tears or lamentable partings for we knew that in heavens pleasure we should all meet again within a few months as after our wedding tour was ended monsieur de chavannes proposed to take up his abode in england the land of his choice as of his education there was no bishop to perform the ceremony nor any duke to give away the bride no long array of liveried servants with favours in their buttons and in their hatsno pompous paragraph in the morning papers to describe the beauties of the highbred bride and the dresses of her aristocratic bridesmaidsbut two hearts were united as well as two hands and heaven smiled upon the union a quick and pleasant passage carried us to paris where i was received with raptures by my good old friend madame paon and with sincere satisfaction by madame dalbret who was proud to recognise her old protegee in the new character of the comtesse de chavannes a character which she imagined reflected no small credit on her tuition and patronage the threatened emeute having passed over auguste easily obtained a renewal of his leave of absence in order to visit his family at pau and as he preceded us by three days and travelled with the utmost diligence he outstripped us by nearly a week and we found both my parents prepared to receive us and both really happy at the prosperous tidings my poor mother was indeed dying had we come two days later we should have been too late for she died in my arms on the day following our arrival enraptured to find herself relieved from the heinous crime of which she had so long believed herself guilty and blessing me with her dying lips my father who had always loved me and who had erred through weakness of head only seemed never to weary of sitting beside me of holding my hand in his and of gazing in my face with monsieur de chavannes consent the whole of my little earnings amounting now to nearly pounds was settled on him for his life and then on my sisters and the income arising from it though a mere trifle in england in that cheap region sufficed with what he possessed of his own to render his old age affluent and happy thus all my trials ended and if the beginning of my career was painful and disastrous the cares and sorrows of valerie de chatenoeuf had been more than compensated by the happiness of valerie de chavannes i may as well mention here that a few years afterwards lionel dempster married my second sister elisee a very nice and very handsome girl and has settled very close to the villa which the count purchased on his return from france near windsor on the lovely thames ministering not a little by their company to the bliss of our happy peaceful life my eldest brother auguste is now a lieutenantcolonel of the line having greatly distinguished himself in algeria nicholas who never returned to france has acquired both renown and riches by his musical abilities and all the younger branches of the family are happily provided for i have three sweet children one boy and two little girls and the difficulties and sorrows i experienced owing to an evil and injudicious course of education have been so far of use that they have taught me how to bring up my own children even more to love and honour than to obey perfect happiness is not allotted to any here below but few and short have been the latter sorrows and infinite the blessings vouchsafed by a kind providence to the once poor and houseless but now rich and honoured and better than all loved valerie the end
