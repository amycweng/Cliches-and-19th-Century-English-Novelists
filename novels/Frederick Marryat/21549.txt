jacob faithful by captain marryat captain frederick marryat was born july and died august he retired from the british navy in in order to devote himself to writing in the following years he wrote books many of which are among the very best of english literature and some of which are still in print marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories he says somewhere that when he sat down for the days work he never knew what he was going to write he certainly was a literary genius jacob faithful was published in the fifth book to flow from marryats pen the story tells the life and adventures of a boy who was born and brought up on a lighter small riverbarge on the river thames as it flows through london it gives an extremely interesting contemporary picture of life in london and on the river in the early part of the nineteenth century this etext was transcribed in by nick hodson and was reformatted in and again in jacob faithful by captain frederick marryat chapter one my birth parentage and family pretensionsunfortunately i prove to be a detrimental or younger son which is remedied by a trifling accident i hardly receive the first elements of science from my father when the elements conspire against me and i am left an orphan gentle reader i was born upon the waternot upon the salt and angry ocean but upon the fresh and rapidflowing river it was in a floating sort of box called a lighter and upon the river thames at low water when i first smelt the mud this lighter was manned an expression amounting to bullism if not construed kindly by my father my mother and your humble servant my father had the sole chargehe was monarch of the deck my mother of course was queen and i was the heirapparent before i say one word about myself allow me dutifully to describe my parents first then i will portray my queen mother report says that when she first came on board of the lighter a lighter figure and a lighter step never pressed a plank but as far as i can tax my recollection she was always a fat unwieldy woman locomotion was not to her tastegin was she seldom quitted the cabinnever quitted the lighter a pair of shoes may have lasted her for five years for the wear and tear she took out of them being of this domestic habit as all married women ought to be she was always to be found when wanted but although always at hand she was not always on her feet towards the close of the day she lay down upon her beda wise precaution when a person can no longer stand the fact was that my honoured mother although her virtue was unimpeachable was frequently seduced by liquor and although constant to my father was debauched and to be found in bed with that insidious assailer of female uprightnessgin the lighter which might have been compared to another garden of eden of which my mother was the eve and my father the adam to consort with was entered by this serpent who tempted her and if she did not eat she drank which was even worse at first indeedand i may mention it to prove how the enemy always gains admittance under a specious formshe drank it only to keep the cold out of her stomach which the humid atmosphere from the surrounding water appeared to warrant my father took his pipe for the same reason but at the time that i was born he smoked and she drank from morning to night because habit had rendered it almost necessary to their existence the pipe was always to his lip the glass incessantly to hers i would have defied any cold ever to have penetrated into their stomachsbut i have said enough of my mother for the present i will now pass on to my father my father was a puffy roundbellied longarmed little man admirably calculated for his station in or rather out of society he could manage a lighter as well as anybody but he could do no more he had been brought up to it from his infancy he went on shore for my mother and came on board againthe only remarkable event in his life his whole amusement was his pipe and as there is a certain indefinable link between smoking and philosophy my father by dint of smoking had become a perfect philosopher it is no less strange than true that we can puff away our cares with tobacco when without it they remain a burden to existence there is no composing draught like the draught through the tube of a pipe the savage warriors of north america enjoyed the blessing before we did and to the pipe is to be ascribed the wisdom of their councils and the laconic delivery of their sentiments it would be well introduced into our own legislative assembly ladies indeed would no longer peep down through the ventilator but we should have more sense and fewer words it is also to tobacco that is to be ascribed the stoical firmness of those american warriors who satisfied with the pipes in their mouths submitted with perfect indifference to the torture of their enemies from the wellknown virtues of this weed arose that peculiar expression when you irritate another that you put his pipe out my fathers pipe literally and metaphorically was never put out he had a few apophthegms which brought every disaster to a happy conclusion and as he seldom or never indulged in words these sayings were deeply impressed upon my infant memory one was its no use crying whats done cant be helped when once these words escaped his lips the subject was never renewed nothing appeared to move him the abjurations of those employed in the other lighters barges vessels and boats of every description who were contending with us for the extra foot of water as we drifted up or down with the tide affected him not further than an extra column or two of smoke rising from the bowl of his pipe to my mother he used but one expression take it coolly but it always had the contrary effect with my mother as it put her more in a passion it was like pouring oil upon flame nevertheless the advice was good had it ever been followed another favourite expression of my fathers when anything went wrong and which was of the same pattern as the rest of his philosophy was better luck next time these aphorisms were deeply impressed upon my memory i continually recalled them to mind and thus i became a philosopher long before my wise teeth were in embryo or i had even shed the first set with which kind nature presents us that in the petticoat age we may fearlessly indulge in lollipop my fathers education had been neglected he could neither write nor read but although he did not exactly like cadmus invent letters he had accustomed himself to certain hieroglyphics generally speaking sufficient for his purposes and which might be considered as an artificial memory i cant write nor read jacob he would say i wish i could but look boy i means this mark for three quarters of a bushel mind you recollects it when i axes you or ill be blowed if i dont wallop you but it was only a case of peculiar difficulty which would require a new hieroglyphic or extract such a long speech from my father i was well acquainted with his usual scratches and dots and having a good memory could put him right when he was puzzled with some misshapen x or z representing some unknown quantity like the same letters in algebra i have said that i was heirapparent but i did not say that i was the only child born to my father in his wedlock my honoured mother had had two more children but the first who was a girl had been provided for by a fit of the measles and the second my elder brother by stumbling over the stern of the lighter when he was three years old at the time of the accident my mother had retired to her bed a little the worse for liquor my father was on deck forward leaning against the windlass soberly smoking his evening pipe what was that exclaimed my father taking his pipe out of his mouth and listening i shouldnt wonder if that wasnt joe and my father put in his pipe again and smoked away as before my father was correct in his surmises it was joe who had made the splash which roused him from his meditations for the next morning joe was nowhere to be found he was however found some days afterwards but as the newspapers say and as may well be imagined the vital spark was extinct and moreover the eels and chubs had eaten off his nose and a portion of his chubby face so that as my father said he was of no use to nobody the morning after the accident my father was up early and had missed poor little joe he went into the cabin smoked his pipe and said nothing as my brother did not appear as usual for his breakfast my mother called out for him in a harsh voice but joe was out of hearing and as mute as a fish joe opened not his mouth in reply neither did my father my mother then quitted the cabin and walked round the lighter looked into the dogkennel to ascertain if he was asleep with the great mastiffbut joe was nowhere to be found why what can have become of joe cried my mother with maternal alarm in her countenance appealing to my father as she hastened back to the cabin my father spoke not but taking the pipe out of his mouth dropped the bowl of it in a perpendicular direction till it landed softly on the deck then put it into his mouth again and puffed mournfully why you dont mean to say he is overboard screamed my mother my father nodded his head and puffed away at an accumulated rate a torrent of tears exclamations and revilings succeeded to this characteristic announcement my father allowed my mother to exhaust herself by the time when she had finished so was his pipe he then knocked out the ashes and quietly observed its no use crying whats done cant be helped and proceeded to refill the bowl cant be helped cried my mother but it might have been helped take it coolly replied my father take it coolly replied my mother in a ragetake it coolly yes youre for taking everything coolly i presume if i fell overboard you would be taking it coolly you would be taking it coolly at all events replied my imperturbable father o dear o dear cried my poor mother two poor children and lost them both better luck next time rejoined my father so sall say no more about it my father continued for some time to smoke his pipe and my mother to pipe her eye until at last my father who was really a kindhearted man rose from the chest upon which he was seated went to the cupboard poured out a teacupful of gin and handed it to my mother it was kindly done of him and my mother was to be won by kindness it was a pure offering in the spirit and taken in the spirit in which it was offered after a few repetitions which were rendered necessary from its potency being diluted with her tears grief and recollection were drowned together and disappeared like two lovers who sink down entwined in each others arms with this beautiful metaphor i shall wind up the episode of my unfortunate brother joe it was about a year after the loss of my brother that i was ushered into the world without any other assistants or spectators than my father and dame nature who i believe to be a very clever midwife if not interfered with my father who had some faint ideas of christianity performed the baptismal rites by crossing me on the forehead with the end of his pipe and calling me jacob as for my mother being churched she had never been but once to church in her life in fact my father and mother never quitted the lighter unless when the former was called out by the superintendent or proprietor at the delivery or shipment of a cargo or was once a month for a few minutes on shore to purchase necessaries i cannot recall much of my infancy but i recollect that the lighter was often very brilliant with blue and red paint and that my mother used to point it out to me as so pretty to keep me quiet i shall therefore pass it over and commence at the age of five years at which early period i was of some little use to my father indeed i was almost as forward as some boys at ten this may appear strange but the fact is that my ideas although bounded were concentrated the lighter its equipments and its destination were the microcosm of my infant imagination and my ideas and thoughts being directed to so few objects these objects were deeply impressed and their value fully understood up to the time that i quitted the lighter at eleven years old the banks of the river were the boundaries of my speculations i certainly comprehended something of the nature of trees and houses but i do not think that i was aware that the former grew from the time that i could recollect them on the banks of the river they appeared to be exactly of the same size as they were when first i saw them and i asked no questions but by the time that i was ten years old i knew the name of the reach of the river and every pointthe depth of water and the shallows the drift of the current and the ebb and flow of the tide itself i was able to manage the lighter as it floated down with the tide for what i lacked in strength i made up with dexterity arising from constant practice it was at the age of eleven years that a catastrophe took place which changed my prospects in life and i must therefore say a little more about my father and mother bringing up their history to that period the propensity of my mother to ardent spirits had as always is the case greatly increased upon her and her corpulence had increased in the same ratio she was now a most unwieldy bloated mountain of flesh such a form as i have never since beheld although at the time she did not appear to me to be disgusting accustomed to witness imperceptibly her increase and not seeing any other females except at a distance for the last two years she had seldom quitted her bedcertainly she did not crawl out of the cabin more than five minutes during the week indeed her obesity and habitual intoxication rendered her incapable my father went on shore for a quarter of an hour once a month to purchase gin tobacco red herrings and decayed shipbiscuitsthe latter was my principal fare except when i could catch a fish over the sides as we lay at anchor i was therefore a great waterdrinker not altogether from choice but from the salt nature of my food and because my mother had still sense enough left to discern that gin wasnt good for little boys but a great change had taken place in my father i was now left almost altogether in charge of the deck my father seldom coming up except to assist me in shooting the bridges or when it required more than my exertions to steer clear of the crowds of vessels which we encountered when between them in fact as i grew more capable my father became more incapable and passed most of his time in the cabin assisting my mother in emptying the great stone bottle the woman had prevailed upon the man and now both were guilty in partaking of the forbidden fruit of the juniper tree such was the state of affairs in our little kingdom when the catastrophe occurred which i am now about to relate one fine summers evening we were floating up with the tide deeply laden with coals to be delivered at the proprietors wharf some distance above putney bridge a strong breeze sprang up and checked our progress and we could not as we expected gain the wharf that night we were about a mile and a half above the bridge when the tide turned against us and we dropped our anchor my father who expecting to arrive that evening had very unwillingly remained sober waiting until the lighter had swung to the stream and then saying to me remember jacob we must be at the wharf early tomorrow morning so keep alive went into the cabin to indulge in his potations leaving me in possession of the deck and also of my supper which i never ate below the little cabin being so unpleasantly close indeed i took all my meals al fresco and unless the nights were intensely cold slept on deck in the capacious dogkennel abaft which had once been tenanted by the large mastiff but he had been dead some years was thrown overboard and in all probability had been converted into savoury sausages at shilling per pound weight some time after his decease i had taken possession of his apartment and had performed his duty i had finished my supper which was washed down with a considerable portion of thames water for i always drank more when above the bridges having an idea that it tasted more pure and fresh i had walked forward and looked at the cable to see if all was right and then having nothing more to do i lay down on the deck and indulged in the profound speculations of a boy of eleven years old i was watching the stars above me which twinkled faintly and appeared to me ever and anon to be extinguished and then relighted i was wondering what they could be made of and how they came there when of a sudden i was interrupted in my reveries by a loud shriek and perceived a strong smell of something burning the shrieks were renewed again and again and i had hardly time to get upon my legs when my father burst up from the cabin rushed over the side of the lighter and disappeared under the water i caught a glimpse of his features as he passed me and observed fright and intoxication blended together i ran to the side where he had disappeared but could see nothing but a few eddying circles as the tide rushed quickly past for a few seconds i remained staggered and stupefied at his sudden disappearance and evident death but i was recalled to recollection by the smoke which encompassed me and the shrieks of my mother which were now fainter and fainter and i hastened to her assistance a strong empyreumatic thick smoke ascended from the hatchway of the cabin and as it had now fallen calm it mounted straight up the air in a dense column i attempted to go in but so soon as i encountered the smoke i found that it was impossible it would have suffocated me in half a minute i did what most children would have done in such a situation of excitement and distressi sat down and cried bitterly in about ten minutes i moved my hands with which i had covered up my face and looked at the cabin hatch the smoke had disappeared and all was silent i went to the hatchway and although the smell was still overpowering i found that i could bear it i descended the little ladder of three steps and called mother but there was no answer the lamp fixed against the after bulkhead with a glass before it was still alight and i could see plainly to every corner of the cabin nothing was burningnot even the curtains to my mothers bed appeared to be singed i was astonishedbreathless with fear with a trembling voice i again called out mother i remained more than a minute panting for breath and then ventured to draw back the curtains of the bedmy mother was not there but there appeared to be a black mass in the centre of the bed i put my hand fearfully upon itit was a sort of unctuous pitchy cinder i screamed with horrormy little senses reeledi staggered from the cabin and fell down on the deck in a state amounting almost to insanity it was followed by a sort of stupor which lasted for many hours as the reader may be in some doubt as to the occasion of my mothers death i must inform him that she perished in that very peculiar and dreadful manner which does sometimes although rarely occur to those who indulge in an immoderate use of spirituous liquors cases of this kind do indeed present themselves but once in a century but the occurrence of them is too well authenticated she perished from what is termed spontaneous combustion an inflammation of the gases generated from the spirits absorbed into the system it is to be presumed that the flames issuing from my mothers body completely frightened out of his senses my father who had been drinking freely and thus did i lose both my parents one by fire and the other by water at one and the same time chapter two i fulfil the last injunctions of my father and i am embarked upon a new elementfirst bargain in my life very profitablefirst parting with old friends very painfulfirst introduction into civilised life very unsatisfactory to all parties it was broad daylight when i awoke from my state of bodily and mental imbecility for some time i could not recall to my mind all that had happened the weight which pressed upon my feelings told me that it was something dreadful at length the cabin hatch still open caught my eye i recalled all the horrors of the preceding evening and recollected that i was left alone in the lighter i got up and stood on my feet in mute despair i looked around methe mist of the morning was hanging over the river and the objects on shore were with difficulty to be distinguished i was chilled from lying all night in the heavy dew and perhaps still more from previous and extraordinary excitement venture to go down into the cabin i dare not i had an indescribable awe a degree of horror at what i had seen that made it impossible still i was unsatisfied and would have given worlds if i had had them to explain the mystery i turned my eyes from the cabin hatch to the water thought of my father and then for more than half an hour watched the tide as it ran upmy mind in a state of vacancy as the sun rose the mist gradually cleared away trees houses and green fields other barges coming up with the tide boats passing and repassing the barking of dogs the smoke issuing from the various chimneys all broke upon me by degrees and i was recalled to the sense that i was in a busy world and had my own task to perform the last words of my fatherand his injunctions had ever been a law to mewere mind jacob we must be up at the wharf early tomorrow morning i prepared to obey him purchase the anchor i could not i therefore slipped the cable lashing a broken sweep to the end of it as a buoyrope and once more the lighter was at the mercy of the stream guided by a boy of eleven years old in about two hours i was within a hundred yards of the wharf and well inshore i hailed for assistance and two men who were on board of the lighters moored at the wharf pushed off in a skiff to know what it was that i wanted i told them that i was alone in the lighter without anchor or cable and requested them to secure her they came on board and in a few minutes the lighter was safe alongside of the others as soon as the lashings were passed they interrogated me as to what had happened but although the fulfilling of my fathers last injunctions had borne up my spirits now that they were obeyed a reaction took place i could not answer them i threw myself down on the deck in a paroxysm of grief and cried as if my heart would break the men who were astonished not only at my conduct but at finding me alone in the lighter went on shore to the clerk and stated the circumstances he returned with them and would have interrogated me but my paroxysm was not yet over and my replies broken my sobs were unintelligible the clerk and the two men went down into the cabin returned hastily and quitted the lighter in about a quarter of an hour i was sent for and conducted to the house of the proprietorthe first time in my life that i had ever put my foot on terra firma i was led into the parlour where i found the proprietor at breakfast with his wife and his daughter a little girl nine years old by this time i had recovered myself and on being interrogated told my story clearly and succinctly while the big tears coursed each other down my dirty face how strange and how horrible said the lady to her husband i cannot understand it even now nor can i but still it is true from what johnson the clerk has witnessed in the meantime my eyes were directed to every part of the room which appeared to my ignorance as a golcondo of wealth and luxury there were few things which i had seen before but i had an innate idea that they were of value the silver teapot the hissing urn the spoons the pictures in their frames every article of furniture caught my wondering eye and for a short time i had forgotten my father and my mother but i was recalled from my musing speculations by the proprietor inquiring how far i had brought the lighter without assistance have you any friends my poor boy inquired the lady no what no relations onshore i never was on shore before in my life do you know that you are a destitute orphan whats that that you have no father or mother said the little girl well replied i in my fathers words having no answer more appropriate its no use crying whats done cant be helped but what do you intend to do now inquired the proprietor looking hard at me after my previous answer dont know im sure take it coolly replied i whimpering what a very odd child observed the lady is he aware of the extent of his misfortune better luck next time missus repled i wiping my eyes with the back of my hand what strange answers from a child who has shown so much feeling observed the proprietor to his wife what is your name jacob faithful can you write or read no replied i again using my fathers words no i canti wish i could very well my poor boy well see whats to be done said the proprietor i know whats to be done rejoined i you must send a couple of hands to get the anchor and cable afore they cut the buoy adrift you are right my lad that must be done immediately said the proprietor but now you had better go down with sarah into the kitchen cook will take care of you sarah my love take him down to cook the little girl beckoned me to follow her i was astonished at the length and variety of the companionladders for such i considered the stairs and was at last landed below when little sarah giving cook the injunction to take care of me again tripped lightly up to her mother i found the signification of take care of any one very different on shore from what it was on the river where taking care of you means getting out of your way and giving you a wide berth and i found the shore reading much more agreeable cook did take care of me she was a kindhearted fat woman who melted at a tale of woe although the fire made no impression on her i not only beheld but i devoured such things as never before entered into my mouth or my imagination grief had not taken away my appetite i stopped occasionally to cry a little wiped my eyes and sat down again it was more than two hours before i laid down my knife and not until strong symptoms of suffocation played round the regions of my trachea did i cry out hold enough somebody has made an epigram about the vast ideas which a misers horse must have had of corn i doubt if such ideas were existent whether they were at all equal to my astonishment at a leg of mutton i never had seen such a piece of meat before and wondered if it were fresh or otherwise after such reflection i naturally felt inclined to sleep in a few minutes i was snoring upon two chairs cook having covered me up with her apron to keep away the flies thus was i fairly embarked upon a new element to memy mother earth and it may be just as well to examine now into the capital i possessed for my novel enterprise in person i was welllooking i was wellmade strong and active of my habiliments the less said the better i had a pair of trousers with no seat to them but this defect when i stood up was hid by my jacket composed of an old waistcoat of my fathers which reached down as low as the morning frocks worn in those days a shirt of coarse duck and a fur cap which was as rough and ragged as if it had been the hide of a cat pulled to pieces by dogs completed my attire shoes and stockings i had none these supernumerary appendages had never confined the action of my feet my mental acquisitions were not much more valuable they consisted of a tolerable knowledge of the depth of water names of points and reaches in the river thames all of which was not very available on dry landof a few hieroglyphics of my fathers which as the crier says sometimes winding up his oration were of no use to nobody but the owner add to the above the three favourite maxims of my taciturn father which were indelibly imprinted upon my memory and you have the whole inventory of my stockintrade these three maxims were i may say incorporated into my very system so continually had they been quoted to me during my life and before i went to sleep that night they were again conned over whats done cant be helped consoled me for the mishaps of my life better luck next time made me look forward with hope and take it coolly was a subject of great reflection until i feel into a deep sleep for i had sufficient penetration to observe that my father had lost his life by not adhering to his own principles and this perception only rendered my belief in the infallibility of these maxims to be even still more steadfast i have stated what was my fathers legacy and the reader will suppose that from the maternal side the acquisition was nil directly such was the case but indirectly she proved a very good mother to me and that was by the very extraordinary way in which she had quitted the world had she met with a common death she would have been worth nothing burke himself would not have been able to dispose of her but dying as she did her ashes were the source of wealth the bed with her remains lying in the centre even the curtains of the bed were all brought on shore and locked up in an outhouse the coroner came down in a postchaise and four charged to the country the jury was empanelled my evidence was taken surgeons and apothecaries attended from far and near to give their opinions and after much examination much arguing and much disagreement the verdict was brought in that she died through the visitation of god as this in other phraseology implies that god only knows how she died it was agreed to nemine contradicente and gave universal satisfaction but the extraordinary circumstance was spread everywhere with all due amplifications and thousands flocked to the wharfingers yard to witness the effects of spontaneous combustion the proprietor immediately perceived that he could avail himself of the public curiosity to my advantage a plate with some silver and gold was placed at the foot of my poor mothers flock mattress with for the benefit of the orphan in capital text placarded above it and many were the shillings halfcrowns and even larger sums which were dropped into it by the spectators who shuddered as they turned away from this awful specimen of the effects of habitual intoxication for many days did the exhibition continue during which time i was domiciled with the cook who employed me in scouring her saucepans and any other employment in which my slender services might be useful little thinking at the time that my poor mother was holding her levee for my advantage on the eleventh day the exhibition was closed and i was summoned upstairs by the proprietor whom i found in company with a little gentleman in black this was a surgeon who had offered a sum of money for my mothers remains bed and curtains in a lot the proprietor was willing to get rid of them in so advantageous a manner but did not conceive that he was justified in taking this step although for my benefit without first consulting me as heiratlaw jacob said he this gentleman offers pounds which is a great deal of money for the ashes of your poor mother have you any objection to let him have them what do you want em for inquired i i wish to keep them and take great care of them answered he well replied i after a little consideration if youll take care of the old woman you may have herand the bargain was concluded singular that the first bargain i ever made in my life should be that of selling my own mother the proceeds of the exhibition and sale amounted to pounds odd which the worthy proprietor of the lighter after deducting for a suit of clothes laid up for my use thus ends the history of my mothers remains which proved more valuable to me than ever she did when living in her career she somewhat reversed the case of semele who was first visited in a shower of gold and eventually perished in the fiery embraces of the god whereas my poor mother perished first by the same element and the shower of gold descended to her only son but this is easily explained semele was very lovely and did not drink ginmy mother was her complete antithesis when i was summoned to my masters presence to arrange the contract with the surgeon i had taken off the waistcoat which i wore as a garment over all that i might be more at my ease in chopping some wood for the cook and the servant led me up at once without giving me time to put it on after i had given my consent i turned away to go downstairs again when having as i before observed no seat to my trousers the solution of continuity was observed by a little spaniel who jumped from the sofa and arriving at a certain distance stood at bay and barked most furiously at the exposure he had been bred among respectable people and had never seen such an expose mr drummond the proprietor observed the defect pointed out by the dog and forthwith i was ordered to be suited with a new suitcertainly not before they were required in twentyfour hours i was thrust into a new garment by a bandylegged tailor assisted by my friend the cook and turn or twist whichever way i pleased decency was never violated a new suit of clothes is generally an object of ambition and flatters the vanity of young and old but with me it was far otherwise encumbered with my novel apparel i experienced at once feelings of restraint and sorrow my shoes hurt me my worsted stockings irritated the skin and as i had been accustomed to hereditarily succeed to my fathers castoff skins which were a world too wide for my shanks having but few ideas it appeared to me as if i had swelled out to the size of the clothes which i had been accustomed to wear not that they had been reduced to my dimensions i fancied myself a man but was very much embarrassed with my manhood every step that i took i felt as if i was checked back by strings i could not swing my arms as i was wont to do and tottered in my shoes like a rickety child my old apparel had been consigned to the dusthole by cook and often during the day would i pass casting a longing eye at it wishing that i dare recover it and exchange it for that which i wore i knew the value of it and like the magician in aladdins tale would have offered new lamps for old ones cheerfully submitting to ridicule that i might have repossessed my treasure with the kitchen and its apparatus i was now quite at home but at every other part of the house and furniture i was completely puzzled everything appeared to me foreign strange and unnatural and prince le boo or any other savage never stared or wondered more than i did of most things i knew not the use of many not even the names i was literally a savage but still a kind and docile one the day after my new clothes had been put on i was summoned into the parlour mr drummond and his wife surveyed me in my altered habiliments and amused themselves at my awkwardness at the same time that they admired my wellknit compact and straight figure set off by a fit in my opinion much too straight their little daughter sarah who often spoke to me went up and whispered to her mother you must ask papa was the reply another whisper and a kiss and mr drummond told me i should dine with them in a few minutes i followed them into the diningroom and for the first time i was seated to a repast which could boast of some of the supernumerary comforts of civilised life there i sat perched on a chair with my feet swinging close to the carpet glowing with heat from the compression of my clothes and the novelty of my situation and all that was around me mr drummond helped me to some scalding soup a silver spoon was put into my hand which i twisted round and round looking at my face reflected in miniature on its polish now jacob you must eat the soup with the spoon said little sarah laughing we shall all be done be quick take it coolly replied i digging my spoon into the burning preparation and tossing it into my mouth it burst forth from my tortured throat in a diverging shower accompanied with a howl of pain the poor boy has scalded his mouth cried the lady pouring out a tumbler of water its no use crying replied i blubbering with all my might whats done cant be helped better that you had not been helped observed mr drummond wiping off his share of my liberal spargification from his coat and waistcoat the poor boy has been shamefully neglected observed the goodnatured mrs drummond come jacob sit down and try it again it will not burn you now better luck next time said i shoving in a portion of it with a great deal of tremulous hesitation and spilling onehalf of it in its transit it was now cool but i did not get on very fast i held my spoon awry and soiled my clothes mrs drummond interfered and kindly showed me how to proceed when mr drummond said let the boy eat it after his own fashion my dearonly be quick jacob for we are waiting then i see no good losing so much of it taking it in tale observed i when i can ship it all in bulk in a minute i laid down my spoon and stooping my head applied my mouth to the edge of the plate and sucked the remainder down my throat without spilling a drop i looked up for approbation and was very much astonished to hear mrs drummond quietly observe that is not the way to eat soup i made so many blunders during the meal that little sarah was in a continued roar of laughter and i felt so miserable that i heartily wished myself again in my dogkennel on board of the lighter gnawing biscuit in all the happiness of content and dignity of simplicity for the first time i felt the pangs of humiliation ignorance is not always debasing on board of the lighter i was sufficient for myself my company and my duties i felt an elasticity of mind a respect for myself and a consciousness of power as the immense mass was guided through the waters by my single arm there without being able to analyse my feelings i was a spirit guiding a little world and now at this table and in company with rational and wellinformed beings i felt humiliated and degraded my heart was overflowing with shame and at one unusual loud laugh of the little sarah the heaped up measure of my anguish overflowed and i burst into a passion of tears as i lay with my head upon the tablecloth regardless of those decencies i had so much feared and awake only to a deep sense of wounded pride each sob coming from the very core of my heart i felt a soft breathing warm upon my cheek that caused me to look up timidly and i beheld the glowing and beautiful face of little sarah her eyes filled with tears looking so softly and beseechingly at me that i felt at once i was of some value and panted to be of more i wont laugh at you any more said she so dont cry jacob no more i will replied i cheering up she remained standing by me and i felt grateful the first time i get a piece of wood whispered i ill cut you out a barge that boy has a heart said mr drummond to his wife but will it swim jacob inquired the little girl yes and if its lopsided call me a lubber whats lopsided and whats a lubber replied sarah why dont you know cried i and i felt my confidence return when i found that in this little instance i knew more than she did chapter three i am sent to a charity school where the boys do not consider charity as a part of their educationthe peculiarities of the master and the magical effect of a blow of the nosea disquisition upon the letter a from which i find all my previous learning thrown away before i quitted the room sarah and i were in deep converse at the window and mr and mrs drummond employed likewise at the table the result of the conversation between sarah and me was the intimacy of children that of mr and mrs drummond that the sooner i was disposed of the more it would be for my own advantage having some interest with the governors of a charity school near brentford mr drummond lost no time in procuring me admission and before i had quite spoiled my new clothes having worn them nearly three weeks i was suited afresh in a formal attirea long coat of pepper and salt yellow leather breeches tied at the knees a worsted cap with a tuft on the top of it stockings and shoes to match and a large pewter plate upon my breast marked with number which as i was the last entered boy indicated the sum total of the school it was with regret that i left the abode of the drummonds who did not think it advisable to wait for the completion of the barge much to the annoyance of miss drummond and before we arrived met them all out walking i was put into the ranks received a little good advice from my worthy patron who then walked away one way while we walked another looking like a regiment of yellowthighed fieldfares straightened in human perpendiculars behold then the last scion of the faithfuls peppered salted and plated that all the world might know that he was a charityboy and that there was charity in this world but if heroes kings great and grave men must yield to destiny lighterboys cannot be expected to escape and i was doomed to receive an education board lodging raiment etcetera free gratis and for nothing every society has it chief and i was about to observe that every circle has it centre which certainly would have been true enough but the comparison is of no use to me as our circle had two centres or to follow up the first idea had two chiefsthe chief schoolmaster and the chief domesticthe chief masculine and the chief femininethe chief with the ferula and the chief with the brimstone and treaclethe master and the matron each of whom had their appendagesthe one in the usher the other in the assistant housemaid but of this quartette the master was not only the most important but the most worthy of description and as he will often appear in the pages of my narrative long after my education was complete i shall be very particular in my description of dominie dobiensis as he delighted to be called or dreary dobs as his dutiful scholars delighted to call him as in our school it was necessary that we should be instructed in reading writing and ciphering the governors had selected the dominie as the most fitting person that had offered for the employment because he had in the first place written a work that nobody could understand upon the greek particles secondly he had proved himself a great mathematician having it is said squared the circle by algebraical false quantities but would never show the operation for fear of losing the honour by treachery he had also discovered as many errors in the demonstrations of euclid as ever did joey hume in army and navy estimates and with as much benefit to the country at large he was a man who breathed certainly in the present age but the half of his life was spent in antiquity or algebra once carried away by a problem or a greek reminiscence he passed away as it were from his present existence and everything was unheeded his body remained and breathed on his desk but his soul was absent this peculiarity was well known to the boys who used to say dominie is in his dreams and talks in his sleep dominie dobiensis left reading and writing to the usher contrary to the regulations of the school putting the boys if possible into mathematics latin and greek the usher was not over competent to teach the two first the boys not over willing to learn the latter the master was too clever the usher too ignorant hence the scholars profited little the dominie was grave and irascible but he possessed a fund of drollery and the kindest heart his features could not laugh but his trachea did the chuckle rose no higher than the rings of the windpipe and then it was vigorously thrust back again by the impulse of gravity into the region of his heart and gladdened it with hidden mirth in its dark centre the dominie loved a pun whether it was let off in english greek or latin the last two were made by nobody but himself and not being understood were of course relished by himself alone but his love of a pun was a serious attachment he loved it with a solemn affectionwith him it was no laughing matter in person dominie dobiensis was above six feet all bone and sinews his face was long and his lineaments large but his predominant feature was his nose which large as were the others bore them down into insignificance it was a prodigya ridicule but he consoled himself ovid was called naso it was not an aquiline nose nor was it an aquiline nose reversed it was not a nose snubbed at the extremity gross heavy or carbuncled or fluting in all its magnitude of proportions it was an intellectual nose it was thin horny transparent and sonorous its snuffle was consequential and its sneeze oracular the very sight of it was impressive its sound when blown in school hours was ominous but the scholars loved the nose for the warning which it gave like the rattle of the dreaded snake which announces its presence so did the nose indicate to the scholars that they were to be on their guard the dominie would attend to this world and its duties for an hour or two and then forget his scholars and his schoolroom while he took a journey into the world of greek or algebra then when he marked x y and z in his calculations the boys knew that he was safe and their studies were neglected reader did you ever witness the magic effects of a drum in a small village when the recruiting party with manycoloured ribbons rouse it up with a spiritstirring tattoo matrons leave their domestic cares and run to the cottage door peeping over their shoulders the maidens admire and fear the shuffling clowns raise up their heads gradually until they stand erect and proud the slouch in the back is taken out their heavy walk is changed to a firm yet elastic tread every muscle appears more braced every nerve by degrees new strung the blood circulates rapidly pulses quicken hearts throb eyes brighten and as the martial sound pervades their rustic frames the cimons of the plough are converted as if by magic into incipient heroes for the fieldand all this is produced by beating the skin of the most gentle most harmless animal of creation not having at hand the simile synthetical we have resorted to the antithetical the blowing of the dominies nose produced the very contrary effects it was a signal that he had returned from his intellectual journal and was once more in his schoolroomthat the master had finished with his x y zs and it was time for scholars to mind their ps and qs at this note of warning like the minuteroll among the troops every one fell into his place halfmunched apples were thrust into the first pocketpopguns disappearedbattles were left to be decided elsewherebooks were opened and eyes directed to themforms that were fidgeting and twisting in all directions now took one regimental inclined position over the desksilence was restored order resumed her reign and mr knapps the usher who always availed himself of these interregnums as well as the scholars by deserting to the matrons room warned by the wellknown sound hastened to the desk of toil such were the astonishing effects of a blow from dominie dobiensis sonorous and peacerestoring nose jacob faithful draw near were the first words which struck upon my tympanum the next morning when i had taken my seat at the further end of the schoolroom i rose and threaded my way through two lines of boys who put out their legs to trip me up in my passage through their ranks and surmounting all difficulties found myself within three feet of the masters high desk or pulpit from which he looked down upon me like the olympian jupiter upon mortals in ancient time jacob faithful canst thou read no i cant replied i i wish i could a welldisposed answer jacob thy wishes shall be gratified knowest thou thine alphabet i dont know what that is then thou knowest it not mr knapps shall forthwith instruct thee thou shall forthwith go to mr knapps who inculcateth the rudiments levior puer lighterboy thou hast a crafty look and then i heard a noise in his throat that resembled the cluck cluck when my poor mother poured the gin out of the great stone bottle my little navilculator continued he thou art a weed washed on shore one of father thames castup wrecks fluviorum rex eridanus chuck cluck to thy studies be thyselfthat is be faithful mr knapps let the cadmean art proceed forthwith so saying dominie dobiensis thrust his large hand into his right coat pocket in which he kept his snuff loose and taking a large pinch the major part of which the stock being low was composed of hair and cotton abrasions which had collected in the corners of his pocket he called up the first class while mr knapps called me to my first lesson mr knapps was a thin hecticlooking young man apparently nineteen or twenty years of age very small in all his proportions red ferret eyes and without the least sign of incipient manhood but he was very savage nevertheless not being permitted to pummel the boys when the dominie was in the schoolroom he played the tyrant most effectually when he was left commanding officer the noise and hubbub certainly warranted his interferencethe respect paid to him was positively nil his practice was to select the most glaring delinquent and let fly his ruler at him with immediate orders to bring it back these orders were complied with for more than one reason in the first place was the offender hit he was glad that another should have his turn in the second mr knapps being a very bad shot never having drove a kamschatdale team of dogs he generally missed the one he aimed at and hit some other who if he did not exactly deserve it at that moment certainly did for previous or would for subsequent delinquencies in the latter case the ruler was brought back to him because there was no injury inflicted although intended however be it as it may the ruler was always returned to him and thus did mr knapps pelt the boys as if they were cocks on shrove tuesday to the great risk of their heads and limbs i have little further to say of mr knapps except that he wore a black shalloon loose coat on the left sleeve of which he wiped his pen and upon the right but too often his eversnivelling nose what is that boy said mr knapps pointing to the letter a i looked attentively and recognising as i thought one of my fathers hieroglyphics replied thats halfabushel and i was certainly warranted in my supposition halfabushel youre more than half a fool thats the letter a no its halfabushel father told me so then your father was as big a fool as yourself father knew what halfabushel was and so do i thats halfabushel i tell you its the letter a cried mr knapps in a rage its halfabushel replied i doggedly i persisted in my assertion and mr knapps who dared not punish me while the dominie was present descended his throne of one step and led me up to the master i can do nothing with this boy sir said he red as fire he denies the first letter in the alphabet and insists upon it that the letter a is not a but halfabushel dost thou in thine ignorance pretend to teach when thou comest here to learn jacob faithful father always told me that that thing there meant halfabushel thy father might perhaps have used that letter to signify the measure which thou speakest of in the same way as i in my mathematics use divers letters for known and unknown quantities but thou must forget that which thy father taught thee and commence de novo dost thou understand no i dont then little jacob that represents the letter a and whatever else mr knapps may tell thee thou wilt believe return jacob and be docile chapter four sleightofhand at the expense of my feetfilling a mans pockets as great an offence as picking them and punished accordinglya turn out a turn up and a turn inearly impressions removed and redundancy of feeling corrected by a spell of the rattan i did not quit mr knapps until i had run through the alphabet and then returned to my place that i might con it over at my leisure puzzling myself with the strange complexity of forms of which the alphabet was composed i felt heated and annoyed by the constraint of my shoes always an object of aversion from the time i had put them on i drew my foot out of one then out of the other and thought no more of them for some time in the meanwhile the boys next me had passed them on with their feet to the others and thus were they shuffled along until they were right up to the masters desk i missed them and perceiving that there was mirth at my expense i narrowly and quietly watched up and down till i perceived one of the head boys of the school who sat nearest the dominie catch up one of my shoes and the dominie being then in an absent fit drop it into his coatpocket a short time afterwards he got up went to mr knapps put a question to him and while it was being answered he dropped the other into the pocket of the usher and tittering to the other boys returned to his seat i said nothing but when the hours of school were over the dominie looked at his watch blew his nose which made the whole of the boys pop up their heads like the clansmen of roderick dhu when summoned by his horn folded up his large pockethankerchief slowly and reverently as if it were a banner put it into his pocket and uttered in a solemn tone tempus est ludendi as this latin phrase was used every day at the same hour every boy in the school understood so much latin a rush from all the desks ensured and amidst shouting yelling and leaping every soul disappeared except myself who remained fixed to my form the dominie rose from his pulpit and descended the usher did the same and both approached me on their way to their respective apartments jacob faithful why still porest thou over thy bookdidst thou not understand that the hours of recreation had arrived why risest thou not upon thy feet like the others cause ive got no shoes and where are thy shoes jacob ones in your pocket replied i and tothers in hisn each party placed their hands behind and felt the truth of the assertion expound jacob said the dominie who hath done this the big boy with the red hair and a face picked all over with holes like the strainers in masters kitchen replied i mr knapps it would be infra dig on my part and also on yours to suffer this disrespect to pass unnoticed ring in the boys the boys were rung in and i was desired to point out the offender which i immediately did and who as stoutly denied the offence but he had abstracted my shoestrings and put them into his own shoes i recognised them and it was sufficient barnaby bracegirdle said the dominie thou art convicted not only of disrespect towards me and mr knapps but further of the grievous sin of lying simon swapps let him be hoisted he was hoisted his nether garments descended and then the birch descend with all the vigour of the dominies muscular arm barnaby bracegirdle showed every symptom of his disapproval of the measures taken but simon swapps held fast and the dominie flogged fast after a minutes flagellation barnaby was let down his yellow tights pulled up and the boys dismissed barnabys face was red but the antipodes were redder the dominie departed leaving us togetherhe adjusting his inexpressibles i putting in my shoestrings by the time barnaby had buttoned up and wiped his eyes i had succeeded in standing in my shoes there we were teteatete now then said barnaby holding one fist to my face while with the other open hand he rubbed behind come out in the playground mr cinderella and see if i wont drub you within an inch of your life its no use crying said i soothingly for i had not wished him to be flogged whats done cant be helped did it hurt you much this intended consolation was taken for sarcasm barnaby stormed take it coolly observed i barnaby waxed even more wroth better luck next time continued i trying to soothe him barnaby was outrageoushe shook his fist and ran into the playground daring me to follow him his threats had no weight with me not wishing to remain indoors i followed him in a minute or two when i found him surrounded by the other boys to whom he was in loud and vehement harangue cinderella wheres your glass slippers cried the boys as i made my appearance come out you waterrat cried barnaby you son of a cinder come out and fight him or else youre a coward exclaimed the whole host from number to number inclusive he has had beating enough already to my mind replied i but he had better not touch mei can use my arms a ring was formed in the centre of which i found barnaby and myself he took off his clothes and i did the same he was much older and stronger than i and knew something about fighting one boy came forward as my second barnaby advanced and held out his hand which i shook heartily thinking it was all over but immediately received a right and left on the face which sent me reeling backwards this was a complete mystery but it raised my bile and i returned it with interest i was very strong in my arms as may be supposed and i threw them about like sails of a windmill never hitting straight out but with semicircular blows which descended on or about his ears on the contrary his blows were all received straightforward and my nose and face were soon covered with blood as i warmed with pain and rage i flung out my arms at random and barnaby gave me a knockdown blow i was picked up and sat upon my seconds knee who whispered to me as i spat the blood out of my mouth take it coolly and make sure when you hit my ownmy fathers maximcoming from another it struck with double force and i never forgot it during the remainder of the fight again we were standing up face to face again i received it right and left and returned it upon his right and left ears barnaby rushed ini was down again better luck next time said i to my second as cool as a cucumber a third and a fourth round succeeded all apparently in barnabys favour but really in mine my face was beat to a mummy but he was what is termed groggy from the constant return of blows on the side of the head again we stood up panting and exhausted barnaby rushed at me and i avoided him before he could return to the attack i had again planted two severe blows upon his ears and he reeled he shook his head and with his fists in the attitude of defence asked me whether i had had enough he has said my second stick to him now jacob and youll beat him i did stick to him three or four more blows applied to the same part finished him and he fell senseless on the ground youve settled him cried my second whats done cant be helped replied i is he dead whats all this cried mr knapps pressing his way through the crowd followed by the matron barnaby and cinderella having it out sir said one of the elder boys the matron who had already taken a liking for me because i was goodlooking and because i had been recommended to her care by mrs drummond ran to me well says she if the dominie dont punish that big brute for this ill see whether im anybody or not and taking me by the hand she led me away in the meantime mr knapps surveyed barnaby who was still senseless and desired the other boys to bring him in and lay him on his bed he breathed hard but still remained senseless and a surgeon was sent for who found it necessary to bleed him copiously he then at the request of the matron came to me my features were indistinguishable but elsewhere i was all right as i stripped he examined my arms it seemed strange observed he that the bigger boy should be so severely punished but this boys arms are like little sledgehammers i recommend you said he to the other boys not to fight with him for some day or other hell kill one of you this piece of advice was not forgotten by the other boys and from that day i was the cock of the school the name of cinderella given me by barnaby in ridicule of my mothers death was immediately abandoned and i suffered no more persecution it was the custom of the dominie whenever two boys fought to flog them both but in this instance it was not followed up because i was not the aggressor and my adversary narrowly escaped with his life i was under the matrons care for a week and barnaby under the surgeons hands for about the same time neither was i less successful in my studies i learnt rapidly after i had conquered the first rudiments but i had another difficulty to conquer which was my habit of construing everything according to my refined ideas the force of association had become so strong that i could not overcome it for a considerable length of time mr knapps continually complained of my being obstinate when in fact i was anxious to please as well as to learn for instance in spelling the first syllable always produced the association with something connected with my former way of life i recollect the dominie once and only once gave me a caning about a fortnight after i went to the school i had been brought up by mr knapps as contumelious jacob faithful how is this thine head is good yet wilt thou refuse learning tell me now what does cat spell it was the pitchpipe to cathead and answered i accordingly nay jacob it spells cat take care of thy head on the next reply understand me head is not understood jacob thy head is in jeopardy now jacob what does mat spell chafingmat replied i it spells mat only silly boy the chafing will be on my part directly now jacob what does dog spell dogkennel dog jacob without the kennel thou art very contumelious and deservest to be rolled in the kennel now jacob this is the last time that thou triflest with me what does hat spell fur cap replied i after some hesitation jacob i feel the wrath rising within me yet would i fain spare thee if hat spell furcap pray advise me what doth cap spell then capstern indeed jacob thy stern as well as thy head are in danger and i suppose then wind spells windlass does it not yes sir replied i pleased to find that he agreed with me upon the same principle what does rat spell rat sir replied i nay jacob rat must spell rattan and as thou hast missed thine own mode of spelling thou shalt not miss the cane the dominie then applied it to my shoulders with considerable unction much to the delight of mr knapps who thought the punishment was much too small for the offence but i soon extricated myself from these associations as my ideas extended and was considered by the dominie as the cleverest boy in the school whether it were from natural intellect or from my brain having lain fallow as it were for so many years or probably from the two causes combined i certainly learned almost by instinct i read my lessons once over and laid my book aside for i knew it all i had not been six months at the school before i discovered that in a thousand instances the affection of a father appeared towards me under the rough crust of the dominie i think it was on the third day of the seventh month that i afforded him a day of triumph and warming of his heart when he took me for the first time into his little study and put the latin accidence into my hands i learnt my first lesson in a quarter of an hour and i remember well how that unsmiling grave man looked into my smiling eyes parting the chestnut curls which the matron would not cut off from my brows and saying bene fecisti jacobe many times afterwards when the lesson was over he would fix his eyes upon me fall back on his chair and make me recount all i could remember of my former life which was really nothing but a record of perceptions and feelings he could attend to me and as i related some early and singular impression some conjecture of what i saw yet could not comprehend on the shore which i had never touched he would rub his hands with enthusiasm and exclaim i have found a new bookan album whereon i may write the deeds of heroes and the words of sages carissime jacobe how happy shall we be when we get into virgil i hardly need say that i loved himi did so from my heart and learned with avidity to please him i felt that i was of consequencemy confidence in myself was unbounded i walked proudly yet i was not vain my schoolfellows hated me but they feared me as much for my own prowess as my interest with the master but still many were the bitter gibes and innuendoes which i was obliged to hear as i sat down with them to our meals at other times i held communion with the dominie the worthy old matron and my books we walked out every day at first attended by mr knapps the usher the boys would not walk with me without they were ordered and if ordered most unwillingly yet i had given no cause of offence the matron found it out told the dominie and after that the dominie attended the boys and led me by the hand this was of the greatest advantage to me as he answered all my questions which were not few and each day i advanced in every variety of knowledge before i had been eighteen months at school the dominie was unhappy without my company and i was equally anxious for his presence he was a father to me and i loved him as a son should love a father and as it will hereafter prove he was my guide through life but although the victory over barnaby bracegirdle and the idea of my prowess procured me an enforced respect still the dominies goodwill towards me was the occasion of a settled hostility affront me or attack me openly they dare not but supported as the boys were by mr knapps the usher who was equally jealous of my favour and equally mean in spirit they caballed to ruin me if possible in the good opinion of my master barnaby bracegirdle had a talent for caricature which was wellknown to all but the dominie his first attempt against me was a caricature of my mothers death in which she was represented as a lamp supplied from a ginbottle and giving flame out of her mouth this was told to me but i did not see it it was given by barnaby to mr knapps who highly commended it and put it into his desk after which barnaby made an oftrepeated caricature of the dominie with a vast nose which he shewed to the usher as my performance the usher understood what barnaby was at and put it into his desk without comment several other ludicrous caricatures were made of the dominie and of the matron all of which were consigned to mr knapps by the boys as being the productions of my pencil but this was not sufficientit was necessary i should be more clearly identified it so happened that one evening when sitting with the dominie at my latin the matron and mr knapps being in the adjoining room the light which had burned close down fell in the socket and went out the dominie rose to get another the matron also got up to fetch away the candlestick with the same intent they met in the dark and ran their heads together pretty hard as this event was only known to mr knapps and myself he communicated it to barnaby wondering whether i should not make it a subject of one of my caricatures barnaby took the hint in the course of a few hours this caricature was added to the others mr knapps to further his views took an opportunity to mention with encomium my talent for drawing added that he had seen several of my performances the boy hath talent replied the dominie he is a rich mine from which much precious metal is to be obtained i hear that thou hast the talent for drawing jacob said he to me a day or two afterwards i never had in my life sir replied i nay jacob i like modesty but modesty should never lead to a denial of the truth remember jacob that thou do not repeat the fault i made no answer as i felt convinced that i was not in fault but that evening i requested the dominie to lend me a pencil as i wished to try and draw for some days various scraps of my performances were produced and received commendation the boy draweth well observed the dominie to mr knapps as he examined my performance through his spectacles why should he have denied his being able to draw observed the usher it was a fault arising from modesty or want of confidenceeven a virtue carried to excess may lead us into error the next attempt of barnaby was to obtain the cornelius nepos which i then studied this was effected by mr knapps who took it out of the dominies study and put it into barnabys possession who drew on the flyleaf on which was my name a caricature head of the dominie and under my own name which i had written on the leaf added in my hand fecit so that it appeared jacob faithful fecit having done this the leaf was torn out of the book and consigned to the usher with the rest the plot was now ripe and the explosion soon ensued mr knapps told the dominie that i drew caricatures of my schoolfellows the dominie taxed me and i denied it so you denied drawing observed the usher a few days passed away when mr knapps informed the dominie that i had been caricaturing him and mrs bately the matron and that he had proofs of it i had then gone to bed the dominie was much surprised and thought it impossible that i could be so ungrateful mr knapps said that should make the charge openly and prove it the next morning in the schoolroom and wound up the wrong by describing me in several points as a cunning goodfornothing although clever boy chapter five mr knapps thinks to catch me napping but the plot is discovered and barnaby bracegirdle is obliged to loosen his braces for the second time on my accountdrawing caricatures ends in drawing bloodthe usher is ushered out of the school and i am nearly ushered into the next world but instead of being bound on so long a journey i am bound prentice to a waterman ignorant of what had passed i slept soundly and the next morning found the matron very grave with me which i did not comprehend the dominie also took no notice of my morning salute but supposing him to be wrapt in euclid at the time i thought little of it the breakfast passed over and the bell rang for school we were all assembled the dominie walked in with a very magisterial air followed by mr knapps who instead of parting company when he arrived at his own desk continued his course with the dominie to his pulpit we all knew that there was something in the wind but of all perhaps i was the least alarmed the dominie unfolded his large handkerchief waved it and blew his nose and the school was into profound silence jacob faithful draw near said he in a tone which proved that the affair was serious i drew near wondering thou hast been accused by mr knapps of caricaturing and holding up to the ridicule of the school methy master upon any other boy such disrespect should be visited severely but from thee jacob i must add in the words of caesar et tu brute i expected i had a right to expect otherwise in se animi ingrati crimen vitia omnia condit thou understandest me jacob guilty or not guilty not guilty sir replied i firmly he pleadeth net guilty mr knapps proceed then to prove thy charge mr knapps then went to his desk and brought out the drawings with which he had been supplied by barnaby bracegirdle and the other boys these drawings sir which you will please to look over have all been given up to me as the performance of jacob faithful at first i could not believe it to be true but you will perceive at once that they are all by the same hand that i acknowledge said the dominie and all reflect upon my nose it is true that my nose is of large dimensions but it was the will of heaven that i should be so endowed yet are the noses of these figures even larger than mine own could warrant if the limner were correct and not malicious still have they merit continued the dominie looking at some of them and i heard a gentle cluck cluck in his throat as he laughed at his own misrepresentations artis adumbratae meruit cum sedula laudem as prudentius hath it i have no time to finish the quotation here is one drawing sir continued mr knapps which proves to me that jacob faithful is the party in which you and mrs bately are shown up to ridicule who would have been aware that the candle went out in your study except jacob faithful i perceive replied the dominie looking at it through his spectacles when put into his hand the arcana of the study have been violated but sir continued mr knapps here is a more convincing proof you observe this caricature of yourself with his own name put to ithis own handwriting i recognised it immediately and happening to turn over his cornelius nepos observed the first blank leaf torn out here it is sir and you will observe that it fits on to the remainder of the leaf in the book exactly i perceive that it doth and am grieved to find that such is the case jacob faithful thou are convicted of disrespect and of falsehood where is simon swapps if you please sir may i not defend myself replied i am i to be flogged unheard nay that were an injustice replied the dominie but what defence canst thou offer o puer infelix et sceleratus may i look at those caricatures sir said i the dominie handed them to me in silence i looked them all over and immediately knew them to be drawn by barnaby bracegirdle the last particularly struck me i had felt confounded and frightened with the strong evidence brought against me but this reassured me and i spoke boldly these drawings are by barnaby bracegirdle sir and not by me i never drew a caricature in my life so didst thou assert that thou couldst not draw and afterwards provedst by thy pencil to the contrary jacob faithful i knew not that i was able to draw when i said so but i wished to draw when you supposed i was ablei did not like that you should give me credit for what i could not do it was to please you sir that i asked for the pencil i wish it were as thou statest jacobi wish from my inmost soul that thou wert not guilty will you ask mr knapps from whom he had these drawings and at what time there are a great many of them answer mr knapps to the questions of jacob faithful they have been given to me by the boys at different times during this last month well mr knapps point out the boys who gave them mr knapps called out eight or ten boys who came forward did barnaby bracegirdle give you none of them mr knapps said i perceiving that barnaby was not summoned no replied mr knapps if you please sir said i to the dominie with respect to the leaf out of my nepos the jacob faithful was written on it by me on the day that you gave it to me but the fecit and the caricature of yourself is not mine how it came there i dont know thou hast disproved nothing jacob replied the dominie but i have proved something sir on what day was it that i asked you for the pencil to draw with was it not on a saturday last saturday week i think it was well then sir mr knapps told you the day before that i could draw he did and thou deniedst it how then does mr knapps account for not producing those caricatures of mine which he says he has collected for a whole month why didnt he give them to you before thou puttest it shrewdly replied the dominie answer mr knapps why didst thou for a fortnight at the least conceal thy knowledge of his offence i wished to have more proofs replied the usher thou hearest jacob faithful pray sir did you ever hear me speak of my poor mother but with kindness never jacob thou hast ever appeared dutiful please sir to call up john williams john number draw near williams said i did you not tell me that barnaby bracegirdle had drawn my mother flaming at the mouth yes i did my indignation now found vent in a torrent of tears now sir cried i if you believe that i drew the caricatures of you and mrs bately did i draw this which is by the same person and i handed up to the dominie the caricature of my mother which mr knapps had inadvertently produced at the bottom of the rest mr knapps turned white as a sheet the dominie looked at the caricature and was silent for some time at last he turned to the usher from whom didst thou obtain this mr knapps mr knapps replied in his confusion from barnaby bracegirdle it was but this moment thou didst state that thou hadst received none from barnaby bracegirdle thou hast contradicted thyself mr knapps jacob did not draw his mother and the pencil is the same as that which drew the restergo he did not i really believe draw one of them ite procul fraudes god i thank thee that the innocent have been protected narrowly hast thou escaped these toils o jacobcum populo et duce fraudulento and now for punishment barnaby bracegirdle thou gavest this caricature to mr knapps from whence hadst thou it lie not barnaby turned red and white and then acknowledged that the drawing was his own you boys cried the dominie waving his rod which he had seized you gave these drawings to mr knapps tell me from whom they came the boys frightened at the dominies looks immediately replied in a breath from barnaby bracegirdle then barnaby bracegirdle from whom didst thou receive them inquired the dominie barnaby was dumbfounded tell the truth didst thou not draw them thyself since thou didst not receive them from other people barnaby fell upon his knees and related the whole circumstances particularly the way in which the cornelius nepos had been obtained through the medium of mr knapps the indignation of the dominie was now beyond all bounds i never had seen him so moved before he appeared to rise at least a foot more in stature his eyes sparkled his great nose turned red his nostrils dilated and his mouth was more than half open to give vent to the ponderous breathing from his chest his whole appearance was withering to the culprits for thee thou base degraded emptyheaded and venomous little abortion of a man i have no words to signify my contempt by the governors of this charity i leave thy conduct to be judged but until they meet thou shalt not pollute and contaminate the air of this school by thy presence if thou hast one spark of good feeling in thy petty frame beg pardon of this poor boy whom thou wouldst have ruined by thy treachery if not hasten to depart lest in my wrath i apply to the teacher the punishment intended for the scholar but of which thou art more deserving than even barnaby bracegirdle mr knapps said nothing hastened out of the school and that evening quitted his domicile when the governors met he was expelled with ignominy simon swapps hoist up barnaby bracegirdle most strenuously and most indefatigably was the birch applied to barnaby a second time through me barnaby howled and kicked howled and kicked and kicked again at last the dominie was tired consonat omne nemus strepitu for nemus read schoolroom exclaimed the dominie laying down the rod and pulling out his handkerchief to wipe his face calcitrat ardescunt germani coede bimembres that last quotation is happy cluck cluck he then blew his nose addressed the boys in a long orationpaid me a handsome compliment upon my able defenceproved to all those who chose to listen to him that innocence would always confound guiltintimated to barnaby that he must leave the school and then finding himself worn out with exhaustion gave the boys a holiday that they might reflect upon what had passed and which they duly profited by in playing at marbles and peg in the ring he then dismissed the school took me by the hand and led me into his study where he gave vent to his strong and affectionate feelings towards me until the matron came to tell us that dinner was ready after this everything went on well the dominies kindness and attention were unremitting and no one ever thought of caballing against me my progress became most rapid i had conquered virgil taken tacitus by storm and was reading the odes of horace i had passed triumphantly through decimals and was busily employed in mensuration of solids when one evening i was seized with a giddiness in my head i complained to the matron she felt my hands pronounced me feverish and ordered me to bed i passed a restless night the next morning i attempted to rise but a heavy burning ball rolled as it were in my head and i fell back on my pillow the matron came was alarmed at my state and sent for the surgeon who pronounced that i had caught the typhus fever then raging through the vicinity this was the first time in my life that i had known a days sicknessit was a lesson i had yet to learn the surgeon bled me and giving directions to the matron promised to call again in a few hours i was quite deliriousmy senses ran wild one moment i thought i was with little sarah drummond walking in green fields holding her by the hand i turned round and she was no longer there but i was in the lighter and my hand grasped the cinders of my mother my father stood before me again jumped overboard and disappeared again the dark black column ascended from the cabin and i was prostrate on the deck then i was once more alone on the placid and noble thames the moon shining bright and the sweep in my hand tiding up the reach and admiring the foliage which hung in dark shadows over the banks i saw the slopes of green so pure and so fresh by that sweet light and in the distance counted the numerous spires of the great monster city and beheld the various bridges spanning over the water the faint ripple of the tide was harmony the reflection of the moon beauty i felt happiness in my heart i was no longer the charityboy but the pilot of the barge then as i would survey the scene there was something that invariably presented itself between my eyes and the object of my scrutiny whichever way i looked it stood in my way and i could not remove it it was like a cloud yet transparent and with a certain undefined shape i tried for some time but in vain to decipher it but could not at last it appeared to cohere into a formit was the dominies great nose magnified into that of the scripture as the tower which looketh towards damascus my temples throbbed with agonyi burned all over i had no exact notions of death in bed except that of my poor mother and i thought that i was to die like her the horrible fear seized me that all this burning was but prefatory to bursting out into flame and consuming into ashes the dread hung about my young heart and turned that to ice while the rest of my body was on fire this was my last recollection and then all was blank for many days i lay unconscious of either pain or existence when i awoke from my stupor my wandering senses gradually returning i opened my eyes and dimly perceived something before me that cut across my vision in a diagonal line as the mist cleared away and i recovered myself i made out that it was the nose of dominie dobiensis who was kneeling at the bedside his nose adumbrating the coverlid of my bed his spectacles dimmed with tears and his long grey locks falling on each side and shadowing his eyes i was not frightened but i was too weak to stir or speak his prayerbook was in his hand and he still remained on his knees he had been praying for me supposing me still insensible he broke out in the following soliloquy naviculator larvus pallidushow beautiful even in death my poor lighterboy that hath mastered the rudiments and triumphed over the accidencebut to die levior puer a puerile conceit yet i love it as i do thee how my heart bleeds for thee the icy breath of death

fain would i have instructed thee still more before i quitted the scenefain have left thee the mantle of learning thou knowest lord that i walk wearily as in the desert that i am heavily burdened and that my infirmities are many must i then mourn over thee thou promising onemust i say with the epigrammatist hoc jacet in tumulo raptus puerilibus annis jacob faithful domini cura doloroque sui true most true thou hast quitted the element thou so joyously controlledst thou hast come upon the terra firma for thy grave sis licet inde sibi tellus placata levisque artifices levior non potes esse manu earth lay light upon the lighterboythe lotus the waterlily that hath been cast on shore to die hadst thou lived jacob i would have taught thee the humanities we would have conferred pleasantly together i would have poured out my learning to thee my absalom my son he rose and stood over me the tears coursed down his long nose from both his eyes and from the point of it poured out like a little raingutter upon the coverlid i understood not all his words but i understood the spirit of themit was love i feebly stretched forth my arms and articulated dominie the old man clasped his hands looked upwards and said o god i thank theehe will live hush hush my sweet one thou must not prate and he retired on tiptoe and i heard him mutter triumphantly as he walked away he called me dominie from that hour i rapidly recovered and in three weeks was again at my duties i was now within six months of being fourteen years old and mr drummond who had occasionally called to ascertain my progress came to confer with the dominie upon my future prospects all that i can do for him mr dobbs said my former master is to bind him apprentice to serve his time on the river thames and that cannot be done until he is fourteen will the rules of the school permit his remaining the regulations do not exactly but i will replied the dominie i have asked nothing for my long services and the governors will not refuse me such a slight favour should they i will charge myself with him that he may not lose his precious time what sayest thou jacob dost thou feel inclined to return to thy father thames i replied in the affirmative for the recollections of my former life were those of independence and activity thou hast decided well jacobthe tailor at his needle the shoemaker at his last the serving boy to an exacting mistress and all those apprenticed to the various trades have no time for improvement but afloat there are moments of quiet and peacethe still night for reflection the watch for meditation and even the adverse wind or tide leaves moments of leisure which may be employed to advantage then wilt thou call to mind the stores of learning which i have laid up in thy garner and wilt add to them by perseverance and industry thou hast yet six months to profit by and with the blessing of god those six months shall not be thrown away mr drummond having received my consent to be bound apprentice wished me farewell and departed during the six months the dominie pressed me hard almost too hard but i worked for love and to please him i was most diligent at last the time had flown away the six months had more than expired and mr drummond made his appearance with a servant carrying a bundle under his arm i slipped off my pepperandsalt my yellows and badge dressed myself in a neat blue jacket and trousers and with many exhortations from the dominie and kind wishes from the matron i bade farewell to them and to the charityschool and in an hour was once more under the roof of the kind mrs drummond but how different were my sensations to those which oppressed me when i had before entered i was no longer a little savage uneducated and confused in my ideas on the contrary i was full of imagination confident in myself and in my own powers cultivated in mind and proud of my success the finer feelings of my nature had been called into play i felt gratitude humility and love at the same time that i was aware of my own capabilities in person i had much improved as well as much increased in stature i walked confident and elastic joying in the world hoping anticipating and kindly disposed towards my fellowcreatures i knew i felt my improvement my total change of character and it was with sparkling eyes that i looked up at the window where i saw mrs drummond and little sarah watching my return and reappearance after an absence of three years mrs drummond had been prepared by her husband to find a great change but still she looked for a second or two with wonder as i entered the door with my hat in my hand and paid my obeisance she extended her hand to me which i took respectfully i should not have known you jacob you have grown quite a man said she smiling sarah held back looking at me with pleased astonishment but i went up to her and she timidly accepted my hand i had left her as my superiori returned and she soon perceived that i had a legitimate right to the command it was some time before she would converse and much longer before she would become intimate but when she did so it was no longer the little girl encouraging the untutored boy by kindness or laughing at his absurdities but looking up to him with respect and affection and taking his opinion as a guide for her own i had gained the power of knowledge by the regulations of the watermans company it is necessary that every one who wishes to ply on the river on his own account should serve as an apprentice from the age of fourteen to twentyone at all events he must serve an apprenticeship for seven years and be fourteen years old before he signs the articles this apprenticeship may be served in any description of vessel which sails or works on the river whether it be barge lighter fishing smack or a boat of larger dimensions and it is not until that apprenticeship is served that he can work on his own account either in a wherry or any other craft mr drummond offered to article me on board of one of his own lighters free of all expense leaving me at liberty to change into any other vessel that i might think proper i gratefully accepted the proposal went with him to watermens hall signed the papers and thus was at the age of fourteen bound prentice to a waterman chapter six i am recommended to learn to swim and i take a friendly adviceheavy suspicion on board of the lighter and a mystery out of which mrs radcliffe would have made a romance jacob this is marables who has charge of the polly barge said mr drummond who had sent for me into his office a few days after my arrival at his house marables continued my protector addressing the man i have told you that this lad is bound prentice to the polly i expect you will look after him and treat him kindly no blows or ill treatment if he does not conduct himself well but well im sure he will let me know when you come back from your trip during this speech i was scrutinising the outward man of my future controller he was stout and wellbuilt inclining to corpulence his features remarkably good although his eyes were not large his mouth was very small and there was a goodnatured smile on his lips as he answered i never treated a cat ill master i believe not replied mr drummond but i am anxious that jacob should do well in the world and therefore let you know that he will always have my protection so long as he conducts himself properly we shall be very good friends sir ill answer for it if i may judge from the cut of his jib replied marables extending to me an immense hand as broad as it was long after this introduction mr drummond gave him some directions and left us together come and see the craft boy said marables and i followed him to the barge which was one of those fitted with a mast which lowered down and hauled up again as required she plied up and down the river as far as the nore sometimes extending her voyage still farther but that was only in the summer months she had a large cabin abaft and a cuddy forward the cabin was locked and i could not examine it this will be your berth said marables pointing to the cuddyhatch forward you will have it all to yourself the other man and i sleep abaft have you another man then yes i have jacob replied he and then muttering to himself i wish i had noti wish the barge was only between us jacob or that you had not been sent on board continued he gravely it would have been bettermuch better and he walked aft whistling in a low tone looking down sadly on the deck is your cabin large inquired i as he came forward yes large enough but i cannot show it to you nowhe has the key what the other man under you yes replied marables hastily ive been thinking jacob that you may as well remain on shore till we start you can be of no use here to this i had no objection but i often went on board during the fortnight that the barge remained and soon became very partial to marables there was a kindness about him that won me and i was distressed to perceive that he was often very melancholy what surprised me most was to find that during the first week the cabin was constantly locked and that marables had not the key it appeared so strange that he as master of the barge should be locked out of his own cabin by his inferior one day i went early on board and found not only the cabin doors open but the other man belonging to her walking up and down the deck with marables he was a welllooking tall active young man apparently not thirty with a general boldness of countenance strongly contrasted with a furtive glance of the eye he had a sort of blue smockfrock overall and the trousers which appeared below were of a finer texture than those usually worn by people of his condition this is the lad who is bound to the barge said marables jacob this is fleming so younker said fleming after casting an inquiring eye upon me you are to sail with us are you its my opinion that your room would be better than your company however if you keep your eyes open id advise you to keep your mouth shut when i dont like peoples company i sometimes give them a hoist into the streamso keep a sharp look out my joker not very well pleased with this address i answered i thought marables had charge of the craft and that i was to look to him for orders did you indeed replied fleming with a sneer i say my lad can you swim no i cant replied ii wish i could well then take my advicelearn to swim as fast as you can for i have a strong notion that one day or other i shall take you by the scruff of the neck and send you to look after your father fleming fleming pray be quiet said marables who had several times pulled him by the sleeve hes only joking jacob continued marables to me as indignant at the mention of my fathers death i was walking away to the shore over the other lighters well replied i turning round if i am to be tossed overboard its just as well to let mr drummond know that if im missing he may guess whats become of me pooh nonsense said fleming immediately altering his manner and coming to me where i stood in the barge next to them give us your hand my boy i was only trying what stuff you were made of come shake hands i wasnt in earnest i took the proffered hand and went on shore nevertheless thought i ill learn to swim for i rather think he was in earnest and i took my first lesson that day and by dint of practice soon acquired that very necessary art had it not been for the threat of fleming i probably should not have thought of it but it occurred to me that i might tumble even if i were not thrown overboard and that a knowledge of swimming would do no harm the day before the barge was to proceed down the river to sheerness with a cargo of bricks i called upon my worthy old master dominie dobiensis salve puer cried the old man who was sitting in his study verily jacob thou art come in good time i am at leisure and will give thee a lesson sit down my child the dominie opened the aeneid of virgil and commenced forthwith i was fortunate enough to please him with my offhand translation and as he closed the book i told him that i had called to bid him farewell as we started at daylight the next morning jacob said he thou hast profited well by the lessons which i have bestowed upon thee now take heed of that advice which i am now about to offer to thee there are many who will tell thee that thy knowledge is of no use for what avail can the latin tongue be to a boy on board of a lighter others may think that i have done wrong thus to instruct thee as thy knowledge may render thee vainnil exactius eruditiusque est or discontented with thy situation in life such is too often the case i grant but it is because education is not as general as it ought to be were all educated the superiority acquired or presumed upon by education would be lost and the nation would not only be wiser but happier it would judge more rightly would not condemn the measures of its rulers which at present it cannot understand and would not be led away by the clamour and misrepresentation of the disaffected but i must not digress as time is short jacob i feel that thou wilt not be spoilt by the knowledge instilled into thee but mark me parade it not for it will be vanity and make thee enemies cultivate thyself as much as thou canst but in due seasonthy duties to thy employer must be first attended tobut treasure up what thou hast and lay up more when thou canst consider it as hidden wealth which may hereafter be advantageously employed thou art now but an apprentice in a barge but what mayest thou not be jacob if thou art diligentif thou fear god and be honest i will now call to my mind some examples to stimulate thee in thy career here the dominie brought forward about forty or fifty instances from history in which people from nothing had risen to the highest rank and consideration but although i listened to them very attentively the reader will probably not regret the omission of the dominies catalogue having concluded the dominie gave me a latin testament the whole duty of man and his blessing the matron added to them a large slice of seedcake and by the time that i had returned to mr drummonds both the dominies precepts and the matrons considerate addition had been well digested it was six oclock the next morning that we cast off our fastenings and pulled into the stream the day was lovely the sun had risen above the trees which feathered their boughs down on the sloping lawns in front of the many beautiful retreats of the nobility and gentry which border the river and the lamp of day poured a flood of light upon the smooth and rapidly ebbing river the heavy dew which had fallen during the night studded the sides of the barge and glittered like necklaces of diamonds the mist and the fog had ascended except here and there where it partially concealed the landscape boats laden with the produce of the marketgardens in the vicinity were hastening down with the tide to supply the metropolis the watermen were in their wherries cleaning and mopping them out ready for their fares the smoke of the chimneys ascended in a straight line to heaven and the distant chirping of the birds in the trees added to the hilarity and lightness of heart with which i now commenced my career as an apprentice i was forward looking down the river when marables called me to take the helm while they went to breakfast he commenced giving me instructions but i cut them short by proving to him that i knew the river as well as he did pleased at the information he joined fleming who was preparing the breakfast in the cabin and i was left on the deck by myself there as we glided by every object which for years i had not seen but which was immediately recognised and welcomed as an old friend with what rapidity did former scenes connected with them flash into my memory there was the inn at the waterside where my father used to replenish the stone bottle it was just where the barge now was that i had hooked and pulled up the largest chub i had ever caught now i arrived at the spot where we had ran foul of another craft and my father with his pipe in his mouth and his take it coolly which so exasperated the other parties stood as alive before me hereyes it was hereexactly herewhere we anchored on that fatal night when i was left an orphanit was here that my father disappeared and as i looked down at the water i almost thought i could perceive it again close over him as it eddied by and it was here that the black smokethe whole scene came fresh to my memory my eyes filled with tears and for a little while i could not see to steer but i soon recovered myself the freshness of the air the bright sky overhead the busy scene before me and the necessity of attending to my duty chased away my painful remembrances and when i had passed the spot i was again cheerful and content in halfanhour i had shot putney bridge and was sweeping clear of the shallows on the reach below when marables and fleming came up how exclaimed marables have we passed the bridge why did you not call us i have shot it without help many and many a time replied i when i was but ten years old why should i call you from your breakfast but the tides are high now and the stream rapid you had better get a sweep out on the bow or we may tail on the bank well replied fleming with astonishment i had no idea that he would have been any help to us but so much the better he then spoke in a low tone to marables marables shook his head dont try it fleming it will never do so you said once about yourself replied fleming laughing i didi did replied marables clenching both his hands which at the time were crossed on his breast with a look of painful emotion but i say again dont try it nay i say more you shall not shall not replied fleming haughtily yes replied marables coolly i say shall not and ill stand by my words now jacob give me the helm and get your breakfast i gave up the helm to marables and was about to enter the cabin when fleming caught me by the arm and slewed me round i say my joker we may just as well begin as we leave off understand me that into that cabin you never enter and understand further that if ever i find you in that cabin by day or night ill break every bone in your body your berth is forward and as for your meals you may either take them down there or you may eat them on deck from what i had already witnessed i knew that for some reason or other fleming had the control over marables nevertheless i replied if mr marables says it is to be so well and good but he has charge of this barge marables made no reply he coloured up seemed very much annoyed and then looked up to the sky youll find continued fleming addressing me in a low voice that i command hereso be wise perhaps the day may come when you may walk in and out the cabin as you please but that depends upon yourself byandby when we know more of each other never fleming never interrupted marables in a firm and loud tone it shall not be fleming muttered what i could not hear and going into the cabin brought me out my breakfast which i despatched with good appetite and soon afterwards i offered to take the helm which offer was accepted by marables who retired to the cabin with fleming where i heard them converse for a long while in a low tone the tide was about threequarters ebb when the barge arrived abreast of millbank marables came on deck and taking the helm desired me to go forward and see the anchor clear for letting go anchor clear said i why we have a good hour more before we meet the flood i know that jacob as well as you do but we shall not go farther tonight be smart and see all clear whether fleming thought that it was necessary to blind me or whether it was true that they were only obeying their orders he said to marables in my hearing will you go on shore and give the letters to mr drummonds correspondent or shall i go for you you had better go replied marables carelessly and shortly after they went to dinner in the cabin fleming bringing me mine out on deck the flood tide now made and we rode to the stream having nothing to do and marables as well as fleming appearing to avoid me i brought the dominies latin testament and amused myself with reading it about a quarter of an hour before dusk fleming made his appearance to go on shore he was genteelly i may say fashionably dressed in a suit of black with a white neckcloth at first i did not recognise him so surprised was i at his alteration and my thoughts as soon as my surprise was over naturally turned upon the singularity of a man who worked in a barge under another now assuming the dress and appearance of a gentleman marables hauled up the little skiff which lay astern fleming jumped in and shoved off i watched him till i perceived him land at the stairs and then turned round to marables i cant understand all this observed i i dont suppose you can replied marables but still i could explain it if you will promise me faithfully not to say a word about it i will make that promise if you satisfy me that all is right answered i as to all being right jacob thats as may be but if i prove to you that there is no harm done to our master i suppose you will keep the secret however i must not allow you to think worse of it than it really is no ill trust to your good nature you wouldnt harm me jacob marables then told me that fleming had once been welltodo in the world and during the long illness and subsequent death of marables wife had lent him money that fleming had been very imprudent and had run up a great many debts and that the bailiffs were after him on this emergency he had applied to marables to help him and that in consequence he had received him on board of the barge where they never would think of looking for him that fleming had friends and contrived to go on shore at night to see them and get what assistance he could from them in money in the meantime his relations were trying what they could do to arrange with his creditors now said marables after this narration how could i help assisting one who has been so kind to me and what harm does it do mr drummond if fleming cant do his work or wont when we unload he pays another man himself so mr drummond is not hurt by it that may be all true replied i but i cannot imagine why i am not to enter the cabin and why he orders about here as master why you see jacob i owe him money and he allows me so much per week for the cabin by which means i pay it off do you understand now yes i understand what you have said replied i well then jacob i hope youll say nothing about it it would only harm me and do no good that depends upon flemings behaviour towards me replied i i will not be bullied and made uncomfortable by him depend upon it he has no business on board the barge thats clear and i am bound prentice to her i dont wish to hurt you and as i suppose fleming wont be long on board i shall say nothing unless he treats me ill marables then left me and i reflected upon what he had said it appeared all very probable but still i was not satisfied i resolved to watch narrowly and if anything occurred which excited more suspicions to inform mr drummond upon our return shortly afterwards marables came out again and told me i might go to bed and he would keep the deck till flemings return i assented and went down to the cuddy but i did not much like this permission it appeared to me as if he wanted to get rid of me and i laid awake turning over in my mind all that i had heard and seen about two oclock in the morning i heard the sound of oars and the skiff strike the side of the barge i did not go up but i put my head up the scuttle to see what was going on it was broad moonlight and almost as clear as day fleming threw up the painter of the skiff to marables and as he held it lifted out of the boat a blue bag apparently well filled the contents jingled as it was landed on the deck he then put out a yellow silk handkerchief full of something else and having gained the deck marables walked aft with the painter in his hand until the skiff had dropped astern where he made it fast and returned to fleming who stood close to the blue bag i heard fleming ask marables in a low voice if i were in bed and an answer given in the affirmative i dropped my head immediately that i might not be discovered and turned into my bedplace i was restless for a long while thought upon thought surmise upon surmise conjecture upon conjecture and doubt upon doubt occupied my brain until at last i went fast asleepso fast that i did not wake until summoned by fleming i rose and when i came on deck found that the anchor had been weighed more than two hours and that we were past all the bridges why jacob my man youve had a famous nap said fleming with apparent good humour now go aft and get your breakfast it has been waiting for you this halfhour by the manner of fleming i took it for granted that marables had acquainted him with our conversation and indeed from that time during our whole trip fleming treated me with kindness and familiarity the veto had not however been taken off the cabin which i never attempted to enter chapter seven the mystery becomes more and more interesting and i determine to find it outprying after things locked up i am locked up myselffleming proves to me that his advice was good when he recommended me to learn to swim on our arrival off the medway i had just gone down to bed and was undressing when i heard fleming come on deck and haul up the boat i looked up the hatchway it was very dark but i could perceive marables hand him the bag and handkerchief with which he pulled on shore he did not return until the next morning at daylight when i met him as he came up the side well jacob said he youve caught me ive been on shore to see my sweetheart but you boys ought to know nothing about these things make the boat fast theres a good lad when we were one night discharging our cargo which was for government i heard voices alongside from habit the least noise now awoke me a boat striking the side was certain so to do it was then about twelve oclock i looked up the hatchway perceived two men come on board and enter the cabin with packages they remained there about ten minutes and then escorted to the side by fleming left the barge when the barge was cleared we hauled off to return and in three days were again alongside of mr drummonds wharf the kindness both of marables and of fleming had been very great they lived in a style very superior to what they could be expected to do and i fared well in consequence on our arrival at the wharf marables came up to me and said now jacob as i have honestly told you the secret i hope you wont ruin me by saying a word to mr drummond i had before made up my mind to say nothing to my master until my suspicions were confirmed and i therefore gave my promise but i had also resolved to impart my suspicions as well as what i had seen to the old dominie on the third day after our arrival i walked out to the school and acquainted him with all that had passed and asked him for his advice jacob said he thou hast done well but thou mightest have done better hadst thou not given thy promise which is sacred i would have taken thee to mr drummond that thou mightest impart the whole instanter i like it not evil deeds are done in darkness noctem peccatis et fraudibus objice nubem still as thou sayest nought is yet proved watch therefore jacobwatch carefully over thy masters interests and the interests of society at large it is thy duty i may say vigilare noctesque diesque it may be as marables hath saidand all may be accounted for still i say be careful and be honest i followed the suggestions of the dominie we were soon laden with another cargo of bricks to be delivered at the same place and proceeded on our voyage marables and fleming finding that i had not said a word to mr drummond treated me with every kindness fleming once offered me money which i refused saying that i had no use for it i was on the best terms with them at the same time that i took notice of all that passed without offering a remark to excite their suspicions but not to be too prolix it will suffice to say that we made many trips during several months and that during that time i made the following observationsthat fleming went on shore at night at certain places taking with him bags and bundles that he generally returned with others which were taken into the cabin that sometimes people came off at night and remained some time in the cabin with him and that all this took place when it was supposed that i was asleep the cabin was invariably locked when the barge was lying at the wharfs if fleming was on shore and at no time was i permitted to enter it marables was a complete cipher in flemings hands who ordered everything as he pleased and in the conversations which took place before me with much less restraint than at first there appeared to be no idea of flemings leaving us as i felt convinced that there was no chance of discovery without further efforts on my part and my suspicions increasing daily i resolved upon running some hazard my chief wish was to get into the cabin and examine its contents but this was not easy and would in all probability be a dangerous attempt one night i came on deck in my shirt we were at anchor off rotherhithe it was a dark night with a drizzling rain i was hastening below when i perceived a light still burning in the cabin and heard the voices of marables and fleming i thought this a good opportunity and having no shoes walked softly on the wet deck to the cabindoor which opened forward and peeped through the crevices marables and fleming were sitting opposite each other at the little table there were some papers before them and they were dividing some money marables expostulated at his share not being sufficient and fleming laughed and told him he had earned no more fearful of being discovered i made a silent retreat and gained my bed it was well that i had made the resolution for just as i was putting my head below the hatch and drawing it over the scuttle the door was thrown open and fleming came out i pondered over this circumstance and the remark of fleming that marables had not earned any more and i felt convinced that the story told me by marables relative to fleming was all false this conviction stimulated me more than ever to discover the secret and many and many a night did i watch with a hope of being able to examine the cabin but it was to no purpose either fleming or marables was always on board i continued to report to the dominie all i had discovered and he agreed at last that it was better that i should not say anything to mr drummond until there was the fullest proof of the nature of their proceedings the cabin was now the sole object of my thoughts and many were the schemes resolved in my mind to obtain an entrance fatima never coveted admission to the dreadful chamber of bluebeard as i did to ascertain the secrets of this hidden receptacle one night fleming had quitted the barge and i ascended from my dormitory marables was on deck sitting upon the watercask with his elbow resting on the gunwale his hand supporting his head as if in deep thought the cabindoors were closed but the light still remained in it i watched for some time and perceiving that marables did not move walked gently up to him he was fast asleep i waited for some little time alongside of him at last he snored it was an opportunity not to be lost i crept to the cabindoor it was not locked although i did not fear the wrath of marables in case of discovery as i did that of fleming it was still with a beating heart and a tremulous hand that i gently opened the door pausing before i entered to ascertain if marables were disturbed he moved not and i entered closing the door after me i caught up the light and held it in my hand as i hung over the table on each side were the two bedplaces of marables and fleming which i had before then had many a partial glimpse of in front of the two bedplaces were two lockers to sit down upon i tried themthey were not fastthey contained their clothes at the after part of the cabin were three cupboards i opened the centre one it contained crockery glass and knives and forks i tried the one on the starboard side it was locked but the key was in it i turned it gently but being a good lock it snapped loud i paused in fearbut marables still slept the cupboard had three shelves and every shelf was loaded with silver spoons forks and every variety of plate mixed with watches bracelets and ornaments of every description there was i perceived a label on each with a peculiar mark wishing to have an accurate survey and encouraged by my discovery i turned to the cupboard opposite on the larboard side and i opened it it contained silk handkerchiefs in every variety lace veils and various other articles of value on the lower shelf were laid three pairs of pistols i was now satisfied and closing the last cupboard which had not been locked was about to retreat when i recollected that i had not relocked the first cupboard and that they might not by finding it open suspect my visit i turned the key it made a louder snap than before i heard marables start from his slumber on deck in a moment i blew out the lamp and remained quiet marables got up took a turn or two looked at the cabin doors which were shut and opened them a little perceiving that the lamp had as he thought gone out he shut them again and to my consternation turned the key there i was locked up until the arrival of flemingthen to be left to his mercy i hardly knew how to act at last i resolved upon calling to marables as i dreaded his anger less than flemings then it occurred to me that marables might come in feel for the lamp to relight it and that as he came in on one side of the cabin i might in the dark escape by the other this all but forlorn hope prevented me for some time from applying to him at last i made up my mind that i would and ran from the locker to call through the door when i heard the sound of oars i paused againloiteredthe boat was alongside and i heard fleming jump upon the deck quick said he to marables as he came to the cabindoor and tried to open it weve no time to losewe must get up the sacks and sink everything two of them have peached and the fence will be discovered he took the keys from marables and opened the door i had replaced the lamp upon the table fleming entered took a seat on the locker on the larboard side and felt for the lamp marables followed him and sat down on the starboard lockerescape was impossible with a throbbing heart i sat in silence watching my fate in the meantime fleming had taken out of his pocket his phosphorus match box i heard the tin top pulled openeven the slight rustling of the one match selected was perceived another second it was withdrawn from the bottle and a wild flame of light illumined the deck cabin and discovered me to their view staggered at my appearance the match fell from flemings hand and all was dark as before but there was no more to be gained by darknessi had been discovered jacob cried marables will not live to tell the tale added fleming with a firm voice as he put another match into the bottle and then relighted the lamp come said fleming fiercely out of the cabin immediately i prepared to obey him fleming went out and i was following him round his side of the table when marables interposed stop fleming what is that you mean to do silence him retorted fleming but not murder him surely cried marables trembling from head to foot you will not dare not do that what is it that i dare not do marables but it is useless to talk it is now his life or mine one must be sacrificed and i will not die yet to please him you shall notby god fleming you shall not cried marables seizing hold of my other arm and holding me tight i added my resistance to that of marables when fleming perceiving that we should be masters took a pistol from his pocket and struck marables a blow on the head which rendered him senseless throwing away the pistol he dragged me out of the cabin i was strong but he was very powerful my resistance availed me nothing by degrees he forced me to the side of the barge and lifting me in his arms dashed me into the dark and rapidly flowing water it was fortunate for me that the threat of fleming upon our first meeting had induced me to practise swimming and still more fortunate that i was not encumbered with any other clothes than my shirt in which i had come on deck as it was i was carried away by the tide for some time before i could rise and at such a distance that fleming who probably watched did not perceive that i came up again still i had but little hopes of saving myself in a dark night and at nearly a quarter of a mile from shore i struggled to keep myself afloat when i heard the sound of oars a second or two more and i saw them over my head i grasped at and seized the last as the others passed me crying help what the devil oars my men heres somebody overboard cried the man whose oar i had seized they stopped pulling he dragged in his oar till he could lay hold of me and then they hauled me into the boat i was exhausted with cold and my energetic struggles in the water and it was not until they had wrapped me up in a greatcoat and poured some spirits down my throat that i could speak they inquired to which of the craft i belonged the folly barge the very one we are searching for where about is she my lad i directed them the boat was a large wherry pulling six oars belonging to the river police the officer in the stern sheets who steered her then said how came you overboard i was thrown overboard replied i by a man called fleming the name he goes by cried the officer give way my lads theres murder it appears as well as other charges in a quarter of an hour we were alongsidethe officer and four men sprang out of the boat leaving the other two with directions for me to remain in the boat cold and miserable as i was i was too much interested in the scene not to rise up from the stern sheets and pay attention to what passed when the officer and his men gained the deck they were met by fleming in the advance and marables about a yard or two behind whats all this cried fleming boldly are you river pirates come to plunder us not exactly replied the officer but we are just come to overhaul you deliver up the key of your cabin continued he after trying the door and finding it locked with all my heart if you prove yourselves authorised to search replied fleming but youll find no smuggled spirits here i can tell you marables hand them the key i see that they belong to the river guard marables who had never spoken handed the key to the officer who opening a dark lanthorn went down into the cabin and proceeded in his search leaving two of the men to take charge of fleming and marables but his search was in vain he could find nothing and he came out on deck well said fleming sarcastically have you made a seizure wait a little said the officer how many men have you in this barge you see them replied fleming yes but you have a boy where is he we have no boy replied fleming two men are quite enough for this craft still i ask you what has become of the boy for a boy was on your decks this afternoon if there was one i presume he has gone on shore again answer me another question which of you threw him overboard at this query of the officer fleming started while marables cried out it was not i i would have saved him o that the boy were here to prove it i am here marables said i coming on deck and i am witness that you tried to save me until you were struck senseless by that ruffian fleming who threw me overboard that i might not give evidence as to the silver and gold which i found in the cabin and which i overheard him tell you must be put into sacks and sunk as two of the men had peached fleming when he saw me turned round as if not to look at me his face i could not see but after remaining a few seconds in that position he held out his hands in silence for the handcuffs which the officer had already taken out of his pocket marables on the contrary sprang forward as soon as i had finished speaking and caught me in his arms my fine honest boy i thank godi thank god all that he has said is true sir you will find the goods sunk astern and the buoyrope to them fastened to the lower pintle of the rudder jacob thank god you are safe i little thought to see you again there sir continued he to the officer holding out his hands i deserve it all i had not strength of mind enough to be honest the handcuffs were put on marables as well as on fleming and the officer allowing me time to go down and put on my clothes hauled up the sacks containing the valuables and leaving two hands in charge of the barge rowed ashore with us all in the boat it was then about three oclock in the morning and i was very glad when we arrived at the receivinghouse and i was permitted to warm myself before the fire as soon as i was comfortable i laid down on the bench and fell fast asleep chapter eight one of the ups and downs of lifeup before the magistrates then down the river again in the lighterthe tomsa light heart upon two sticksreceive my first lesson in singingour lighter wellmanned with two boys and a fraction i did not awake the next morning till roused by the police who brought us up before the magistrates the crowd that followed appeared to make no distinction between the prisoners and the witness and remarks not very complimentary and to me very annoying were liberally made hes a young hand for such work cried one theres gallows marked in his face observed another to whom when i turned round to look at him i certainly could have returned the compliment the station was not far from the magistrates office and we soon arrived the principal officer went into the inner room and communicated with the magistrates before they came out and took their seats on the bench where is jacob faithful my lad do you know the nature of an oath i answered in the affirmative the oath was administered and my evidence taken down it was then read over to the prisoners who were asked if they had anything to say in their defence fleming who had sent for his lawyer was advised to make no answer marables quietly replied that all the boy had said was quite true recollect said the magistrate we cannot accept you as kings evidence that of the boy is considered sufficient i did not intend that you should replied marables i only want to ease my conscience not to try for my pardon they were then committed for trial and led away to prison i could not help going up to marables and shaking his hand before he was led away he lifted up his two arms for he was still handcuffed and wiped his eyes saying let this be a warning to you jacobnot that i think you need it but still i once was honest as yourselfand look at me now and he cast his eyes down sorrowfully upon his fettered wrists they quitted the room fleming giving me a look which was very significant of what my chance would be if ever i fell into his clutches we must detain you my lad observed one of the magistrates without you can procure a sufficient bail for your appearance as witness on the trial i replied that i knew of no one except my master mr drummond and my schoolmaster and had no means of letting them know of my situation the magistrate then directed the officer to go down by the first brentford coach acquaint mr drummond with what had passed and that the lighter would remain in charge of the river police until he could send hands on board of her and i was allowed to sit down on the bench behind the bar it was not until past noon that mr drummond accompanied by the dominie made his appearance to save time the magistrates gave them my deposition to read they put in bail and i was permitted to leave the court we went down by the coach but as they went inside and i was out i had not many questions asked until my arrival at mr drummonds house when i gave them a detailed account of all that had happened proh deus exclaimed the dominie when i had finished my story what an escape how narrowly as propertius hath it femininely eripitur nobis jumpridem carus puer well was it that thou hadst learnt to swimverily thou must have struggled lustily pugnat in adversas ire natator aquas yea lustily for thy life child now god be praised but mr drummond was anxious that the lighter should be brought back to the wharf he therefore gave me my dinner for i had eaten nothing that day and then despatched me in a boat with two men to bring her up the river the next morning we arrived and mr drummond not having yet selected any other person to take her in charge i was again some days on shore dividing my time between the dominie and mr drummonds where i was always kindly treated not only by him but also by his wife and his little daughter sarah a master for the lighter was soon found and as i passed a considerable time under his orders i must describe him particularly he had served the best part of his life on board a manofwar had been in many general and single actions and at the battle of trafalgar had wound up his servitude with the loss of both his legs and an outpension from the greenwich hospital which he preferred to being received upon the establishment as he had a wife and child since that time he had worked on the river he was very active and broadshouldered and had probably before he lost his legs been a man of at least five feet eleven or six feet high but as he found that he could keep his balance better upon short stumps than long ones he had reduced his wooden legs to about eight inches in length which with his square body gave him the appearance of a huge dwarf he bore and i will say most deservedly an excellent character his temper was always cheerful and he was a little inclined to drink but the principal feature in him was lightness of heart he was always singing his voice was very fine and powerful when in the service he used to be summoned to sing to the captain and officers and was the delight of the forecastle his memory was retentive and his stock of songs incredible at the same time he seldom or ever sang more than one or two stanzas of a song in the way of quotation or if apt to what was going on often altering the words to suit the occasion he was accompanied by his son tom a lad of my own age as merry as his father and who had a good treble voice and a good deal of humour he would often take the song up from his father with words of his own putting in with ready wit and good tune we three composed the crew of the lighter and as there had already been considerable loss from demurrage were embarked as soon as they arrived the name of the father was tom beazeley but he was always known on the river as old tom or as some more learned wag had christened him the merman on two sticks as soon as we had put our traps on board as old tom called them he received his orders and we cast off from the wharf the wind was favourable young tom was as active as a monkey and as full of tricks his father took the helm while we two assisted by a dog of the small newfoundland breed which tom had taught to take a rope in his teeth and be of no small service to two boys in bowsing on a tackle made sail upon the lighter and away we went while old toms strain might be heard from either shore loose loose every sail to the breeze the course of the vessel improve ive done with the toil of the seas ye sailors im bound to my love tom you beggar is the bundle ready for your mother we must drop the skiff jacob at battersea reach and send the clothes on shore for the old woman to wash or therell be no clean shirts for sunday shove in your shirts jacob the old woman wont mind that she used to wash for the mess clap on both of you and get another pull at those haulyards thatll do my bantams hoist hoist every sail to the breeze come shipmates and join in the song lets drink while the barge cuts the seas to the gale that may drive her along tom wheres my pot of tea come my boy we must pipe to breakfast jacob theres a rope towing overboard now tom hand me my tea and ill steer her with one hand drink with the other and as for the legs the less we say about them the better no glory i covet no riches i want ambition is nothing to me but one thing i beg of kind heaven to grant toms treble chimed in handing him the pot for breakfast a good cup of tea silence you seacook how dare you shove in your penny whistle hows tide tom three quarters ebb no it ant you thief how is it jacob about half i think and youre right what water have we down here on the side you must give the point a wide berth replied i the shoals runs out thanky boy so i thought but wasnt sure and then old tom burst out in a beautiful air trust not too much your own opinion when your vessels under weigh let good advice still bear dominion thats a compass will not stray old tom is that you hallooed a man from another barge yes whats left of me my hearty youll not fetch the bridges this tidetheres a strong breeze right up the reaches below never mind well do all we can if unassailed by squall or shower wafted by the gentle gales lets not lose the favouring hour while success attends our sails bravo old tom why dont the boys get the lines out for all the fishes are listening for you cried the man as the barges were parted by the wind and tide i did once belong to a small craft called the anon observed old tom and they say as how the story was that that chap could make the fish follow him just when he pleased i know that when we were in the north sea the shoals of seals would follow the ship if you whistled but these brutes have earsnow fish havnt got none oh well do i remember that cold dreary land here the northern light in the winters night shone bright on its snowy strand jacob have you finished your breakfast here take the helm while i and tom put the craft a little into applepie order old tom then stumped forward followed by his son and the newfoundland dog who appeared to consider himself as one of the most useful personages on board after coiling down the ropes and sweeping the decks they went into the cabin to make their little arrangements a good lock that tom cried the father turning the key of the cupboard i recollected it and that its snapping so loud was the occasion of my being tossed overboard old tom continued i say tom you wont be able to open that cupboard so ill put the sugar and the grog into it you scamp it goes too fast when youre pursers steward for grog is our larboard and starboard our mainmast our mizzen our log on shore or at sea or when harbourd the mariners compass is grog but it arnt a compass to steer steady by father replied tom then dont you have nothing to do with it tom i only takes a little father because you maynt take too much thanky for nothing when do i ever take too much you scamp not too much for a man standing on his own pins but too much for a man on two broomsticks stop your jaw mr tom or ill unscrew one of the broomsticks and lay it over your shoulders before its out of the socket ill give you legbail what will you do then father catch you when i can tom as the spider takes the fly whats the good o that when you cant bear malice for ten minutes very true tom then thank your stars that you have two good legs and that your poor father has none i very often do thank my stars and thats the truth of it but whats the use of being angry about a drop of rum or a handful of sugar because you takes more than your allowance well do you take less then all will be right and why should i take less pray because youre only half a man you havent any legs to provide for as i have now i tell you tom thats the very reason why i should have more to comfort my old body for the loss of them when you lost your legs you lost your ballast father and therefore you mustnt carry too much sail or youll topple overboard some dark night if i drink the grog its all for your good you see youre a dutiful son in that way at all events and a sweet child as far as sugar goes but jacob is to sleep in the cabin with me and youll shake your blanket forward now that i consider quite unnatural why part father and son its not that exactly its only parting son and the grog bottle thats just as cruel why part two such good friends cause tom hes too strong for you and floors you sometimes well but i forgives him its all done in good humour tom youre a wag but you wag your tongue to no purpose liquor aint good for a boy like you and it grows upon you well dont i grow too we grow together youll grow faster without it ive no wish to be a tall man cut short like you if i hadnt been a tall man my breath would have been cut short for ever the ball which took my legs would have cut you right in half and the ball that would take your head off would whistle over mine so there we are equal again and theres the grog fast replied old tom turning the key and putting it into his pocket thats a stopper over all so now well go on deck i have narrated this conversation as it will give the reader a better idea of tom and his way of treating his father tom was fond of his father and although mischievous and too fond of drinking when he could obtain liquor was not disobedient or vicious we had nearly reached battersea fields when they returned on deck do you know jacob how the parish of battersea came into the possession of those fields no i do not well then ill tell you it was because the battersea people were more humane and charitable than their neighbours there was a time when those fields were of no value now theyre worth a mint of money they say the body of a poor devil who was drowned in the river was washed on shore on those banks and none of the parishes would be at the expense of burying it the battersea people though they had least right to be called upon would not allow the poor fellows corpse to be lying on the mud and they went to the expense now when the fields became of value the other parishes were ready enough to claim them but the case was tried and as it was proved that battersea had buried the body the fields were decided to belong to that parish so they were well paid for their humanity and they deserved it mr drummond says you know the river well jacob i was born on it yes so i heard and all about your father and mothers death i was telling tom of it because hes too fond of bowsing up his jib well father theres no occasion to remind jacob the tear is in his eye already replied tom with consideration i wish you never had any other drop in your eyebut never mind jacob i didnt think of what i was saying look ye dye see that little house with the two chimneysthats mine and theres my old womani wonder what shes about just now old tom paused for a while with his eyes fixed on the object and then burst out ive crossed the wide waters ive trod the lone strand ive triumphed in battle ive lighted the brand ive borne the loud thunder of death oer the foam fame riches neer found themyet still found a home tom boy haul up the skiff and paddle on shore with the bundle ask the old woman how she is and tell her im hearty tom was in the boat in a moment and pulling lustily for the shore that makes me recollect when i returned to my mother ater the first three years of my sea service i borrowed the skiff from the skipperi was in a greenlandman my first ship and pulled ashore to my mothers cottage under the cliff i thought the old soul would have died with joy here old tom was silent brushed a tear from his eye and as usual commenced a strain sotto voce why whats that to you if my eyes im a wiping a tear is a pleasure dye see in its way how miserable continued he after another pause the poor thing was when i would go to seahow she begged and prayedboys have no feeling thats sartin o bairn dinna leave me to gang far away o bairn dinna leave me yere a that i hae think on a mither the wind and the wave a mither set on ye her feet in the grave however she got used to it at last as the woman said when she skinned the ells toms a good boy jacob but not steady as they say you are his mother spoils him and i cant bear to be cross to him neither for his hearts in the right place after all theres the old woman shaking her dishclout at us as a signal i wish i had gone on shore myself but i cant step into these paperbuilt little boats without my timber toes going through at the bottom chapter nine the two toms take to protocollingtreaty of peace ratified between the belligerent partieslots of songs and supperthe largest mess of roast meat upon record tom then shoved off the skiff when halfway between the lighter and the shore while his mother stood watching us he lay on his oars tom tom cried his mother shaking her fist at him as he stooped down his head if you do tom tom tom cried his father shaking his fist also if you dare tom but tom was not within reach of either party and he dragged a bottle out of the basket which his mother had entrusted to him and putting it to his mouth took a long swig thats enough tom screamed his mother from the shore thats too much you rascal cried his father from the barge neither admonition was however minded by tom who took what he considered his allowance and then very coolly pulled alongside and handed up the basket and bundle of clean clothes on deck tom then gave the boats painter to his father who i perceived intended to salute him with the end of it as soon as he came up but tom was too knowing he surged the boat ahead and was on deck and forward before his father could stump up to him the main hatch was open and tom put that obstacle between his father and himself before he commenced his parley whats the matter father said tom smiling and looking at me matter you scamp how dare you touch the bottle the bottlethe bottles there as good as ever the grog is what i meanhow dare you drink it i was halfway between my mother and you and so i drank success and long life to you both aint that being a very dutiful son i wish i had my legs back again you rascal you wish you had the grog back again you mean father you have to choose betweenfor if you had the grog youd keep your legs for the matter of drinking the grog you scamp you seem determined to stand in my shoes well shoes are of no use to you now fatherwhy shouldnt i why dont you trust me if you hadnt locked the cupboard i wouldnt have helped myself and tom whose bootlace was loose stooped down to make it fast old tom who was still in wrath thought this a good opportunity as his sons head was turned the other way to step over the bricks with which as i before said the lighter had been laden level with the main hatchway and take his son by surprise tom who had no idea of this manoeuvre would certainly have been captured but fortunately for him one of the upper bricks turned over and let his fathers wooden leg down between two of the piles where it was jammed fast old tom attempted to extricate himself but could not tom tom come here cried he and pull me out not i replied tom jacob jacob come here tom run and take the helm not i replied tom jacob never mind the helm shell drift all right for a minute cried old tom come and help me but i had been so amused with the scene and having a sort of feeling for young tom that i declared it impossible to leave the helm without her going on the banks i therefore remained wishing to see in what way the two toms would get out of their respective scrapes confound these tom you scoundrel am i to stick here all day no father i dont suppose you will i shall help you directly well then why dont you do it because i must come to terms you dont think id help myself to a thrashing do you i wont thrash you tom shiver my timbers if i do theyre in a fair way of being shivered as it is i think now father were both even hows that why you clapped a stopper over all on me this morning and now youve got one on yourself well then take off mine and ill take off yours if i unlock your leg youll unlock the cupboard yes and you promise me a stiff one after dinner yes yes as stiff as i stand here no that will be too much for it would set me fast i only like it about halfandhalf as i took it just now tom who was aware that his father would adhere to his agreement immediately went to his assistance and throwing out some of the upper bricks released him from his confinement when old tom was once more on deck and on his legs he observed its an ill wind that blows nobody good the loss of my leg has been the saving of you many a time mr tom it was now time to anchor as we were meeting the flood tom who officiated as cook served up the dinner which was ready and we were all very pleasant tom treating his father with perfect confidence as we had not to weigh again for some hours our repast was prolonged and old tom having fulfilled his promise to his son of a stiff one took one or two himself and became very garrulous come spin us a good yarn father weve nothing to do and jacob will like to hear you well then so i will answered he what shall it be about fire and water of course replied tom well then ill tell you something about both since you wish it how i came into his majestys sarvice through fire and how the officer who pressed me went out of it through water i was still prentice and wanted about three months to sarve my time when of course i should no longer be protected from sarving the king when the ship i was in sailed up the baltic with a cargo of bullocks we had at least two hundred on board tied up on platforms on every deck with their heads close to the sides and all their sterns looking inboard they were fat enough when they were shipped but soon dwindled away the weather was very bad and the poor creatures rolled against each other and slipped about in a way that it pitied you to see them however they were stowed so thick that they held one another up which proved of service to them in the heavy gales which tossed the ship about like a pea in a rattle we had joined a large convoy and were entering the sound when as usual it fell calm and out came the danish gunboats to attack us the menofwar who had charge of the convoy behaved nobly but still they were becalmed and many of us were a long way astern our ship was pretty well up but she was too far inshore and the danes made a dash at us with the hope of making a capture the menofwar seeing what the enemy were about sent boats to beat them off but it was too late to prevent them boarding which they did not wishing to peep through the bars of the gaol at copenhagen we left the ship in our boats on one side just as the danes boarded on the other and pulled towards the menofwars armed boats coming to our assistance the menofwars boats pulled right for the ship to retake her which they did certainly but not before the enemy had set fire to the vessel and had then pulled off towards another seeing this the menofwars boats again gave chase to the danes leaving us to extinguish the flames which were now bursting out fore and aft and climbing like fiery serpents up to the main catharprings we soon found that it was impossible we remained as long as the heat and smoke would permit us and then we were obliged to be off but i shall never forget the roaring and moaning of the poor animals who were then roasting alive it was a cruel thing of the danes to fire a vessel full of these poor creatures some had broken loose and were darting up and down the decks goring others and tumbling down the hatchways others remained trembling or trying to snuff up a mouthful of fresh air amongst the smoke but the struggling and bellowing as the fire caught the vessel fore and aft and was grilling two hundred poor creatures at once was at last shocking and might have been heard for a mile we did all we could i cut the throats of a dozen but they kicked and struggled so much falling down upon and treading you under their feet and one lay upon me and i expected to be burnt with them for it was not until i was helped that i got clear of the poor animal so we stayed as long as we could and then left them to their fate and the smell of burnt meat as we shoved off was as horrible as the cries and wailings of the poor beasts themselves the menofwars boats returned having chased away the danes and very kindly offered us all a ship as we had lost our own so that you see that by fire i was forced into his majestys sarvice now the boat that took us belonged to one of the frigates who had charge of the convoy and the lieutenant who commanded the boat was a swearing tearing sort of a chap who lived as if his life was to last for ever after i was taken on board the captain asked me if i would enter and i thought that i might as well sarve the king handsomely so i volunteered its always the best thing to do when youre taken and cant help yourself for you are more trusted than a pressed man who is obstinate i liked the sarvice from the firstthe captain was not a particular man according to some peoples ideas of the sarvice she wasnt in quite manofwar fashion but she was a happy ship and the men would have followed and fought for the captain to the last drop of their blood thats the sort of ship for me ive seen cleaner decks but i never saw merrier hearts the only one of the officers disliked by the men was the lieutenant who pressed me he had a foul mouth and no discretion and as for swearing it was really terrible to hear the words which came out of his mouth i dont mind an oath rapped out in the heat of the moment but he invented his oaths when he was cool and let them out in his rage we were returning home after having seen the convoy safe when we met with a gale of wind in our teeth one of the very worst i ever fell in with it had been blowing hard from the south west and then shifted to the north west and made a cross sea which was tremendous now the frigate was a very old vessel and although they had often had her into dock and repaired her below they had taken no notice of her upper works which were as rotten as a medlar i think it was about three bells in the middle watch when the wind was howling through the rigging for we had no canvas on her cept a staysail and trysail when the staysail sheet went and she broachedto afore they could prevent her the lieutenant i spoke of had the watch and his voice was heard through the roaring of the wind swearing at the men to haul down the staysail that we might bend on the sheet and set it right again when she having i said broachedto a waveay a wave as high as the maintop almost took the frigate right on her broadside and the bulwarks of the quarterdeck being as i said quite rotten cut them off clean level with the main chains sweeping them and guns and men all overboard together the mizzenmast went but the mainmast held on and i was under its lee at the time and was saved by clinging on like a nigger while for a minute i was under the water which carried almost all away with it to leeward as soon as the water passed over me i looked up and around meit was quite awful the quarterdeck was cut off as with a knifenot a soul left there that i could see no man at the wheelmizzenmast goneskylights washed awaywaves making a clear breach and no defence boats washed away from the quartersall silent on deck but plenty of noise below and on the maindeck for the ship was nearly full of water and all below were hurrying up in their shirts thinking that we were going down at last the captain crawled up and clung by the stancheons followed by the first lieutenant and the officers and by degrees all was quiet the ship was cleared and the hands were turned up to muster under the halfdeck there were fortyseven men who did not answer to their namesthey had been summoned to answer for their lives poor fellows and there was also the swearing lieutenant not to be found well at last we got the hands on deck and put her before the wind scudding under bare poles as we went aft to the taffrail the bulwark of which still remained with about six feet of the quarterdeck bulwark on each side we observed something clinging to the sternladder dipping every now and then into the sea as it rose under her counter and assisted the wind in driving her before the gale we soon made it out to be a man and i went down slipped a bowling knot over the poor fellow and with some difficulty we were both hauled up again it proved to be the lieutenant who had been washed under the counter and clung to the sternladder and had thus miraculously been preserved it was a long while before he came to and he never did any duty the whole week we were out till we got into yarmouth roads indeed he hardly ever spoke a word to any one but seemed to be always in serious thought when we arrived he gave his commission to the captain and went on shore went to school again they say bore up for a parson and for all i know hell preach somewhere next sunday so you see water drove him out of the sarvice and fire forced me in theres a yarn for you jacob i like it very much replied i and now father give us a whole song and none of your little bits old tom broke out with the death of nelson in a style that made the tune and words ring in my ears for the whole evening the moon was up before the tide served and we weighed our anchor old tom steering while his son was preparing supper and i remaining forward keeping a sharp lookout that we did not run foul of anything it was a beautiful night and as we passed through the several bridges the city appeared as if it were illuminated from the quantity of gas throwing a sort of halo of light over the tops of the buildings which occasionally marked out the main streets from the general dark massold toms voice was still occasionally heard as the scene brought to his remembrance his variety of song for the murmur of thy lip love comes sweetly unto me as the sound of oars that dip love at moonlight on the sea i never was more delighted than when i heard these snatches of different songs poured forth in such melody from old toms lips the notes floating along the water during the silence of the night i turned aft to look at him his face was directed upwards looking on the moon which glided majestically through the heavens silvering the whole of the landscape the water was smooth as glass and the rapid tide had swept us clear of the ranges of ships in the pool both banks of the river were clear when old tom again commenced the moon is up her silver beam shines bower and grove and mountain over a flood of radiance heaven doth seem to light thee maiden to thy lover jacob how does the bluffnob bear on the starboard bow yesbroad on the bow youd better keep up half a point the tide sweeps us fast very true jacob look out and say when steady it is boy if oer her orb a cloud should rest tis but thy cheeks soft blush to cover he waits to clasp thee to his breast the moon is upgo meet thy lover tom what have you got for supper boy what is that frizzing in your fryingpan smells good anyhow yes and i expect will taste good too however you look after the moon father and leave me and the fryingpan to play our parts while i sing mine i suppose boy the moon is up round beautys shine loves pilgrims bend at vesper hour earth breathes to heaven and looks divine and lovers hearts confess her power old tom stopped and the fryingpan frizzled on sending forth an odour which if not grateful to heaven was peculiarly so to us mortals hungry with the fresh air how do we go now jacob steady and alls right but we shall be met with the wind next reach and had better brail up the mainsail go then tom and help jacob i cant leave the ingons onions father not if the lighter tumbled overboard it would bring more tears in my eyes to spoil them now that they are frying so merrily than they did when i was cutting them up besides the liver would be as black as the bends clap the fryingpan down on deck tom and brail the sail up with jacob theres a good boy you can give it another shake or two afterwards guide on my bark how sweet to rove with such a beaming eye above thats right my boys belay all that now to our stations jacob on the lookout tom to his fryingpan and i to the helm no sound is heard to break the spell except the waters gentle swell while midnight like a mimic day shines on to guide our moonlight way well the moons a beautiful creaturegod bless her how often have we longed for her in the dark winter channelcruising when the waves were flying over the eddystone and trying in their malice to put out the light i dont wonder at people making songs to the moon nor at my singing them well anchor when we get down the next reach we swept the next reach with the tide which was now slacking fast our anchor was dropped and we all went to supper and to bed i have been particular in describing the first day of my being on board with my new shipmates as it may be taken as a sample of our every day life tom and his father fighting and making friends cooking singing and spinning yarns still i shall have more scenes to describe our voyage was made we took in a return cargo and arrived at the proprietors wharf when i found that i could not proceed with them the next voyage as the trial of fleming and marables was expected to come on in a few days the lighter therefore took in another cargo and sailed without me mr drummond as usual giving me the run of his house chapter ten i help to hang my late bargemate for his attempt to drown meone good turn deserves anotherthe subject suddenly dropped at newgatea yarn in the law linewith due precautions and preparations the dominie makes his first voyageto gravesend it was on the th of november if i recollect rightly that fleming and marables were called up to trial at the old bailey and i was in the court with mr drummond and the dominie soon after ten oclock after the judge had taken his seat as their trial was first on the list they were ushered in they were both clean and well dressed in fleming i could perceive little difference he was pale but resolute but when i looked at marables i was astonished mr drummond did not at first recognise himhe had fallen away from seventeen stone to at the most thirteenhis clothes hung loosely about himhis ruddy cheeks had vanishedhis nose was becoming sharp and his full round face had been changed to an oblong still there remained that natural goodhumoured expression in his countenance and the sweet smile played upon his lips his eyes glanced fearfully round the courthe felt his disgraceful situationthe colour mounted to his temples and forehead and he then became again pale as a sheet casting down his eyes as if desirous to see no more after the indictment had been read over the prisoners were asked by the clerk whether they pleaded guilty or not guilty not guilty replied fleming in a bold voice john marablesguilty or not guilty guilty replied marablesguilty my lord and he covered his face with his hands fleming was indicted on three countsan assault with intent to murder having stolen goods in his possession and for a burglary in a dwellinghouse on such a date but i understand that they had nearly twenty more charges against him had these failed marables was indicted for having been an accessary to the last charge as receiver of stolen goods the counsel for the crown who opened the trial stated that fleming alias barkett alias wenn with many more aliases had for a long while been at the head of the most notorious gang of thieves which had infested the metropolis for many years that justice had long been in search of him but that he had disappeared and it had been supposed that he had quitted the kingdom to avoid the penalties of the law to which he had subjected himself by his enormities it appeared however that he had taken a step which not only blinded the officers of the police but at the same time had enabled the gang to carry on their depredations with more impunity than ever he had concealed himself in a lighter on the river and appearing in her as one diligently performing his duty and earning his livelihood as an honest man had by such means been enabled to extend his influence the number of his associates and his audacious schemes the principal means of detection in cases of burglary was by advertising the goods and the great difficulty on the part of such miscreants was to obtain a ready sale for themthe receivers of stolen goods being aware that the thieves were at their mercy and must accept what was offered now to obviate these difficulties fleming had as we before observed concealed himself from justice on board of a river barge which was made the receptacle for stolen goods those which had been nefariously obtained at one place being by him and his associates carried up and down the river in the craft and disposed of at a great distance by which means the goods were never brought to light so as to enable the police to recognise or trace them this system had now been carried on with great success for upwards of twelve months and would in all probability have not been discovered even now had it not been that a quarrel as to profits had taken place which had induced two of his associates to give information to the officers and these two associates had also been permitted to turn kings evidence in a case of burglary in which fleming was a principal provided that it was considered necessary but there was a more serious charge against the prisoner that of having attempted the life of a boy named jacob faithful belonging to the lighter and who it appeared had suspicions of what was going on and in duty to his master had carefully watched the proceedings and given notice to others of what he had discovered from time to time the lad was the chief evidence against the prisoner fleming and also against marables the other prisoner of whom he could only observe that circumstances would transpire during the trial in his favour which he had no doubt would be well considered by his lordship he would not detain the gentlemen of the jury any longer but at once call on his witnesses i was then summoned again asked the same questions as to the nature of an oath and the judge being satisfied with my replies i gave my evidence as before the judge as i perceived carefully examining my previous disposition to ascertain if anything i now said was at variance with my former assertions i was then crossexamined by the counsel for fleming but he could not make me vary in my evidence i did however take the opportunity whenever i was able of saying all i could in favour of marables at last the counsel said he would ask me no more questions i was dismissed and the policeofficer who had picked me up and other parties who identified the various property as their own and the manner in which they had been robbed of it were examined the evidence was too clear to admit of doubt the jury immediately returned a verdict of guilty against fleming and marables but strongly recommended marables to the mercy of the crown the judge rose put on his black cap and addressed the prisoners as follows the court was so still that a pin falling might have been heard you william fleming have been tried by a jury of your countrymen upon the charge of receiving stolen goods to which you have added the most atrocious crime of intended murder you have had a fair and impartial trial and have been found guilty and it appears that even had you escaped in this instance other charges equally heavy and which would equally consign you to condign punishment were in readiness to be preferred against you your life has been one of guilt not only in your own person but also in abetting and stimulating others to crime and you have wound up your shameful career by attempting the life of a fellowcreature to hold out to you any hope of mercy is impossible your life is justly forfeited to the offended laws of your country and your sentence is that you be removed from this court to the place from whence you came and from thence to the place of execution there to be hanged by the neck till you are dead and may god in his infinite goodness have mercy on your soul you john marables have pleaded guilty to the charges brought against you and it has appeared during the evidence brought out on the trial that although you have been a party to these nefarious transactions you are far from being hardened in your guilt no no exclaimed marables i believe sincerely that you are not and much regret that one who from the evidence brought forward appears to have been previously to this unfortunate connection an honest man should now appear in so disgraceful a situation a severe punishment is however demanded by the voice of justice and by that sentence of the law you must now be condemned at the same time i trust that an appeal to the mercy of your sovereign will not be made in vain the judge then passed the sentence upon marables the prisoners were led out of court and a new trial commenced while mr drummond and the dominie conducted me home about a week after the trial fleming suffered the penalty of the law while marables was sentenced to transportation for life which however previous to his sailing was commuted to seven years in a few days the lighter returned her arrival was announced to me one fine sunny morning as i lay in bed by a voice whose wellknown notes poured into my ear as i was half dozing on my pillow bright are the beams of the morning sky and sweet the dew the red blossoms sip but brighter the glances of dear womans eye tom you monkey belay the warp and throw the fenders over the side be smart or old fuzzle will be growling about his red paint and sweet is the dew on her lip i jumped out of my little crib threw open the window the panes of which were crystallised with the frost in the form of little trees and beheld the lighter just made fast to the wharf the sun shining brightly old toms face as cheerful as the morn and young tom laughing jumping about and blowing his fingers i was soon dressed and shaking hands with my bargemates well jacob how do you like the old bailey never was in it but once in my life and never mean to go again if i can help it that was when sam bowles was tried for his life but my evidence saved him ill tell you how it was tom look ater the breakfast a bowl of tea this cold morning will be worth having come jump about but i never heard the story of sam bowles answered tom whats that to you im telling it to jacob but i want to hear itso go on father ill start you well dye see sam bowles master tom them as play with bowls may meet with rubbers take care i dont rub down your hide off you thief and get breakfast no i wont if i dont have your bowles you shall have no bowls of tea ive made my mind up to that i tell you what tom i shall never get any good out of you until i have both your legs ampitated ive a great mind to send for the farrier thanky father but i find them very useful well said i suppose we put off the story till breakfast time and ill go and help tom to get it ready be it so jacob i suppose tom must have his way as i spoiled him myself i made him so fond of yarns so i was a fool to be vexed oh life is a river and man is the boat that over its surface is destined to float and joy is a cargo so easily stored that he is a fool who takes sorrow on board now ill go on shore to master and find out whats to be done next give me my stick boy and i shall crawl over the planks a little safer a safe stool must have three legs you know old tom then stumped away on shore in about a quarter of an hour he returned bringing halfadozen red herrings here tom grill these sodgers jacob who is that tall old chap with such a devil of a cutwater which i met just now with master we are bound for sheerness this trip and im to land him at greenwich what the dominie replied i from old toms description his name did begin with a d but that wasnt it dobbs yes thats nearer hes to be a passenger on board of us going down to see a friend whos very ill now tom my hearty bring out the crockery for i want a little inside lining we all sat down to our breakfast and as soon as old tom had finished his son called for the history of sam bowles well now you shall have it sam bowles was a shipmate of mine on board of the greenlandman he was one of our best harpooners and a good quiet honest messmate as ever slung a hammock he was spliced to as pretty a piece of flesh as ever was seen but she wasnt as good as she was pretty we were fitting out for another voyage and his wife had been living on board with him some weeks for sam was devilish spoony on her and couldnt bear her to be out of his sight as we spected to sail in a few days we were filling up our complement of men and fresh hands came on board every day one morning a fine tall fellow with a tail as thick as a hawser came on board and offered himself he was taken by the skipper and went on shore again to get his traps while he was still on deck i went below and seeing sam with his little wife on his knee playing with his lovelocks i said that there was a famous stout and goodlooking fellow that we should have as a shipmate sams wife who like all women was a little curious put her head up the hatchway to look at him she put it down again very quick as i thought and made some excuse to go forward in the eyes of her where she remained some time and then when she came aft told sam that she would go on shore now as it had been agreed that she should remain on board till we were clear of the river sam couldnt think what the matter was but she was positive and go away she did very much to sams astonishment and anger in the evening sam went on shore and found her out and what dye think the little jezebel told himwhy that one of the men had been rude to her when she went forward and thats why she wouldnt stay on board sam was in a devil of a passion at this and wanted to know which was the man but she fondled him and wouldnt tell him because she was afraid that hed be hurt at last she bamboozled him and sent him on board again quite content well we remained three days longer and then dropped down the river to greenwich where the captain was to come on board and we were to sail as soon as the wind was fair now this fine tall fellow was with us when we dropped down the river and as sam was sitting down on his chest eating a basin o soup the other man takes out a baccy pouch of sealskinit was a very curious one made out of the white and spotted part of a young seals belly i say shipmate cries sam hand me over my baccy pouch where did you pick it up your pouch says he to him i killed the seal and my fancy girl made the pouch for me well if that aint cool youd swear a man out of his life mate tom says he to me aint that my pouch which my wife gave me when i came back last trip i looked at it and knew it again and said it was the tall fellow denied it and there was a devil of a bobbery sam called him a thief and he pitched sam right down the main hatchway among the casks after that there was a regular setto and sam was knocked all to shivers and obliged to give in when the fight was over i took up sams shirt for him to put on thats my shirt cried the tall fellow thats sams shirt replied i i know its his i tell you its mine replied the man my lass gave it to me to put on when i got up this morning the other is his shirt we looked at the other and they both were sams shirts now when sam heard this he put two and two together and became very jealous and uneasy he thought it odd that his wife was so anxious to leave the ship when this tall fellow came on board and what with the pouch and the shirt he was puzzled his wife had promised to come down to greenwich and see him off when we anchored some of the men went on shoreamong others the tall fellow sam whose head was swelled up like a pumpkin told one of his shipmates to say to his wife that he could not come on shore and that she must come off to him well it was about nine oclock dark and all the stars were twinkling when sam says to me tom lets go on shore my black eyes cant be seen in the dark as we hauled up the boat the second mate told sam to take his harpooniron on shore for him to have the hole for the becket punched larger away we went and the first place of course that sam went to was the house where he knew that his wife put up at as before he went upstairs to her room and i followed him the door was not made fast and in we went there was his little devil of a wife fast asleep in the arms of the tall fellow sam couldnt command his rage and having the harpooniron in his hand he drove it right through the tall fellows body before i could prevent him it was a dreadful sight the man groaned and his head fell over the side of the bed sams wife screamed and made sam more wroth by throwing herself on the mans body and weeping over it sam would have pulled out the iron to run her through with but that was impossible the noise brought up the people of the house and it was soon known that murder had been committed the constable came sam was thrown into prison and i went on board and told the whole story well we were just about to heave up for we had shipped two more men in place of sam who was to be tried for his life and the poor fellow he had killed when a lawyer chap came on board with what they call a suppeny for me all i know is that the lawyer pressed me into his service and i lost my voyage i was taken on shore and well fed till the trial came on poor sam was at the bar for murder the gentleman in his gown and wig began his yarn stating that how the late fellow whose name was will errol was with his own wife when sam harpooned him thats a lie cried sam he was with my wife false papers here are mine and he pulled out his tin case and handed them to the court the judge said that this was not the way to try people and that sam must hold his tongue so the trial went on and at first they had it all their own way then our turn came and i was called up to prove what had passed and i stated how the man was with sams wife and how he having the harpooniron in his hand had run it through his body then they compared the certificates and it was proved that the little jezebel had married them both but she had married sam first so he had the most right to her but fancying the other man afterwards she thought she might as well have two strings to her bow so the judge declared that she was sams wife and that any man even without the harpoon in his hand would be justified in killing a man whom he found in bed with his own wife so sam went scotfree but the judge wouldnt let off sams wife as she had caused murder by her wicked conduct he tried her aterwards for biggery as they call it and sent her over the water for life sam never held up his head aterwards what with having killed an innocent man and the haviour of his wife he was always down he went out to the fishery and a whale cut the boat in two with her tail sam was stunned and went down like a stone so you see the mischief brought about by this little jezebel who must have two husbands and be damned to her well thats a good yarn father said tom as soon as it was finished i was right in saying i would hear it wasnt i no replied old tom putting out his large hand and seizing his son by the collar and now youve put me in mind of it ill pay you off for old scores lord love you father you dont owe me anything said tom yes i do and now ill give you a receipt in full o lord theyll be drowned screamed tom holding up both his hands with every symptom of terror old tom turned short round to look in the direction letting go his hold tom made his escape and burst out alaughing i laughed also and so at last did his father i went on shore and found that old toms report was correctthe dominie was at breakfast with mr drummond the new usher had charge of the boys and the governors had allowed him a fortnights holiday to visit an old friend at greenwich to save expense as well as to indulge his curiosity the old man had obtained a passage down in the lighter never yet jacob have i put my feet into that which floateth on the watery element observed he to me nor would i now but that it saveth money which thou knowest well is with me not plentiful many dangers i expect many perils shall i encounter such have i read of in books and well might horace exclaimille robur et aes triplex with reference to the first man who ventured afloat still doth mr drummond assure me that the lighter is of that strength as to be able to resist the force of the winds and waves and confiding in providence i intend to venture jacob te duce nay sir replied i laughing at the idea which the dominie appeared to have formed of the dangers of river navigation old tom is the dux old tom where have i seen that name now i do recall to mind that i have seen the name painted in large letters upon a cask at the tavern bar of the inn at brentford but what it did intend to signify i did not inquire what connection is there none replied i but i rather think they are very good friends the tide turns in halfanhour sir are you ready to go on board truly am i and well prepared having my habiliments in a bundle my umbrella and my greatcoat as well as my spencer for general wear but where i am to sleep hath not yet been made known to me peradventure one sleepeth nottanto in periculo yes sir we do you shall have my berth and ill turn in with young tom hast thou then a young tom as well as an old tom on board yes sir and a dog also of the name of tommy well then we will embark and thou shalt make me known to this triad of thomases inde tomos dictus locus est cluck cluck ovid i thank thee chapter eleven much learning afloatyoung tom is very lively upon the dead languages the dominie after experiencing the wonders of the mighty deep prepares to revel upon lobscousethough the man of learning gets many songs and some yarns from old tom he loses the best part of a tale without knowing it the old dominies bundle and other paraphernalia being sent on board he took farewell of mr drummond and his family in so serious a manner that i was convinced that he considered he was about to enter upon a dangerous adventure and then i led him down to the wharf where the lighter lay alongside it was with some trepidation that he crossed the plank and got on board when he recovered himself and looked round my sarvice to you old gentleman said a voice behind the dominie it was that of old tom who had just come from the cabin the dominie turned round and perceived old tom this is old tom sir said i to the dominie who stared with astonishment art thou indeed jacob thou didst not tell me that he had been curtailed of his fair proportions and i was surprised art thou then dux continued the dominie addressing old tom yes interrupted young tom who had come from forward he is ducks because he waddles on his short stumps and i wont say who be goose eh father take care you dont buy goose for your imperance sir cried old tom a forward boy exclaimed the dominie yes replied tom im generally forward art thou forward in thy learning canst thou tell me latin for goose to be sure replied tom brandy brandy exclaimed the dominie nay child it is anser then i was right replied tom you had your answer the boy is apt cluck cluck he is apt to be devilish saucy old gentleman but never mind that theres no harm in him this then is young tom i presume jacob said the dominie referring to me yes sir replied i you have seen old tom and young tom and you have only to see tommy want to see tommy sir cried tom here tommy tommy but tommy who was rather busy with a bone forward did not immediately answer to his call and the dominie turned round to survey the river the scene was busy barges and boats passing in every direction others lying on shore with waggons taking out the coals and other cargoes men at work shouting or laughing with each other populus in fluviis as virgil hath it grand indeed is the vast river labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum as the generations of men are swept into eternity said the dominie musing aloud but tommy had now made his appearance and tom in his mischief had laid hold of the tail of the dominies coat and shown it to the dog the dog accustomed to seize a rope when it was shown to him immediately seized the dominies coat making three desperate tugs at it the dominie who was in one of his reveries and probably thought it was i who wished to direct his attention elsewhere each time waved his hand without turning round as much as to say i am busy now haul and hold cried tom to the dog splitting his sides and the tears running down his cheeks with laughing tommy made one more desperate tug carrying away one tail of the dominies coat but the dominie perceived it not he was still nubibus while the dog galloped forward with the fragment and tom chased him to recover it the dominie continued in his reverie when old tom burst out o england dear england bright gem of the ocean thy valleys and fields look fertile and gay the heart clings to thee with a sacred devotion and memory adores when in far lands away the song gradually called the dominie to his recollection indeed the strain was so beautiful that it would have vibrated in the ears of a dying man the dominie gradually turned round and when old tom had finished exclaimed truly it did delight mine ear and from such and continued the dominie looking down upon old tomwithout legs too why old gentleman i dont sing with my legs answered old tom nay good dux i am not so deficient as not to be aware that a man singeth from the mouth yet is thy voice mellifluous sweet as the honey of hybla strong as the latin for goose finished tom come father old dictionary is in the doldrums rouse him up with another stave ill rouse you up with the stave of a cask over your shoulders mr tom what have you done with the old gentlemans swallowtail leave me to settle that affair father i know how to get out of a scrape so you ought you scamp considering how many you get into but the craft are swinging and heaving up forward there jacob and sway up the mast theres tom and tommy to help you the mast was hoisted up the sail set and the lighter in the stream before the dominie was out of his reverie are there whirlpools here said the dominie talking more to himself than to those about him whirlpools replied young tom who was watching and mocking him yes that there are under the bridges ive watched a dozen chips go down one after the other a dozen ships exclaimed the dominie turning to tom and every soul lost never saw them afterwards replied tom in a mournful voice how little did i dream of the dangers of those so near me said the dominie turning away and communing with himself those who go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waterset vastas aperit syrtesthese men see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deepalternante vorans vasta charybdis aquafor at his word the stormy wind ariseth which lifteth up the waves thereofsurgens a puppi

pavidi omnibus ignoiae mortis timor omnibus hostemthey reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man so they do father dont they sometimes observed tom leering his eye at his father thats all ive understood of his speech they are at their wits end continued the dominie mind the end of your wit master tom answered his father wroth at the insinuation so when they call upon the lord in their troublecujus jurare timent et fallere nomenhe delivereth them out of their distress for he makest the storm to cease so that the waves thereof are still yea still and smooth as the peaceful water which now floweth rapidly by our anchored vesselyet it appeareth to me that the scene hath changed these fields met not mine eyes before riparumque toros et prata recentia rivis surely we have moved from the wharfand the dominie turned round and discovered for the first time that we were more than a mile from the place at which we had embarked pray sir whats the use of speech sir interrogated tom who had been listening to the whole of the dominies long soliloquy thou asketh a foolish question boy we are endowed with the power of speech to enable us to communicate our ideas thats exactly what i thought sir then pray whats the use of your talking all that gibberish that none of us could understand i crave thy pardon child i spoke i presume in the dead languages if theyre dead why not let them rest in their graves good thou hast wit cluck cluck yet child know that it is pleasant to commune with the dead is it then well put you on shore at battersea churchyard silence tom hes full of his sauce siryou must forgive it nay it pleaseth me to hear him talk but it would please me more to hear thee sing then here goes sir to drown toms impudence glide on my bark the morning tide is gently floating by thy side around thy prow the waters bright in circling rounds of broken light are glittering as if ocean gave her countless gems unto the wave thats a pretty air and i first heard it sung by a pretty woman but thats all i know of the song she sang another id be a butterfly born in a bower youd be a butterfly said the dominie taking old tom literally and looking at his person young tom roared yes sir hed be a butterfly and i dont see why he shouldnt very soon his legs are gone and his wings arent come so hes a grub now and that you know is the next thing to it what a funny old beggar it is fatherarent it tom tom go forward sir we must shoot the bridge shoot exclaimed the dominie shoot what you arent afraid of firearms are ye sir inquired tom nay i said not that i was afraid of firearms but why should you shoot we never could get on without it sir we shall have plenty of shooting byandby you dont know this river indeed i thought not of such doings or that there were other dangers besides that of the deep waters go forward tom and dont be playing with your betters cried old tom never mind him sir hes only humbugging you explain jacob the language of both old tom and young tom are to me as incomprehensible as would be that of the dog tommy or as your latin is to them sir true jacob true i have no right to complain nay i do not complain for i am amused although at times much puzzled we now shot putney bridge and as a wherry passed us old tom carolled out did you ever hear tell of a jolly young waterman no i never did said the dominie observing old toms eyes directed towards him tom amused by this naivete on the part of the dominie touched him by the sleeve on the other side and commenced with his treble did you neer hear a tale of a maid in the vale not that i can recollect my child replied the dominie then where have you been all your life my life has been employed my lad in teaching the young idea how to shoot so youre an old soldier after all and afraid of firearms why dont you hold yourself up i suppose its that enormous jib of yours that brings you down by the head tom tom ill cut you into pork pieces if you go on that gait go and get dinner under weigh you scamp and leave the gentleman alone heres more wind coming a wet sheet and a flowing sea a wind that follows fast and fills the white and rustling sail and bends the gallant mast and bends the gallant mast my boys while like the eagle free away the good ship flies and leaves old england on the lee jacob said the dominie i have heard by the mouth of rumour with her hundred tongues how careless and indifferent are sailors unto danger but i never could have believed that such lightness of heart could have been shown yon man although certainly not old in years yet what is hea remnant of a man resting upon unnatural and illproportioned support yon lad who is yet but a child appears as blythe and merry as if he were in possession of all the world can afford i have an affection for that bold child and would fain teach him the rudiments at least of the latin tongue i doubt if tom would ever learn them sir he hath a will of his own it grieveth me to hear thee say so for he lacketh not talent but instruction and the dux he pleaseth me mightilya second palinurus yet how that a man could venture to embark upon an element to struggle through the horrors of which must occasionally demand the utmost exertion of every limb with the want of the two most necessary for his safety is to me quite incomprehensible he can keep his legs sir nay jacob how can he keep what are already gone even thou speakest strangely upon the water i see the dangers that surround us jacob yet i am calm i feel that i have not lived a wicked lifeinteger vitae scelerisque purus as horace truly saith may venture even as i have done upon the broad expanse of water what is it that the boy is providing for us it hath an inviting smell lobscouse master replied old tom and not bad lining either i recollect no such wordunde derivatur friend whats that master inquired old tom its latin for lobscouse depend upon it father cried tom who was stirring up the savoury mess with a large wooden spoon he be a deadly lively old gentleman with his dead language dinners all ready are we to let go the anchor or pipe to dinner first we may as well anchor boys we have not a quarter of an hours more ebb and the wind is heading us tom and i went forward brailed up the mainsail cleared away and let go the anchor the lighter swung round rapidly to the stream the dominie who had been in a fit of musing with his eyes cast upon the forests of masts which we had passed below london bridge and which were now some way astern of us of a sudden exclaimed in a loud voice parce precor periculosum est the lighter swinging short round to her anchor had surprised the dominie with the rapid motion of the panorama and he thought we had fallen in with one of the whirlpools mentioned by tom what has happened good dux tell me cried the dominie to old tom with alarm in his countenance why master ill tell you after my own fashion replied old tom smiling and then singing as he held the dominie by the button of his spencer now to her berth the craft draws nigh with slackend sail she feels the tide stand clear the cable is the cry the anchors gone we safely ride and now master well bail out the lobscouse we shant weigh anchor again until tomorrow morning the winds right in our teeth and it will blow fresh im sartain look how the scuds flying so now well have a jolly time of it and you shall have your allowance of grog on board before you turn in i have before heard of that potation replied the dominie sitting down on the coaming of the hatchway and fain would taste it chapter twelve is a chapter of tales in a double sensethe dominie from the natural effects of his singleheartedness begins to see doublea new definition of philosophy with an episode on jealousy we now took our seats on the deck round the saucepan for we did not trouble ourselves with dishes and the dominie appeared to enjoy the lobscouse very much in the course of halfanhour all was over that is to say we had eaten as much as we wished and the newfoundland dog who during our repast lay close by young tom flapping the deck with his tail and sniffing the savoury smell of the compound had just licked all our plates quite clean and was now finishing with his head in the saucepan while tom was busy carrying the crockery into the cabin and bringing out the bottle and tin pannikins ready for the promised carouse there now master theres a glass o grog for you that would float a marlinespike see if that dont warm the cockles of your old heart ay added tom and set all your muscles as taut as weather backstays master tom with your leave ill mix your grog for you myself hand me back that bottle you rascal just as you please father replied tom handing the bottle but recollect none of your water bewitched only help me as you love me old tom mixed a pannikin of grog for tom and another for himself i hardly need say which was the stiffer of the two well father i suppose you think the grog will run short to be sure one bottle arent too much mong four of us one bottle you scamp theres another in the cupboard then you must see double already father old tom who was startled at this news and who imagined that tom must have gained possession of the other bottle jumped up and made for the cupboard to ascertain whether what tom asserted was correct this was what tom wished he immediately changed pannikins of grog with his father and remained quiet there is another bottle tom said his father coming out and taking his seat again i knew there was you young rascal you dont know how you frightened me and old tom put the pannikin to his lips drowned the miller by heavens said he what could i have been about ejaculated he adding more spirit to his mixture i suppose upon the strength of another bottle in the locker you are doubling the strength of your grog come father and tom held out his pannikin do put a little drop in mineits sevenwater grog and im not on the blacklist no no tom your next shall be stronger well master how do you like your liquor verily replied the dominie it is a pleasant and seducing liquor lo and behold i am at the bottom of my utensil stop till i fill it up again old gentleman i see you are one of the right sort you know what the song says a plague on those musty old lubbers who tell us to fast and to think and patient fall in with lifes rubbers with nothing but water to drink water indeed the only use of water i know is to mix your grog with and float vessels up and down the world why was the sea made salt but to prevent our drinking too much water water indeed a can of good grog had they swiggd it twould have set them for pleasure agog and in spite of the rules of the schools the old fools would have all of them swiggd it and swore there was nothing like grog im exactly of your opinion father said tom holding out his empty pannikin always ready for two things master tomgrog and mischief but however you shall have one more dose it hath then medicinal virtues inquired the dominie ay that it has mastermore than all the quacking medicines in the world it cures grief and melancholy and prevents spirits from getting low i doubt that father cried tom holding up the bottle for the more grog we drink the more the spirits become low cluck cluck came from the thorax of the dominie verily friend tom it appeareth among other virtues to sharpen the wits proceed friend dux in the medicinal virtues of grog well master it cures love when its not returned and adds to it when it is ive heard say it will cure jealousy but that ive my doubts of now i think on it i will tell you a yarn about a jealous match between a couple of fools jacob arent your pannikin empty my boy yes replied i handing it up to be filled it was empty for not being very fond of it myself tom with my permission had drunk it as well as his own there jacob is a good dose for you you arent always craving after it like tom he isnt troubled with low spirits as i am father how long has that been your complaint tom inquired i ever since i heard how to cure it come father give us the yarn well then you must mind that an old shipmate o mine ben leader had a wife named poll a pretty sort of craft in her wayneat in her rigging swellingbows taking sort of figurehead and devilish well rounded in the counter altogether she was a very fancy girl and all the men were after her shed a roguish eye and liked to be stared at as most pretty women do because it flatters their vanities now although she liked to be noticed so far by the other chaps yet ben was the only one she ever wished to be handled by it was paws off pompey with all the rest ben leader was a goodlooking active smart chap and could foot it in a reel or take a bout at singlestick with the very best o them and she was mortal fond of him and mortal jealous if he talked to any other woman for the women liked ben as much as the men liked she well as they returned love for love so did they return jealousy for jealousy and the lads and lasses seeing that had a pleasure in making them come to a misunderstanding so every day it became worse and worse between them now i always says that its a stupid thing to be jealous cause if there be cause there be no cause for love and if there be no cause there be no cause for jealousy youre like a row in a rookery fathernothing but caws interrupted tom well i suppose i am but thats what i call chop logicarent it master it was a syllogism replied the dominie taking the pannikin from his mouth i dont know what that is nor do i want to know replied old tom so ill just go on with my story well at last they came to downright fighting ben licks poll cause she talked and laughed with other men and poll cries and whines all day cause he wont sit on her knee instead of going on board and tending to his duty well one night ater work was over ben goes on shore to the house where he and poll used to sleep and when he sees the girl in the bar he says where is poll now the girl at the bar was a freshcomer and answers what girl so ben describes her and the bargirl answers she be just gone to bed with her husband i suppose for you see there was a woman like her who had gone up to her bed sure enough when ben heard that he gave his trousers one hitch and calls for a quartern drinks it off with a sigh and leaves the house believing it all to be true ater ben was gone poll makes her appearance and when she finds ben wasnt in the tap says young woman did a man go upstairs just now yes replied the bargirl with his wife i suppose they be turned in this quarter of an hour when she almost turned mad with rage and then as white as a sheet and then she burst into tears and runs out of the house crying out poor misfortunate creature that i am knocking everything down undersized and running into the arms of every man who came athwart her hawse i understood him but just now that she was running on foot yet doth he talk about her horse expound jacob it was a nautical figure of speech sir exactly rejoined tom it meant her figurehead old gentleman but my yarn wont cut a figure if im brought up all standing in this way suppose master you hear the story first and understand it aterwards i will endeavour to comprehend by the context replied the dominie that is i suppose that youll allow me to stick to my text well then heres coil away again ben you see what with his jealousy and what with a whole quartern at a draught became somehow nohow and he walked down to the jetty with the intention of getting rid of himself and his wife and all his trouble by giving his soul back to his creator and his body to the fishes bad philosophy quoth the dominie i agree with you master replied old tom pray what sort of a thing is philosophy inquired tom philosophy replied old tom is either hanging drowning shooting yourself or in short getting out of the world without help nay replied the dominie that is felo de se well i pronounce it quicker than you master but its one and the same thing but to go on while ben was standing on the jetty thinking whether he should take one more quid of baccy afore he dived who should come down but poll with her hair all adrift streaming and coachwhipping astern of her with the same intention as bento commit philozoffy ben who was standing at the edge of the jetty his eyes fixed upon the water as it eddied among the piles looking as dismal as if he had swallowed a hearse and six with the funeral feathers hanging out of his mouth a bold comparison murmured the dominie never sees her and she was so busy with herself that although close to him she never sees healways remembering that the night was dark so poll turned her eyes up for all the world like a dying jackdaw tell me friend dux interrupted the dominie doth a jackdaw die in any peculiar way yes replied young tom he always dies black master then doth he die as he liveth cluck cluck proceed good dux and dont you break the thread of my yarn any more master if you wish to hear the end of it so poll begins to bludder about ben o ben ben cried she cruel cruel man for to comefor to gofor to go for to come whos there shouted ben for to comefor to go cried poll ship ahoy hailed ben again for to gofor to come blubbered poll and then she couldnt bring out anything more for sobbing with that ben who thought he knew the voice walks up to her and says be that you poll be that you ben replied poll taking her hands from her face and looking at him i thought you were in bed withwithoh poll said ben and i thought you were in bed withoh ben replied poll but i wasnt poll nor more wasnt i ben and what brought you here poll i wanted for to die ben and what brought you here ben i didnt want for to live poll when i thought you false then polly might have answered in the words of the old song master but her poor heart was too full i suppose and tom sang your polly has never been false she declares since last time we parted at wapping old stairs howsomever in the next minute they were both hugging and kissing sobbing shivering and shaking in each others arms and as soon as they had settled themselves a little back they went arminarm to the house and had a good stiff glass to prevent their taking the rheumatism went to bed and were cured of their jealously ever aterwardswhich in my opinion was a much better philozoffy than the one they had both been bound on there ive wound it all off at last master and now well fill up our pannikins before i consent friend dux prythee inform me how much of this pleasant liquor may be taken without inebriating vulgo getting tipsy father can drink enough to float a jollyboat master replied tom so you neednt fear ill drink pan for pan with you all night long indeed you wont mister tom replied the father but i will master i perceived that the liquor had already had some effect upon my worthy pedagogue and was not willing that he should be persuaded into excess i therefore pulled him by the coat as a hint but he was again deep in thought and he did not heed me tired of sitting so long i got up and walked forward to look at the cable strange muttered the dominie that jacob should thus pull me by the garment what could he mean did he pull you sir inquired tom yes many times and then he walked away it appears that you have been pulled too much sir replied tom appearing to pick up the tail of his coat which had been torn off by the dog and handing it to him eheu jacobefili dilectissimequid fecisti cried the dominie holding up the fragment of his coat with a look of despair a long pull a strong pull and a pull altogether sang out old tom and then looking at tom now aint you a pretty rascal master tom it is done exclaimed the dominie with a sigh putting the fragment into the remaining pocket and it cannot be undone now i think it is undone and can be done master replied tom a needle and thread will soon join the pieces of your old coat againin holy matrimony i may safely say true cluck cluck my housekeeper will restore it yet will she be wroth feminae curaeque iraeque but let us think no more about it cried the dominie drinking deeply from his pannikin and each minute verging fast to intoxication nunc est bibendum nunc pede libero pulsanda tellus i feel as if i were lifted up and could dance yea and could exalt my voice and sing could you my jolly old master then we will both dance and sing come let us dance and sing while all barbadoes bells shall ring mars scrapes the fiddle string while venus plays the lute hymen gay trips away jocund at the wedding day now for chorus come let us dance and sing chapter thirteen the fun grows fast and furiousthe pedagogue does not scan correctly and his feet become very unequalan allegorical compliment almost worked up into a literal quarrelat length the mighty are laid low and the dominie hurts his nose i heard toms treble and a creaking noise which i recognised to proceed from the dominie who had joined the chorus and i went aft if possible to prevent further excess but i found that the grog had mounted into the dominies head and all my hints were disregarded tom was despatched for the other bottle and the dominies pannikin was replenished old tom roaring out come sling the flowing bowl fond hopes arise the girls we prize shall bless each jovial soul the can boys bring well dance and sing while foaming billows roll now for the chorus again come sling the flowing bowl etcetera jacob why dont you join the chorus was given by the whole of us the dominies voice was even louder though not quite so musical as old toms evoe cried the dominie evoe cantemus amo amasi loved a lass for she was tall and slender amas amatshe laid me flat though of the feminine gender truly do i not forget the songs of my youth and of my hilarious days yet doth the potent spirit work upon me like the god in the cumean sybil and i shall soon prophecy that which shall come to pass so can i said tom giving me a nudge and laughing do thine office of ganymede and fill up the pannikin put not in too much of the element once more exalt thy voice good dux always ready master cried tom who sang out again in praise of his favourite liquor smiling grog is the sailors best hope his sheet anchor his compass his cable his log that gives him a heart which lifes cares cannot canker though dangers around him unite to confound him he braves them and tips off his grog tis grog only grog is his rudder his compass his cable his log the sailors sheet anchor is grog verily thou art an apolloor rather referring to thy want of legs half an apollothat is a demigod cluck cluck sweet is thy lyre friend dux fair words master im no liar cried tom clap a stopper on your tongue or youll get into disgrace ubi lapsus quid feci said the dominie i spoke of thy musical tongue and furthermore i spoke allegorically i know a man lies with his tongue as well as you do old chap but as for telling a hell of a something lie as you states i say i never did rejoined old tom who was getting cross in his cups i now interfered as there was every appearance of a fray and in spite of young tom who wished as he termed it to kick up a shindy prevailed upon them to make friends which they did shaking hands for nearly five minutes when this was ended i again entreated the dominie not to drink any more but to go to bed amice jacobe replied the dominie the liquor hath mounted into thy brain and thou wouldst rebuke thy master and thy preceptor betake thee to thy couch and sleep off the effects of thy drink verily jacob thou art plenus veteris bacchi or in plain english thou art drunk canst thou conjugate jacob i fear not canst thou decline jacob i fear not canst thou scan jacob i fear not nay jacob methinks that thou art unsteady in thy gait and not over clear in thy vision canst thou hear jacob if so i will give thee an oration against inebriety with which thou mayest down on thy pillow wilt thou have it in latin or in greek o damn your greek and latin cried old tom keep that for tomorrow sing us a song my old hearty or shall i sing you one here goes for while the grog goes round all sense of dangers drownd we despise it to a man we sing a little sing a little bawled the dominie and laugh a little laugh a little chorused young tom and work a little work a little cried the dominie and swear a little swear not a little echoed tom and fiddle a little fiddle a little hiccuped the dominie and foot it a little foot it a little repeated tom and swig the flowing can and fiddle a little and foot it a little and swig the flowing can roared old tom emptying his pannikin and swig the flowing can followed the dominie tossing off his and swig the flowing can cried young tom turning up his pannikin empty hurrah thats what i calls glorious lets have it over again and then well have another dose come now all together again was the song repeated and when they came to foot it a little old tom jumped on his stumps seizing hold of the dominie who immediately rose and the three danced round and round for a minute or two singing the song and chorus till old tom who was very far gone tripped against the coamings of the hatchway pitching his head into the dominies stomach who fell backwards clinging to young toms hand so that they all rolled on the deck togethermy worthy preceptor underneath the other two foot it rather too much that time father said young tom getting up the first and laughing come jacob lets put father on his pins again he cant rise without a purchase with some difficulty we succeeded as soon as he was on his legs again old tom put a hand upon each of our shoulders and commenced with a drunken leer what though his timbers they are gone and hes a slave to tipple no better sailor eer was born than tom the jovial cripple thanky my boys thanky now rouse up the old gentleman i suspect we knocked the wind out of him hollo there are you hard and fast the bricks are hard and verily my senses are fast departing quoth the dominie rousing himself and sitting up staring around him senses going do you say master cried old tom dont throw them overboard till we have made a finish one more pannikin apiece one more song and then to bed tom wheres the bottle drink no more sir i beg youll be ill tomorrow said i to the dominie deprome quadrimum hiccuped the dominie carpe diemquam

come shall i give you a song thats right tom a volunteers worth two pressed men open your mouth wide an let your whistle fly away with the gale you whistles in tune at all events tom then struck up the dominie seesawing as he sat and getting very sleepy luck in life or good or bad neer could make me melancholy seldom rich yet never sad sometimes poor yet always jolly fortunes in my scale thats poz of mischance put more than half in yet i dont know how it was i could never cry for laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha i could never cry for laughing now for chorus father ha ha ha ha ha ha i could never

rolling himself along the deck to the cabin hatch that ive as muchas i can staggerunder at all eventsso ill sing myself to sleepcause whyim happy jacob mind you keep all the watches tonightand tom may keep the rest old tom then sat up leaning his back against the cabin hatch and commenced one of those doleful ditties which are sometimes heard on the forecastle of a manofwar he had one or two of the songs that he always reserved for such occasions while tom and i dragged the dominie to bed old tom drawled out his ditty oh we sailed to virginia and thence to fyal where we waterd our shipping and so then weighed all full in view on the seasboysseven sail we did espy o we manned our capstern and weighed speedily thats right my boys haul and holdstow the old dictionary awayfor he cant command

sleep first ill call you at four oclock we cant weigh till tide serves and i shall have plenty of sleep before that tom went to bed and i walked the deck till the morning thinking over the events of the day and wondering what the dominie would say when he came to his senses at four oclock as agreed i roused tom out and turned into his bed and was soon as fast asleep as old tom and the dominie whose responsive snores had rung in my ears during the whole time that i had walked the deck chapter fourteen cold water and repentancethe two toms almost moral and myself full of wise reflectionsthe chapter being full of grave saws is luckily very short and though a very sensible one i would not advise it to be skipped about halfpast eight the next morning i was called up by tom to assist in getting the lighter under weigh when on deck i found old tom as fresh as if he had not drunk a drop the night before very busily stumping about the windlass with which we hove up first the anchor and then the mast well jacob my boy had sleep enough not too much i dare say but a bout like last night dont come often jacobonly once in a way now and then i do believe its good for my health its a great comfort to me my lad to have you on board with me because as you never drinks i may now indulge a little oftener as for tom i cant trust himtoo much like his fatherhad nobody to trust to for the lookout except the dog tommy till you came with us i can trust tommy as far as keeping off the river sharks hell never let them take a ropeyarn off the deck night or day but a dogs but a dog after all now were brought to so clap on my boy and lets heave up with a will hows the old gentleman father said tom as we paused a moment from our labour at the windlass oh hes got a good deal more to sleep off yet there he lies flat on his back blowing as hard as a grampus better leave him as long as we can well rouse him as soon as we turn greenwich reach tom didnt you think his nose loomed devilish large yesterday never seed such a devil of a cutwater in my life father well then youll see a larger when he gets up for its swelled bigger than the brandy bottle heave and haul now bring to the fall and up with the mast boys while i goes aft and takes the helm old tom went aft during the night the wind had veered to the north and the frost had set in sharp the rime covered the deck of the barge and here and there floating ice was to be seen coming down with the tide the banks of the river and fields adjacent were white with hoar frost and would have presented but a cheerless aspect had not the sun shone out clear and bright tom went aft to light the fire while i coiled away and made all snug forward old tom as usual carolled forth oh for a soft and gentle wind i heard a fair one cry but give to me the roaring breeze and white waves beating high and white waves beating high my boys the good ship tight and free the world of waters is our own and merry men are we a nice morning this for cooling a hot head thats sartain tommy you rascal youre like a court lady with her velvet gownd covered all over with diamonds continued old tom looking at the newfoundland dog whose glossy black hair was besprinkled with little icicles which glittered in the sun you and jacob were the only sensible ones of the party last night for you both were sober so was i father i was as sober as a judge observed tom who was blowing up the fire may be tom as a judge ater dinner but a judge on the bench be one thing and a judge over a bottle be another and not bad judges in that way either at all events if you warnt sewed up it wasnt your fault and i suppose replied tom it was only your misfortune that you were no i dont say that but still when i look at the dog whos but a beast by nature and thinks of myself who wasnt meant to be a beast why i blushes thats all jacob look at fathernow does he blush cried tom i cant say that i perceive it replied i smiling well then if i dont its the fault of my having no legs im sure when they were knocked off i lost half the blood in my body and thats the reason i suppose at all events i meant to blush so well take the will for the deed but do you mean to keep sober in future father said tom never do you mind thatmind your own business mr tom at all events i shant get tipsy till next time and thats all i can say with safety cause dye see i knows my failing jacob did you ever see that old gentleman sail too close to the wind before i never didi do not think that he was ever tipsy before last night then i pities himhis headache and his repentance moreover there be his nose and the swallowtail of his coat to make him unhappy we shall be down abreast of the hospital in halfanhour suppose you go and give him a shake jacob not you tom i wont trust youyoull be doing him a mischief you havent got no fellowfeeling not even for dumb brutes ill thank you not to take away my character that way father replied tom didnt i put you to bed last night when you were speechless suppose you didwhat then why then i had a feeling for a dumb brute i only say that father for the joke of it you know continued tom going up to his father and patting his rough cheek i know that my boy you never were unkind thats sartain but you must have your joke merry thoughts are linkd with laughter why should we bury them sighs and tears may come hereafter no need to hurry them they who through a spyingglass view the minutes as they pass make the sun a gloomy mass but the faults their own tom in the meantime i was vainly attempting to rouse the dominie after many fruitless attempts i put a large quantity off snuff on his upper lip and then blew it up his nose but merciful powers what a nose it had becomelarger than the largest pear that i ever saw in my life the whole weight of old tom had fallen on it and instead of being crushed by the blow it appeared as if on the contrary it had swelled up indignant at the injury and affront which it had received the skin was as tight as the parchment of a drum and shining as if it had been oiled while the colour was a bright purple verily it was the dominies nose in a rage the snuff had the effect of partially awakening him from his lethargy six oclockdid you say mrs bately are the boys washedand in the schoolroom i will rise speedilyyet i am overcome with much heaviness delapsus somnus ab and the dominie snored again i renewed my attempts and gradually succeeded the dominie opened his eyes stared at the deck and carlines above him then at the cupboard by his side lastly he looked at and recognised me eheu jacobewhere am i and what is that which presses upon my brain what is it so loadeth my cerebellum even as if it were lead my memorywhere is it let me recall my scattered senses here the dominie was silent for some time ah me yea and verily i do recollectwith pain of head and more pain of heartthat which i would fain forget which is that i did forget myself and indeed have forgotten all that passed the latter portion of the night friend dux hath proved no friend but hath led me into the wrong path and as or the potation called grogeheu jacobe how have i fallenfallen in my own opinionfallen in thinehow can i look thee in the face o jacob what must thou think of him who hath hitherto been thy preceptor and thy guide here the dominie fell back on the pillow and turned away his head it is not your fault sir replied i to comfort him you were not aware of what you were drinkingyou did not know that the liquor was so strong old tom deceived you nay jacob i cannot lay that flattering unction to my wounded heart i ought to have known nay now i recall to mind that thou wouldst have warned meeven to the pulling off of the tail of my coatyet i heeded thee not and i am humbledeven i the master over seventy boys nay sir it was not i who pulled off the tail of your coat it was the dog jacob i have heard of the wonderful sagacity of the canine species yet could not i ever have believed that a dumb brute would have perceived my folly and warned me from intoxication mirabile dictu tell me jacob thou who hast profited by these lessons which thy master could givealthough he could not follow up his precept by exampletell me what did take place let me know the full extent of my backsliding you fell asleep sir and we put you to bed who did me that office jacob young tom and i sir as for old tom he was not in a state to help anybody i am humbled jacob nonsense old gentleman why make a fuss about nothing said old tom who overhearing our conversation came into the cabin you had a drop too much thats all and what o that its a poor heart that never rejoiceth rouse a bit wash your face with old thames water and in halfanhour youll be as fresh as a daisy my head acheth exclaimed the dominie even as if there were a ball of lead rolling from one temple to the other but my punishment is just that is the punishment of making too free with the bottle for sartain but if it is an offence then it carries its own punishment and thats quite sufficient every man knows that when the hearts over light at night that the heads over heavy in the morning i have known and proved it a thousand times well what then i puts the good against the bad and i takes my punishment like a man friend dux for so i will still call thee thou lookest not at the offence in a moral point of vision whats moral replied old tom i would point out that intoxication is sinful intoxication sinful i suppose that means that its a sin to get drunk now master its my opinion that as god almighty has given us good liquor it was for no other purpose than to drink it and therefore it would be ungrateful to him and a sin not to get drunkthat is with discretion how canst thou reconcile getting drunk with discretion good dux i mean master when theres work to be done the work should be done but when theres plenty of time and everything is safe and all ready for a start the next morning i can see no possible objection to a jollification come master rouse out the lighters abreast of the hospital almost by this time and we must put you on shore the dominie whose clothes were all on turned out of his bedplace and went with us on deck young tom who was at the helm as soon as we made our appearance wished him a goodmorning very respectfully indeed i always observed that tom with all his impudence and waggery had a great deal of consideration and kindness he had overheard the dominies conversation with me and would not further wound his feelings with a jest old tom resumed his place at the helm while his son prepared the breakfast and i drew a bucket of water for the dominie to wash his face and hands of his nose not a word was said and the dominie made no remarks to me on the subject although i am persuaded it must have been very painful from the comfort he appeared to derive in bathing it with the freezing water a bowl of tea was a great solace to him and he had hardly finished it when the lighter was abreast the hospital stairs tom jumped into the boat and hauled it alongside i took the other oar and the dominie shaking hands with old tom said thou didst mean kindly and therefore i wish thee a kind farewell good dux god be with you master replied old tom shall we call for you as we come back nay nay replied the dominie the travelling by land is more expensive but less dangerous i thank thee for thy songs andfor all thy kindness good dux are my paraphernalia in the boat jacob i replied in the affirmative the dominie stepped in and we pulled him on shore he landed took his bundle and umbrella under his arm shook hands with tom and then with me without speaking and i perceived the tears start in his eyes as he turned and walked away well now said tom looking after the dominie i wish i had been drunk instead of he he does so take it to heart poor old gentleman he has lost his selfesteem tom replied i it should be a warning to you come get your oar to pass well some people he fashioned one way and some another ive been tipsy more than once and i never lost anything but my reason and that came back as soon as the grog left my head i cant understand that fretting about having had a glass too much i only frets when i cant get enough well of all the noses i ever saw his bests them by chalks i did so want to laugh at it but i knew it would pain him it is very kind of you tom to hold your tongue and i thank you very much and yet that old dad of mine swears ive got no fellowfeeling which i consider a very undutiful thing for him to say whats the reason jacob that sons be always cleverer than their fathers i didnt know that was the case tom but it is so now if it wasnt in olden time the proverb says young people think old people to be fools but old people know young people to be fools we must alter that for i says old people think young people to be fools but young people know old people to be fools have it your own way tom that will do rowed of all we tossed in our oars made the boat fast and gained the deck where old tom still remained at the helm well said he jacob i never thought i should be glad to see the old gentleman clear of the lighter but i wasdevilish glad he was like a load on my conscience this morning he was trusted to my charge by mr drummond and i had no right to persuade him to make a fool of himself but however whats done cant be helped as you say sometimes and its no use crying still it was a pity for he be for all the world like a child theres a fancy kind of lass in that wherry crossing our bows look at the streamers from her topgallant come oer the sea maiden to me mine through sunshine storm and snows seasons may roll but the true soul burns the same wherever it goes then come oer the sea maiden with me see you hanged first you underpinned old hulk replied the female in the boat which was then close under our bows well that be civil for certain said old tom laughing chapter fifteen i am unshipped for a short time in order to record shipments and engross invoicesform a new acquaintance what is called in the world a warm man though he passed the best part of his life among icebergs and one whole night within the ribs of deathhis wife works hard at gentility we arrived at sheerness the next morning landed the bricks which were for the government buildings and returned in ballast to the wharf my first inquiry was for the dominie but he had not yet returned and mr drummond further informed me that he had been obliged to send away his underclerk and wished me to simply take his place until he could procure another the lighter therefore took in her cargo and sailed without me which was of consequence as my apprenticeship still went on i now lived with mr drummond as one of his own family and wanted for nothing his continual kindness to me made me strive all i could to please him by diligence and attention and i soon became very expert at accounts and as he said very useful the advantages to me i hardly need observe were considerable and i gained information every day still although i was glad to be of any use to mr drummond the confinement at the desk was irksome and i anxiously looked for the arrival of the new clerk to take my place and leave me free to join the lighter mr drummond did not appear to me to be in any hurry indeed i believe that he would have retained me altogether had he not perceived that i still wished to be on the river at all events jacob i shall keep you here until you are master of your work it will be useful to you hereafter he said to me one day and you do not gain much by sailing up and down the river this was true and i also derived much advantage from the evenings spent with mrs drummond who was a very sensible good woman and would make me read aloud to her and little sarah as they sat at their needle i had no idea until i was employed posting up the book that mr drummonds concern was so extensive or that there was so much capital employed in the business the dominie returned a few days after my arrival when we met his nose had resumed its former appearance and he never brought up the subject of the evening on board of the lighter i saw him frequently mostly on sundays after i had been to church with the family and halfanhour at least was certain to be dedicated to our reading together one of the classics as i was on shore several months i became acquainted with many families one or two of which were worth noticing among the foremost was captain turnbull at least such was his appellation until within the last two months previous to my making his acquaintance when mr turnbull sent out his cards george turnbull esquire the history of captain turnbull was as followshe had with his twin brother been hung up at the knocker and afterwards had been educated at the foundling hospital they had both been apprenticed to the sea grown up thoroughbred capital seamen in the greenland fishery rose to be mates then captains had been very successful owned part then the whole of the ship afterwards two or three ships and had wound up with handsome fortunes captain turnbull was a married man without a family his wife fine in person vulgar in speech a wouldbe fashionable lady against which fashion captain t had for years pleaded poverty but his brother who had remained a bachelor died leaving him forty thousand poundsa fact which could not be concealed captain turnbull had not allowed his wife to be aware of the extent of his own fortune more from a wish to live quietly and happily than from any motive of parsimony for he was liberal to excess but now he had no further excuse to plead and mrs turnbull insisted upon fashion the house they had lived in was given up and a marine villa on the borders of the thames to a certain degree met the views of both parties mrs turnbull anticipating dinners and fetes and the captain content to watch what was going on in the river and amuse himself in a wherry they had long been acquaintances of mr and mrs drummond and captain turnbulls character was such as always to command the respect of mr drummond as he was an honest friendly man mrs turnbull had now set up her carriage and she was in her own opinion a very great personage she would have cut all her former acquaintance but on that point the captain was inflexible particularly as regarded the drummonds as far as they were concerned mrs turnbull gave way mrs drummond being a ladylike woman and mr drummond universally respected as a man of talent and information captain or rather mr turnbull was a constant visitor at our house and very partial to me he used to scold mr drummond for keeping me so close to my desk and would often persuade him to give me a couple of hours run when this was obtained he would call a waterman throw him a crown and tell him to get out of his wherry as fast as he could we then embarked and amused ourselves pulling up and down the river while mrs turnbull dressed in the extremity of the fashion rode out in the carriage and left her cards in every direction one day mr turnbull called upon the drummonds and asked them to dine with him on the following saturday they accepted the invitation bytheby said he i got what my wife calls a remind in my pocket and he pulled out of his coatpocket a large card with mr and mrs turnbulls compliments etcetera which card he had doubled in two by his sitting down upon it shortly after he came in mr turnbull straightened it again as well as he could and laid it on the table and jacob said he youll come too you dont want a remind but if you do my wife will send you one i replied that i wanted no remind for a good dinner no i dare say not my boy but recollect that you come an hour or two before the dinnerhour to help me theres so much fuss with one thing or another that im left in the lurch and as for trusting the keys of the spiritroom to that longtogged rascal of a butler ill see him harpoond first so do you come and help me jacob this having been promised he asked mr drummond to lend me for an hour or so as he wished to take a row up the river this was also consented to we embarked and pulled away for kew bridge mr turnbull was as good a hand at a yarn as old tom and many were the adventures he narrated to me of what had taken place during the vicissitudes of his life more especially when he was employed in the greenland fishery he related an accident that morning which particularly bore upon the marvellous although i do not believe that he was at all guilty of indulging in a travellers licence jacob said he i recollect once when i was very near eaten alive by foxes and that in a very singular manner i was then mate of a greenland ship we had been on the fishing ground for three months and had twelve fish on board finding we were doing well we fixed our iceanchors upon a very large iceberg drifting up and down with it and taking fish as we fell in with them one morning we had just cast loose the carcass of a fish which we had cut up when the man in the crows nest on the lookout for another fall cried out that a large polar bear and her cub were swimming over to the iceberg against the side of which and about halfamile from us the carcass of a whale was beating as we had nothing to do seven of us immediately started in chase we had intended to have gone after the foxes which had gathered there also in hundreds to prey upon the dead whale it was then quite calm we soon came up with the bear who at first was for making off but as the cub could not get on over the rough ice as well as the old one she at last turned round to bay we shot the cub to make sure of her and it did make sure of the dam not leaving us till either she or we perished in the conflict i never shall forget her moaning over the cub as it lay bleeding on the ice while we fired bullet after bullet into her at last she turned round gave a roar and a gnashing snarl which you might have heard a mile and with her eyes flashing fire darted upon us we received her in a body all close together with our lances to her breast but she was so large and strong that she beat us all back and two of us fell fortunately the others held their ground and as she was then on end three bullets were put into her chest which brought her down i never saw so large a beast in my life i dont wish to make her out larger than she really was but i have seen many a bullock at smithfield which would not weigh twothirds of her after that we had some trouble in despatching her and while we were so employed the wind blew up in gusts from the northward and the snow fell heavy the men were for returning to the ship immediately which certainly was the wisest thing for us all to do but i thought that the snowstorm would blow over in a short time and not wishing to lose so fine a skin resolved to remain and flay the beast for i knew that if left there a few hours as the foxes could not get hold of the carcass of the whale which had not grounded they would soon finish the bear and the cub and the skins be worth nothing well the other men went back to the ship and as it was the snowstorm came on so thick that they lost their way and would never have found her if it was not that the bell was kept tolling for a guide to them i soon found that i had done a very foolish thing instead of the storm blowing over the snow came down thicker and thicker and before i had taken a quarter of the skin off i was becoming cold and numbed and then i was unable to regain the ship and with every prospect of being frozen to death before the storm was over at last i knew what was my only chance i had flayed all the belly of the bear but had not cut her open i ripped her up tore out all her inside and then contrived to get into her body where i lay and having closed up the entrance hole was warm and comfortable for the animal heat had not yet been extinguished this manoeuvre no doubt saved my life and i have heard that the french soldiers did the same in their unfortunate russian campaign killing their horses and getting inside to protect themselves from the dreadful weather well jacob i had not lain more than halfanhour when i knew by sundry jerks and tugs at my newly invented hurricanehouse that the foxes were busyand so they were sure enough there must have been hundreds of them for they were at work in all directions and some pushed their sharp noses into the opening where i had crept in but i contrived to get out my knife and saw their noses across whenever they touched me otherwise i should have been eaten up in a very short time there were so many of them and they were so ravenous that they soon got through the bears thick skin and were tearing away at the flesh now i was not so much afraid of their eating me as i thought that if i jumped up and discovered myself they would have all fled no saying though two or three hundred ravenous devils take courage when together but i was afraid that they would devour my covering from the weather and then i should perish with the cold and i was also afraid of having pieces nipped out of me which would of course oblige me to quit my retreat at last daylight was made through the upper part of the carcass and i was only protected by the ribs of the animal between which every now and then their noses dived and nipped my sealskin jacket i was just thinking of shouting to frighten them away when i heard the report of halfadozen muskets and some of the bullets struck the carcass but fortunately did not hit me i immediately halloed as loud as i could and the men hearing me ceased firing they had fired at the foxes little thinking that i was inside of the bear i crawled out the storm was over and the men of the ship had come back to look for me my brother who was also a mate on board of the vessel who had not been with the first party had joined them in the search but with little hopes of finding me alive he hugged me in his arms covered as i was with blood as soon as he saw me hes dead now poor fellow thats the story jacob thank you sir replied i but perceiving that the memory of his brother affected him i did not speak again for a few minutes we then resumed our conversation and pulling back with the tide landed at the wharf on the day of the dinner party i went up to mr turnbulls at three oclock as he had proposed i found the house in a bustle mr and mrs turnbull with the butler and footman in the diningroom debating as to the propriety of this and that being placed here and there both servants giving their opinion and arguing on a footing of equality contradicting and insisting mr turnbull occasionally throwing in a word and each time snubbed by his wife although the servants dare not take any liberty with him do pray mr turnbull leave hus to settle these matters get hup your wine that is your department leave the room mr turnbull hif you please mortimer and i know what we are about without your hinterference oh by the lord i dont wish to interfere but i wish you and your servants not to be squabbling thats all if they gave me half the cheek do pray mr turnbull leave the room and allow me to regulate my own ousehold come jacob well go down into the cellar said mr turnbull and accordingly we went i assisted mr turnbull in his department as much as i could but he grumbled very much i cant bear all this nonsense all this finery and foolery everything comes up cold everything is out of reach the tables so long and so covered with uneatables that my wife is hardly within hail and by jingo with her the servants are masters not with me at all events for if they spoke to me as they do to mrs turnbull i would kick them out of the house however jacob theres no help for it all one asks for is quiet and i must put up with all this sometimes or i should have no quiet from one years end to another when a woman will have her way theres no stopping her you know the old verse a mans a fool who strives by force or skill to stem the torrent of a womans will for if she will she will you may depend ont and if she wont she wontand theres an end ont now lets go up into my room and we will chat while i wash my hands as soon as mr turnbull was dressed we went down into the drawingroom which was crowded with tables loaded with every variety of ornamental articles now this is what my wife calls fashionable one might as well be steering through an icefloe as try to come to an anchor here without running foul of something its hardaport or hardastarboard every minute and if your coattail jibes away goes something and whatever it is that smashes mrs t always swears it was the most valuable thing in the room im like a bull in a chinashop one comfort is that i never come in here except when theres company indeed im not allowed thank god sit on a chair jacob one of those spiderlike french things for my wife wont allow blacks as she calls them to come to an anchor upon her skyblue silk sofas how stupid to have furniture that ones not to make use of give me comfort but it appears thats not to be bought for money chapter sixteen high life above stairs a little below the markfashion french virtue and all that six oclock was now near at hand and mrs turnbull entered the drawingroom in full dress she certainly was a very handsome woman and had every appearance of being fashionable but it was her language which exposed her she was like the peacock as long as she was silent you could but admire the plumage but her voice spoilt all now mr turnbull said she i wish to hexplain to you that there are certain himproprieties in your behaviour which i cannot put hup with particularly that hof talking about when you were before the mast well my dear is that anything to be ashamed of yes mr turnbull that hisone halways sinks them ere particulars in fashionable society to wirtuperate in company ant pleasant and hive thought of a plan which may hact as an himpediment to your vulgarity recollect mr t whenhever i say that hive an eadache its to be a sign for you to old your tongue and mr t hoblige me by wearing kid gloves all the evening what at dinner time my dear yes mr t at dinner time your ands are not fit to be touched well i recollect when you thought otherwise when mr t ave i not often told you so yes lately but i referred to the time when one poll bacon of wapping took my hand for better or for worse really mr t you quite shock me my name was mary and the bacons are a good old hinglish name you ave their harms quartered on the carriage in right o me thats something i can tell you something i had to pay for pretty smartly at all events the payment mr t was on account of granting harms to you who never ad any and never wished for them what do i care for such stuff and when you did choose mr turnbull you might have consulted me instead of making yourself the laughingstock of sir george naylor and all the eralds who but a madman would have chosen three harpoons saluims and three barrels couchants with a spouting whale for a crest just to point out to everybody what should hever be buried in hoblivion and then your beastly mottowhich i would have changedblubber for ever blubber indeed henough to make hany one blubber for ever well the heralds told me they were just what i ought to have chosen and very apposite as they termed it they took your money and laughed at you two pair of griffins a lion halfadozen leopards and a hand with a dagger wouldnt ave cost a farthing more but what can you hexpect from an og but if i was cured i should be what you werebacon i wont demean myself mr turnbull thats right my dear dont theres no curing you recollect the motto you chose in preference to mine well and a very proper onetoo much familiarity breeds contempt is it not so master faithful yes madam it was one of our copies at school i beg your pardon sir it was my hown hinvention rap tap rap tap tap tap tap mr and mrs peters of petercumb hall announced the butler enter mrs peters first a very diminutive lady and followed by mr peters six feet four inches without his shoes deduct for stooping and curved shoulders seven inches mr peters had retired from the stock exchange with a competence bought a place named it petercumb hall and set up his carriage another knock and mr and mrs drummond were announced compliments exchanged and a pastile lighted by mrs turnbull well drummond said mr turnbull what are coals worth now mr turnbull ive got such an eadache this was of course a matter of condolence from all present and a stopper upon mr turnbulls tongue another sounding rap and a pause monsieur and madame de tagliabue coming up enter monsieur and madame de tagliabue the former a dapper little frenchman with a neat pair of legs and stomach as round as a pea madame sailing in like an outwardbound east indiaman with studding sails below and aloft so large in her dimensions that her husband might be compared to the pilotboat plying about her stern charmee de vous voir madame tombulle vous vous portez bien nestce pas ve replied mrs turnbull who thus exhausted her knowledge of the french language while the monsieur tried in vain first on one side and then on the other to get from under the lee of his wife and make his bow this was not accomplished until the lady had taken possession of a sofa which she filled most comfortably who these people were and how they lived i never could find out they came in a fly from brentford another announcement my lord babbleton and mr smith coming up mr t pray go down and receive his lordship there are two wax candles for you to light on the hall table and you must walk up with them before his lordship said the lady aside ill be hanged if i do replied mr turnbull let the servants light him o mr t ive such an eadache so you may have replied mr t sitting down doggedly in the meantime mr smith entered leading lord babbleton a boy of twelve or thirteen years old shy awkward redhaired and ugly to whom mr smith was tutor mrs t had found out mr smith who was residing near brentford with his charge and made his acquaintance on purpose to have a lord on her visiting list and to her delight the leader had not forgotten to bring his bear with him mrs turnbull sprang to the door to receive them making a prepared courtesy to the aristocratical cub and then shaking him respectfully by the hand wont your lordship walk to the fire isnt your lordship cold i hope your lordships sty is better in your lordships eye allow me to introduce to your lordships notice mr and mrs petersmadame and mounsheer tagleebuemr and mrs drummond the right honourable lord viscount babbleton as for mr turnbull and myself we were left out as unworthy of introduction we are ready for dinner mr turnbull snobbs get dinner dressed up said mr t to the butler o mr t ive such an eadache this last headache was produced by mr t forgetting himself and calling the butler by his real name which was snobbs but mrs turnbull had resolved that it should be changed to mortimeror rather to mr mortimer as the household were directed to call him on pain of expulsion dinner was announced madame tagliabue upon what pretence i know not was considered the first lady in the room and lord babbleton was requested by mrs turnbull to hand her down madame rose took his lordships hand and led him away before they were out of the room his lordship had disappeared among the ample folds of madames gown and was seen no more until she pulled him out on their arrival at the dinnertable at last we were all arranged according to mrs turnbulls wishes although there were several chops and changes about until the order of precedence could be correctly observed a french cook had been sent for by mrs turnbull and not being mistress of the language she had a card with the names of the dishes to refresh her memory mr mortimer having informed her that such was always the custom among great people who not ordering their own dinners of course they could not tell what there was to eat mrs turnbull what soup have you there consummy soup my lord will your lordship make use of that or of this here which is ojuss his lordship stared made no answer looked foolish and mr mortimer placed some soup before him lord babbleton takes soup said mr smith pompously and the little right honourable supped soup much to mrs turnbulls satisfaction madame do you soup or do you fish merci no souppoisson dont be afraid madame weve a french cook you wont be poisoned here replied mrs turnbull rather annoyed comment my chere madame i meant to say dat i prefer de cod mr t some soup for madame john a clean plate for lord babbleton what will your lordship condescend to make use of now mrs turnbull thought the phrase make use excessively refined and elegant ah madame votre cuisine est superbe exclaimed monsieur tagliabue tucking the corner of his napkin into his buttonhole and making preparations for well filling his little rotundity ve replied mrs turnbull mrs peters will you try the dish next mr turnbull what is it looking at her cardagno roty will you my lord if your lordship has not yet got into your french it means roast quarter of lamb his lordship is very partial to lamb said mr

turnbull the first course was removed and the second after some delay made its appearance in the interim mr mortimer handed round one or two varieties of wine drummond will you take a glass of wine with me said mr turnbull i hate your sour french wines will you take madeira i was on shore at madeira once for a few hours when i was before the mast in the mr turnbull ive such an eadache cried his lady in an angry tone my lord will you take some of thisit is ding dong o turfa turkey my lord his lordship is fond of turkey said mr smith dictatorially monsieur tagliabue who sat on the other side

lady red as a quarter of beef permettez said monsieur looking at the card ah cest impossible ma chere continued he laughing madame turnbull se trompait elle voudrait dire beignets de pommes vous trouvez notre langue fort difficile nestce pas continued madame who recovered her good humour and smiled graciously at mrs t ve replied mrs turnbull who perceived that she had made some mistake and was anxiously awaiting the issue of the dialogue it had however the effect of checking mrs t who said little more during the dinner and dessert at last the ladies rose from the dessert and left the gentlemen at the table but we were not permitted to remain long before coffee was announced and we went up stairs a variety of french liqueurs were handed about and praised by most of the company mr turnbull however ordered a glass of brandy as a settler oh mr turnbull ive such an eadache after that the party became very dull lord babbleton fell asleep on the sofa mr peters walked round the room admiring the pictures and asking the names of the masters i really quite forget but mr drummond you are a judge of paintings i hear who do you think this is painted by said the lady pointing to a very inferior performance i am not quite sure but i think it is vanvan daub i should think so too replied mr drummond drily we have a great many pictures in england by the same hand the french gentleman proposed ecarte but no one knew how to play it except his wife who sat down with him to pass away the time the ladies sauntered about the room looking at the contents of the tables mrs peters occasionally talking of petercumb hall mr smith played at patience in one corner while mr turnbull and mr drummond sat in another in close conversation and the lady of the house divided her attentions running from one to the other and requesting them not to talk so loud as to awake the right honourable lord viscount babbleton at last the vehicles were announced and the fashionable party broke up much to the satisfaction of everybody and to none more than myself i ought to observe that all the peculiar absurdities i have narrated did not strike me so much at the time but it was an event to me to dine out and the scene was well impressed upon my memory after what occurred to me in my after life and when i became better able to judge of fashionable pretensions the whole was vividly brought back to my recollection chapter seventeen the tomkinses fete champetre and fete dansantelights among the gooseberrybushesall went off well excepting the lights they went outa winding up that had nearly proved a catastropheold tom proves that danger makes friends by a yarn young tom by a fact i remained with mr drummond about eight months when at last the new clerk made his appearancea little fat fellow about twenty with a face as round as a full moon thick lips and red cheeks during this time i frequently had the pleasure of meeting with old and young tom who appeared very anxious that i should rejoin them and i must say that i was equally willing to return to the lighter still mr drummond put his veto on it and mrs drummond was also constantly pointing out the very desirable situation i might have on shore as a clerk in the office but i could not bear itseated nearly the whole dayperched up on a high stoolturning over debtors contra creditors and only occasionally interrupted by the head clerk with his attempt to make rhymes the new clerk came i expected my release but i was disappointed mr drummond discovered him to be so awkward and the head clerk declared that the time was so busy that he could not spare me this was true mr drummond had just come to a final arrangement which had been some time pending by which he purchased a wharf and large warehouses with a house adjoining in lower thames streeta very large concern for which he had paid a considerable sum of money what with the valuations winding up of the brentford concern on the old account etcetera there was much to do and i toiled at the desk until the removal took place and when the family were removed i was still detained as there was no warehouseman to superintend the unloading and hoisting up of goods mr tomkins the head clerk who had been many years a faithful servant to mr drummond was admitted a partner and had charge of the brentford wharf a species of promotion which he and his wife resolved to celebrate with a party after a long debate it was resolved that they should give a ball and mrs tomkins exerted all her taste and ingenuity on the occasion my friend tomkins lived at a short distance from the premises in a small house surrounded with half an acre of garden chiefly filled with gooseberrybushes and perambulated by means of four straight gravel walks mr and mrs drummond were invited and accepted the invitation which was considered by the tomkinses as a great mark of condescension as a specimen of mr tomkinss poetical talents i shall give his invitation to mr drummond written in the very best german text mr and mrs t sincerely hope to see mr and mrs drum mond to a very hum ble party that they in tend to ask their kin to on the saturday of the week ensuing when fiddles they will play and other things be doing belle vue house to which jeu desprit mr drummond answered with a pencil on a card mr and mrs drum mond intend to come here give tomkins that jacob it will please him better than any formal acceptation mr and mrs turnbull were also asked the former accepted but the latter indignantly refused when i arrived with mr and mrs drummond many of the company were there the garden was what they called illuminated that is every gooseberrybush had one variegated lamp suspended above the centre and as mr tomkins told me afterwards the lamps were red and yellow according to the fruit they bore it was a cold frosty clear night and the lamps twinkled as brightly among the bare boughs of the gooseberry trees as the stars did in the heavens the company in general were quite charmed with the novelty quite a minor wauxhall cried one lady whose exuberance of fat kept her warm enough to allow her to stare about in the open air the entrance porch had a dozen little lamps backed with laurel twigs and looked very imposing mrs tomkins received her company upon the steps outside that she might have the pleasure of hearing their praises of her external arrangements still it was freezing and she shivered not a little the drawingroom fourteen feet by ten was fitted up as a ballroom with two fiddlers and a fifer sitting in a corner and a countrydance was performing when we arrived over the mantlepiece was a square of laurel twigs inclosing as a frame this couplet from the poetical brain of the master of the house cut out in red paper and bespangled with blue and yellow tinsel here we are to dance so gay while the fiddlers play away other appropriate distichs which i have now forgotten were framed in the same way on each of the other compartments but the diningroom was the chef doeuvre it was formed into a bower with evergreens and on the evergreen boughs were stuck real apples and oranges in all directions so that you could help yourself vell i do declare this is a paradise exclaimed the fat lady who entered with me in all but one thing maam replied mr turnbull who with his coat off was squeezing lemons for the punchtheres no forbidden fruit you may help yourself the bonmot was repeated by mr tomkins to the end of his existence not only for its own sake but because it gave him an opportunity of entering into a detail of the whole fetethe first he had ever given in his life ah jacob my boy glad to see youcome and help here theyll soon be thirsty ill warrant said mr turnbull who was in his glory the company although not so very select were very happy they danced drank punch laughed and danced again and it was not till a late hour long after mr and mrs drummond had gone home that i quitted the festive scene mr turnbull who walked away with me declaring that it was worth a dozen of his party although they had not such grand people as mrs tagliabue or the right honourable lord viscount babbleton i thought so too every one was happy and every one at their ease and i do believe they would have stayed much longer but the musicians took so much punch that one fiddler broke his fiddle the other broke his head in going down the steps into the garden and the fifer swore he could blow no longer so as there was an end to the music clogs pattens and lanterns were called for the shawls were brought out of the kitchen and every one went away nothing could go off better mrs tomkins had a cold and rheumatism the next day but that was not surprising a minor wauxhall not being seasonable in the month of december a week after this party we removed to thames street and i performed the duty of warehouseman our quantity of lighters was now much increased and employed in carrying dry goods etcetera one morning old tom came under the crane to discharge his lighter and wishing to see me when the fall had been overhauled down to heave up the casks with which the lighter was laden instead of hooking on a cask held on by his hands crying hoist away intending to be hoisting himself up to the door of the warehouse where i was presiding now there was nothing unusual in this whim of old toms but still he ran a very narrow chance in consequence of an extra whim of young toms who as soon as his father was suspended in the air caught hold of his two wooden stumps to be hoisted up also and as he caught hold of them standing on tiptoe they both swung clear of the lighter which could not approach to within five feet of the buildings the crane was on the third story of the warehouse and very high up tom tom you rascal what the devil are you about cried the old man when he felt the weight of his sons body hanging to him going up along with you fatherhope we shall go to heaven the same way more likely to go to the devil together you little fool i never can bear your weight hoist away there quick hearing the voices i looked out of the door and perceiving their situation ordered the men to hoist as fast as they could before old toms strength should be exhausted but it was a compound moving crane and we could not hoist very fast although we could hoist very great weights at last as they were wound up higher and higher old toms strength was going fast o tom tom what must be done i canti cant hold on but a little longer and we shall be both dashed to pieces my poor boy well then ill let go father it was all my folly and ill be the sufferer let go cried old tom no no tomdont let go my boy ill try a little longer dont let go my dear boydont let go well father how much longer can you hold on a littlevery little longer replied the old man struggling well hold fast now cried young tom who raising his head above his arms with great exertion shifted one of his hands to his fathers thigh then the other raising himself as before he then caught at the seat of his fathers trousers with his teeth old tom groaned for his son had taken hold of more than the garments he then shifted his hands round his fathers bodyfrom thence he gained the collar of his jacketfrom the collar he climbed on his fathers shoulders from thence he seized hold of the fall above and relieved his father of the weight now father are you all right cried tom panting as he clung to the fall above him i cant hold on ten seconds more tomno longermy clutch is going now hang on by your eyelids father if you love me cried young tom in agony it was indeed an awful moment they were now at least sixty feet above the lighter suspended in the air the men whirled round the wheel and i had at last the pleasure of hauling them both in on the floor of the warehouse the old man so exhausted that he could not speak for more than a minute young tom as soon as all was safe laughed immoderately old tom sat upright it might have been no laughing matter mr tom said he looking at his son whats done cant be helped father as jacob says after all youre more frightened than hurt i dont know that you young scamp replied the old man putting his hand behind him and rubbing softly youve bit a piece clean out of my starn now let this be a warning to you tom jacob my boy couldnt you say that ive met with an accident and get a drop of something from mr drummond i thought after his last observation i might honestly say that he had met with an accident and i soon returned with a glass of brandy which old tom was drinking off when his son interrupted him for a share you know father i shared the danger yes tom i know you did replied the father but this was sent to me on account of my accident and as i had that all to myself i shall have all this too but father you ought to give me a drop if it were only to take the taste out of my mouth your own flesh and blood tom replied his father emptying his glass well i always heard it was quite unnatural not to like your own flesh and blood replied tom but i see now that there may be reasons for it be content tom replied his father putting down the glass were now just square youve had your raw nip and ive had mine mr drummond now came up and asked what had been the matter nothing sironly an accident tom and i had a bit of a hoist as this last word had a double meaning mr drummond thought that a cask had surged when coming out of the lighter and struck them down he desired old tom to be more careful and walked away while we proceeded to unload the lighter the new clerk was a very heavy simple young man plodding and attentive certainly but he had no other merit he was sent into the lighter to rake the marks and numbers of the casks as they were hoisted up and soon became a butt to young tom who gave him the wrong marks and numbers of all the casks to his interrogations whats that boy cried the puddingfaced fellow with his pencil in one hand and his book in the other pea soup replied tom ladies bonnets now then master chalk again pipeclay for sodgers red herrings all of which were carefully noted down by mr grubbins who when the lighter was cleared took the memoranda to mr drummond fortunately we had checked the number of the casks as they were received abovetheir contents were flour mr drummond sent for young tom and asked him how he dared play such a trick tom replied very boldly that it was meant as a good lesson to the young man that in future he did his own work and did not trust to others to this mr drummond agreed and master tom was dismissed without punishment as the men had all gone to dinner i went down into the lighter to have a little chat with my old shipmates well jacob said old tom toms not a bit wiser than he was beforetwo scrapes today already well father if i prove my folly by getting into scrapes i prove my wit by getting out of them yes that may be true tom but suppose we had both come down with a run what would you have thought then i suspect father that i should have been past thinking i once did see a thing of that kind happen said old tom calling to mind former scenes in his life and ill tell you a yarn about it boys because they say danger makes friends we sat down by old tom who narrated as follows when i was captain of the maintop in the la minerve fortyfour gun frigate we were the smartest ship up the mediterranean and manys the exercise we were the means of giving to other ships companies because they could not beat usno not even hold a candle to us in both fore and maintop we had eightandtwenty as smart chaps as ever put their foot to a rattling or slid down by an ater backstay now the two captains of the foretop were both prime young men active as monkeys and bold as lions one was named tom herbert from north shields a dark goodlooking chap with teeth as white as a niggers and a merry chap he was always ashowing them the other was a cockney chap your lunnuners arnt often good seamen but when they are seamen theres no better they never allow any one to show them the way thats for sartin being naturally spunky sort of chaps and full of tricks and fun this fellows name was bill wiggins and between him and herbert there was always a jealousy who should be the smartest man ive seen both of them run out on the yard in fine weather without holding on nothing seize the lift and down to their station haul up the earing in no time up by the lift again and down on deck by the backstay before half the men had time to get clear of the top in fact they often risked their lives in bad weather when there was no occasion for it that one might outdo the other now this was all very well and a good example to the other men the captain and officers appeared to like these contests for superiority but it ended in their hating each other and not being even on speaking terms which as the two captains of the top was bad they had quarrelled often and fought five times neither proving the better man either both done up or parted by the masteratarms and reported to the first lieutenant so that at last they were not so much countenanced by the officers and were out of favour with the captain who threatened to disrate them both if ever they fought again we were cruising off the gulf of lyons where sometimes it blows hard enought to blew the devils horns off though the gales never last very long we were under close reefed fore and maintop sails storm staysail and trysail when there was a fresh hand at the bellows and the captain desired the officers of the watch just before dinner to take in the foretop sail not to disturb the watch below the maintop men were ordered up forward to help the foretop men of the watch and i was of course aloft ready to lie out on the lee yardarmwhen wiggins who had the watch below came up in the top not liking that herbert should be at work in such weather without he being there too tom says to me ill take the yardarm very well say i with all my heart then ill look to the bunt just at that time there came on a squall with rain which almost blinded us the sail was taken in very neatly the clewlines chockablock buntlines and leechlines well up reeftackles overhauled rollingtackles taut and all as it should be the men lied out on the yard the squall wore worse and worse but they were handing in the leech of the sail when snap went one buntline then the other the sail flapped and flagged till away went the leechlines and the men clung to the yards for their lives for the sail mastered them and they could do nothing at last it split like thunder buffeting the men on the yardarms till they were almost senseless until to windward it wore away into long coach whips and the whole of the canvas left was at the lee yardarm the men laid in at last with great difficulty quite worn out by fatigue and clinging for their existence all but wiggins who was barred by the sail to leeward from making his footing good on the horse and there he was poor fellow completely in irons and so beaten by the canvas that he could hardly be said to be sensible it takes a long while to tell all this but it wasnt the work of a minute at last he made an attempt to get up by the lift but was struck down and would have been hurled overboard if it hadnt been that his leg fell over the horse and there he was head downwards hanging over a raging sea ready to swallow him up as soon as he dropt into it as every one expected he would be beat off before any assistance could be given you may guess that it was an awful moment to those below who were looking up at him watching for his fall and the roll of the ship to see if he fell clear into the sea or was dashed to pieces in the forechains i couldnt bear to see a fellowcreature and good seaman in the bargain in that state and although the captain dare not order any one to help him yet there were one or two midshipmen hastening up the forerigging with the intent i have no doubt of trying to save him for midshipmen dont value their lives at a quid of tobacco so i seizes the studding sail halyards and runs up the topmast rigging intending to go down by the lift and pass a bowling knot round him before he fell when who should i meet at the crosstrees but tom herbert who snatched the rope out of my hand bawling to me through the gale this is my business tom down he goes by the lift the remainder of the canvas flapped over him and i seed no more until i heard a cry from all below and away went herbert and wiggins both together flying to leeward just as the ship was taking her recovery to windward fortunately they both fell clear of the ship about two feet not more and as their fall was expected they had prepared below a masters mate of the name of simmonds and the captain of the forecastle both went overboard in bowling knots with another in their hands and in a minute or two they were all four on board again but herbert and were both senseless and a long while coming to again well now what do you think was the upshot of it why they were the best friends in the world ever afterwards and would have died for one another and if one had a glass of grog from the officers for any little job instead of touching his forelock and drinking it off to the officers health he always took it out of the gunroom that he might give half of it to the other so dye see my boys as i said before i began my yarn that danger makes friends tis said we ventrous die hard when we leave the shore our friends may mourn lest we return to bless their sight no more but this is all a notion bold jack cant understand some die upon the ocean and some die upon dry land and if we had tumbled father we should have just died betwixt and between not water enough to float us it would have been woolez wous parlez wous plump in the mud as you say sometimes why yes tom ive a notion that i should have been planted too deep ever to have struck replied the old man looking at his wooden stumps why yes father legs are legs when you tumble into six foot of mud how you would have dibbled down if your daddles hadnt held on well then tom recollect that you never sell your father for a lark again tom laughed and catching at the word although used in a different sense sung just like the lark high poised in air and so were you father only you didnt sing as he does and you didnt leave your young one below in the nest ay it is the young uns which prevent the old ones from rising in the worldthats very true tom holla who have we got here my service to you at all events chapter eighteen the art of hard lying made easy though i am made very uneasy by hard lyingi send my ruler as a missive to let the parties concerned know that i am a rebel to tyrannical rulei am arraigned tried and condemned without a hearingwhat i lose in speech is made up in feeling the whole wound up with magnanimous resolves and a little sobbing it was the captain of the american schooner from out of which we were then taking the casks of flour weve no sarvice in our country ive a notion my old bobtail roarer said he when do you come alongside of my schooner for tother lading with this raft of yours not tonight i guess well youve guessed right this time replied old tom we shall lie on the mud till tomorrow morning with your permission yes for all the world like a louisiana alligator you take things coolly ive a notion in the old country i dont want to be hanging head and starn in this little bit of a river of yourn i must be back to new york afore fever time she be a pretty craft that little thing of yours observed old tom how long may she take to make the run how long i expect in just no time and shed go as fast again only she wont wait for the breeze to come up with her why dont you heaveto for it said young tom lose too much time i guess i have been chased by an easterly wind all the way from your lands end to our narrows and it never could overhaul me and i presume the porpoises give it up in despair dont they replied old tom with a leer and yet ive seen the creatures playing across the bows of an english frigate at her speed and laughing at her they never play their tricks with me old snapper if they do i cuts them in halves and astarn they go head part floating on one side and tail part on the other but dont they join together again when they meet in your wake inquired tom shouldnt wonder replied the american captain pray captain what may be that vessel they talk so much about at new york old tom referred to the first steam vessel whose qualities at that time had been tried and an exaggerated report of which had been copied from the american papers that ship or whatever she may be that sails without masts yards or canvas it is quite above my comprehension old country heads cant take it in ill tell you whatshe goes slick through the water ahead or astarn broadside on or up or down or any way and all you have to do is to poke the fire and warm your fingers and the more you poke the faster she goes gainst wind and tide well i must see that to believe it though replied old tom no fear of a capsize i calculate my little craft did upset with me one night in a pretty comfortable heavy gal but shes smart and came up again on the other side in a moment all right as before never should have known anything about it if the man at the wheel had not found his jacket wet and the men below had a round turn in all the clews of their hammocks after that round turn you may belay cried young tom laughing yes but dont lets have a stopper over all tom replied his father i consider all this excessively divarting pray captain does everything else go fast in the new country everything with us clean slick i guess what sort of horses have you in america inquired i our kentucky horses ive a notion would surprise you theyre almighty goers at a trot beat a north west gal of wind i once took an englishman with me in a gig up allibama country and he says whats this great churchyard we are passing through and stranger says i i calculate its nothing but the milestones we are passing so slick but i once had a horse who i expect was a deal quicker than that i once seed a flash of lightning chase him for halfanhour round the clearance and i guess it couldnt catch him but i cant wait no longer i expect youll come alongside tomorrow afore meridian ay ay master replied old tom tuning up twas post meridian halfpast four by signal i from nancy parted at five she lingered on the shore with uplift eyes and brokenhearted i calculate you are no fool of a screamer said the american shoving off his boat from the barge and pulling to his vessel and i calculate youre no fool of a liar said young tom well so he is but i do like a good lie jacob theres some fun in it but what the devil does the fellow mean by calling a gale of winda gal i dont know replied tom unless for the same reason that we call a girl a blowing our conversation was here interrupted by mr hodgson the new head clerk of whom i have hitherto said nothing he came into the establishment in the place of mr tomkins when we quitted the battersea wharf and had taken an evident dislike to me which appeared to increase every day as mr drummond gave me fresh marks of his approbation you faithful come out of that barge directly and go to your desk i will have no eyeservers under me come out sir directly i say mr quilldriver cried old tom do you mean for to say that jacob is an eyesarver yes i do and want none of your impertinence or ill unship you you old blackguard well then for the first part of your story my sarvice to you and you lies and as for the second that remains to be proved mr hodgsons temper was not softened by this reply of old tom my blood was also up for i had borne much already and young tom was bursting with impatience to take my part he walked carelessly by the head clerk saying to me as he passed by why i thought jacob you were prentice to the river but it seems that youre bound to the countinghouse how long do you mean to sarve i dont know replied i as i walked away sulkily but i wish i was out of my time very well sir i shall report your behaviour to mr drummond ill make him know your tricks tricks you wont let him know his tricks his duty is to take his trick at the wheel replied old tom not to be brought up at your cheating tricks at the desk cheating tricks you old scoundrel what do you mean by that replied mr hodgson in a rage my father means ledgerdemain i suppose replied young tom this repartee from a quarter so little expected sent off the head clerk more wroth than ever you seemed to hit him hard there tom said his father but i cant say that i understand how youve had me taught to read and write father replied young tom and ater that a lad may teach himself everything i pick up every day here and there and i never see a thing or a word that i dont understand but i find out the meaning when i can i picked up that hard word at bartlemy fair and very hard you hit him with it who wouldnt to serve a friend but mark my words father this wont last long theres a squall blowing up and jacob quiet as he seems to be will show his teeth ere long tom was correct in his surmise i had not taken my seat at my desk more than a minute when mr hodgson entered and commenced a tirade of abuse which my pride could no longer allow me to submit to an invoice perfectly correct and wellwritten which i had nearly completed he snatched from before me tore into fragments and ordered me to write it over again indignant at this treatment i refused and throwing down my pen looked at him determinedly in the face irritated at this defiance he caught up a directory and threw it at my head no longer able to command myself i seized a ruler and returned the salute it was whizzing through the air as mr drummond entered the room and he was just in time to witness mr hodgson struck on the forehead and felled to the ground while i remained with my arm raised standing upon the crossbar of my high stool my face glowing with passion appearances were certainly against me assistance was summoned and the head clerk removed to his chamber during all which time i remained seated on my stool before the desk my breast heaving with tumultuous feelings how long i remained there i cannot say it might have been two hours feelings long dormant had been aroused and whirled round and round in a continual cycle in my feverish brains i should have remained probably much longer in this state of absorption had i not been summoned to attend mr drummond it appeared that in the meantime mr hodgson had come to his own senses and had given his own version of the fracas which had been to an unjustifiable degree corroborated by the stupid young clerk who was no friend of mine and who sought favour with his principal i walked up to the drawingroom where i found mr and mrs drummond and little sarah whose eyes were red with crying i entered without any feeling of alarm my breast was too full of indignation mrs drummond looked grave and mournful mr drummond severe jacob faithful i have sent for you to tell you that in consequence of your disgraceful conduct to my senior clerk you can no longer remain under my roof it appears that what i have been a witness to this day has been but a sequel to behaviour equally improper and impertinent that so far from having as i thought done your duty you have constantly neglected it and that the association you have formed with that drunken old man and his insolent son has led you into this folly you may say that it was not your wish to remain on shore and that you preferred being on the river at your age it is too often the case that young people consult their wishes rather than their interests and it is well for them if they find those who are older and wished them well to decide for them i had hoped to have been able to place you in a more respectable situation in society than was my original intention when you were thrown upon me a destitute orphan but i now perceive my error you have proved yourself not only deceitful but ungrateful i have not interrupted i calmly you have i have been a witness myself to your impropriety of conduct which it appears has long been concealed from me but no more of that i bound you apprentice to the river and you must now follow up your apprenticeship but expect nothing farther from me you must now work your own way up in the world and i trust that you will reform and do well you may return to the lighter until i can procure you a situation in another craft for i consider it my duty to remove you from the influence of those who have led you astray and with the old man and his son you will not remain i have one thing more to say you have been in my countinghouse for some months and you are now about to be thrown upon the world there are ten pounds for your services and mr drummond laid the money on the table you may also recollect that i have some money belonging to you which has been laid by until you shall be out of your apprenticeship i consider it my duty still to retain that money for you as soon as your apprenticeship is expired you may demand it and it shall be made over to you i trust sincerely trust jacob that the severe lesson you are now about to receive will bring you to a sense of what is right and that you will forget the evil counsel you have received from your late companions do not attempt to justify yourself it is useless mr drummond then rose and left the room i should have replied had it not been for this last sentence of mr drummonds which again roused the feeling of indignation which in their presence had been gradually giving way to softer emotions i therefore stood still and firmly met the glance of mr drummond as he passed me my looks were construed into hardness of heart it appeared that mr drummond had left the room by previous arrangement that he might not be supposed to be moved from this purpose and that mrs drummond was then to have talked to me and to have ascertained how far there was a chance of my pleading guilty and begging for a mitigation of my sentence but the firm composure of innocence was mistaken for defiance and the blood mounting to my forehead from a feeling of injusticeof injustice from those i loved and venerated perhaps the most poignant feeling in existence to a sensitive and generous mindwas falsely estimated as proceeding from impetuous and disgraceful sources mrs drummond looked upon me with a mournful face sighed and said nothing little sarah watching me with her large black eyes as if she would read my inmost soul have you nothing to say jacob at last observed mrs drummond that i can tell mr drummond when his anger is not so great nothing madam replied i except that ill try to forgive him this reply was offensive even to the mild mrs drummond she rose from her chair come sarah said she and she walked out of the room wishing me in a kind soft voice a goodbye jacob as she passed me my eyes swam with tears i tried to return the salutation but i was too much choked by my feelings i could not speak and my silence was again looked upon as contumacy and ingratitude little sarah still remainedshe had not obeyed her mothers injunctions to follow her she was now nearly fourteen years old and i had known her as a companion and a friend for five years during the last six months that i had resided in the house we had become more intimately acquainted i joined her in the evening in all her pursuits and mr and mrs drummond appeared to take a pleasure in our intimacy i loved her as a dear sister my love was based on gratitude i had never forgotten her kindness to me when i first came under her fathers roof and a long acquaintance with the sweetness of her disposition had rendered the attachment so firm that i felt i could have died for her but i never knew the full extent of the feeling until now that i was about to leave her perhaps for ever my heart sank when mr drummond left the rooma bitter pang passed through it as the form of mrs drummond vanished from my sight but now was to be the bitterest of all i felt it and i remained with the handle of the door in my hand gasping for breath blinded with the tears that coursed each other rapidly down my cheeks i remained a minute in this state when i felt that sarah touched my other listless hand jacob she would have said but before half my name was out she burst into tears and sobbed on my shoulder my heart was too much surcharged not to take the infectionmy grief found vent and i mingled my sobs with those of the affectionate girl when we were more composed i recounted to her all that had passed and one at least in the world acknowledged that i had been treated unjustly i had but just finished when the servant interrupted us with a message to sarah that her mother desired her presence she threw herself into my arms and bade me farewell i released her she hastened to obey her mother but perceiving the money still upon the table she pointed to it your money jacob no sarah i will not accept it i would accept of anything from those who treat me kindly and feel more and more grateful to them but that i will not accepti cannot and you must not let it be left here say that i could not take it sarah would have remonstrated but perceiving that i was firm and at the same time perhaps entering into my feelings she again bade me farewell and hastened away the reader may easy imagine that i did not put off my departure i hastened to pack up my clothes and in less than ten minutes after sarah had quitted me i was on board the lighter with old tom and his son who were then going to supper they knew a part of what had happened and i narrated the rest well replied old tom after i had finished my story i didnt know that i have done you any harm jacob and im sorry that mr drummond should suppose so im fond of a drop thats true but i appeals to you whether i ever force it on youand whether i dont check that boy as much as i can but then dye see although i preach i dont practise thats the worst of it and i know ive to answer for making tom so fond of grog and though i never says anything about it i often think to myself that if tom should chance to be pressed some of these days and be punished for being in liquor hell think of his old father and curse him in his heart when he eyes the cat flourishing round before it strikes ill curse the cat father or the boatswains mate or the officer who complained of me or the captain who flogs me or my own folly but ill be hanged if ever i curse you who have been so kind to me replied tom taking his fathers hand well we must hope for the best my dear boy replied old tom but jacob youve not had fair play that sartain its very true that master did take you as an orphan and help you to an education but thats no reason why he should take away your free will and after binding you prentice to the river perch you up on a high stool and grind your nose down to the desk if so be he was so kind to you only to make you a slave why then there was no kindness at all in my opinion and as for punishment without hearing what a man has to say in his own defencetheres neer a tartar in the sarvice but would allow a man to speak before he orders him to strip i recollect a story about that in the sarvice but im in no humour to spin a yarn now now you see jacob master drummond has done a great deal for you and now he has undone a great deal i cant pretend to balance the account but it does appear to me that you dont owe him much for what thanks is there if you take a vessel in tow and then cast her off halfway when she most needs your assistance but what hurts me most is his saying that you shant stay in the lighter with us if you had you shouldnt have wanted as long as pay and pension are forthcoming never mindtom my boy bring out the bottlehang care it killed the cat the grog did not however bring back old toms spirits the evening passed heavily and we retired to our beds at a seasonable hour as we were to drop down to the schooner early the next morning that night i did not close my eyes i ran over in my mind all that had occurred and indignation took full possession of my soul my whole life passed in review before me i travelled back to my former daysto the time which had been almost obliterated from my memory when i had navigated the barge with my father again was the scene of his and my mothers death presented to my view again i saw him disappear and the column of black smoke ascend to the sky the dominie the matron marables and fleming the scene in the cabinall passed in rapid succession i felt that i had done my duty and that i had been unjustly treated my head ached with tumultuous and long suppressed feelings reader i stated that when i was first taken in hand by mr drummond i was a savage although a docile one to be reclaimed by kindness and kindness only you may have been surprised at the rapid change which took place in a few years that change was produced by kindness the conduct of mr drummond of his amiable wife and daughter had been all kindness the dominie and the worthy old matron had proved equally beneficent marables had been kind and although now and then as in the case of the usher at the school and fleming on board the lighter i had received injuries still these were but trifling checks to the uninterrupted series of kindness with which i had been treated by everybody thus was my nature rapidly formed by a system of kindness assisted by education and had this been followed up in a few years my new character would have been firmly established but the blow was now struck injustice roused up the latent feelings of my nature and when i rose the next morning i was changed i do not mean to say that all that precept and education had done for me was overthrown but if not overthrown it was so shaken to the base so rent from the summit to the foundation that at the slightest impulse in a wrong direction it would have fallen in and left nothing but a mixed chaos of ruined prospects if anything could hold it together it was the kindness and affection of sarah to which i would again and again return in my revolving thoughts as the only bright star to be discovered in my clouded horizon how dangerous how foolish how presumptuous it is in adults to suppose that they can read the thoughts and the feelings of those of a tender age how often has this presumption on their part been the ruin of a young mind which if truly estimated and duly fostered would have blossomed and produced good fruit the blush of honest indignation is as dark as the blush of guilt and the paleness of concentrated courage as marked as that of fear the firmness of conscious innocence is but too often mistaken as the effrontery of hardened vice and the tears springing from a source of injury the tongue tied from the oppression of a wounded heart the trembling and agitation of the little frame convulsed with emotion have often and often been ascribed by prejudging and selfopinionated witnesses to the very opposite passions to those which have produced them youth should never be judged harshly and even when judged correctly should it be in an evil course may always be reclaimedthose who decide otherwise and leave it to drift about the world have to answer for the castaway chapter nineteen the breach widenedi turn sportsman poacher and desperadosome excellent notions propounded of common law upon common rightsthe common keeper uncommonly savagei warn him offhe prophesies that we shall both come to the gallowssome men are prophets in their own countrythe man right after all hollo in the lighter therei say you lighter boy were words i heard as i was pacing the deck of the vessel in deep cogitation tom and his father were both in the cabin there could be no doubt but that they were addressed to me i looked up and perceived the grinning stupid sneering face of the young clerk gubbins why dont you answer when youre called to heh continued the numbskull youre wanted up here come up directly who wants me replied i reddening with anger whats that to you do you mean to obey my order or not no i do not replied i im not under the orders of such a fool thank god and if you come within my reach ill try if i cant break your head thick as it is as well as your masters the lout disappeared and i continued to pace up and down as i afterwards discovered the message was from mrs drummond who requested to speak to me sarah had communicated the real facts of my case and mrs drummond had been convinced that what i had said was correct she had talked with her husband she pointed out to him that my conduct under mr tomkins had been so exemplary that there must have been some reason for so sudden a change sarah had gone down into the countinghouse and obtained the invoice which the senior clerk had torn up the correctness of it established the fact of one part of my assertions and that nothing but malice could have warranted its having been destroyed mr drummond felt more than he chose to acknowledge he was now aware that he had been too precipitate even my having refused the money assumed a different appearance he was puzzled and mortified few people like to acknowledge that they have been in error mr drummond therefore left his wife to examine further into the matter and gave her permission to send for me the message given and the results of it have been stated the answer returned was that i would not come and that i had threatened to break the clerks head as well as that of mr drummond for although the scoundrel knew very well that in making use of the word master i referred to the senior clerk he thought it proper to substitute that of mr drummond the effect of this reply may easily be imagined sarah was astonished mrs drummond shocked and mr drummond was almost pleased to find that he could not have been in the wrong thus was the breach made even wider than before and all communication broken off much depends in this world upon messages being correctly given in halfanhour we had hauled out of the tier and dropped down to the american schooner to take out a cargo of flour which old tom had directions to land at the battersea wharf so that i was for the time removed from the site of my misfortune i cannot say that i felt happy but i certainly felt glad that i was away i was reckless to a degree that was insupportable i had a heavy load on my mind which i could not shake offa prey upon my spiritsa disgust at almost everything how well do i recollect with what different feelings i looked upon the few books which mr drummond and the dominie had given me to amuse my leisure hours i turned from them with contempt and thought i would never open them again i felt as if all ties were now cut off and that i was again wedded to the thames my ideas my wishes extended no farther and i surveyed the river and its busy scene as i did before i had been taken away from it as if all my energies all my prospects were in future to be bounded by its shores in the course of fourandtwenty hours a revulsion had taken place which again put me on the confines of barbarism my bargemates were equally dull as i was they were too partial to me and had too much kindness of heart not to feel my situation and anger at the injustice with which i had been treated employment however for a time relieved our melancholy thoughts our cargo was on board of the lighter and we were again tiding it through the bridges we dropped our anchor above putney bridge a little after twelve oclock and young tom with the wish of amusing me proposed that we should go on shore and walk ah do my lads doit will do you good jacob no use moping here a whole tide ill take care of the barkey mind you make the boat well fast and take the sculls into the publichouse there ill have the supper under weigh when you come back and then well have a night ont its a poor heart that never rejoices and tom take a bottle on shore get it filled and bring it off with you heres the money but i say tom honour bright honour bright father and to do tom justice he always kept his promise especially after the word had passed of honour bright had there been gallons of spirits under his charge he would not have tasted a drop after that pledge haul up the boat jacob quick said tom as his father went into the cabin to fetch an empty bottle tom hastened down below forward and brought up an old gun which he put under the stern sheets before his father came out on the deck we then received the bottle from him and tom called out for the dog tommy why youre not going to take the dog whats the use of that i want him here to keep watch with me said old tom pooh father why cant you let the poor devil have a run on shore he wants to eat grass i am sure for i watched him this day or two we shall be back before dark well well just as you please tom tommy jumped into the boat and away we went and now tom what are you after said i as soon as we were ten yards from the lighter ater jacob going to have a little shooting on wimbledon common but father cant bear to see a gun in my hand because i once shot my old mother i did pepper her sure enough her old flannel petticoat was full of shot but it was so thick that it saved her are you anything of a shot never fired a gun in my life well then well fire in turns and toss up if you like for first shot we landed carried the sculls up to the publichouse and left the bottle to be filled and then with tommy bounding before us and throwing about his bushy tail with delight ascended putney hill and arrived at the green man publichouse at the corner of wimbledon common i wonder where green men are to be found observed tom laughing i suppose they live in the same country with the blue dogs my father speaks about sometimes now then its time to load the bowl of a tobacco pipe full of powder was then inserted with an equal dose of shot and all being ready we were soon among the furze a half penny decided it was my first shot and fate further decided that a waterwagtail should be the mark i took good aim as i thought at least i took sufficient time for i followed him with the muzzle of the gun for three or four minutes at least as he ran to and fro at last i fired tommy barked with delight and the bird flew away i think i must have hit it said i i saw it wag its tail more proof of a miss than a hit replied tom had you hit it hed never have wagged his tail again never mind said i better luck next time tom then knocked a blackbird off a furze bush and loading the gun handed it to me i was more successful than before a cock sparrow three yards distant yielded to the prowess of my arm and i never felt more happy in my life than in this first successful attempt at murder gaily did we trudge over the common sometimes falling in with gravelpits half full of water at others bogs and swampy plains which obliged us to make a circuit the gun was fired again and again but our gamebag did not fill very fast however if we were not quite so well pleased when we missed as when we hit tommy was every shot being followed up with a dozen bounds and half a minutes barking at last we began to feel tired and agreed to repose a while in a cluster of furze bushes we sat down pulled out our game and spread it in a row before us it consisted of two sparrows one greenfinch one blackbird and three tomtits all of a sudden we heard a rustling in the furze and then a loud squeal it was the dog who scenting something had forced its way into the bush and had caught a hare which having been wounded in the loins by some other sportsman had dragged itself there to die in a minute we had taken possession of it much to the annoyance of tommy who seemed to consider that there was no copartnership in the concern and would not surrender his prize until after sundry admonitory kicks when we had fairly beaten him off we were in an ecstasy of delight we laid the animal out between us and were admiring it from the ear to the tip of his tail when we were suddenly saluted with a voice close to us oh you blamd young poachers so ive caught you have i we looked up and beheld the commonkeeper comecome along with me weve a nice clink at wandsworth to lock you up in ive been looking arter you some time hand your gun here i should rather think not replied i the gun belongs to us and not to you and i caught up the gun and presented the muzzle at him what do you mean to commit murder why you young villains do you want to commit a robbery retorted i fiercely because if you do i mean to commit murder then i shoot him tom no jacob no you mustnt shoot men replied tom who perceived that i was in a humour to keep my word with the commonkeeper indeed you cant continued he whispering to me the guns not loaded do you mean to refuse to give me up your gun repeated the man yes i do replied i cocking the lock so keep off oh you young reprobatesyoull come to the gallows before long thats certain do you refuse to come with me i should rather think we do replied i you refuse do you recollect ive caught you in the fact poaching with a dead hare in your possession well its no use crying about it whats done cant be helped replied i dont you know that all the game and all the turf and all the bog and all the gravel and all the furze on this common belong to the right honourable earl spencer and all the blackbirds and all the greenfinches and all the sparrows and all the tomtits too i suppose replied i to be sure they doand im commonkeeper now youll give me up that hare immediately look you replied tom we didnt kill that hare the dog caught it and it is his property we shant interfere in the matter if tommy chooses to let you have it well and good here tommy this here gentleman says and tom pointed to the keeper that this hare and tom pointed to the hare is not yours now will you watch it or let him have it at the word watch it tommy laid down with his forepaws over the hare and showing a formidable set of ivories looked fiercely at the man and growled you see what he says now you may do as you please continued tom addressing the man yesvery wellyoull come to the gallows i see that but ill just go and fetch halfadozen men to help me and then well have you both in gaol then be smart replied i jumping up and levelling the gun tommy jumped up also to fly at the man but tom caught him by the neck and restrained him the commonkeeper took to his heels and as soon as he was out of gunshot turned round shook his fist and then hastened away to obtain the reinforcement he desired i wish the gun had been loaded said i why jacob whats come over you would you have fired at him the man is only doing his dutywe have no business here i think otherwise replied i a hare on a common is as much mine as lord spencers a common belongs to everybody thats my opinion too but nevertheless if he gets hold of us hell have us in gaol and therefore i propose we make off as fast as we can in the opposite way to which he is gone we started accordingly and as the keeper proceeded in the direction of wandsworth we took the other direction but it so happened that on turning round after a quarter of an hours walk we perceived the man coming back with three or four others we must run for it cried tom and then hide ourselves after ten minutes hard run we descended into a hollow and swampy place looking round to see if they could perceive us and finding that they were not in sight we plunged into a thick cluster of furze bushes which completely concealed us tommy followed us and there we lay now they never will find us said tom if i can only keep the dog quiet lie down tommy watch and lie down the dog appeared to understand what was required he lay between us perfectly still we had remained there about halfanhour when we heard voices i motioned to tom to give me the powder to load the gun but he refused the voices came nearer tommy gave a low growl tom held his mouth with his hands at last they were close to the bushes and we heard the commonkeeper say they never went over the hill thats for certain the little wagrants they cant be far offthey must be down in the hollow come along but im blessed if im not up to my knees in the bog cried one of the men ill go no further down dang me well then lets try the side of the bog replied the keeper ill show you the way and the voices retreated fortunately for us for there had been a continual struggle between us and the dog for the last minute i holding his forepaws and tom jamming up his mouth we were now all quiet again but dare not leave our hidingplace we remained there for halfanhour when it became nearly dark and the sky which had been quite clear when we set out clouded over tom put up his head looked all round and perceiving nobody proposed that we should return as fast as we could to which i agreed but we were scarcely clear of the furze in which we had been concealed when a heavy fall of snow commenced which with the darkness prevented us from distinguishing our way every minute the snowstorm increased the wind rose and hurled the flakes into our faces until we were blinded still we made good way against it and expected every minute to be on the road after which our task would be easy on we walked in silence i carrying the gun tom with the hare over his shoulder and tommy at our heels for upwards of an hour did we tread our way through the furze but could find no road above us all was dark as pitch the wind howled our clothes were loaded with snow and we began to feel no inconsiderable degree of fatigue at last quite tired out we stopped tom said i im sure weve not kept a straight course the wind was on our starboard side and our clothes were flaked with snow on that side and now you see weve got it in our quarter what the devil shall we do we must go on till we fall in with something at all events replied tom and i expect that will be a gravelpit replied i but never mind better luck next time i only wish i had that rascal of a commonkeeper here suppose we turn back again and keep the wind on the starboard side of us as before we must pitch upon something at last we did so but our difficulties increased every moment we floundered in the bogs we tumbled over the stumps of the cut furze and had i not caught bold of tom as he was sliding down he would have been at the bottom of a gravelpit this obliged us to alter our course and we proceeded for a quarter of an hour in another direction until worn out with cold and fatigue we began to despair this will never do tom said i as the wind rose and roared with double fury i think we had better get into the furze and wait till the storm is over toms teeth chattered with the cold but before he could reply they chattered with fear we heard a loud scream overhead what was that cried he i confess that i was as much alarmed as tom the scream was repeated and it had an unearthly sound it was no human voiceit was between a scream and a creak again it was repeated and carried along with the gale i mustered up courage sufficient to look up to where the sound proceeded from but the darkness was so intense and the snow blinded me so completely that i could see nothing again and again did the dreadful sound ring in our ears and we remained fixed and motionless with horror even the dog crouched at our feet trembling we spoke not a wordneither of us moved the gun had fallen from my hand the hare lay at toms feet we held each others hand in silence and there we remained for more than a quarter of an hour every moment more and more sinking under the effects of cold fatigue and horror fortunately for us the storm in which had it continued much longer we should in all probability have perished was by that time over the snow ceased to fall the clouds were rolled away to leeward and a clear sky bespangled with a thousand twinkling lights roused us from our state of bodily and mental suffering the first object which caught my eye was a post within two yards of us i looked at it followed it up with my eyes and to my horror beheld a body suspended and swinging in chains over our heads as soon as i recovered from the shock which the first view occasioned i pointed it out to tom who had not yet moved he looked up started back and fell over the dogjumped up again and burst out into as loud a laugh as his frozen jaws would permit its old jerry abershaw said he i know him well and now i know where we are this was the case abershaw had about three years before been hung in chains on wimbledon common and the unearthly sound we had heard was the creaking of the rusty iron as the body was swung toandfro by the gale alls right jacob said tom looking up at the brilliant sky and then taking up the hare well be on the road in five minutes i shouldered the gun and off we set by the lord that rascally commonkeeper was right continued tom as we renewed our steps he prophesied we should come to the gallows before long and so we have well this has been a pretty turn out father will be in a precious stew better luck next time tom replied i its all owing to that turfandbog rascal i wish we had him here why what would you do with him take down old abershaw and hang him up in his place as sure as my names jacob chapter twenty our last adventure not fataltake to my grog kindlygrog makes me a very unkind returnold tom at his yarns againhow to put your foot in a mischief without having a hand in itcandidates for the catoninetails we soon recovered the road and in halfanhour we were at putney bridge cold wet and tired but not so bad as when we were stationary under the gallows the quick walking restored the circulation tom went in for the bottle of spirits while i went for the sculls and carried them down to the boat which was high and dry and nearly up to the thwarts with snow when tom joined me he appeared with two bottles under his arms i have taken another upon tick jacob said he for im sure we want it and so will father say when he hears our story we launched our boat and in a couple of minutes were close to the lighter on the deck of which stood old tom boat ahoy is that you lads cried he yes father alls right replied tom as we laid in our oars thank god replied the old man boys boys how you frightened me where have you been i thought you had met with some disaster how have i been peeping through the snowstorm these last two hours watching for the boat and im as wet as a shag and as cold as charity what has been the matter did you bring the bottle tom yes father brought two for we shall want them tonight if we go without for a week but we must all get on dry rigging as fast as possible and then you shall have the story of our cruise in a few minutes we had changed our wet clothes and were seated at the cabintable eating our supper and narrating our adventures to the old man tommy poor fellow had his share and now lay snoring at our feet as the bottles and pannikins were placed upon the little table come jacob a drop will do you good said old tom filling me one of the pannikins ater all its much better being snug here in this little cabin than shivering with fear and cold under old abershaws gallows and tom you scamp if ever you go gunning again ill disinherit you what have you got to leave father except your wooden legs replied tom yours would be but a woodenlegacy how do you know but what i can post the coal so you will if i boil a pot o tatoes with your legacybut it will only be charcoal well i believe you are about right tom still somehow or other the old woman always picks out a piece or two of gold when im rather puzzled how to raise the wind i never keeps no count with her if i follow my legs before she i hope the old soul will have saved something for you know when a man goes to kingdom come his pension goes with him however let me only hold on another five years and then youll not see her want will you tom no father ill sell myself to the king and stand to be shot at at a shilling a day and give the old woman half well tom tis but natural for a man to wish to serve his country so heres to you my lad and may you never do worse jacob do you think of going on board of a manofwar id like to serve my apprenticeship first and then i dont care how soon well my boy youll meet more fair play on board of a kings ship than you have from those on shore i should hope so replied i bitterly i hope to see you a man before i die yet jacob i shall very soon be laid up in ordinarymy toes pain me a good deal lately your toes cried tom and i both at once yes boys you may think it odd but sometimes i feel them just as plain as if they were now on instead of being long ago in some sharks maw at nights i has the cramp in them till it almost makes me halloo out with pain its a hard thing when one has lost the sarvice of his legs that all the feelings should remain the doctor says as how its narvous come jacob shove in your pannikin you seem to take it more kindly than you did yes replied i i begin to like grog now the now however might be comprehended within the space of the last twentyfour hours my depressed spirits were raised with the stimulus and for a time i got rid of the eternal current of thought which pressed upon my brain i wonder what your old gentleman the dominie as you call him thought after he got on shore again said old tom he seemed to be mighty cut up i suppose youll give him a hail jacob no replied i i shall not go near him nor any one else if i can help it mr drummond may think i wish to make it up again ive done with the shore i only wish i knew what is to become of me for you know i am not to serve in the lighter with you suppose tom and i look out for another craft jacob i care nothing for mr drummond he said tother day i was a drunken old swabfor which with my sarvice to him he lies a drunken fellow is one who cant for the soul of him keep from liquor when he can get it and whos overtaken before he is aware of it now thats not the case with me i keep sober when theres work to be done and when i knows that everything is safe under hatches and no fear of nothing why then i gets drunk like a rational being with my eyes opencause whycause i chooses thats exactly my notion of the thing observed tom draining his pannikin and handing it over to his father for a fresh supply mind you keep to that notion tom when you gets in the kings sarvice thats all or youll be sure to have your back scratched which i understand is no joke after all yet i do remember once in a ship i was in when halfadozen fellows were all fighting who should be flogged pray give us that yarn father but before you begin just fill my pannikin i shoved it over halfanhour ago just by way of a hint well then said old tom pouring out some spirits into toms pannikin it was just as follows it was when the ship was lying at anchor in bermuda harbour that the purser sent a breaker of spirits on shore to be taken up to some ladys house whom he was very anxious to splice and i suppose that he found a glass of grog helped the matter now there were about twenty of the men who had liberty to go on shore to stretch their limbslittle else could they do poor fellows for the first lieutenant looked sharp after their kits to see that they did not sell any of their rigging and as for money we had been five years without touching a farthing of pay and i dont suppose there was a matter of threepence among the men before the mast however libertys liberty after all and if they couldnt go ashore and get glorious rather than not go on shore at all they went ashore and kept sober perforce i do think myself its a very bad thing to keep the seamen without a farthing for so longfor you see a man who will be very honest with a few shillings in his pocket is often tempted to help himself just for the sake of getting a glass or two of grog and the temptations very great thats sartain ticularly in a hot climate when the sun scorches you and the very ground itself is so heated that you can hardly bear the naked foot to it this has been corrected the men have for some time received a portion of their pay on foreign stations and this portion has been greatly increased during sir james grahams administration but to go on the yawl was ordered on shore for the liberty men and the purser gives this breaker which was at least half full and i dare say there might be three gallons in it under my charge as coxswain to deliver to madam at the house well as soon as we landed i shoulders the breaker and starts with it up the hill what have you there tom said bill short what i wish i could share with you bill says i its some of old nipcheeses eights that he has sent on shore to bowse his jib up with with his sweetheart ive seen the madam said holmes to mefor you see all the liberty men were walking up the hill at the same timeand id rather make love to the breaker than to her shes as fat as an ox as broad as shes long built like a dutch schuyt and as yellow as a nabob but old tummings knows what hes about said a scotch lad of the name of malpine they say she has lots of gold dust more ducks and ingons and more inches of water in her tank than any on the island you see boys bermuda be a queer sort of place and water very scarce all they get there is a godsend as it comes from heaven and they look sharp for the rain which is collected in large tanks and an inch or two more of water in the tank is considered a great catch ive often heard the ladies there talking for a shower good morning marm how do you do this fine morning pretty well i tank you marm charming shower hab last night yes so all say but me not very lucky cloud not come over my tank how many inches of water you get last night marm i get good seven inches and i tink a little bit more which make me very happy me no so lucky marm so help me god me only get four inches of water in my tank and dat nothing well but ive been yawing again so now to keep my course as soon as i came to the house i knocked at the door and a little black girl opens the jalousies and put her finger to her thick lips no make noise missy sleep where am i to put this put down there byandby i come fetch it and then she closed the jalousies for fear her mistress should be woke up and she get a hiding poor devil so i puts the breaker down at the door and walks back to the boat again now you see these liberty men were all by when i spoke to the girl and seeing the liquor left with no one to guard it the temptation was too strong for them so they looked all about them and then at one another and caught one anothers meaning by the eye but they said nothing ill have no hand in it at last says one and walked away nor i said another and walked away too at last all of them walked away except eight and then bill short walks up to the breaker and says i wont have no hand in it either but he gave the breaker a kick which rolls it away two or three yards from the door nor more will i said holmes giving the breaker another kick which rolled it out in the road so they all went on without having a hand in it sure enough till they had kicked the breaker down the hill to the beach then they were at a dead stand as no one would spile the breaker at last a black carpenter came by and they offered him a glass if he would bore a hole with his gimlet for they were determined to be able to swear every one of them that they had no hand in it well as soon as the hole was bored one of them borrowed a couple of little mugs from a black woman who sold beer and then they let it run the black carpenter shoving one mug under as soon as the other was full and they drinking as fast as they could before they had half finished more of the liberty men came down i suppose they scented the good stuff from above as a shark does anything in the water and they soon made a finish of it and when it was all finished they were all drunk and made sail for a cruise that they might not be found too near the empty breaker well a little before sunset i was sent on shore with the boat to fetch off the liberty men and the purser takes this opportunity of getting ashore to see his madam and the first thing he falls athwart of is his own empty breaker hows this says he didnt you take this breaker up as i ordered you yes sir replied i i did and gave it in charge to the little back thing but madam was asleep and the girl did not allow me to put it inside the door at that he began to storm and swore that hed find out the malefactors as he termed the liberty men who had emptied his breaker and away he went to the house as soon as he was gone we got hold of the breaker and made a bull of it how did you manage that inquired i why jacob a bull means putting a quart or two of water into a cask which has had spirits in it and what with the little that may be left and what has soaked in the wood if you roll it and shake it well it generally turns out pretty fair grog at all events its always better than nothing well to go onbut suppose we fill up again and take a fresh departure as this is a tolerably long yarn and i must wet the threads or they may chance to break our pannikins which had been empty were all replenished and then old tom proceeded it was a long while before we could pick up the liberty men who were reeling about every corner of the town and quite dark before i came on board the first lieutenant was on deck and had no occasion to ask me why i waited so long when he found they were all lying in the stern sheets where the devil could they have picked up the liquor said he and then he ordered the masteratarms to keep them under the halfdeck till they were sober the next morning the purser comes off and makes his complaint on the quarterdeck as how somebody had stolen his liquor the first lieutenant reports to the captain and the captain orders up all the men who came off tipsy which of you took the liquor said he they all swore that they had no hand in it then how did you get tipsy come now mr short answer me you came off beastly drunkwho gave you the liquor a black fellow sir replied short which was true enough as the mugs were filled by the black carpenter and handed by him well they all swore the same and then the captain got into a rage and ordered them all to be put down on the report the next day the hands were turned up for punishment and the captain said now my lads if you wont tell who stole the pursers grog i will flog you all round i only want to flog those who committed the theft for it is too much to expect of seamen that they would refuse a glass of grog when offered to them now short and the others had a parley together and they had agreed how to act they knew that the captain could not bear flogging and was a very kindhearted man so bill short steps out and says touching his forelock to the captain if you please sir if all must be flogged if nobody will peach i think it better to tell the truth at once it was i who took the liquor very well then said the captain strip sir so bill short pulls off his shirt and is seized up boatswains mate said the captain give him a dozen beg your honours pardon said jack holmes stepping out of the row of men brought out for punishment but i cant bear to see an innocent man punished and since one must be flogged it must be the right one it warnt bill short that took the liquor it was i why hows this said the captain didnt you own that you took the liquor mr short why yes i did say so cause i didnt wish to see everybody floggedbut the truths the truth and i had no hand in it cast him looseholmes youll strip sir holmes stripped and was tied up give him a dozen said the captain when out steps malpine and swore it was him and not holmes and axd leave to be flogged in his stead at which the captain bit his lips to prevent laughing and then they knew all was right so another came forward and says it was him and not malpine and another contradicts him again and so on at last the captain says one would think flogging was a very pleasant affair you are all so eager to be tied up but however i shant flog to please you i shall find out who the real culprit is and then punish him severely in the meantime you keep them all on the report mr p speaking to the first lieutenant depend upon it ill not let you off although i do not choose to flog innocent men so they piped down and the first lieutenant who knew that the captain never meant to take any more notice of it never made no inquiries and the thing blew over one day a month or two after i told the officers how it was managed and they laughed heartily we continued our carouse till a late hour old tom constantly amusing us with his long yarns and that night for the first time i went to bed intoxicated old tom and his son assisted me into my bedplace old tom observing poor jacob it will do him good his heart was heavy and now hell forget it all for a little time at all events well but father i dont like to see jacob drunk replied young tom its not like himits not worthy of him as for you or me its nothing at all but i feel jacob was never meant to be a toper i never saw a lad so altered in a short time and i expect bad will come of it when he leaves us i awoke as might be supposed after my first debauch with a violent headache but i had also a fever brought on by my previous anxiety of mind i rose dressed and went on deck where the snow was nearly a foot deep it now froze hard and the river was covered with small pieces of floating ice i rubbed my burning forehead with the snow and felt relief for some time i assisted tom to heave it overboard but the fever pressed upon me and in less than halfanhour i could no longer stand the exertion i sat down on the water cask and pressed my hands to my throbbing temples you are not well jacob inquired tom coming up to me with the shovel in his hand and glowing with health and exercise i am not indeed tom replied i feel how hot i am tom went to his father who was in the cabin padding with extra flannel his stumps to defend them from the cold which always made him suffer much and then led me into the cabin it was with much difficulty i could walk my knees trembled and my eyesight was defective old tom took my hand as i sank on the locker do you think that it was taking too much last night inquired tom of his father theres more here than a gallon of liquor would have brought about replied old tom no noi see it all go to bed again jacob they put me into bed and i was soon in a state of stupor in which i remained until the lighter had arrived at the brentford wharf and for many days afterwards chapter twenty one on a sick bedfever firmness and follybound prentice to a watermani take my first lesson in love and give my first lesson in latinthe love lesson makes an impression on my auricular organ verily none are so deaf as those who wont hear when i recovered my senses i found myself in bed and captain turnbull sitting by my side i had been removed to his house when the lighter had arrived at the wharf captain turnbull was then talking with mr tomkins the former head clerk now in charge old tom came on shore and stated the condition i was in and mr tomkins having no spare bed in his house captain turnbull immediately ordered me to be taken to his residence and sent for medical advice during the time i had remained in this state old tom had informed captain turnbull the dominie and mr tomkins of the circumstances which had occurred and how much i had been misrepresented to mr drummond and not saying a word about the affair of wimbledon common or my subsequent intemperance had given it as his opinion that illtreatment had produced the fever in this i believe he was nearly correct although my disease might certainly have been aggravated and hastened by those two unmentioned causes they all of them took my part and mr turnbull went to london to state my condition to mr drummond and also to remonstrate at his injustice circumstances had since occurred which induced mr drummond to lend a ready ear to my justification but the message i had sent was still an obstacle this however was partly removed by the equivocating testimony of the young clerk when he was interrogated by captain turnbull and mr drummond and wholly so by the evidence of young and old tom who although in the cabin had overheard the whole of the conversation and mr drummond desired captain turnbull to inform me as soon as i recovered that all was forgotten and forgiven it might have been on his part but not on mine and when captain turnbull told me so with the view of raising my spirits i shook my head as i lay on the pillow as the reader will have observed the feeling roused in me by the illusage i had received was a vindictive oneone that must have been deeply implanted in my heart although till then it had never been roused into action and now once roused was not to be suppressed that it was based on pride was evident and with it my pride was raised in proportion to the intimation of captain turnbull i therefore gave a decided dissent no sir i cannot return to mr drummond that he was kind to me and that i owe much to his kindness i readily admit and now that he has acknowledged his error in supposing me capable of such ingratitude i heartily forgive him but i cannot and will not receive any more favours from him i cannot put myself in a situation to be again mortified as i have been i feel i should no longer have the same pleasure in doing my duty as i once had and i never could live under the same roof with those who at present serve him tell him all this and pray tell little sarah how grateful i feel no her for all her kindness to me and that i shall always think of her with regret at being obliged to leave her and at the remembrance of little sarah i burst into tears and sobbed on my pillow captain turnbull whether he rightly estimated my character or fell convinced that i had made up my mind did not renew the subject well jacob replied he well not talk of that any more ill give your messages just in your own words now take your draught and try to get a little sleep i complied with this request and nothing but weakness now remaining i rapidly regained my strength and with my strength my feelings of resentment increased in proportion nothing but the very weak state that i was in when captain turnbull spoke to me would have softened me down to give the kind message that i did but my vindictive mind was subdued by disease and better feelings predominated the only effect this had was to increase my animosity against the other parties who were the cause of my illtreatment and i vowed that they at least should one day repent their conduct the dominie called upon me the following sunday i was dressed and looking through the window when he arrived the frost was now intense and the river was covered with large masses of ice and my greatest pleasure was to watch them as they floated down with the tide thou hast had a second narrow escape my jacob said he after some preliminary observations once again did death pallida mors hover over thy couch but thou hast arisen and thy fair fame is again established when wilt thou be able to visit mr drummond and be able to thank him for his kindness never sir replied i i will never again enter mr drummonds house nay jacob this savoureth of enmity are not we all likely to be deceivedall likely to do wrong did not i even i in thy presence backslide into intemperance and folly did not i disgrace myself before my pupiland shalt thou in thy tender years harbour illwill against one who had cherished thee when thou wert destitute and who was deceived with regard to thee by the base and evilspeaking i am obliged to mr drummond for all his kindness sir replied i but i never wish to enter his house i was turned out of it and never will again go into it eheu jacobe thou art in error it is our duty to forgive as we hope to be forgiven i do forgive sir if that is what is requested but i cannot and will not accept of further favours the dominie urged in vain and left me mr tomkins also came and argued the point without success i was resolved i was determined to be independent and i looked to the river as my father mother home and everything as soon as my health was reinstated captain turnbull one day came to me jacob said he the lighter has returned and i wish to know if you intend to go on board again and afterwards go into the vessel into which mr drummond proposes to send you i will go into no vessel through mr drummonds means or interest replied i what will you do then replied he i can always enter on board a manofwar replied i if the worst comes to the worst but if i can serve out my apprenticeship on the river i should prefer it i rather expected this answer jacob from what you have said to me already and i have been trying if i cannot help you to something which may suit you you dont mind being obliged to me o no but promise you will never doubt menever accuse me my voice faltered and i could say no more no my lad that i will not i know you as i think pretty well and the heart that feels a false accusation as yours does is sure to guard against committing what you are so angry at being accused of now jacob listen to me you know old deaf stapleton whose wherry we have so often pulled up and down the river i have spoken to him to take you as his help and he has consented will you like to go he has served his time and has a right to take a prentice yes replied i with pleasure and with more pleasure from expecting to see you often o i promise you all my custom jacob replied he laughing well often turn old stapleton out and have a row together is it agreed it is replied i and many thanks to you well then consider it settled stapleton has a very good room and all thats requisite on shore at fulham i have seen his place and i think you will be comfortable i did not know at the time how much captain turnbull had been my friendthat he had made stapleton take better lodgings and had made up the difference to him besides allowing him a trifle per week and promising him a gratuity occasionally if i were content with my situation in a few days i had removed all my clothes to stapletons had taken my leave of mr turnbull and was established as an apprentice to a waterman on the thames the lighter was still at the wharf when i left and my parting with old tom and his son was equally and sincerely felt on both sides jacob said old tom i likes your pride after all cause why i think you have some right to be proud and the man who only asks fair play and no favour always will rise in this world but look you jacob theres sometimes a current gainst a man that no one can make head against and if so be that should be your case for a time recollect the old house the old woman and old tom and there youll always find a hearty welcome and a hearty old couple wholl share with you what they have be it good bad or indifferent heres luck to you my boy and recollect i means to go to the expense of painting the sides of my craft blue and then youll always know her as she creeps up and down the river and jacob said young tomi may be a wild one but im a true one if ever you want me in fair weather and in foulgood or badfor fun or for mischieffor a help or for a friend in need through thick or thin im yours even to the gallows and heres my hand upon it just like you tom observed his father but i know what you mean and alls right i shook hands with them both and we parted thus did i remove from the lighter and at once take up the profession of a waterman i walked down to the fulham side where i found stapleton at the door of the publichouse standing with two or three others smoking his pipe well lad so youre chained to my wherry for two or three years and im to initiate you into all the rules and regulations of the company now ill tell you one thing which is dye see when the rivers covered with ice as it is just now haul your wherry up high and dry and smoke your pipe till the river is clear as i do now i might have guessed that replied i bawling in his ear without you telling me very true but dont bawl in my ear quite so loud i hears none the better for it my ears require coaxing thats all why i thought you were as deaf as a post yes so i be with strangers cause i dont know the pitch of their voice but with those about me i hear better when they speak quietly thats human nature come lets go home my pipe is finished and as theres nothing to be done on the river we may just as well make all tidy there stapleton had lost his wife but he had a daughter fifteen years old who kept his lodgings and did for him as he termed it he lived in part of some buildings leased by a boatbuilder his windows looked out on the river and on the first floor a baywindow was thrown out so that at high water the river ran under it as for the rooms consisting of five i can only say that they could not be spoken of as large and small but as small and smaller the sittingroom was eight feet square the two bedrooms at the back for himself and his daughter just held a small bed each and the kitchen and my room below were to match neither were the tenements in the very best repair the parlour especially hanging over the river being lopsided and giving you the uncomfortable idea that it would every minute fall into the stream below still the builder declared that it would last many years without sinking further and that was sufficient at all events they were very respectable accommodations for a waterman and stapleton paid for them pounds per annum stapletons daughter was certainly a very wellfavoured girl she had rather a large mouth but her teeth were very fine and beautifully white her hair was auburnher complexion very fair her eyes were large and of a deep blue and from her figure which was very good i should have supposed her to have been eighteen although she was not past fifteen as i found out afterwards there was a frankness and honesty of countenance about her and an intellectual smile which was very agreeable well mary how do you get on said stapleton as we ascended to the sittingroom heres young faithful come to take up with us well father his beds all ready and i have taken so much dirt from the room that i expect we shall be indicted for filling up the river i wonder what nasty people lived in this house before us very nice rooms nevertheless aint they boy o yes very nice for idle people you may amuse yourself looking out on the river or watching what floats past or fishing with a pin at high water replied mary looking at me i like the river replied i gravely i was born on it and hope to get my bread on it and i like this sittingroom rejoined stapleton how mighty comfortable it will be to sit at the open window and smoke in the summer time with ones jacket off at all events youll have no excuse for dirtying the room father and as for the lad i suppose his smoking days have not come yet no replied i but my days for taking off my jacket are i suspect o yes replied she never fear that father will let you do all the work you please and look onwont you father dont let your tongue run quite so fast mary youre not over fond of work yourself no theres only one thing i dislike more replied she and thats holding my tongue well i shall leave you and jacob to make it out together i am going back to the feathers and old stapleton walked down stairs and went back to the inn saying as he went out that he should be back to his dinner mary continued her employment of wiping the furniture of the room with a duster for some minutes during which i did not speak but watched the floating ice on the river well said mary do you always talk as you do now if so youll be a very nice companion mr turnbull who came to my father told me that you was a sharp fellow could read write and do everything and that i should like you very much but if you mean to keep it all to yourself you might as well not have had it i am ready to talk when i have anything to talk about replied i thats not enough im ready to talk about nothing and you must do the same very well replied i how old are you how old am i o then you consider me nothing ill try hard but you shall alter your opinion my fine fellow however to answer your question i believe im about fifteen not more well theres an old proverb which i will not repeat i know it so you may save yourself the trouble you saucy boy but now for your age mine let me see well i believe that i am nearly seventeen are you really so old well now i should have thought you no more than fourteen this answer at first surprised me as i was very stout and tall for my age but a moments reflection told me that it was given to annoy me a lad is as much vexed at being supposed younger than he really is as a man of a certain age is annoyed at being taken for so much older pooh replied i that shows how little you know about men i wasnt talking about men that i know of but still i do know something about them ive had two sweethearts already indeed and what have you done with them done with them i jilted the first for the second because the second was better looking and when mr turnbull told me so much about you i jilted the second to make room for you but now i mean to try if i cant get him back again with all my heart replied i laughing i shall prove but a sorry sweetheart for i have never made love in my life have you ever had anybody to make love to no thats the reason mr jacob depend upon it all you have to do is to swear that im the prettiest girl in the world that you like me better than anybody else in the world do anything in the world that i wish you to dospend all the money you have in the world in buying me ribbons and fairings and then and then what why then i shall hear all you have to say take all you have to give and laugh at you in the bargain but i shouldnt stand that long o yes you would id put you out of humour and coax you in again the fact is jacob faithful i made my mind up before i saw you that you should be my sweetheart and when i will have a thing i will so you may as well submit to it at once if you dont as i keep the key of the cupboard ill half starve you thats the way to tame any brute they say and i tell you why jacob i mean that you shall be my sweetheart its because mr turnbull told me that you knew latin now tell me what is latin latin is a language which people spoke in former times but now they do not well then you shall make love to me in latin thats agreed and how do you mean to answer me o in plain english to be sure but how are you to understand me replied i much amused with the conversation o if you make love properly i shall soon understand you i shall read the english of it in your eyes very well i have no objection when am i to begin why directly you stupid fellow to be sure what a question i went close up to mary and repeated a few words of latin now says i look into my eyes and see if you can translate them something impudent im sure replied she fixing her blue eyes on mine not at all replied i i only asked for this and i snatched a kiss in return for which i received a box on the ear which made it tingle for five minutes nay replied i thats not fair i did as you desiredi made love in latin and i answered you as i said i would in plain english replied mary reddening up to the forehead but directly after bursting out into a loud laugh now mr jacob i plainly see that you know nothing about making love bless me a years dangling and a years pocketmoney should not have given you what you have had the impudence to take in so many minutes but it was my own fault thats certain and i have no one to thank but myself i hope i didnt hurt youim very sorry if i did but no more making love in latin ive had quite enough of that well then suppose we make friends replied i holding out my hand thats what i really wished to do although ive been talking so much nonsense replied mary i know we shall like one another and be very good friends you cant help feeling kind towards a girl youve kissed and i shall try by kindness to make up to you for the box on the ear so now sit down and lets have a long talk mr turnbull told us that he wished you to serve out your apprenticeship on the river with my father so that if you agree we shall be a long while together i take mr turnbulls word not that i can find it out yet that you are a very goodtempered goodlooking clever modest lad and as an apprentice who remains with my father must live with us of course i had rather it should be one of that sort than some ugly awkward brute who is not fit to make love to you replied i who is not fit company for me replied mary i want no more love from you at present the fact is that father spends all the time he can spare from the wherry at the alehouse smoking and its very dull for me and having nothing to do i look out of the window and make faces at the young men as they pass by just to amuse myself now there was no great harm in that a year or two ago but now you know jacob well now what then o im bigger thats all and what might be called sauciness in a girl may be thought something more of in a young woman so ive been obliged to leave it off but being obliged to remain home with nobody to talk to i never was so glad as when i heard that you were to come so you see jacob we must be friends i darent quarrel with you long although i shall sometimes just for variety and to have the pleasure of making it up again do you hear meor what are you thinking of im thinking that youre a very odd girl i dare say that i am but how can i help that mother died when i was five years old and father couldnt afford to put me out so he used to lock me in all day till he came home from the river and it was not till i was seven years old and of some use that the door was left open i never shall forget the day when he told me that in future he should trust me and leave the door open i thought i was quite a woman and have thought so ever since i recollect that i often peeped out and longed to run about the world but i went two or three yards from the door and felt so frightened that i ran back as fast as i could since that i have seldom quitted the house for an hour and never have been out of fulham then you have never been at school o nonever i often wish that i had i used to see the little girls coming home as they passed our door so merrily with their bags from the schoolhouse and im sure if it were only to have the pleasure of going there and back again for the sake of the run id have worked hard if for nothing else would you like to learn to read and write will you teach me replied mary taking me by the arm and looking me earnestly in the face yes i will with pleasure replied i laughing we will pass the evening better than making love after all especially if you hit so hard how came you so knowing in those matters i dont know replied mary smiling i suppose as father says its human nature for i never learnt anything but you will teach me to read and write i will teach you all i know myself mary if you wish to learn everything but latinweve had enough of that oh i shall be so much obliged to you i shall love you so there you are again no no i didnt mean that replied mary earnestly i meant that after all i dont know what else to say i mean that i shall love you for your kindness without your loving me again thats it i understand you but now mary as we are to be such good friends it is necessary that your father and i should be good friends so i must ask you what sort of a person he is for i know but little of him and of course wish to oblige him well then to prove to you that im sincere i will tell you something my father in the first place is a very good tempered sort of man he works pretty well but might gain more but he likes to smoke at the publichouse all he requires of me is his dinner ready his linen clean and the house tidy he never drinks too much and is always civil spoken but he leaves me too much alone and talks too much about human nature thats all but hes so deafhe cant talk to you give me your handnow promisefor im going to do a very foolish thing which is to trust a manpromise youll never tell it again well i promise replied i supposing her secret of no consequence well thenmindyouve promised father is no more deaf than you or i indeed replied i why he goes by the name of deaf stapleton i know he does and makes everybody believe that he is so but it is to make money how can he make money by that theres many people in business who go down the river and they wish to talk of their affairs without being overheard as they go down they always call for deaf stapleton and theres many a gentleman and lady who have much to say to each other without wishing people to listen you understand me o yes i understandlatin exactlyand they call for deaf stapleton and by this means he gets more good fares than any other waterman and does less work but how will he manage now that i am with him o i suppose it will depend upon his customers if a single person wants to go down you will take the sculls if they call for oars you will both go if he considers deaf stapleton only is wanted you will remain on shore or perhaps he will insist upon your being deaf too but i do not like deceit no its not right although it appears to me that there is a great deal of it still i should like you to sham deaf and then tell me all that people say it would be so funny father never will tell a word so far your father to a certain degree excuses himself well i think he will soon tell you what i have now told you but till then you must keep your promise and now you must do as you please as i must go down in the kitchen and get dinner on the fire i have nothing to do replied i can i help you to be sure you can and talk to me which is better still come down and wash the potatoes for me and then ill find you some more work well i do think we shall be very happy i followed mary stapleton down into the kitchen and we were soon very busy and very noisy laughing talking blowing the fire and preparing the dinner by the time that her father came home we were sworn friends chapter twenty two is very didactic and treats learnedly on the various senses and human nature is also diffuse on the best training to produce a moral philosopherindeed it contains materials with which to build up one system and halfadozen theories as these things are now made i was rather curious after the secret confided to me by mary stapleton to see how her father would behave but when we had sat and talked some time as he appeared to have no difficulty in answering to any observation in a common pitch of the voice i observed to him that he was not so deaf as i thought he was no no replied he in the house i hear very well but in the open air i cant hear at all if a person speaks to me two yards off always speak to me close to my ear in the open air but not loud and then i shall hear you very well i caught a bright glance from marys blue eye and made no answer this frost will hold im afraid continued stapleton and we shall have nothing to do for some days but to blow our fingers and spend our earnings but theres never much doing at this time of the year the winter cuts us watermen up terribly as for me i smokes my pipe and thinks on human natur but what you are to do jacob i cant tell oh he will teach me to read and write replied mary i dont know that he shall replied stapleton whats the use of reading and writing to you weve too many senses already in my opinion and if so be we have learning to boot why then all the worse for us how many senses are there father how many im sure i cant tell but more than enough to puzzle us there are only five i believe said i first theres hearing well replied stapleton hearing may be useful at times but not hearing at times is much more convenient i make twice as much money since i lost the better part of my hearing well then theres seeing continued i seeing is useful at times i acknowledge but i knows this that if a man could pull a young couple about the river and not be able to see now and then it would be many a halfcrown in his pocket well then now we come to tasting no use at allonly a vexation if there was no tasting we should not care whether we ate brown bread or roast beef drank water or xx ale and in these hard times that would be no small saving well then let me see theres smelling smellings no use whatever for one good smell by the rivers side there be ten nasty ones and there is everywhere to my conviction which is the next jacob said mary smiling archly feeling feeling thats the worst of the whole always feel too cold in winter too hot in summerfeel a blow too feeling only gives pain thats a very bad sense well then i suppose you think we should get on better without our senses no not without all of them a little hearing and a little seeing be all very well but there are other senses which you have forgot jacob now one i takes to be the very best of the bunch is smoking i never heard that was a sense replied i laughing then you havent half finished your education jacob are reading and writing senses father inquired mary to be sure they be girl for without sense you cant read and write and rowing be a sense just as well and there be many other senses but in my opinion most of the senses be nonsense and only lead to mischief jacob said mary whispering to my ear isnt loving a sense no thats nonsense replied i well then replied she i agree with my father that nonsense is better than sense but still i dont see why i should not learn to read and write father ive lived all my life without it and never felt the want of itwhy cant you because i do feel the want of it so you may but they leads no no good look at those fellows at the feathers all were happy enough before jim holder who is a scholar came among them and now since he reads to them they do nothing but grumble and growl and talk about i dont know whatcorn laws and taxes and liberty and all other nonsense now what could you do more than you do now if you larnt to read and write i could amuse myself when ive nothing to do father when you and jacob are away i often sit down after ive done all my work and think what i shall do next and at last i look out of the window and make faces at people because ive nothing better to do now father you must let him learn me to read and write well mary if you will you will but recollect dont blame me for itit must be all on your own head and not on my conscience ive lived some forty or fifty years in this world and all my bad luck has been owing to having too much senses and all my good luck to getting rid of them i wish you would tell me how that came to pass said i i should like to hear it very much and it will be a lesson to mary well i dont care if i do jacob only i must light my pipe first and mary do you go for a pot o beer let jacob go father i mean him to run on all my errands now you mustnt order jacob mary no noi wouldnt think of ordering him but i know he will do it wont you jacob yes with pleasure replied i well with all my heart provided it be all for love said stapleton of course all for love replied mary looking at me or latin which jacob whats latin said her father oh thats a new sense jacob has been showing me something of which like many others proved to be nonsense i went for the beer and when i returned found the fire burning brightly and a strong sense of smoking from old stapletons pipe he puffed once or twice more and then commenced his history as follows i cant exactly say when i were born nor where said old stapleton taking his pipe out of his mouth because i never axed either father or mother and they never told me because why i never did ax and that be all agreeable to human natur here stapleton paused and took three whiffs of his pipe i recollects when i was a little brat about two foot nothing mother used to whack me all day long and i used to cry in proportion father used to cry shame and then mother would fly at him he would whack she she would up with her apron in one corner and cry while i did the same with my pinbefore in another all that was nothing but human natur a pause and six or seven whiffs of the pipe i was sent to school at a penny a week to keep me out of the way and out of mischief i larnt nothing but to sit still on the form and hold my tongue and so i used to amuse myself twiddling my thumbs and looking at the flies as they buzzed about the room in the summer time and in the winter cause there was no flies of no sort i used to watch the old missus aknitting of stockings and think how soon the time would come when i should go home and have my supper which in a child was nothing but human natur puff puff puff father and mother lived in a cellar mother sold coals and tatoes and father used to go out to work in the barges on the river as soon as i was old enough the schoolmissus sent word that i ought to learn to read and write and that she must be paid threepence a week so father took me away from school because he thought i had had education enough and mother perched me on a basket upside down and made me watch that nobody took the goods while she was busy down below and then i used to sit all day long watching the coals and tatoes and never hardly speaking to nobody so having nothing better to do i used to think about this and that and everything and when dinner would be ready and when i might get off the basket for you see thinking be another of the senses and when one has nothing to do and nothing to say to think be nothing more than human natur puff puff and a pause for a drink out of the pot at last i grew a big stout boy and mother said that i ate too much and must earn my livelihood somehow or other and father for once agreed with her but there was a little difficulty how that was to be done so until that was got over i did nothing at all but watch the coals and tatoes as before one day mother wouldnt give me wituals enough so i helped myself so she whacked me so i being strong whacked she so father coming home whacked me so i takes to my heels and runs away a good mile before i thought at all about how i was to live and there i was very sore very unhappy and very hungry puff puff puff and a spit i walks on and on and then i gets behind a coach and then the fellow whips me and i gets down again in a great hurry and tumbles into the road and before i could get up again a gemman in a gig drives right over me and breaks my leg i screams with pain which if i hadnt had the sense of feeling of course i shouldnt have minded he pulls up and gets out and tells me hes very sorry i tells him so am i his servant calls some people and they takes me into a publichouse and lays me on the table all among the pots of beer sends for a doctor who puts me into bed and puts my leg right again and then i was provided for for at least six weeks during which the gemman calls and axes how i feel myself and i says pretty well i thanky puff puffknock the ashes out pipe refilled relighted a drink of beer and go on so when i was well and on my pins again the gentleman says what can i do for you and the landlord cuts him short by saying that he wanted a potboy if i liked the profession now if i didnt like the pots i did the porter which i had no share of at home so i agrees the gemman pays the score gives me half a guinea and tells me not to be lying in the middle of the road another time i tells him i wont so he jumps into his gig and i never cast eyes upon him since i stayed three years with my master taking out beer to his customers and always taking a little out of each pot for myself for thats nothing but human natur when you likes a thing but i never got into trouble until one day i sees my missus akissing in the back parlour with a fellow who travels for orders i never said nothing at first but at last i sees too much and then i tells master who gets into a rage and goes into his wife stays with her halfanhour and then comes out and kicks me out of the door calling me a liar and telling me never to show my face again i shies a pot at his head and showed him anything but my face for i took to my heels and ran for it as fast as i could so much for seeing if i hadnt seen that wouldnt have happened so there i was adrift and goodbye to porter puff puff mary wheres my baccy stopper poke down puff puff spit and proceed well i walks towards lunnen thinking on husbands and wives porter and human natur until i finds myself there and then i looks at all the lighted lamps and recollects that i havent no lodging for the night and then all of a sudden i thinks of my father and mother and wonders how they be going on so i thought id go and see and away i went comes to the cellar and goes down there was my mother with a quartern of gin before her walking to and fro and whimpering to herself so says i mother whats the matter now at which she jumps up and hugs me and tells me im her only comfort left i looked at the quartern and thinks otherwise so down i sits by her side and then she pours me out a glass and pours out all her grief telling me how my father had left her for another woman who kept another cellar in another street and how she was very unhappy and how she had taken to ginwhich was nothing but human natur you see and how she meant to make away with herself and then she sent for more quarterns and we finished them what with the joy of finding me and the grief at losing my father and the quarterns of gin she went to bed crying drunk and fell fast asleep so did i and thought home was home after all next morning i takes up the business and finds trade not so bad after all so i takes the command of all keeps all the money and keeps mother in order and dont allow drinking nor disorderly conduct in the house but goes to the publichouse every night for a pipe and a pot well everything goes on very well for a month when who should come home but father which i didnt approve of because i liked being master so i being a strong chap then says if you be come to illtreat my mother ill put you in the kennel father be off to your new woman arnt you ashamed of yourself says i so father looks me in the face and tells me to stand out of the way or hell make cats meat of me and then he goes to my mother and after a quarter of an hour of sobbing on her part and coaxing on his they kiss and make friends and then they both turns to me and orders me to leave the cellar and never to show my face again i refuses father flies at me and mother helps him and between the two i was hustled out to find my bread how and where i could ive never taken a womans part since puff puff puff and a deep sigh i walks down to the waterside and having one or two shillings in my pocket goes into a publichouse to get a drop of drink and a bed and when i comes in i sees a man hand a note for change to the landlady and she gives him change that wont do says he and he was half tipsy i gave you a tenpound note and this here lad be witness it was only a one says the woman youre a damned old cheat says he and if you dont give me the change ill set your house on fire and burn you alive with that there was a great row and he goes out for the constable and gives her in charge and gives me in charge as a witness and then she gives him in charge and so we all went to the watchhouse together and slept on the benches the next morning we all appeared before the magistrate and the man tells his story and calls me as a witness but recollecting how much i had suffered from seeing i wouldnt see anything this time it might have been a tenpound note for it certainly didnt look like a one but my evidence went rather for than against the woman for i only proved the man to be drunk and she was let off and i walked home with her so says she youre a fine boy and ill do you a good turn for what you have done for me my husband is a waterman and ill make you free of the river for he hasnt no prentice and you can come on shore and stay at the publichouse when you arnt wanted i jumped at the offer and so by not seeing i gets into a regular livelihood well jacob how do you like it very much replied i and you mary o i like it very much but i want father to go on and to know how he fell in love and married my mother well you shall have it all byandby but now i must take a spell chapter twenty three a very sensible chapter having reference to the sensesstapleton by keeping his under control keeps his head above water in his wherry forced to fight for his wife and when he had won her to fight on to keep herno great prize yet it made him a prizefighter old stapleton finished his pipe took another swig at the porter filled relighted puffed to try it cleared his mouth and then proceeded now you see bartley her husband was the greatest rogue on the river he was up to everything and stood at nothing he fleeced as much on the water as she did on the land for i often seed her give wrong change afterwards when people were tipsy but i made it a rule always to walk away as for bartley his was always nightwork and manys the coil of rope i have brought on shore what although he might have paid for he didnt buy it of the lawful owner but i never seed or heard that was my maxim and i fared well till i served my time and then they gave me their old wherry and built a new one for themselves so i set up on my own account and then i seed and heard and had all my senses just as they were beforemores the pity for no good came of it puff puff puff puff the bartleys wanted me to join them but that wouldnt do for though i never meddled with other peoples concerns yet i didnt choose to go wrong myself ive seed all the world cheating each other for fifty years or more but thats no concern of mine i cant make the world better so all i thinks about it is to keep honest myself and if every one was to look after his own soul and not trouble themselves about their neighbours why then it would be all the better for human natur i plied at the swan stairs gained my livelihood and spent it as i got it for i was then too young to look out ater a rainy day one night a young woman in a cloak comes down to the stairs with a bundle in her arms and seems in a very great taking and asks me for a boat i hauls out of the row alongside of the yard and hands her in she trips as she steps in and i catches to save her from falling and in catching her i puts my hand upon the bundle in her arms and feels the warm face of a baby where am i to go maam says i o pull across and land me on the other side says she and then i hears her sobbing to herself as if her heart would break when we were in the middle o the stream she lifts up her head and then first she looks at the bundle and kisses it and then she looks up at the stars which were glittering above in the sky she kisses the child once more jumps up and afore i could be aware of what she was about she tosses me her purse throws her child into the water and leaps in herself i pulls sharp round immediately and seeing her again i made one or two good strokes comes alongside of her and gets hold of her clothes ater much ado i gets her into the wherry and as soon as i seed she was come to again i pulls her back to the stairs where she had taken me from as soon as i lands i hears a noise and talking and several people standing about it seems it were her relatives who had missed her and were axing whether she had taken a boat and while they were describing her and the other watermen were telling them how i had taken a fare of that description i brings her back well they takes charge of her and leads her home and then for the first time i thinks of the purse at the bottom of the boat which i picks up and sure enough there were four golden guineas in it beside some silver well the men who plied at the stairs axed me all about it but i keeps my counsel and only tells them how the poor girl threw herself into the water and how i pulled her out again and in a week i had almost forgot all about it when up comes an officer and says to me you be stapleton the waterman and i says yes i be then you must come along with me and he takes me to the policeoffice where i finds the poor young woman in custody for being accused of having murdered her infant so they begins to tax me upon my bible oath and i was forced to tell the whole story for though you may loose all your senses when convenient yet somehow or another an oath on the bible brings them all back again did you see the child said the magistrate i seed a bundle said i did you hear the child cry said he no says i i didnt and then i thought i had got the young woman off but the magistrate was an old fox and had all the senses at his fingers ends so says he when the young woman stepped into the boat did she give you the bundle no says i again then you never touched it yes i did when her foot slipped and what did it feel like it felt like a piece of human natur says i and quite warm like how do you mean says he why i took it by the feel for a baby and it was quite warm was it yes replied i it was well then what else took place why when we were in the middle of the stream she and her child went overboard i pulled her in again but could not see the child fortunately for the poor girl they didnt ask me which went overboard first and that saved her from hanging she was confined six months in prison and then let out again but you see if it hadnt been for my unfortunately feeling the child and feeling it was warm which proved its being alive the poor young woman would have got off altogether perhaps so much for the sense of feeling which i say is of no use to nobody but only a vexation puffthe pipe out relightedpuff puff but father said mary did you ever hear the history of the poor girl yes i heard as how it was a hard case how she had been seduced by some fellow who had left her and her baby upon which she determined to drown herself poor thing and her baby too had she only tried to drown her baby i should have said it was quite unnatural but as she wished to drown herself at the same time i considers that drowning the baby to take it to heaven with her was quite natural and all agreeable to human natur loves a sense which young women should keep down as much as possible mary no good comes of that sense and yet father it appears to me to be human nature replied mary so it is but theres mischief in it girl so do you never have anything to do with it was there mischief when you fell in love with my mother and married her you shall hear mary replied old stapleton who recommenced it was bout two months after the poor girl threw herself into the river that i first seed your mother she was then mayhap two years older than you may be and much such a same sort of person in her looks there was a young man who plied from our stairs named ben jones he and i were great friends and used for to help each other and when a fare called for oars used to ply together one night he says to me will come up and ill show you a devilish fine piece of stuff so i walks with him and he takes me to a shop where they dealed in marine stores and we goes and finds your mother in the back parlour ben sends for pipes and beer and we sat down and made ourselves comfortable now mary your mother was a very jilting kind of girl who would put one fellow off to take another just as her whim and fancy took her i looked at mary who cast down her eyes now these women do a mint of mischief among men and it seldom ends well and id sooner see you in your coffin tomorrow mary than think you should be one of this flaunting sort ben jones was quite in for it and wanted for to marry her and she had turned off a fine young chap for him and he used to come there every night and it was supposed that they would be spliced in the course of a month but when i goes there she cuts him almost altogether and takes to me making such eyes at me and drinking beer out of my pot and refusing hisn till poor jones was quite mad and beside himself well it wasnt in human natur to stand those large blue eyes just like yours mary darting fire at a poor fellow and when jones got up in a surly humour and said it was time to go away instead of walking home arm in arm we went side by side like two big dogs with their tails as stiff up as a crowbar and ready for a fight neither he nor i saying a word and we parted without saying goodnight well i dreamed of your mother all that night and the next day went to see her and felt worser and worser each time and she snubbed jones and at last told him to go about his business this was bout a month after i had first seen her and then one day jones who was a prizefighter says to me be you a man and slaps me on the ear so i knowing what hed been ater pulls off my duds and we sets to we fights for ten minutes or so and then i hits him a round blow on the ear and he falls down on the hard and couldnt come to time no wonder poor fellow for he had gone to eternity here old stapleton paused for half a minute and passed his hand across his eyes i was tried for manslaughter but it being proved that he came up and struck me first i was acquitted after lying two months in gaol for i couldnt get no bail but it was because i had been two months in gaol that i was let off at first when i came out i determined never to see your mother again but she came to me and wound round me and i loved her so much that i couldnt shake her off as soon as she found that i was fairly hooked she began to play with others but i wouldnt stand that and every fellow that came near her was certain to have a turn out with me and so i became a great fighter and she seeing that i was the best man and that no one else would come to her one fine morning agreed to marry me well we were spliced and the very first night i thought i saw poor ben jones standing by my bedside and for a week or so i was not comfortable but howsomever it wore off i plied at the stairs and gained my money but my pipes out and im dry with talking suppose i take a spell for a few minutes stapleton relighted his pipe and for nearly halfanhour smoked in silence what marys thoughts were i cannot positively assert but i imagined that like myself she was thinking about her mothers conduct and her own i certainly was making the comparison and we neither of us spoke a word well continued stapleton at last i married your mother mary and i only hope that any man who may take a fancy to you will not have so much trouble with his wife as i had i thought that ater she were settled she would give up all her nonsense and behave herselfbut i suppose it was in her natur and she couldnt help it she made eyes and gave encouragement to the men until they became saucy and i became jealous and i had to fight one and then the other until i became a noted pugilist i will say that your mother seemed always very happy when i beat my man which latterly i always did but still she liked to be fit for and i had hardly time to earn my bread at last some one backed me against another man in the ring for fifty pound aside and i was to have half if i won i was very short of blunt at the time and i agreed so ater a little training the battle was fought and i won easy and the knowing ones liked my way of hitting so much that they made up another match with a better man for two hundred pounds and a lord and other great people came to me and i was introduced to them at the publichouse and all was settled so i became a regular prizefighter all through your mother mary nay dont cry child i dont mean to say that your mother with all her love of being stared at and talked to would have gone wrong but still it was almost as bad in my opinion well i was put into training and after five weeks we met at mousley hurst and a hard fight it wasbut ive got the whole of it somewhere mary look in the drawer there and youll see a newspaper mary brought out the newspaper which was rolled up and tied with a bit of string and stapleton handed it over to me telling me to read it aloud i did so but i shall not enter into the details yes thats all right enough said stapleton who had taken advantage of my reading to smoke furiously to make up for lost time but no good came of it for one of the gemmen took a fancy to your mother mary and tried to win her away from me i found him attempting to kiss her and she refusing himbut laughing and as i thought more than halfwilling so i floored him and put him out of the house and after that i never would have anything more to say with lords and gemmen nor with fighting either i built a new wherry and stuck to the river and i shifted my lodgings that i mightnt mix any more with those who knew me as a boxer your mother was then brought to bed with you and i hoped for a good deal of happiness as i thought she would only think of her husband and child and so she did until you were weaned and then she went on just as afore there was a captain of a vessel lying in the river who used now and then to stop and talk with her but i thought little about that seeing how every one talked with her and she with everybody and besides she knew the captains wife who was a very pretty woman and used very often to ask mary to go and see her which i permitted but one morning when i was going off to the boatfor he had come down to me to take him to his vesseljust as i was walking away with the sculls over my shoulder i recollects my baccy box which i had left and i goes back and hears him say before i came into the doorrecollect i shall be here again by two oclock and then you promised to come on board my ship and see i didnt hear the rest but she laughed and said yes she would i didnt show myself but walked away and went to the boat he followed me and i rowed him up the river and took my fareand then i determined to watch them for i felt mighty jealous so i lays off on my oars in the middle of the stream and sure enough i see the captain and your mother get into a small skiff belonging to his ship and pull away the captain had one oar and one of his men another i pulled ater them as fast as i could and at last they seed me and not wishing me to find her out she begged them to pull away as fast as they could for she knew how savage i would be still i gained upon them every now and then looking round and vowing vengeance in my heart when all of a sudden i heard a scream and perceived their boat to capsize and all hands in the water they had not seen a warp of a vessel getting into the row and had run over it and as it tautened they capsized your mother went down like a stone mary and was not found for three days aterward and when i seed her sink i fell down in a fit here old stapleton stopped laid down his pipe and rested his face in his hands mary burst into tears after a few minutes he resumed when i came to i found myself on board of the ship in the captains cabin with the captain and his wife watching over meand then i came to understand that it was she who had sent for your mother and that she was living on board and that your mother had at first refused because she knew that i did not like her to be on the river but wishing to see a ship had consented so it was not so bad ater all only that a woman shouldnt act without her husbandbut you see mary all this would not have happened if it hadnt been that i overheard part of what was said and you might now have had a mother and i a wife to comfort us if it had not been for my unfortunate hearingso as i said before theres more harm than good that comes from these sensesat least so it has proved to me and now you have heard my story and how your mother died mary so take care you dont fall into the same fault and be too fond of being looked at which it does somehow or another appear to me you have a bit of a hankering aterbut like mother like child they say and thats human natur when stapleton had concluded his narrative he smoked his pipe in silence mary sat at the table with her hands pressed to her temples apparently in deep thought and i felt anything but communicative in halfanhour the pot of beer was finished and stapleton rose come mary dont be thinking so much lets all go to bed show jacob his room and then come up jacob can find his own room father replied mary without my showing him he knows the kitchen and there is but one other below i took my candle wished them good night and went to my bed which although very homely was at all events comfortable chapter twenty four the warmth of my gratitude proved by a very cold testthe road to fortune may sometimes lead over a bridge of icemine lay under itamor vincet everything but my obstinacy which young tom and the old dominie in the sequel will prove to their cost for many days the frost continued until at last the river was frozen over and all communication by it was stopped stapletons money ran short our fare became very indifferent and mary declared that we must all go begging with the market gardeners if it lasted much longer i must go and call upon mr turnbull and ax him to help us said stapleton one day pulling his last shilling out and laying it on the table im cleaned out but hes a good gentleman and will lend me a trifle in the afternoon stapleton returned and i saw by his looks that he had been successful jacob said he mr turnbull desires that you will breakfast with him tomorrow morning as he wishes to see you i set off accordingly at daylight the next morning and was in good time for breakfast mr turnbull was as kind as ever and began telling me long stories about the ice in the northern regions bytheby i hear there is an ox to be roasted whole jacob a little above london bridge suppose we go and see the fun i consented and we took the brentford coach and were put down at the corner of queen street from thence we walked to the river the scene was very amusing and exciting booths were erected on the ice in every direction with flags flying people walking and some skating although the ice was too rough for that pastime the whole river was crowded with people who now walked in security over where they a month before would have met with death here and there smoke ascended from various fires on which sausages and other eatables were cooking but the great attraction was the ox roasting whole close to the centre pier of the bridge although the ice appeared to have fallen at the spot where so many hundreds were assembled yet as it was now four or five feet thick there was no danger here and there indeed were what were called rotten places where the ice was not sound but these were intimated by placards warning people not to approach too near and close to them were ropes and poles for succour if required we amused ourselves for some time with the gaiety of the scene for the sun shone out brightly and the sky was clear the wind was fresh from the northward and piercing cold in the shade the thermometer being then it was said twentyeight degrees below the freezing point we had been on the ice about three hours amusing ourselves when mr turnbull proposed our going home and we walked up the river towards blackfriars bridge where we proposed to land and take the coach at charing cross i wonder how the tide is now observed mr turnbull to me it would be rather puzzling to find out not if i can find a hole replied i looking for one stop here is one i threw in a piece of ice and found that it was strong ebb we continued our walk over the ice which was now very rough when mr turnbulls hat fell off and the wind catching it it blew away skimming across the ice at a rapid rate mr turnbull and i gave chase but could scarcely keep up with it and at all events could not overtake it many people on the river laughed as we passed and watched us in our chase mr turnbull was the foremost and heedless in the pursuit did not observe a large surface of rotten ice before him neither did i until all at once i heard it break and saw mr turnbull fall in and disappear many people were close to us and a rope was laid across the spot to designate the danger i did not hesitatei loved mr turnbull and my love and my feelings of resentment were equally potent i seized the bight of the rope twisted it round my arm and plunged in after recollecting it was ebb tide fortunate for mr turnbull it was that he had accidentally put the question i sank under the ice and pushed down the stream and in a few seconds felt myself grappled by him i sought and at almost the same time the rope hauling in from above as soon as they found there was resistance they knew that i at least was attached to it and they hauled in quicker not however until i had lost my recollection still i clung to the rope with the force of a drowning man and mr turnbull did the same to me and we shortly made our appearance at the hole in which we had been plunged a ladder was thrown across and two of the men of the humane society came to our assistance pulled us out and laid us upon it they then drew back and hauled us on the ladder to a more secure situation we were both still senseless but having been taken to a publichouse on the riverside were put to bed and medical advice having been procured were soon restored the next morning we were able to return in a chaise to brentford where our absence had created the greatest alarm mr turnbull spoke but little the whole time but he often pressed my hand and when i requested him to drop me at fulham that i might let stapleton and his daughter know that i was safe he consented saying god bless you my fine boy i will see you soon when i went up the stairs of stapletons lodgings i found mary by herself she started up as soon as she saw me where have you been said she half crying half smiling under the ice i replied and only thawed again this morning are you in earnest jacob said she now dont plague and frighten me ive been too frightened already i never slept a wink last night i then told her the circumstances which had occurred i was sure something had happened she replied i told my father so but he wouldnt believe it you promised to be at home to give me my lesson and i know you never break your word but my father smoked away and said that when boys are amused they forget their promises and that it was nothing but human natur oh jacob im so glad youre back again and after what has happened i dont mind your kissing me for once and mary held her face towards me and returned my kiss there that must last you a long while recollect said she laughing you must not think of another until youre under the ice again then i trust it will be the last replied i laughing you are not in love with me jacob thats clear or you would not have made that answer replied mary i had seen a great deal of mary and though she certainly was a great flirt yet she had many excellent and amiable qualities for the first week after her father had given us the history of his life his remarks upon her mother appeared to have made a decided impression upon her and her conduct was much more staid and demure but as the remembrance wore off so did her conduct become coquettish and flirting as before still it was impossible not to be fond of her and even with all her caprice there was such a fund of real good feeling and amiableness which when called forth was certain to appear that i often thought how dangerous and captivating a girl she would be when she grew up i had again produced the books which i had thrown aside with disgust to teach her to read and write her improvement was rapid and would have been still more so if she had not been just as busy in trying to make me fond of her as she was in surmounting the difficulties of her lessons but she was very young and although as her father declared it was her natur to run after the men there was every reason to hope that a year or two would render her less volatile and add to those sterling good qualities which she really possessed in heart and feeling she was a modest girl although the buoyancy of her spirits often carried her beyond the bounds prescribed by decorum and often called forth a blush upon her own animated countenance when her good sense or the remarks of others reminded her of her having committed herself it was impossible to know mary and not like her although at a casual meeting a rigid person might go away with an impression by no means favourable as for myself i must say that the more i was in her company the more i was attached to her and the more i respected her old stapleton came home in the evening he had as usual been smoking and thinking of human natur at the feathers publichouse i told him what had happened and upon the strength of it he sent for an extra pot of beer for mary and me which he insisted upon our drinking between usa greater proof of goodwill on his part could not have been given although captain turnbull appeared to have recovered from the effects of the accident yet it seemed that such was not the case as the morning after his arrival he was taken ill with shivering and pains in his loins which ended in ague and fever and he did not quit his bed for three or four weeks i on the contrary felt no ill effects but the constitution of a youth is better able to meet such violent shocks than that of a man of sixty years old already sapped by exposure and fatigue as the frost still continued i complied with captain turnbulls request to come up and stay with him and for many days until he was able to leave his bed i was his constant nurse the general theme of his conversation was on my future prospects and a wish that i would embark in some pursuit or profession more likely to raise me in the world but on this head i was positive and also another point which was that i would in future put myself under an obligation to no one i could not erase from my memory the injuries i had received and my vindictive spirit continually brooded over them i was resolved to be independent and free i felt that in the company i was in i was with my equals or if there were any superiority it was on my part arising from education and i never would submit to be again in the society of those above me in which i was admitted as a favour and by the major part looked down upon and at the same time liable as i had once been to be turned out with contumely on the first moment of caprice still i was very fond of captain turnbull he had always been kind to me spoke to me on terms of equality and had behaved with consistency and my feelings towards him since the accident had consequently strengthened but we always feel an increased regard towards those to whom we have been of service and my pride was softened by the reflection that whatever might be mr turnbulls goodwill towards me he never could even if i would permit it repay me for the life which i had preserved towards him i felt unbounded regard towards those who had illtreated me unlimited hatred towards the world in general a mixture of feeling which i could hardly analyse and as far as regarded myself a love of liberty and independence which nothing would ever have induced me to compromise as i did not wish to hurt captain turnbulls feelings by a direct refusal to all his proffers of service and remarks upon the advantages which might arise i generally made an evasive answer but when on the day proposed for my departure he at once came to the point offering me everything and observing that he was childless and therefore my acceptance of his offer would be injurious to nobody when he took me by the hand and drawing me near to him passed his arm round me and spoke to me in the kind accents of a father almost entreating me to consentthe tears of gratitude coursed each other rapidly down my cheeks but my resolution was no less firmalthough it was with a faltering voice that i replied you have been very kind to me sirvery kindand i shall never forget it and i hope i shall deserve itbutmr drummond and mrs drummond and sarah were also kind to mevery kind to meyou know the rest i will remain as i am if you please and if you wish to do me a kindness if you wish me to love you as i really do let me be as i amfree and independent i beg it of you as the greatest favour that you can possibly confer on methe only favour which i can accept or shall be truly thankful for captain turnbull was some minutes before he could reply he then saidi see it is useless and i will not tease you any more but jacob do not let the fire of injustice which you have received from your fellowcreatures prey so much upon your mind or induce you to form the mistaken idea that the world is bad as you live on you will find much good and recollect that those who injured you from the misrepresentation of others have been willing and have offered to repair their fault they can do no more and i wish you could get over this vindictive feeling recollect we must forgive as we hope to be forgiven i do sometimes said i for sarahs sakei cant always but you ought to forgive for other reasons jacob i know i oughtbut if i cannot i cannot nay my boy i never heard you talk soi was going to saywickedly do you not perceive that you are now in error you will not abandon a feeling which your own good sense and religion tell you to be wrongyou cling to itand yet you will admit of no excuse for the errors of others i feel what you sayand the truth of it sir replied i but i cannot combat the feeling i will therefore admit every excuse you please for the faults of others but at the same time i am surely not to be blamed if i refuse to put myself in a situation where i am again liable to meet with mortification surely i am not to be censured if i prefer to work for my bread after my own fashion and prefer the river to dry land no that i acknowledge but what i dislike in the choice is that it is dictated by feelings of resentment whats done cant be helped replied i quickly wishing to break off the conversation very true jacob but i follow that up with another of your remarks which is better luck next time god bless you my boy take care of yourself and dont get under the ice again for you i would tomorrow replied i taking the proffered hand but if i could only see that hodgson near a hole youd not push him in indeed i would replied i bitterly jacob you would not i tell youyou think so now but if you saw him in distress you would assist him as you did me i know you my boy better than you know yourself whether captain turnbull or i were right remains to be proved in the sequel we then shook hands and i hastened away to see mary whom i had often thought of during my absence who do you think has been here said mary after our first greeting i cannot guess replied i not old tom and his son no i dont think it was old tom but it was such an old quizwith such a noseo heavens i thought i should have died with laughing as soon as he went downstairs do you know jacob that i made love to him just to see how hed take it you know who it is now o yes you mean the dominie my schoolmaster yes he told me so and i talked so much about you and about your teaching me to read and write and how fond i was of learning and how i should like to be married to an elderly man who was a great scholar who would teach me latin and greek that the old gentleman became quite chatty and sat for two hours talking to me he desired me to say that he should call here tomorrow afternoon and i begged him to stay the evening as you are to have two more of your friends here now who do you think are those i have no others except old tom beazeley and his son well it is your old tom after all and a nice old fellow he is although i would not like him for a husband but as for his sonhes a lad after my own heartim quite in love with him your love will do you no harm mary but recollect what may be a joke to you may not be so to other people as for the dominie meeting old beazeley and his son i dont exactly know how that will suit for i doubt if he will like to see them why not inquired mary upon a promise never to hint at them i briefly stated the circumstances attending the worthy mans voyage on board of the lighter mary paused and then said jacob did we not read the last time that the most dangerous rocks to men were wine and women yes we did if i recollect right humph said she the old gentleman has given plenty of lessons in his time and it appears that he has received one we may do so to the last day of our existence mary well he is a very clever learned man ive no doubt and looks down upon all of us not you jacob as silly people ill try if i cant give him a lesson you mary what can you teach him never mind we shall see and mary turned the discourse on her father you know i suppose that father is gone up to mr turnbulls no i did not yes he has he was desired to go there this morning and hasnt been back since jacob i hope you wont be so foolish again for i dont want to lose my master oh never fear i shall teach you all you want to know before i die i replied dont be too sure of that replied mary how do you know how much i may wish to have of your company well if i walk off in a hurry ill make you over to young tom beazeley youre half in love with him already you know replied i laughing well he is a nice fellow replied she he laughs more than you do jacob he has suffered less replied i gloomily calling to mind what had occurred but mary he is a fine young man and a goodhearted clever fellow to boot and when you do know him you will like him very much as i said this i heard her father coming up stairs he came in high goodhumour with his interview with captain turnbull called for his pipe and pot and was excessively fluent upon human natur chapter twenty five the feast of reason and the flow of soulstapleton on human nature proves the former the dominie in his melting mood the lattersalls shoe particularly noted and the true reading made easy of a mind at ease by old tom the afternoon of the next day i heard a wellknown voice which carolled forth as mary huddled up her books and put them out of the way for at that time i was as usual giving her a lesson and many strange sights ive seen and long ive been a rover and everywhere ive been but now the wars are over ive been across the line where the sun will burn your nose off and ive been in northern climes where the frost would bite your toes off fal de ral fal de ral fal de ral de liddy heave ahead tom and let me stump up at my leisure its like warping gainst wind and tide with meand i gets up about as fast as lawyers go to heaven i thought when tom came up first that he had been at unusual trouble in setting off his person and certainly a betterlooking frank open merry countenance was seldom to be seen in person he was about an inch taller than i athletic and well formed he made up to mary who perceiving his impatience and either to check him before me or else from her usual feeling of coquetry received him rather distantly and went up to old tom with whom she shook hands warmly whew whats in the wind now jacob why we parted the best friends in the world said tom looking at mary sheer off yourself tom replied i laughing and youll see that shell come to again oh oh so the winds in that quarter is it replied tom with all my hearti can show false colours as well as she can but i say jacob before i begin my manoeuvres tell me if you wish me to hoist the neutral flagfor i wont interfere with you heres my hand upon it tom that the coast is clear as far as im concerned but take careshes a clipper and not unlikely to slip through your fingers even when you have her under your lee within hail let me alone jacob for that and more tom when youre in possession of her she will require a good man at the helm then shes just the craft after my fancy i hate your steady slowsailing craft that will steer themselves almost give me one that requires to be managed by a man and a seaman if well manned she will do anything depend upon it tom for shes as sound below as possible and although she is down to her bearings on the puff of the moment yet shed not careen further well then jacob alls right and now youve told me what tack shes on see if i dont shape a course to cut her off well jacob my good boy so youve been under the water again i thought you had enough of it when fleming gave you such a twist but however this time you went to sarve a friend which was all right my sarvice to you mr stapleton continued old tom as stapleton made his appearance i was talking to jacob about his last dive nothing but human natur replied stapleton well now replied old tom i consider that going plump into the river when covered with ice to be quite contrary to human natur but not to save a friend father nobecause that be jacobs nature so you see one nature conquered the other and thats the whole long and short of it well now suppose we sit down and make ourselves comfortable observed stapleton but here be somebody else coming upwho can it be i say old codger considering you be as deaf as a post you hears pretty well said old tom yes i hear very well in the house provided people dont speak loud well thats a queer sort of deafness i think we are all troubled with the same complaint cried tom laughing during this remark the dominie made his appearance salve domine said i upon his entering taking my worthy pedagogue by the hand et tu quoque fili mi jacobe but whom have we here the deaf man the maiden andehuthe old man called old tom and likewise the young tom and the dominie looked very grave nay sir said young tom going up to the dominie i know you are angry with us because we both drank too much when we were last in your company but we promisedont we fathernot to do so again this judicious reply of young toms put the dominie more at his ease what he most feared was raillery and exposure on their parts very true old gentleman tom and i did bowse our jibs up a little too taut when we last metbut what thenthere was the grog and there was nothing to do all human natur observed stapleton come sir you have not said one word to me said mary going up to the dominie now you must sit down by me and take care of me and see that they all behave themselves and keep sober the dominie cast a look at mary which was intended for her alone but which was not unperceived by young tom or me we shall have some fun jacob said he aside as we all sat down to the table which just admitted six with close stowage the dominie on one side of mary tom on the other stapleton next to tom then i and old tom who closed in on the other side of the dominie putting one of his timber toes on the old gentlemans corns which induced him to lift up his leg in a hurry and draw his chair still closer to mary to avoid a repetition of the accident while old tom was axing pardon and stapleton demonstrating that on the part of old tom not to feel with a wooden leg and on the part of the dominie to feel with a bad corn was all nothing but human natur at last we were all seated and mary who had provided for the evening produced two or three pots of beer a bottle of spirits pipes and tobacco liberty halli smokes said stapleton lighting his pipe and falling back on his chair ill put a bit of clay in my mouth too followed up old tom it makes one thirsty and enjoy ones liquor well i malts said tom reaching a pot of porter and taking a long pull what do you do jacob i shall wait a little tom and what do you do sir said mary to the dominie the dominie shook his head nay but you mustor i shall think you do not like my company come let me fill a pipe for you mary filled a pipe and handed it to the dominie who hesitated looked at her and was overcome he lighted it and smoked furiously the ice is breaking upwe shall have a change of weatherthe moon quarters tomorrow observed old tom puffing between every observation and then honest men may earn their bread again bad times for you old codger heh continued he addressing stapleton stapleton nodded an assent through the smoke which was first perceived by old tom well he arnt deaf ater all i thought he was only shamming a bit i say jacob this is the weather to blow your fingers and make your eyes bright rather to blow a cloud and make your eyes water replied tom taking up the pot im just as thirsty with swallowing smoke as if i had a pipe myselfat all events i pipe my eye jacob continued tom to me apart do look how the old gentleman is funking mary and casting sheeps eyes at her through the smoke he appears as if he were inclined to board her in the smoke replied i yes and she to make no fight of it but surrender immediately said tom dont you believe it tom i know her better she wants to laugh at himnothing more she winked her eye at me just now but i would not laugh as i did not choose that the old gentleman should be trifled with i will tax her severely tomorrow during all this time old tom and stapleton smoked in silence the dominie made use of his eyes in dumb parlance to mary who answered him with her own bright glances and tom and i began to find it rather dull when at last old toms pipe was exhausted and he laid it down there ill smoke no morethe worst of a pipe is that one cant smoke and talk at the same time mary my girl take your eyes off the dominies nose and hand me that bottle of stuff what glass to mix it in thats more genteel than we are on board tom tom filled a rummer of grog took half off at a huge sip and put it down on the table will you do as we do sir said he addressing the dominie nay friend dux nayprythee persuade me notavaunt and the dominie with an appearance of horror turned away from the bottle handed towards him by old tom not drink anything said mary to the dominie looking at him with surprise but indeed you must or i shall think you despise us and do not think us fit to be in your company nay maiden entreat me not ask anything of me but this replied the dominie ask anything but thisthats just the way people have of refusing replied mary were i to ask anything else it would be the same answerask anything but this now if you will not drink to please me i shall quarrel with you you shall drink a glass and ill mix it for you the dominie shook his head mary made a glass of grog and then put it to her lips now if you refuse to drink it after i have tasted it ill never speak to you again so saying she handed the glass to the dominie verily maiden i must needs refuse for i did make a mental vow what vow was that was it sworn on the bible nay not on the sacred book but in my thoughts most solemnly oh i make those vows every day and never keep one of them so that wont do now observe i give you one more chance i shall drink a little more and if you do not immediately put your lips to the same part of the tumbler ill never drink to you again mary put the tumbler again to her lips drank a little with her eyes fixed upon the dominie who watched her with distended nostrils and muscular agitation of countenance with her sweetest smile she handed him the tumbler the dominie half held out his hand withdrew it put it down again and by degrees took the tumbler mary conquered and i watched the malice of her look as the liquor trickled down the dominies throat tom and i exchanged glances the dominie put down the tumbler and then looking round like a guilty person coloured up to the eyes but mary who perceived that her victory was but half achieved put her hand upon his shoulder and asked him to let her taste the grog again i also to make him feel more at ease helped myself to a glass tom did the same and old tom with more regard to the feelings of the dominie than in his own bluntness of character i would have given him credit for said in a quiet tone the old gentleman is afraid of grog because he seed me take a drop too much but thats no reason why grog arnt a good thing and wholesome in moderation a glass or two is very well and better still when sweetened by the lips of a pretty girl and even if the dominie does not like it hes too much of a gentleman not to give up his dislikes to please a lady mores the merit for if he did like it it would be no sacrifice thats sartain dont you think so my old boozer continued he addressing stapleton who smoked in silence human natur replied stapleton taking the pipe out of his mouth and spitting under the table very true master and so heres to your health mr dominie and may you never want a pretty girl to talk to or a glass of grog to drink her health with oh but the dominie dont care about pretty girls father replied tom hes too learned and clever he thinks about nothing but the moon and latin and greek and all that who can say whats under the skin tom theres no knowing what is and what isntsalls shoe for that never heard of salls shoe father thats new to me didnt i ever tell you that tomwell then you shall have it now that is if all the company be agreeable oh yes cried mary pray tell us would you like to hear it sir i never heard of sall sue in my life and would fain hear her history replied the dominie proceed friend dux well then you must know when i was aboard of the terpsychore there was a foretopman of the name of bill harness a good sort of chap enough but rather soft in the upperworks now wed been on the jamaica station for some years and had come home and merry enough and happy enough we were those that were left of us and we were spending our money like the devil bill harness had a wife who was very fond of he and he was very fond of she but she was a slatternly sort of a body never tidy in her rigging all adrift at all times and whats more she never had a shoe up at heel so she went by the name of slatternly sall and the first lieutenant who was a ticular sort of a chap never liked to see her on deck for you see she put her hair in paper on new years day and never changed it or took it out till the year came round again however be it as it may be she loved bill and bill loved she and they were very happy together ater all it aint whether a womans tidy without that makes a mans happiness it depends upon whether she be right within that is if she be goodtempered and obliging and civil and commodating and so forth ater the first day or two persons nothingeyes get palled like the capstern when the anchors up to the bows but what a man likes is not to be disturbed by vagaries or gusts of temper well bill was happybut one day he was devilish unhappy because sall had lost one of her shoes which wasnt to be wondered at considering as how she was always slipshod who has seen my wifes shoe says he hang your wifes shoe said one it warnt worth casting an eye upon still he cried out who has seen my wifes shoe i seed it says another where says bill i seed it down at heel says the fellow but bill still hallooed out about his wifes shoe which it appeared she had dropped off her foot as she was going up the forecastle ladder to take the air a bit just as it was dark at last bill made so much fuss about it that the ships company laughed and all called out to each other who has seen salls shoehave you got salls shoe and they passed the word fore and aft the whole evening till they went to their hammocks notwithstanding as salls shoe was not forthcoming the next morning bill goes on the quarterdeck and complains to the first lieutenant as how he had lost salls shoe damn salls shoe said he havent i enough to look after without your wifes confounded shoes which cant be worth twopence well bill argues that his wife had only one shoe left and that wont keep two feet dry and begs the first lieutenant to order a search for it but the first lieutenant turns away and tells him to go to the devil and all the men grin at bills making such a fuss about nothing so bill at last goes up to the first lieutenant and whispers something and the first lieutenant booms him off with his speaking trumpet as if he were making too free in whispering to his commanding officer and then sends for the masteratarms collier says he this man has lost his wifes shoe let a search be made for it immediatelytake all the ships boys and look everywhere for it if you find it bring it up to me so away goes the masteratarms with his cane and collects all the boys to look for salls shoeand they go peeping about the maindeck under the guns and under the hencoops and in the sheeppen and everywhere now and then getting a smart slap with the cane behind upon the taut part of their trowsers to make them look sharp until they all wished salls shoe at old nick and her too and bill in the bargain at last one of the boys picks it out of the manger where it had lain all the night poked up and down by the noses of the pigs who didnt think it eatable although it might have smelt humanlike the fact was it was the same boy who had picked up salls shoe when she dropped it and had shied it forward it sartainly did not seem to be worth all the trouble but howsomever it was taken aft by the masteratarms and laid on the capstern head then bill steps out and takes the shoe before the first lieutenant and cuts it open and from between the lining pulls out four ten pound notes which sall had sewn up there by way of security and the first lieutenant tells bill he was a great fool to trust his money in the shoe of a woman who always went slipshod and tells him to go about his business and stow his money away in a safer place next time ater if any thing was better than it looked to be the ships company used always to say it was like salls shoe there you have it all well says stapleton taking the pipe out of his mouth i know a fact much of a muchness with that which happened to me when i was below the river tending a ship at sheernessfor at one time dye see i used to ply there she was an old fiftygun ship called the adamant if i recollect right one day the first lieutenant who like yourn was a mighty particular sort of chap was going round the maindeck and he sees an old pair of canvas trowsers stowed in under the trunnion of one of the guns so says he whose be these now no man would answer because they knowed very well that it would be as good as a fortnight in the black list with that the first lieutenant bundles them out of the port and away they floats astern with the tide it was about halfanhour after that that i comes off with the milk for the wardroom mess and a man named will heaviside says to me stapleton says he the first lieutenant has thrown my canvas trowsers overboard and be damned to him now i must have them back but where be they says i i suppose down at the bottom by this time and the flatfish dubbing their noses into them no no says he they wont never sink but float till eternity they be gone down with the tide and they will come back again only you keep a sharp lookout for them and ill give you five shillings if you bring them well i seed little chance of ever seeing them again or of my seeing five shillings but as it so happened next tide the very denticle pair of trowsers comes up staring me in the face i pulls them in and takes them to will heaviside who appears to be mightily pleased and gives me the money i wouldnt have lost them for ten no not fur twenty pounds says he at all events youve paid me more than they are worth says i have i says he stop a bit and he outs with his knife and rips open the waistband and pulls out a piece of linen and out of the piece of linen he pulls out a childs caul there says he now you knows why the trowsers wouldnt sink and ill leave you to judge whether they arnt worth five shillings thats my story well i cant understand how it is that a caul should keep people up observed old tom at all events a call makes people come up fast enough on board a manofwar father thats true enough but im talking of a childs caul not of a boatswains tom ill just tell you how it is replied stapleton who had recommenced smoking its human natur what is your opinion sir said mary to the dominie maiden replied the dominie taking his pipe out of his mouth i opine that its a vulgar error sir thomas brown i think it is hath the same idea many and strange were the superstitions which have been handed down by our less enlightened ancestorsall of which mists have been cleared away by the powerful rays of truth well but master if a vulgar error saves a man from davy joness locker arnt it just as well to sew it up in the waistband of your trowsers granted good dux if it would save a man but how is it possible it is contrary to the first elements of science what matter does that make provided it holds a man up friend dux thou art obtuse well perhaps i am as i dont know what that is but father dont you recollect interrupted tom what the parson said last sunday that faith saved men now master dominie may it not be faith that a man has in the caul which may save him young tom thou art astute well perhaps i am as father said for i dont know what that is you knock us all down with your dictionary well i do love to hear people make use of such hard words said mary looking at the dominie how very clever you must be sir i wonder whether i shall ever understand them nay if thou wilt i will initiatesweet maiden wilt steal an hour or so to impregnate thy mind with the seeds of learning which in so fair a soil must needs bring forth good fruit thats a fine word that impregnatewill you give us the english of it sir said young tom to the dominie it is english tom only the old gentleman razeed it a little the third ship in the lee line of the channel fleet was a eighty called the impregnable but the old gentleman knows more about books than sea matters a marvellous misconception quoth the dominie theres another cried tom laughing that must be a threedecker come father heres the bottle you must take another glass to wash that down pray what was the meaning of that last long word sir said mary taking the dominie by the arm missomething the word replied the dominie is a compound from conception borrowed from the latin tongue implying conceiving and the mis prefixed which negatives or reverses the meaning misconception therefore implies not to conceive i can make you acquainted with many others of a similar tendency as misconception videlicet mis apprehension misunderstanding miscontriving misapplying mis dear me what a many misses cried mary and do you know them all indeed do i replied the dominie and many many more are treasured in my memory quod nunc describere tongum est id no idea that the old gentleman was given to running after the girls in that way said old tom to stapleton human natur replied the other no more did i continued mary i shall have nothing to say to him and she drew off her chair a few inches from that of the dominie maiden quoth the dominie thou art under a mistake another miss i declare cried tom laughing what an old turk continued mary getting further off nay then i will not reply said the dominie indignantly putting down his pipe leaning back on his chair and pulling out his great red handkerchief which he applied to his nose and produced a sound that made the windows of the little parlour vibrate for some seconds i say master tom dont you make too free with your betters said old tom when he saw the dominie affronted nay replied the dominie theres an old adage which saith as the old cock crows so doth the young wherefore didst thou set him the example very true old gentleman and i axes your pardon and heres my hand upon it and so do i sir and heres my hand upon it said young tom extending his hand on the dominies other side friend dux and thou young tom i do willingly accept thy proffered reconciliation knowing as i well do that there may be much mischief in thy composition but naught of malice the dominie extended his hands and shook both those offered to him warmly there said old tom now my minds at ease as old pigtown said i know not the author whom thou quotest from good dux authori never said he was an author he was only captain of a schooner trading between the islands that i sailed with a few weeks in the west indies perhaps then you will relate to the company present the circumstances which took place to put old pegtopsi may not be correct in the namebut whoever it may be pigtown master well thenthat put old pigtowns mind at easefor i am marvellously amused with thy narrations which do pass away the time most agreeably good dux with all my heart old gentleman but first let us fill up our tumblers i dont know how it is but it does appear to me that grog drinks better out of a glass than out of metal and if it wasnt that tom is so carelessand the dog has no respect for crockery any more than personsi would have one or two on board for particular service but ill think about that and hear what the old woman has to say on the subject now to my yarn dye see old pigtown commanded a little schooner which plied between the isles and he had been in her for a matter of forty years and was as wellknown as port royal tom who might port royal tom be inquired the dominie a relation of yours i hope not master for i wanted none of his acquaintance he was a shark about twenty feet long who rode guard in the harbour to prevent the menofwars men from deserting and was pensioned by government pensioned by government nay but that soundeth strangely i have heard that pensions have been most lavishly bestowed but not that it extended so far truly it must have been a sinecure i dont know what that last may be replied old tom but i heard our boatswain in the minerve who talked politics a bit say as how half the pensions were held by a pack of damned sharks but in this here sharks case it wasnt in money master but hed regular rations of bullocks liver to persuade him to remain in the harbour and no one dare swim on shore when he was cruising round and round the ships well old pigtown with his white trousers and straw hat red nose and big belly was as wellknown as could be and was a capital old fellow for remembering and executing commissions provided you gave him the money first if not he always took care to forget them old pigtown had a son a little dark or so which proved that his mother wasnt quite as fair as a lily and this son was employed in a drogher that is a small craft which goes round to the bays of the island and takes off the sugars to the west india traders one fine day the drogher was driven out to sea and never heard of aterwards now old pigtown was very anxious about what had come of his son and day after day expected he would come back again but he never did for very good reasons as you shall hear byandby and every one knowing old pigtown and he knowing everybody it was at least fifty times a day that the question was put to him well pigtown have you heard anything of your son and fifty times a day he would reply no and my minds but ill at ease well it was two or three months afterwards that when i was in the schooner with him as we lay becalmed between the islands with the sun frizzing our wigs and the planks so hot that you couldnt walk without your shoes that we hooked a large shark which came bowling under our counter got him on board and cut him up when we opened his inside what should i see but something shining i took it out and sure enough it was a silver watch so i hands it to old pigtown he looks at it very tentively opens the outside case reads the makers name and then shuts it up again this here watch says he belonged to my son jack i bought it of a chap in a south whaler for three dollars and a roll of pigtail and a very good watch it was though i perceive it to be stopped now now dye see its all clearthe drogher must have gone down in a squallthe shark must have picked up my son jack and must have digested his body but has not been able to digest his watch now i knows whats become of him and somy minds at ease well observed old stapleton i agrees with old poptown or whatever his name might be that it were better to know the worst at once than to be kept on the worry all your days i consider its nothing but human natur why if one has a bad tooth which is the best plan to have it out with one good wrench or to be eternally tormented night and day thou speakest wisely friend stapleton and like a man of resolvethe anticipation is often if not always more painful than the reality thou knowest jacob how often i have allowed a boy to remain unbuttoned in the centre of the room for an hour previous to the application of the birchand it was with the consideration that the impression would be greater upon his mind than even upon his nether parts all of the feelings in the human breast that of suspense is worse than hanging interrupted young tom even so boy cluck cluck an apt comparison seeing that in suspense you are hanging as it were in the very region of doubt without being able to obtain a footing even upon conjecture nay we may further add another simile although not so well borne out which is that the agony of suspense doth stop the breath of a man for the time as hanging doth stop it altogether so that it may be truly said that suspense is put an end to by suspending cluck cluck and now that youve got rid of all that master suppose you fill up your pipe observed old tom and i will fill up your tumbler sir said mary for you must be dry with talking such hard words the dominie this time made no objection and again enveloped mary and himself in a cloud of smoke through which his nose loomed like an indiaman in a channel fog chapter twenty six the dominies bosom grows too warm so the party and the frost break upi go with the stream and against it make money both wayscoolness between mary and meno chance of a thames edition of abelard and eloiselove learning and latin all lost in a fit of the sulks i say master stapleton suppose we were to knock out half a port observed old tom after a silence of two minutes for the old gentleman blows a devil of a cloud that is if no one has an objection stapleton gave a nod of assent and i rose and put the upper window down a few inches ay thats right jacob now we shall see what miss mary and he are about youve been enjoying the lady all to yourself master continued tom addressing the dominie verily and truly replied the dominie even as a second jupiter never heard of him i presume not still jacob will tell thee that the history is to be found in ovids metamorphoses never heard of the country master nay friend dux it is a book not a country in which thou mayst read how jupiter at first descended unto semele in a cloud and pray where did he come from master he came from heaven the devil he did well if ever i gets there i mean to stay it was love allpowerful love which induced him maiden replied the dominie turning with a smiling eye to mary bove my comprehension altogether replied old tom human natur muttered stapleton with the pipe still between his lips not the first vessels that have run foul in a fog observed young tom no boy but generally there arnt much love between them at those times but come now that we can breathe again suppose i give you a song what shall it be young woman a sea ditty or something spooney oh something about love if youve no objection sir said mary appealing to the dominie nay it pleaseth me maiden and i am of thy mind friend dux let it be anacreontic what the devils that cried old tom lifting up his eyes and taking the pipe out of his mouth nothing of your own father thats clear but something to borrow for its to be on tick replied tom nay boy i would have been understood that the song should refer to women or wine both of which are to his fancy observed young tom to me aside human natur quaintly observed stapleton well then you shall have your wish ill give you one that might be warbled in a ladys chamber without stirring the silk curtains oh the days are gone when beauty bright my hearts chain wove when my dream of life from morn to night was lovestill love new hope may bloom and days may come of milder calmer beam but theres nothing half so sweet in life as loves young dream oh theres nothing half so sweet in life as loves young dream the melody of the song added to the spirits he had drunk and marys eyes beaming on him had a great effect upon the dominie as old tom warbled out so did the pedagogue gradually approach the chair of mary and as gradually entwine her waist with his own arm his eyes twinkling brightly on her old tom who perceived it had given me and tom a wink as he repeated the two last lines and then we saw what was going on we burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter boys boys said the dominie starting up thou hast awakened me by thy boisterous mirth from a sweet musing created by the harmony of friend duxs voice neither do i discover the source of thy cachinnation seeing that the song is amatory and not comic still it may not be supposed at thy early age that thou canst be affected with what thou art too young to feel prythee continue friend dux and boys restrain thy mirth though the bard to a purer fame may soar when wild youths past though he win the wise who frowned before to smile at last hell never meet a joy so sweet in all his noon of fame as when first he sung to womans ear his soulfelt flame and at every close she blushd to hear the oncelovd name at the commencement of this verse the dominie appeared to be on his guard but gradually moved by the power of song he dropped his elbow on the table and his pipe underneath it his forehead sank into his broad palm and he remained motionless the verse ended and the dominie forgetting all around him softly ejaculated without looking up eheu mary did you speak to me sir said mary who perceiving us tittering addressed the dominie with a halfserious halfmocking air speak maiden nay i spoke not yet thou mayest give me my pipe which apparently hath been abducted while i was listening to the song abducted thats a new word but it means smashed into twenty pieces i suppose observed young tom at all events your pipe is for you let it fall between your legs never mind said mary rising from her chair and going to the cupboard heres another sir well master am i to finish or have you had enough of it proceed friend dux proceed and believe that i am all attention oh that hallowed form is neer forgot which first love tracd still it lingering haunts the greenest spot on memorys waste twas odour fled as soon as shed twas memorys winged dream twas a light that neer can shine again on lifes dull stream oh twas light that neer can shine again on lifes dull stream nay said the dominie again abstracted the metaphor is not just lifes dull stream lethe tacitus amnis as lucan hath it but the stream of life flowsay flows rapidlyeven in my veins doth not the heart throb and beatyea stronglyperadventure too forcibly against my better judgment confiteor misere molle cor esse mihi as ovid saith yet must it not prevail shall one girl be victorious over seventy boys shall i dominie dobbs desert my postagain succumb toi will even depart that i may be at my desk at matutinal hours you dont mean to leave us sir said mary taking the dominies arm even so fair maiden for it waxeth late and i have my duties to perform said the dominie rising from his chair then you will promise to come again peradventure i may if you do not promise me that you will i will not let you go now verily maiden promise interrupted mary truly maiden promise cried mary in good sooth maiden promise reiterated mary pulling the dominie towards her chair nay then i do promise since thou wilt have it so replied the dominie and when will you come i will not tarry replied the dominie and now good night to all the dominie shook hands with us and mary lighted him downstairs i was much pleased with the resolution and sense of his danger thus shown by my worthy preceptor and hoped that he would have avoided mary in future who evidently wished to make a conquest of him for her own amusement and love of admiration but still i felt that the promise exacted would be fulfilled and i was afraid that a second meeting and that perhaps not before witnesses would prove mischievous i made up my mind to speak to mary on the subject as soon as i had an opportunity and insist upon her not making a fool of the worthy old man mary remained below a much longer time than was necessary and when she reappeared and looked at me as if for a smile of approval i turned from her with a contemptuous air she sat down and looked confused tom was also silent and paid her no attention a quarter of an hour passed when he proposed to his father that they should be off and the party broke up leaving mary silent and thoughtful and old stapleton finishing his pipe i took my candle and went to bed the next day the moon changed the weather changed and a rapid thaw took place its an ill wind that blows nobody good observed old stapleton we watermen will have the river to ourselves again and the hucksters must carry their gingerbreadnuts to another market it was however three or four days before the river was clear of the ice so as to permit the navigation to proceed and during that time i may as well observe that there was dissension between mary and me i showed her that i resented her conduct and at first she tried to pacify me but finding that i held out longer than she expected she turned round and was affronted in return short words and no lessons were the order of the day and as each party seemed determined to hold out there was little prospect of a reconciliation in this she was the greatest sufferer as i quitted the house after breakfast and did not return until dinner time at first old stapleton plied very regularly and took all the fares but about a fortnight after we had worked together he used to leave me to look after employment and remain at the publichouse the weather was now fine and after the severe frost it changed so rapidly that most of the trees were in leaf and the horsechestnuts in full blossom the wherry was in constant demand and every evening i handed from four to six shillings over to old stapleton i was delighted with my life and should have been perfectly happy if it had not been for my quarrel with mary still continuing she as resolutely refraining from making advances as i how much may life be embittered by dissension with those you live with even when there is no very warm attachment the constant grating together worries and annoys and although you may despise the atoms the aggregate becomes insupportable i had no pleasure in the house and the evenings which formerly passed so agreeably were now a source of vexation from being forced to sit in company with one with whom i was not on good terms old stapleton was seldom at home till late and this made it still worse i was communing with myself one night as i had my eyes fixed on my book whether i should make the first advances when mary who had been quietly at work broke the silence by asking me what i was reading i replied in a quiet tone jacob said she in continuation i think you have used me very ill to humble me in this manner it was your business to make it up first i am not aware that i have been in the wrong replied i i do not say that you have but what matter does that make you ought to give way to a woman why so why so dont the whole world do so do you not offer everything first to a woman is it not her right not when she is in the wrong mary yes when shes in the wrong jacob theres no merit in doing it when shes in the right i think otherwise at all events it depends on how much she has been in the wrong and i consider you have shown a bad heart mary a bad heart in what way jacob in realising the fable of the boys and the frogs with the poor old dominie forgetting that what may be sport to you is death to him you dont mean to say that hell die of love replied mary laughing i should hope not but you may contrive and you have tried all in your power to make him very wretched and pray how do you know that i do not like the old gentleman jacob you appear to think that a girl is to fall in love with nobody but yourself why should i not love an old man with so much learning i have been told that old husbands are much prouder of their wives than young ones and pay them more attention and dont run after other women how do you know that i am not serious because i know your character mary and am not to be deceived if you mean to defend yourself in that way we had better not talk any more lord how savage you are then suppose i did pay the old gentleman any attention did the young ones pay me any did either you or your precious friend mr tom even speak to me no we saw how you were employed and we both hate a jilt oh you do very well sir just as you please i may make both your hearts ache for this some day or another forewarned forearmed mary and i shall take care that they are both forewarned as well as myself as i perceive that you are so decided i shall say no more only for your own sake and your own happiness i caution you recollect your mother mary and recollect your mothers death mary covered her face and burst into tears she sobbed for a few minutes and then came to me you are right jacob and i am a foolishperhaps wickedgirl but forgive me and indeed i will try to behave better but as father says it is human nature in me and its hard to conquer our natures jacob will you promise me not to continue your advances to the dominie mary i will not if i can help it jacob i may forget for the moment but ill do all i can its not very easy to look grave when one is merry or sour when one is pleased but what can induce you mary to practise upon an old man like him if it were young tom i could understand it there might be some credit and your pride might be flattered by the victory but an old man still jacob old or young its much the same i would like to have them all at my feet and thats the truth i cant help it and i thought it a great victory to bring there a wise old man who was so full of latin and learning and who ought to know better tell me jacob if old men a how themselves to be caught as well as young where is the crime of catching them isnt there as much vanity in an old man in his supposing that i really could love him as there is in me who am but a young foolish girl in trying to make him fond of me that may be but still recollect that he is in earnest and you are only joking which makes a great difference and recollect further that in trying at all we very often lose all that i would take my chance of jacob replied mary proudly throwing her curly ringlets back with her hand from her white forehead but what i now want is to make friends with you come jacob you have my promise to do my best yes mary and i believe you so theres my hand you dont know how miserable i have been jacob since we quarrelled said mary wiping the tears away which again commenced flowing and yet i dont know why for im sure i have almost hated you this last weekthat i have but the fact is i like quarrelling very well for the pleasure of making it up again but not for the quarrel to last so long as this has done it has annoyed me too mary for i like you very much in general well then now its all over but jacob are you sure you are friends with me yes mary mary looked archly at me you know the old saw and i feel the truth of it what kiss and make friends replied i with all my heart and i kissed her without any resistance on her part no i didnt mean that jacob what then oh twas another well then what was the other never mind i forget it now said she laughing and rising from the chair now i must go to my work again and you must tell me what youve been doing this last fortnight mary and i entered into a long and amicable conversation till her father came home when we retired to bed i think said old stapleton the next morning that ive had work enough and ive belonged to two benefit clubs for so long as to title me to an allowance i think jacob i shall give up the wherry to you and you shall in future give me onethird of your earnings and keep the rest to yourself i dont see why youre to work hard all day for nothing i remonstrated against this excess of liberality but old stapleton was positive and the arrangement was made i afterwards discovered what may probably occur to the reader that captain turnbull was at the bottom of all this he had pensioned old stapleton that i might become independent by my own exertions before i had served my apprenticeship and after breakfast old stapleton walked down with me to the beach and we launched the boat recollect jacob said he onethird and honour bright so saying he adjourned to his old quarters the publichouse to smoke his pipe and think of human natur i do not recollect any day of my life on which i felt more happy than on this i was working for myself and independent i jumped into my wherry and without waiting for a fare i pushed off and gaining the stream cleaved through the water with delight as my reward but after a quarter of an hour i sobered down with the recollection that although i might pull about for nothing for my own amusement that as stapleton was entitled to onethird i had no right to neglect his interest and i shot my wherry into the row and stood with my hand and forefinger raised watching the eye of every one who came towards the hard i was fortunate that day and when i returned was proceeding to give stapleton his share when he stopped me jacob its no use dividing now once aweek will be better i likes things to come in a lump cause dye seeits itshuman natur chapter twenty seven a good fareeat your pudding and hold your tonguethe dominie crossed in lovethe crosser also crossedi find that all the worlds a stage not excepting the stern sheets of my wherrycleopatras barge apostrophised on the river thames i consider that the present was the period from which i might date my first launching into human life i was now nearly eighteen years old strong active and wellmade full of spirits and overjoyed at the independence which i had so much sighed for since the period of my dismissal from mr drummonds my character had much altered i had become grave and silent brooding over my wrongs harbouring feelings of resentment against the parties and viewing the world in general through a medium by no means favourable i had become in some degree restored from this unwholesome state of mind from having rendered an important service to captain turnbull for we love the world better as we feel that we are more useful in it but the independence now given to me was the acme of my hopes and wishes i felt so happy so buoyant in mind that i could even think of the two clerks in mr drummonds employ without feelings of revenge let it however be remembered that the world was all before me in anticipation only boat sir no thanky my lad i want old stapletonis he here no sir but this is his boat humph cant he take me down no sir but i can if you please well then be quick a sedatelooking gentleman about fortyfive years of age stepped into the boat and in a few seconds i was in the stream shooting the bridge with the ebbing tide whats the matter with deaf stapleton nothing sir but hes getting old and has made the boat over to me are you his son no sir his prentice humph sorry deaf stapletons gone i can be as deaf as he sir if you wish it humph the gentleman said no more at the time and i pulled down the river in silence but in a few minutes he began to move his hands up and down and his lips as if he was in conversation gradually his action increased and words were uttered at last he broke outit is with this conviction i may say important conviction mr speaker that i now deliver my sentiments to the commons house of parliament trusting that no honourable member will decide until he has fully weighed the importance of the arguments which i have submitted to his judgment he then stopped as if aware that i was present and looked at me but prepared as i was there was nothing in my countenance which exhibited the least sign of merriment or indeed of having paid any attention to what he had been saying for i looked carelessly to the right and left at the banks of the river he again entered into conversation have you been long on the river born on it sir how do you like the profession of a waterman very well sir the great point is to have regular customers and how do you gain them by holding my tongue keeping their counsel and my own very good answer my boy people who have much to do cannot afford to loose even their time on the water just now i was preparing and thinking over my speech in the house of commons so i supposed sir and i think the river is a very good place for it as no one can overhear you except the person whose services you have hiredand you need not mind him very true my lad but thats why i liked deaf stapleton he could not hear a word but sir if youve no objection i like to hear it very much and you may be sure that i should never say anything about it if you will trust me do you my lad well then ill just try it over again you shall be the speakermind you hold your tongue and dont interrupt me the gentleman then began mr speaker i should not have ventured to address the house at this late hour did i not consider that the importance of the question now before it isso importantno that wont dodid i not consider that the question now before it is of that i may say paramount importance as to call forth the best energies of every man who is a wellwisher to his country with this conviction mr speaker humble individual as i am i feel it my duty i may say my bounden duty to deliver my sentiments upon the subject the papers which i now hold in my hand mr speaker and to which i shall soon have to call the attention of the house will i trust fully establish i say waterman be you taking that chap to bedlam cried a shrill female voice close to us the speech was stopped we looked up and perceived a wherry with two females passing close to us a shout of laughter followed the observation and my fare looked very much confused i had often read the papers in the publichouse and remembering what was usual in the house in case of interruption called out order order this made the gentleman laugh and as the other wherry was now far off he recommenced his oration with which i shall not trouble my readers it was a very fair speech i have no doubt but i forget what it was about i landed him at westminster bridge and received treble my fare recollect said he on paying me that i shall look out for you when i come again which i do every monday morning and sometimes oftener whats your name jacob sir very well good morning my lad this gentleman became a very regular and excellent customer and we used to have a great deal of conversation independent of debating in the wherry and i must acknowledge that i received from him not only plenty of money but a great deal of valuable information a few days after this i had an opportunity of ascertaining how far mary would keep her promise i was plying at the river side as usual when old stapleton came up to me with his pipe in his mouth and said jacob there be that old gentleman up at our house with mary now i sees a great deal but i says nothing mary will be her mother over again thats sartain suppose you go and see your old teacher and leave me to look ater a customer i begin to feel as if handling the sculls a little would be of sarvice to me we all think idleness be a very pleasant thing when were obliged to work but when we are idle then we feel that a little work be just as agreeablethats human natur i thought that mary was very likely to forget all her good resolutions from her ardent love of admiration and i was determined to go and break up the conference i therefore left the boat to stapleton and hastened to the house i did not like to play the part of an eavesdropper and was quite undecided how i should act whether to go in at once or not when as i passed under the window which was open i heard very plainly the conversation that was going on i stopped in the street and listened to the dominie in continuationbut fair maiden omnia vincit amorhere am i dominie dobbs who have long passed the grand climacteric and can already muster three score yearswho have authority over seventy boys being magister princeps et dux of brentford grammar schoolwho have affectioned only the sciences and communed only with the classicswho have ever turned a deaf ear to the allurements of thy sex and ever hardened my heart to thy fascination here am i even i dominie dobbs suing at the feet of a maiden who had barely ripened into womanhood who knoweth not to read or write and whose father earns his bread by manual labour i feel it alli feel that i am too oldthat thou art too youngthat i am departing from the ways of wisdom and am regardless of my worldly prospects still omnia vincit amor and i bow to the allpowerful god doing him homage through thee mary vainly have i resistedvainly have i as i have lain in bed tried to drive thee from my thoughts and tear thine image from my heart have i not felt thy presence everywhere do not i astonish my worthy coadjutor mistress bately the matron by calling her by the name of mary when i had always before addressed her by her baptismal name of deborah nay have not the boys in the classes discovered my weakness and do they not shout out mary in the hours of play mare periculosum et turbidum hast thou been to me i sleep noti eat notand every sign of love which hath been adduced by ovidius naso whom i have diligently collated do i find in mine own person speak then maiden i have given vent to my feelings do thou the same that i may return and leave not my flock without their shepherd speak maiden i will sir if you will get up replied mary who paused and then continued i think sir that i am young and foolish and you are old andand foolish thou wouldst say i had rather you said it sir than i it is not for me to use such an expression towards one so learned as you are i think sir that i am too young to marry and that perhaps you aretoo old i think sir that you are too cleverand that i am very ignorant that it would not suit you in your situation to marry and that it would not suit me to marry youequally obliged to you all the same perhaps thou hast in thy reply proved the wiser of the two answered the dominie but why maiden didst thou raise those feelings those hopes in my breast only to cause me pain and make me drink deep of the cup of disappointment didst thou appear to cling to me in fondness if thou felt not a yearning towards me but are there no other sorts of love besides the one you would require sir may i not love you because you are so clever and so learned in latin may i not love you as i do my father true true child it is all my own folly and i must retrace my steps in sorrow i have been deceivedbut i have been deceived only by myself my wishes have clouded my understanding and have obscured my reason have made me forgetful of my advanced years and of the little favour i was likely to find in the eyes of a young maiden i have fallen into a pit through blindness and i must extricate myself sore as will be the task bless thee maiden bless thee may another be happy in thy love and never feel the barb of disappointment i will pray for thee marythat heaven may bless thee and the dominie turned away and wept mary appeared to be moved by the good old mans affliction and her heart probably smote her for her coquettish behaviour she attempted to console the dominie and appeared to be more than half crying herself no sir do not take on so you make me feel very uncomfortable i have been wrongi feel i havethough you have not blamed me i am a very foolish girl bless thee childbless thee replied the dominie in a subdued voice indeed sir i dont deserve iti feel i do not but pray do not grieve sir things will go cross in love now sir ill tell you a secret to prove it to you i love jacoblove him very much and he does not care for mei am sure he does not so you sir you are not the only onewho isvery unhappy and mary commenced sobbing with the dominie poor thing said the dominie and thou lovest jacob truly is he worthy of thy love and at thy early age thou knowest what it is to have thy love unrequited truly is this a vale of tearsyet let us be thankful guard well thy heart child for jacob may not be for thee nay i feel that he will not be and why so sir replied mary despondingly because maidenbut nay i must not tell thee only take my warning maryfare thee well i come not here again goodbye sir and pray forgive me this will be a warning to me verily maiden it will be a warning to us both god bless thee i discovered by the sound that mary had vouchsafed to the dominie a kiss and heard soon afterwards his steps as he descended the stairs not wishing to meet him i turned round the corner and went down to the river thinking over what had passed i felt pleased with mary but i was not in love with her the spring was now far advanced and the weather was delightful the river was beautiful and parties of pleasure were constantly to be seen floating up and down with the tide the westminster boys the funny club and other amateurs in their fancy dresses enlivened the scene while the races for prize wherries which occasionally took place rendered the water one mass of life and motion how i longed for my apprenticeship to be over that i might try for a prize one of my best customers was a young man who was an actor at one of the theatres who like the mp used to rehearse the whole time he was in the boat but he was a lively noisy personage full of humour and perfectly indifferent as to appearances he had a quiz and a quirk for everybody that passed in another boat and would stand up and rant at them until they considered him insane we were on very intimate terms and i was never more pleased than when he made his appearance as it was invariably the signal for mirth the first time i certainly considered him to be a lunatic for playhouse phraseology was quite new to me boat sir cried i to him as he came to the hard my affairs do even drag me homeward go on ill follow thee replied he leaping into the boat our fortune lies in this jump i shoved off the wherry down sir down replied he pointing downwards with his finger as if pushing at something down down to hell and say i sent you there thanky sir id rather not if its all the same to you our tongue is rough cozand my condition is not smooth we shot the bridge and went rapidly down with the tide when he again commenced thus with imagind wing our soft scene flies in motion of no less celerity than that of thought then his attention was drawn by a colliers boat pulled by two men as black as chimneysweeps with three women in the sternsheets they made for the centre of the river to get into the strength of the tide and were soon abreast and close to the wherry pulling with us down the stream theres a dandy young man said one of the women with an old straw bonnet and very dirty ribbons laughing and pointing to my man plead you to me fair dame i know you not at ephesus i am but two hours old as strange unto your town as to your talk well he be a reglar rum cove ive a notion said another of the women when she witnessed the theatrical airs of the speaker who immediately recommenced the barge she sat in like a burnishd throne burnd on the waterthe poop was beaten gold purple the sails and so perfumed that the winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver which to the tunes of flutes kept stroke and made the water which they beat to follow faster as amorous of their strokes for her own person it beggard all description come ill be blowed but weve had enough of that so just shut your pan said one of the women angrily her gentlewomen like the naiades so many mermaids tend her mind what youre arter or your mouth will tend to your mischief young fellow from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs jem just run him alongside and break his head with your oar i thinks as how i will if he dont mend his manners i saw her once hop forty paces through the public streets you lie you liverfaced rascal i never walked the streets in my life im a lawful married woman jem do you call yourself a man and stand this here well now sal but hes a nice young man now ant he observed one of the other women away away you trifler love i know thee not i care not for thee kate this is no world to play with mammets and to tilt with lips we must have bloody noses and cracked crowns ive a notion you will too my hearty interrupted one of the colliers that ere long tongue of yours will bring you into disgrace bill give her a jerk towards the wherry and well duck him my friend said the actor addressing me let not his unwholesome corpse come between the wind and my nobility let us exeunt op although i could not understand his phrases i knew very well what he meant and pulling smartly i shoved towards the shore and ahead perceiving this the men in the boat at the intimation of the women who stood up waving their bonnets gave chase to us and my companion appeared not a little alarmed however by great exertion on my part we gained considerably and they abandoned the pursuit now by twoheaded janus said my companion as he looked back upon the colliers nature hath framed strange fellows in her time some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper and others of such a vinegar aspect that theyll not show their teeth by way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable and now continued he addressing me whats your name sir of what condition are youand of what place i pray amused with what had passed i replied that my name was jacobthat i was a waterman and born on the river i find thee apt but tell me art thou perfect that our ship hath touched upon the deserts of bohemia do you land at westminster sir no at blackfriarsthere attend my coming base is the slave who pays nevertheless what is your fare my lad what moneys in my purse seven groats and twopence by jove i am not covetous of gold nor care i who doth feed upon my cost but i can get no remedy for this consumption of the purse here my ladis that enough yes sir i thank you remember poor jack sir said the usual attendant at the landing place catching his arm as he careened the wherry on getting out if he fall in goodnightor sink or swim jack there is a penny for you jacob farewellwe meet again and away he went taking three of the stone steps at each spring this gentlemans name was as i afterwards found out tinfoil an actor of secondrate merit on the london boards the haymarket theatre was where he principally performed and as we became better acquainted he offered to procure me orders to see the play when i should wish to go there chapter twenty eight the picnic partysufferings by oil ice fire and waterupon the whole the divarting vagabonds as the thespian heroes and heroines are classically termed are very happy excepting mr winterbottom whose feelings are by sitting down down to zero one morning he came down to the hard and as usual i expected that he would go down the river i ran to my boat and hauled in close no jacob no this day you will not carry caesar and his fortunes but i have an order for you thank you sir what is the play the playpooh no play but i hope it will prove a farce nevertheless before its over we are to have a picnic party upon one of those little islands up the river by kew all sock and buskin all theatricals if the wherries upset the haymarket may shut up for it will be exeunt omnes with all its best performers look you jacob we shall want three wherries and i leave you to pick out the other twooars in each of course you must be at whitehall steps exactly at nine oclock and i daresay the ladies wont make you wait more than an hour or two which for them is tolerably punctual mr tinfoil then entered into the arrangement for remuneration and walked away and i was conning over in my mind whom i should select from my brother watermen and whether i should ask old stapleton to take the other oar in my boat when i heard a voice never to be mistaken by me life is like a summer day warmed by a sunny ray lower away yet tom thatll do my trump sometimes a dreary cloud chill blast or tempest loud look out for jacob tom cried the old man as the head of the lighter with her mast lowered down made its appearance through the arch of putney bridge with bright blue streaks on her sides here he is father replied tom who was standing forward by the windlass with the fall in his hand i had shoved off on hearing old toms voice and was alongside almost as soon as the lighter had passed under the bridge and discovered old tom at the helm i sprang on the deck with the chainpainter of the wherry in my hand made it fast and went aft to old tom who seized my hand this is as it should be my boy both on the lookout for each other the heart warms when we know the feeling is on both sides youre seldom out of our thoughts boy and always in our hearts now jump forward for toms fretting to greet you i see and you may just as well help him to sway up the mast when you are there i went forward shook hands with tom and then clapped on the fall and assisted him to hoist the mast we then went aft to his father and communicated everything of interest which had passed since our last meeting at the house of old stapleton and hows mary inquired tom shes a very fine lass and ive thought of her more than once but i saw that all you said about her was true how she did flam the poor old dominie i have had a few words with her about it and she has promised to be wiser replied i but as her father says in her its human natur shes a fine craft observed old tom and they always be a little ticklish but jacob youve had some inquiries made after you and by the women too indeed replied i yes and i have had the honour of being sent for into the parlour do you guess now yes said i a gloom coming over my countenance i presume it is drummond and sarah whom you refer to exactly tom then informed me that mrs drummond had sent for him and asked a great many questions about me and desired him to say that they were very glad to hear that i was well and comfortable and hoped that i would call and see her and sarah when i came that way mrs drummond then left the room and tom was alone with sarah who desired him to say that her father had found out that i had not been wrong that he had dismissed both the clerks and that he was very sorry he had been so deceivedand then said tom miss sarah told me to say from herself that she had been very unhappy since you had left them but that she hoped that you would forgive and forget some day or another and come back to them and that i was to give you her love and call next time we went up the river for something that she wanted to send to you so you perceive jacob that you are not forgotten and justice has been done to you yes replied i but it has been too late so let us say no more about it i am quite happy as i am i then told them of the picnic party of the next day upon which tom volunteered to take the other oar in my boat as he would not be wanted while the barge was at the wharf old tom gave his consent and it was agreed he should meet me next morning at daylight ive a notion therell be some fun jacob said he from what you say i think so too but youve towed me two miles and i must be off again or i shall lose my dinner so goodbye i selected two other wherries in the course of the afternoon and then returned home it was a lovely morning when tom and i washed out the boat and having dressed ourselves in our neatest clothes we shoved off in company with the two other wherries and dropped leisurely down the river with the last of the ebb when we pulled in to the stairs at whitehall we found two men waiting for us with three or four hampers some baskets an iron saucepan a fryingpan and a large tin pail with a cover full of rough ice to cool the wines we were directed to put all these articles into one boat the others to be reserved for the company jacob said tom dont let us be kitchen im togged out for the parlour this point had just been arranged and the articles put into the wherry when the party made their appearance mr tinfoil acting as master of the ceremonies fair titania said he to the lady who appeared to demand and therefore received the most attention allow me to hand you to your throne many thanks good puck replied the lady we are well placed but dear me we havent brought or we have lost our vinaigrette we positively cannot go without it what can our women have been about peaseblossom and mustardseed are much to blame replied tinfoil but shall i run back for it yes replied the lady and be here again ere the leviathan can swim a league ill put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes replied the gentleman stepping out of the boat wont you be a little out of breath before you come back sir said tom joining the conversation this remark far from giving offence was followed by a general laugh before mr tinfoil was out of sight the lost vinaigrette was dropped out of the ladys handkerchief he was therefore recalled and the whole of the party being arranged in the two boats we shoved off the third boat in which the provender had been stowed followed us and was occupied by the two attendants a callboy and sceneshifter who were addressed by tinfoil as caliban and stephano is all our company here said a pertlooking little pugnosed man who had taken upon himself the part of quince the carpenter in the midsummer nights dream you nick bottom continued he addressing another are set down for pyramus the party addressed did not however appear to enter into the humour he was a heavymade rather corpulent whitefaced personage dressed in white jean trousers white waistcoat brown coat and white hat whether anything had put him out of humour i know not but it is evident that he was the butt of the ladies and of most of the party ill just thank you replied this personage whose real name was winterbottom to be quiet mr western for i shant stand any of your nonsense oh mr winterbottom surely you are not about to sow the seeds of discord so early look at the scene before youhear how the birds are singing how merrily the sun shines and how beautifully the water sparkles who can be cross on such a morning as this no miss replied mr winterbottom not at allnot at allonly my names winterbottom and not bottom i dont wear an asss head to please anybodythats all i wont be bottomthats flat that depends upon circumstances sir observed tom what business have you to shove your oar in mr waterman i was hired for the purpose replied tom dipping his oar in the water and giving a hearty stroke stick to your own element thenshove your oar into the water but not into our discourse well sir i wont say another word if you dont like it but you may to me said titania laughing whenever you please and to me too said tinfoil who was amused with toms replies mr winterbottom became very wroth and demanded to be put on shore directly but the fairy queen ordered us to obey him at our peril and mr winterbottom was carried up the river very much against his inclination our friend is not himself said mr tinfoil producing a key bugle but music hath charms to soothe the savage breast to soften rocks and rend the knotted oak and therefore will we try the effect of it upon his senses mr tinfoil then played the air in midas pray goody please to moderate etcetera during which mr winterbottom looked more sulky than ever as soon as the air was finished another of the party responded with his flute from the other boatwhile mr quince played what he called base by snapping his fingers the sounds of the instruments floated along the flowing and smooth water reaching the ears and attracting the attention of many who for a time rested from their labour or hung listlessly over the gunnels of the vessels watching the boats and listening to the harmony all was mirth and gaietythe wherries kept close to each other and between the airs the parties kept up a lively and witty conversation occasionally venting their admiration upon the verdure of the sloping lawns and feathering trees with which the banks of the noble river are so beautifully adorned even mr winterbottom had partially recovered his serenity when he was again irritated by a remark of quince who addressed him you can play no part but pyramus for pyramus is a sweetfaced mana proper man as one shall see on a summers day a most lovely gentlemanlike man therefore you must needs play pyramus take care i dont play the devil with your physiognomy mr western retorted winterbottom here caliban in the third boat began playing the fiddle and singing to it gaffer gaffers son and his little jackass were trotting along the road the chorus of which ditty was eeaw eeaw like the braying of a jackass bless thee bottom bless thee thou art translated cried quince looking at winterbottom very wellvery well mr western i dont want to upset the wherry and therefore youre safe at present but the reckoning will comeso i give you warning slaves of my lamp do my bidding i will have no quarrelling here you quince shut your mouth you winterbottom draw in your lips and i your queen will charm you with a song said titania waving her little hand the fiddler ceased playing and the voice of the fair actress rivetted all our attention wilt thou waken bride of may while flowers are fresh and sweet bells chime listen and learn from my roundelay how all lifes pilot boats sailed one day a match with time love sat on a lotusleaf aloft and saw old time in his loaded boat slowly he crossed lifes narrow tide while love sat clapping his wings and cried who will pass time patience came first but soon was gone with helm and sail to help time on care and grief could not lend an oar and prudence said while he staid on shore i wait for time hope filled with flowers her corktree bark and lighted its helm with a glowworms spark then love when he saw his bark fly past said lingering time will soon be passed hope outspeeds time wit went nearest old time to pass with his diamond oar and boat of glass a feathery dart from his store he drew and shouted while far and swift it flew o mirth kills time but time sent the feathery arrow back hopes boat of amaranthus missd its track then love bade its butterfly pilots move and laughing said they shall see how love can conquer time i need hardly say that the song was rapturously applauded and most deservedly so several others were demanded from the ladies and gentlemen of the party and given without hesitation but i cannot now recall them to my memory the bugle and flute played between whiles and all was laughter and merriment theres a sweet place said tinfoil pointing to a villa on the thames now with the fair titania and ten thousand ayear one could there live happy im afraid the fair titania must go to market without the latter encumbrance replied the lady the gentleman must find the ten thousand ayear and i must bring as my dowry ten thousand charms interrupted tinfoilthats most true and pity tis tis true did your fairyship ever hear my epigram on the subject let the lads of the east love the maids of cashmeer nor affection with interests clash far other idolatry pleases us here we adore but the maids of mere cash excellent good puck have you any more not of my own but you have heard what winterbottom wrote under the bust of shakespeare last jubilee i knew not that apollo had ever visited him you shall hear in this here place the bones of shakespeare lie but that ere form of his shall never die a speedy end and soon this world may have but shakespeares name shall bloom beyond the grave ill trouble you mr tinfoil not to be so very witty at my expense growled out winterbottom i never wrote a line of poetry in my life no one said you did winterbottom but you wont deny that you wrote those lines mr winterbottom disdained a reply gaily did we pass the variegated banks of the river swept up with a strong floodtide and at last arrived at a little island agreed upon as the site of the picnic the company disembarked and were busy looking for a convenient spot for their entertainment quince making a rapid escape from winterbottom the latter remaining on the bank jenkins said he to the man christened caliban you did not forget the salad no sir i brought it myself its on the top of the little hamper mr winterbottom who it appears was extremely partial to salad was satisfied with the reply and walked slowly away well said tom to me wiping the perspiration from his brow with his handkerchief i wouldnt have missed this for anything i only wish father had been here i hope that young lady will sing again before we part i think it very likely and that the fun is only begun replied i but come lets lend a hand to get the prog out of the boat pat pat and heres a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal this green plot shall be our stage cried quince addressing the others of the party the locality was approved of and now all were busy in preparation the hampers were unpacked and cold meats poultry pies of various kinds pastry etcetera appeared in abundance this is no managers feast said tinfoil the fowls are not made of wood nor is small beer substituted for wine don juans banquet to the commendador is a farce to it all the managers stage banquets are farces and very sorry jokes into the bargain replied another i wish old morris had to eat his own suppers he must get a new set of teeth or theyll prove a deal too tough hiss turn him out hes made a pun the hampers were now empty some laid the cloth upon the grass and arranged the plates and knives and forks the ladies were as busy as the gentlemensome were wiping the glasses others putting salt into the saltcellars titania was preparing the salad mr winterbottom who was doing nothing accosted her may i beg as a favour that you do not cut the salad too small it loses much of its crispness why what a nebuchadnezzar you are however sir you shall be obeyed who can fry fish cried tinfoil here are two pairs of soles and some eels wheres caliban here i am sir replied the man on his knees blowing up a fire which he had kindled i have got the soup to mind wheres stephano cooling the wine sir who then can fry fish i ask i can sir replied tom but not without butter butter shalt thou have thou disturber of the element have we not hiren here i wasnt hired as a cook at all events replied tom but im rather a dab at it then shalt thou have the place replied the actor with all my heart and soul cried tom taking out his knife and commencing the necessary operation of skinning the fish in halfanhour all was ready the fair titania did me the honour to seat herself upon my jacket to ward off any damp from the ground the other ladies had also taken their respective seats as allotted by the mistress of the revels the tables were covered by many of the good things of this life the soup was ready in a tureen at one end and tom had just placed the fish on the table while mr quince and winterbottom by the commands of titania were despatched for the wine and other varieties of potations when they returned eyeing one another askance winterbottom looking daggers at his opponent and quince not quite easy even under the protection of titania tom had just removed the fryingpan from the fire with its residuary grease still bubbling quince having deposited his load was about to sit down when a freak came into toms head which however he dared not put into execution himself but a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse says the proverb winterbottom stood before tom and quince with his back to them tom looked at winterbottom pointing slily to the fryingpan and then to the hinder parts of quince winterbottom snatched the hint and the fryingpan at the same moment quince squatted himself down with a serge as they say at sea quoting at the timemarry our play is the most lamentable comedybut putting his hands behind him to soften his fall they were received into the hot fryingpan inserted behind him by winterbottom oh lord oh oh shrieked mr quince springing up like lightning bounding in the air with the pain his hands behind him still adhering to the fryingpan at the first scream of mr quince the whole party had been terrified the idea was that a snake had bitten him and the greatest alarm prevailed but when they perceived the cause of the disaster even his expressions of pain could not prevent their mirth it was too ludicrous still the gentlemen and ladies condoled with him but mr quince was not to be reasoned with he walked away to the riverside mr winterbottom slily enjoying his revenge for no one but tom had an idea that it was anything but an accident mr quinces party of pleasure was spoiled but the others did not think it necessary that theirs should be also a really very sorry for poor western and a halfdozen poor fellows intermingled with tittering was all that his misfortunes called forth after his departure and then they set to like french falconers the soup was swallowed the fish disappeared joints were cut up pies delivered up their hidden treasures fowls were dismembered like rotten boroughs corks were drawn others flew without the trouble and they did eat and were filled mr winterbottom kept his eye upon the salad his favourite condiment mixed it himself offered it to all and was glad to find that no one would spare time to eat it but mr winterbottom could eat for everybody and he did eat the fragments were cleared away and handed over to us we were very busy doing as ample justice to them as the party had done before us when mr winterbottom was observed to turn very pale and appeared very uneasy whats the matter inquired mr tinfoil imim not very welliim afraid something has disagreed with me im very ill exclaimed mr winterbottom turning as white as a sheet and screwing up his mouth it must be the salad said one of the ladies no one has eaten it but yourself and we are all well irather thinkit must beohi do recollect that i thought the oil had a queer taste why there was no oil in the castors replied tinfoil i desired jenkins to get some so did i particularly replied winterbottom ohoh dearoh dear jenkins cried tinfoil where did you get the oil for the castors what oil did you getare you sure it was right yes sir quite sure replied jenkins i brought it here in a bottle and put it into the castors before dinner where did you buy it at the chemists sir heres the bottle and jenkins produced a bottle with castor oil in large letters labelled on the side the murder was out mr winterbottom groaned rose from his seat for he felt very sick indeed the misfortunes of individuals generally add to the general quota of mirth and mr winterbottoms misfortune had the same effect as that of mr quince but where was poor mr quince all this time he had sent for the iron kettle in which the soup had been warmed up and filling it full of thames water had immersed the afflicted parts in the cooling element there he sat with his hands plunged deep when mr winterbottom made his appearance at the same spot and mr quince was comforted by witnessing the state of his enemy indeed the sight of winterbottoms distress did more to soothe mr quinces pain than all the thames water in the world he rose and leaving winterbottom with his two hands to his head leaning against a tree joined the party and pledged the ladies in succession till he was more than half tipsy in the space of halfanhour mr winterbottom returned trembling and shivering as if he had been suffering under an ague a bumper or two of brandy restored him and before the day closed in both winterbottom and quince one applying stimulants to his stomach and the other drowning his sense of pain in repeated libations were in a state to say the least of it of incipient intoxication but there is a time for all things and it was time to return the evening had passed freely song had followed song tinfoil had tried his bugle and played not a little out of tune the flute also neglected the flats and sharps as of no consequence the ladies thought the gentlemen rather too forward and in short it was time to break up the party the hampers were repacked and handed halfempty into the boat of wine there was a little left and by the direction of titania the plates dishes etcetera only were to be returned and the fragments divided among the boatmen the company reembarked in high spirits and we had the ebbtide to return with just as we were shoving off it was remembered that the icepail had been left under the tree besides a basket with sundries the other wherries had shoved off and they were in consequence brought into our boat in which we had the same company as before with the exception of mr western alias quince who preferred the boat which carried the hampers that he might loll over the side with his hands in the water mr winterbottom soon showed the effects of the remedy he had taken against the effects of the castor oil he was uproarious and it was with difficulty that he could be persuaded to sit still in the boat much to the alarm of titania and the other ladies he would make violent love to the fairy queen and as he constantly shifted his position to address her and throw himself at her feet there was some danger of the boat being upset at last tom proposed to him to sit on the pail before her as then he could address her with safety and winterbottom staggered up to take the seat as he was seating himself tom took off the cover so that he was plunged into the halfliquid ice but mr winterbottom was too drunk to perceive it he continued to rant and to rave and protest and vow and even spout for some time when suddenly the quantity of caloric extracted from him produced its effect iireally believe that the night is dampthe dew fallsthe seat is damp fair titania its only fancy mr winterbottom replied titania who was delighted with his situation jean trousers are cool in the evening its only an excuse to get away from me and i never will speak again to you if you quit your seat the fair titania the mistress of my soul and body too if she pleaseshasbut to commandand her slave obeys i rather think it is a little damp said tinfoil allow me to throw a little sand upon your seat and tinfoil pulled out a large paper bag full of salt which he strewed over the ice winterbottom was satisfied and remained but by the time we had reached vauxhall bridge the refrigeration had become so complete that he was fixed on the ice which the application of the salt had made solid he complained of cold shivered attempted to rise but could not extricate himself at last his teeth chattered and he became almost sober but he was helpless from the effects of the castor oil his intermediate intoxication and his present state of numbness he spoke less and less at last he was silent and when we arrived at whitehall stairs he was firmly fixed in the ice when released he could not walk and he was sent home in a hackneycoach it was cruel to punish him so mr tinfoil said titania cruel punishment why yes a sort of impailment replied mr tinfoil offering his arm the remainder of the party landed and walked home followed by the two assistants who took charge of the crockery and thus ended the picnic party which as tom said was the very funniest day he had ever spent in his life chapter twenty nine mr turnbull sets his house in ordermrs t thinks such conduct very disorderlythe captain at his old tricks with his harpoonhe pays his ladys debts of honour and gives the applicant a quittance under his own footmonsieur and madame tagliabue withdraw from the society of ces barbares les anglais it was on the sunday after the picnic party when feeling i had neglected captain turnbull and that he would think it unkind of me not to go near him after having accompanied mary to church i set off on foot to his villa near brentford i rang at the porters lodge and asked whether he was at home yes sir replied the old woman at the lodge who was very communicative and very friendly with me and missus be at home too i walked up the carriagedrive of one hundred yards which led to the entrancedoor and when i rang it was opened by a servant i had not seen before as belonging to the establishment where is mr turnbull inquired i he is in his own room sir replied the man but you must send up your name if you please as every one is not admitted i must observe to the reader that i was not dressed in jacket and trousers the money i earned was more than sufficient to supply all my expenses and i had fitted on what are called at sea and on the river long togs i was dressed as most people are on shore the servant evidently took me for a gentleman and perhaps as far as dress went i was entitled to that distinction many people are received as such in this world with less claims than i had i gave my name the man left me at the door and soon returned requesting that i would follow him i must say that i was rather astonished where were mr mortimer and the two men in flaunting liveries and long cotton epaulettes with things like little marlinespikes hanging to the ends of them even the livery was changed being a plain brown coat with light blue collar and cuffs i was however soon made acquainted with what had taken place on my entering the apartment of mr turnbullhis study as mrs t called it although mr turnbull insisted upon calling it his cabin a name certainly more appropriate as it contained but two small shelves of books the remainder of the space being filled up with favourite harpoons porpoise skulls sharks jaws corals several bears skins brown and white and one or two models of the vessels which had belonged to his brother and himself and which had been employed in the greenland fishery it was in fact a sort of museum of all he had collected during his voyages esquimaux implements ornaments and dresses were lying about in corners and skins of rare animals killed by himself such as black foxes etcetera were scattered about the carpet his seachest full of various articles was also one of the ornaments of the room much to the annoyance of mrs t who had frequently exerted her influence to get rid of it but in vain the only articles of furniture were two sofas a large table in the centre and three or four heavy chairs the only attempt at adornment consisted in a dozen coloured engravings framed and glazed of walrus shooting etcetera taken from the folio works of captains cook and mulgrave and a sketch or two by his brother such as the state of the william pressed by an iceberg on the morning of the th of january latitude longitude captain t was in his morninggown evidently not very well at least he appeared harassed and pale my dear jacob this is very kind of you i did mean to scold you for not coming before but im too glad to see you to find the heart now but why have you kept away so long i have really been very well employed sir stapleton has given me up the wherry and i could not neglect his interests even if i did my own always right boy and how are you getting on i am very happy sir very happy indeed im glad to hear it jacob may you always be so now take the other sofa and let us have a long palaver as the indians say i have something to tell you i suppose you observed a changeheh yes sir i observed that mr mortimer was not visible exactly mr mortimer or john snobbs the rascal is at present in newgate for trial and i mean to send him out on a voyage for the good of his health i caught the scoundrel at last and ill show him no more mercy than i would to a shark that had taken the bait but thats not all we have had a regular mutiny and attempt to take the ship from me but i have them all in irons and ordered for punishment jacob money is but too often a curse depend upon it youll not find many of your opinion sir replied i laughing perhaps not because those who have it are content with the importance which it gives to them and wont allow the damnable fact and because those who have it not are always sighing after it as if it were the only thing worth looking after in this world but now i will just tell you what has happened since i last saw you and then you shall judge as however captain ts narrative ran to a length of nearly three hours i shall condense the matter for the information of the reader it appeared that mrs t had continued to increase the lengths of her drives in her carriage the number of her acquaintances and her manifold expenses until mr t had remonstrated in very strong terms his remonstrances did not however meet with the attention which he had expected and he found out by accident moreover that the money with which he had constantly supplied mrs t to defray her weekly bills had been otherwise appropriated and that the bills for the two last quarters had none of them been paid this produced an altercation and a desire on his part to know in what manner these sums had been disbursed at first the only reply from mrs t who considered it advisable to brazen it out and if possible gain the ascendancy which was necessary was a contemptuous toss of her head which undulated the three yellow ostrich feathers in her bonnet as she walked out of the room and entered her carriage this to mr t who was a matteroffact man was not very satisfactory he waited perforce until the carriage returned and then demanded an explicit answer mrs t assumed the highest ground talked about fashionable expenses her knowledge of what was due to his character etcetera mr t rejoined about necessary expenses and that it was due to his character to pay his tradesmens bills mrs t then talked of goodbreeding best society and her many plaisers as she termed them mr t did not know what many pleasures meant in french but he thought she had been indulged in as many as most women since they had come down to this establishment but to the question why were not the bills paid and what had she done with the money spent it in pin money pin money thirty pounds aweek in pins it would have bought harpoons enough for a three years voyage she must tell the truth she wouldnt tell anything but called for her salts and called him a brute at all events he wouldnt be called a fool he gave her till the next morning to consider of it the next morning the bills were all sent in as requested and amounted to six hundred pounds they were paid and receipted now mrs t will you oblige me by letting me know what you have done with this six hundred pounds mrs t would notshe was not to be treated in that manner mr t was not on board a whaler now to bully and frighten as he pleased she would have justice done her have a separation alimony and a divorce she might have them all if she pleased but she should have no more money that was certain then she would have a fit of hysterics so she did and lay the whole of the day on the sofa expecting mr t would pick her up but the idea never came into mr ts head he went to bed and feeling restless he rose very early and saw from his window a cart drive up to the wall and the parties who came with it leap over and enter the house and return carrying to it two large hampers he snatched up one of his harpoons walked out the other way and arrived at the cart just as the hampers had been put in and they were about to drive off challenged them and instead of being answered the horse was flogged and he nearly run over he then let fly his harpoon into the horse which dropped and pitched out the two men on their heads insensible secured them called to the lodge for assistance sent for constables and gave them in charge they proved to be hampers forwarded by mr mortimer who had been in the habit of so doing for some time these hampers contained his best wine and various other articles which also proved that mr mortimer must have had false keys leaving the culprits and property in charge of two constables mr t returned to the house in company with the third constable the door was opened by mr mortimer who followed him into his study told him he should leave the house directly had always lived with gentlemen before and requested that he might have what was due to him mr t thought the request but reasonable and therefore gave him in charge of the constable mr snobbs rather confounded at such ungentlemanly behaviour was with the others marched off to bow street mr t sends for the other two servants in livery and assures them that he has no longer any occasion for their services having the excessive vulgar idea that this peculation must have been known to them pays them their wages requests they will take off their liveries and leave the house both willing they also had always lived with gentlemen before mr t takes the key of the butlers pantry that the plate may not consider him too vulgar to remain in the house and then walks to the stables horses neigh as if to say they are all ready for their breakfasts but the door locked hails the coachman no answer returning from the stables perceives coachee rather dusty coming in at the lodge gate requests to know why he did not sleep at home and take care of his horses he was missuss coachman not masters and could satisfy her but could not satisfy mr t who paid him his wagess and deducting his liveries sent him after the others coachee also was very glad to gohad always lived with gentlemen before meets the ladys maid who tells him mrs t is much too ill to come down to breakfast rather fortunate as there was no breakfast to be had dresses himself gets into a pairhorse coach arrives at the white horse cellar swallows his breakfast goes to bow street commits mr mortimer alias snobbs and his confederates for trial hires a jobman to bring the horses up for sale and leaves his carriage at the coachmakers obtains a temporary footman and then mr t returns to his villa a very good mornings work finds mrs t up in the parlour very much surprised and shocked at his conductat no mr mortimerat no servants and indebted to her own maid for a cup of tea more recriminationsmore violenceanother threat of alimony and the carriage ordered that she may seek counsel no coachmanno carriage no horsesno nothing as her maid declares mrs t locks herself up in her room and another day is passed with as little matrimonial comfort as can be expected in the meantime the news flies in every direction brentford is full of it mr t had been living too fastis done uphad been had up at bow streetcreditors had poured in with billsservants discharged carriage and horses seized mrs t poor creature in hysterics and nobody surprised at it indeed everybody expected it the peters of petercumb hall heard it and shook their heads at the many upstarts there were in the world mr smith requested the right honourable lord viscount babbleton never to mention to his father the right honourable marquis of springguns that he had ever been taken to see the turnbulls or that he mr smith would infallibly lose his situation in esse and his living in posse and monsieur and madame tagliabue were even more astounded but they felt deeply and resolved to pay a visit the next morning at least monsieur tagliabue did and madame acknowledged to the propriety of it the next morning some little order had been restored the footman hired had been given in charge of a sufficient quantity of plate the rest had been locked up the cook was to stay her month the housemaid had no wish to leave and as for the ladys maid she would remain as long as she could to console her poor mistress and accept what she was inclined to give her in return in any way of clothes dresses etcetera although of course she could not hurt her character by remaining too long in a family where there was no carriage or gentlemen out of livery still mr t did obtain some breakfast and had just finished when monsieur tagliabue was announced and was received ah monsieur t i hope madame is better madame tagliabue did nothing but cry all last night when she heard the very bad news about de debt and all dat very much obliged to madame replied turnbull gruffly and now pray sir what may be your pleasure ah monsieur turnbull i feel very much for you but suppose a gentleman no lose his honour what matter de money mr turnbull stared you see monsieur turnbull honour be everything to a gentleman if a gentleman owe money to one rascally tradesfellow and not pay him dat no great matter but he always pay de debt of honour every gentleman pay dat here monsieur turnbull and the little frenchman pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket be a leetle note of madame turnbull which she gave to madame tagliabue in which she acknowledged she owe two hundred pounds for money lost at ecarte dat you see monsieur turnbull be what gentlemen call debt of honour which every gentleman pay or else he lose de character and be called one blackguard by all the world madame tagliabue and i too much fond of you and madame turnbull not to save your character and so i come by her wish to beg you to settle this leetle notethis leetle debt of honour and monsieur tagliabue laid the note on the table with a very polite bow mr turnbull examined the note it was as described by monsieur tagliabue so thought he now the whole storys out she has been swindled out of her money by this rascally french couple now monsieur tagliabue said he allow me to put a question or two before i pay this money and if you answer me sincerely i shall raise no objection i think mrs t has already lost about six hundred pounds at ecarte before monsieur t who presumed that mrs turnbull had made him acquainted with the fact answered in the affirmative and i think that two months ago she never knew what ecarte was dat is true but the ladies are very quick to learn well but now do you think that as she knew nothing about the game and you and your wife are well acquainted with it it was honourable on your part to allow her to lose so much money ah monsieur when a lady say she will play comment faire what can you do but why did you never play at this house monsieur ah monsieur turnbull it is for de lady of de house to propose de game very true replied mr turnbull writing a cheque for the two hundred pounds there is your money mr tagliabue and now that you are paid allow me to observe that i consider you and your wife a couple of swindlers and beg that you will never enter my doors again vat you say sir swindlare god dam sar i will have satisfaction youve got your moneyis that sufficient or do you want anything else replied mr t rising from his chair yes sar i do want morei will have more so you shall then replied mr turnbull kicking him out of the room along the passage and out of the front door monsieur tagliabue turned round every now and then and threatened and then tried to escape as he perceived the upraised boot of mr turnbull when fairly out of the house he turned round monsieur turnbull i will have de satisfaction de terrible satisfaction for this you shall pay by god sar you shall payde money for this that evening mr turnbull was summoned to appear at bow street on the following morning for the assault he met monsieur tagliabue with his lawyer and acknowledged that he had kicked him out of his house for swindling his wife refused all accommodation and was prepared with his bail monsieur tagliabue stormed and blustered talked about his acquaintance with the nobility but the magistrate had seen too much of foreigners to place much reliance on their asseverations who are you monsieur sar i am a gentleman what profession are you of sir sar a gentleman has no profession but how do you live monsieur tagliabue as a gentleman always does sar you mentioned lord scrope just now as your particular friend i think yes sar me very intimate with lord scrope me spend three months at scrope castle with mi lady scrope mi lady scrope very fond of madame tagliabue very well monsieur tagliabue we must proceed with another case until mr turnbulls bail arrives sit down for a little while if you please another case was then heard which lasted about halfanhour but previous to hearing it the magistrate who knew that lord scrope was in town had despatched a runner with a note to his lordship and the answer was now brought back the magistrate read it and smiled went on with the other case and when it was finished said now m tagliabue you have said that you were intimate with lord scrope yes sar very intimate well lord scrope i have the pleasure of knowing and as he is in town i wrote a note to him and here is his answer i will read it m tagliabue turned pale as the magistrate read the following dear sira fellow of the name you mention came from russia with me as my valet i discharged him with dishonesty after he left lady scropes attendant who it appeared was unknown to us married to him left also and then i discovered the peculations to have been so extensive that had we known where to have laid hold of him i should certainly have brought them before you now the affair is forgotten but a greater scoundrel never existedyours scrope now sir what have you to say for yourself continued the magistrate in a severe tone m tagliabue fell on his knees and begged for mercy from the magistrate from lord scrope and lastly from mr turnbull to whom he proffered the draft for pounds the magistrate seeing that mr turnbull did not take it said to him make no ceremony of taking your money back again mr turnbull the very offer of it proves that he has gained it dishonestly and pounds is quite enough to have lost mr turnbull then took the cheque and tore it in pieces and the magistrate ordered m tagliabue to be taken to the alien office and he was sent to the other side of the channel in company with his wife to play ecarte with whomsoever he pleased thus ended the episode of monsieur tagliabue chapter thirty mr turnbull finds out that money though a necessary evil is not a source of happinessthe dominie finds out that a little calumny is more effectual than ovids remedy for love and i find out that walking gives one a good appetite for fillet of veal and baconi set an example to the clergy in refusing to take money for a seat in church and now you see jacob what a revolution has taken place not very pleasant i grant but still it was very necessary i have since been paying all my bills for the report of my being in difficulty has brought them in fast enough and i find that in these last five months my wife has spent a whole years income so it was quite time to stop i agree with you sir but what does mrs turnbull say nowhas she come to her senses pretty well i expect although she does not quite choose to acknowledge it i have told her that she must dispense with a carriage in future and so she shall till i think she deserves it she knows that she must either have my company in the house or none at all she knows that the peters of petercumb hall have cut her for they did not answer a note of hers sent by the gardener and mr smith has written a very violent answer to another of her notes wondering at her attempting to push herself into the company of the aristocracy but what has brought her to her senses more than all is the affair of monsieur tagliabue the magistrate at my request gave me the note of lord scrope and i have taken good care that she could read the police report as well but the fact is she is so much mortified that i say nothing to her she has been following the advice of these french swindlers who have led her wrong to be able to cheat her of her money i expect she will ask me to sell this place and go elsewhere but at present we hardly exchange a word during the whole day i feel very sorry for her sir for i really believe her to be a very good kindhearted person thats like you jacoband so she is at present she is in a state to be pitied she would throw a share of the blame upon other people and cannotshe feels it is all herself all her bubbles of grandeur have burst and she finds herself not half so respectable as she was before her vanity induced her to cut her former acquaintance and try to get into the society of those who laughed at her and at the same time were not half so creditable but its that cursed money which has proved her unhappinessand i may add mine well sir i see no chance of its ever adding to my misfortunes at all events perhaps not jacob even if you ever should get any but at all events you may take a little tomorrow if you please i cannot ask you to dine here it would not be pleasant to you and show a want of feeling to my wife but i should like you to come up with the wherry tomorrow and well take a cruise very well i shall be at your ordersat what time say ten oclock if the weather is fine if not the next day then sir ill now wish you goodbye as i must go and see the dominie mr turnbull took my hand and we parted i was soon at brentford and was continuing my course through the long main street when i met mr and mrs tomkins the former head clerk who had charge of the brentford wharf i was intending to call upon you sir after i had paid a visit to my old master very well jacob and recollect we dine at halfpast threefillet of veal and bacondont be late for dinner i promised that i would not and in a few minutes more arrived at the grammar school i looked at its peaked antiquated front and called to mind my feelings when years back i had first entered its porch what a difference between the little uncouth ignorant savage tricked out like a harlequin and now the tall athletic welldressed youth happy in his independence and conscious although not vain of his acquirements and i mentally blessed the founders but i had to talk to the dominie and to keep my appointment with the veal and bacon at halfpast three so i could not spare any time for meditation i therefore unfolded my arms and making use of my legs entered the wicket and proceeded to the dominies room the door was ajar and i entered without being perceived i have often been reminded by flemish paintings which i have seen since of the picture which then presented itself the room was not large but lofty it had but one window fitted with small diamondshaped panes in heavy woodwork through which poured a broad but subdued stream of light on one side of the window was an ancient armoire containing the dominies library not gilt and lettered but well thumbed and worn on the other his huge chest of drawers on which lay alas for the benefit of the rising generations a new birch rod of large dimensions the table was in the centre of the room and the dominie sat at it with his back to the window in a dressinggown once black having been a cassock but now brown with age he was on his high and narrowbacked chair leaning forwards with both elbows on the table his spectacles on his luxuriant nose and his hands nearly meeting on the top of his bald crown earnestly poring over the contents of a book a large bible which he constantly made use of was also on the table and had apparently been shoved from him to give place to the present object of his meditations his pipe lay on the floor in two pieces having been thrown off without his perceiving it on one side of him was a sheet of paper on which he evidently had been writing extracts i passed by him without his perceiving me and gaining the back of his chair looked over his shoulder the work he was so intent upon was ovids remedy of love it appeared that he had nearly finished reading through the whole for in less than a minute he closed the book and laying his spectacles down threw himself back in his chair strange soliloquised the dominie yet verily is some of his advice important and i should imagine commendable yet i do not find my remedy therein avoid idlenessyes that is sage counseland employment to one that hath not employed himself may drive away thought but i have never been idle and mine hath not been love in idleness avoid her presencethat i must do yet doth she still present herself to mine imagination and i doubt whether the tangible reality could be more clearly perceptible even now doth she stand before me in all her beauty read not propertius and tibullusthat is easily refrained from but read what i will in a minute the type passeth from my eyes and i see but her face beaming from the page nay cast my eyes in what direction i may wist it is the same if i looked at the stained wall the indistinct lines gradually form themselves into her profile if i look at the clouds they will assume some of the redundant outlines of her form if i cast mine eyes upon the fire in the kitchengrate the coals will glow and cool until i see her face nay but yesterday the shoulder of mutton upon the spit gyrated until it at last assumed the decapitated head of mary think of her faults and magnify themnay that were unjust and unchristian let me rather correct mine own i fear me that when ovid wrote his picture he intended it for the use of young men and not for an old fool like me behold i have again broken my pipethe fourth pipe that i have destroyed this week what will the dame say already hath she declared me demented and god knows she is not very far from the truth and the dominie covered up his face in his hands i took this opportunity to step to the door and appear to enter it dropping the latch and rousing the dominie by the noise who extended to me his hand welcome my sonwelcome to thine old preceptor and to the walls which first received thee when thou wert cast on shore as a tangle weed from the river sit jacob i was thinking of thee and thine what sir of old stapleton and his daughter i suppose even so ye were all in my thoughts at the moment that thou madest thy appearance they are well yes sir replied i i see but little of them the old man is always smoking and as for the girlwhy the less one sees of her the better i should say nay jacob this is new to me yet is she most pleasant i knew the dominies character and that if anything could cure his unfortunate passion it would be a supposition on his part that the girl was not correct i determined at all events to depreciate her as i knew that what i said would never be mentioned by him and would therefore do her no harm still i felt that i had to play a difficult game as i was determined not to state what was not the fact pleasant sir yes pleasant to everybody the fact is i dont like such girls as she is indeed jacob what is she light i smiled and made no answer yet i perceived it not replied the dominie she is just like her mother observed i and what was her mother i gave a brief account of her mother and how she met her death in trying to escape from her husband the dominie mused little skilled am i in women jacob yet what thou sayest not only surpriseth but grieveth me she is fair to look upon handsome is that handsome does sir shell make many a mans heart ache yet i expect indeed jacob i am full of marvel at what thou hast already told me i have seen more of her sir i pray thee tell me more no sir i had rather not you may imagine all you please still she is young jacob when she becometh a wife she might alter sir it is my firm opinion and so it was that if you were to marry her tomorrow she would run away from you in a week is that thy candid opinion jacob i will stake my life upon her so doing although not as to the exact time jacob i thank theethank thee much thou hast opened mine eyesthou hast done me more good than ovid yes boy even the ancients whom i have venerated have not done me so kind an act as thou a stripling whom i have fostered thou hast repaid me jacobthou hast rewarded me jacobthou hast protected me jacobthou hast saved me jacob hast saved me both from myself and from her for know jacobknowthat mine heart did yearn towards that maiden and i thought her even to be perfection jacob i thank thee now leave me jacob that i may commune with myself and search out my own heart for i am awakened awakened as from a dream and i would fain be quite alone i was not sorry to leave the dominie for i also felt that i would fain be in company with the fillet of veal and bacon so i shook hands and thus ended my second morning call i was in good time at mr tomkins who received me with great kindness he was well pleased with his new situation which was one of respectability and consequence independently of profit and i met at his table one or two people who to my knowledge would have considered it degrading to have visited him when only head clerk to mr drummond we talked over old affairs not forgetting the ball and the illuminations and mr turnbulls bon mot about paradise and after a very pleasant evening i took my leave with the intention of walking back to fulham but i found old tom waiting outside on the lookout for me jacob my boy i want you to come down to my old shop one of these days what day will you be able to come the lighter will be here for a fortnight at least i find from mr tomkins as she waits for a cargo coming by canal and there is no other craft expected above bridge so tell me what day will you come and see the old woman and spend the whole day with us i wants to talk a bit with you and ax your opinion about a good many little things indeed replied i smiling what are you going to build a new house no nonot that but you see jacob as i told you last winter it was time for me to give up night work up and down the river im not so young as i was about fifty years ago and theres a time for all things i do mean to give up the craft in the autumn and go on shore for a full due but at the same time i must see how i can make matters out so tell me what day you will come well then shall we say wednesday wednesdays as good a day as any other day come to breakfast and you shall go away after supper if you like if not the old woman shall sling a hammock for you agreed then but wheres tom tom i dont know but i think hes gone after that daughter of stapletons he begins to think of the girls now jacob but as the old buffer her father says its all human natur howsomever i never interferes in these matters they seem to be pretty well matched i think how do you mean why as for good looks they be well enough matched thats sure but i dont mean that i mean he is quite as knowing as she is and will shift his helm as she shifts hers twill be a long running fight and when one strikes tother wont have much to boast of perhaps they may sheer off after allperhaps they may sail as consorts god only knows but this i knows that toms sweetheart may be as tricky as she pleases but toms wife wont because why hell keep her in order well goodnight i have a long walk when i returned home i found mary alone has tom been here inquired i what makes you ask that question replied mary to have it answeredif you have no objection oh no well then mr jacob tom has been here and very amusing he has been so he always is replied i and where may you have been i told her so you saw old dominie now tell me what did he say about me that i shall not tell replied i but i will tell you this that he will not think about you any more and you must not expect ever to see him again but recollect that he promised he kept his promise mary oh he told you so did he did he tell you all that passed no mary he never told me that he had been here neither did he tell me what had passed but i happen to know all i cannot understand that still it is true and i think on the whole you behaved pretty well although i cannot understand why you gave him a kiss at parting good heaven where were you you must have been in the room and you heard every word that passed every word replied i well said mary i could not have believed that you could have done so mean a thing mary rather accuse your own imprudence what i heard was to be heard by everyone in the street as well as by me if you choose to have love scenes in a room not eight feet from the ground with the window wide open you must not be surprised at every passerby hearing what you say well thats true i never thought of the window being open not that i would have cared if all the world had heard me if you had not it never occurred to me till then why mary was annoyed at my having overheard her but at once i recollected what she had said about me i made no answer mary sat down leaned her forehead against her hands and was also silent i therefore took my candle and retired it appeared that marys pride was much mortified at my having heard her confession of being partial to mea confession which certainly made very little impression on me as i considered that she might a month afterwards confess the same relative to tom or any other individual who took her fancy but in this i did not do her justice her manners were afterwards much changed towards me she always appeared to avoid rather than to seek further intimacy as for myself i continued as before very good friends kind towards her but nothing more the next morning i was up at mr turnbulls by the time agreed upon but before i set off rather a singular occurrence took place i had just finished cleaning my boat and had resumed my jacket when a dark man from some foreign country came to the hard with a bundle under his arm how much for to go to the other side of the riverhow much pence twopence replied i but not caring to take him i continued but you only pay one penny to cross the bridge i know very well but suppose you take me he was a welllooking not very dark man his turban was of coloured clothhis trousers not very wide and i could not comprehend whether he was a turk or not i afterwards found out he was a parsee from the east indies he spoke very plain english as he decided upon crossing i received him and shoved off when we were in the middle of the stream he requested me to pull a little way up that will do said he opening his bundle and spreading a carpet on the stern flooring of the wherry he then rose looking at the sun which was then rising in all its majesty bowed to it with his hands raised three times then knelt on the carpet and touched it several times with his forehead again rose to his feet took some common field flowers from his vest and cast them into the stream bowed again folded up his carpet and begged me to pull on shore i say my prayers said the man looking at me with his dark piercing eye very proper whom did you say them to to my god but why dont you say them on shore cant see sun in the house suppose i go out little boys laugh and throw mud where no am seen river very proper place we landed and he took out threepence and offered it to me no no said i i dont want you to pay for saying your prayers no take money yes take money to cross the river but not take money for saying prayers if you want to say them any other morning come down and if i am here ill always pull you into the stream you very good man i thank you the parsee made me a low salaam and walked away i may here observe that the man generally came down at sunrise two or three days in the week and i invariably gave him a pull off into the stream that he might pursue his religious ceremony we often conversed and at last became intimate mr turnbull was at the bottom of the lawn which extended from his house to the banks of the river looking out for me when i pulled up the basket with our dinner etcetera was lying by him on the gravel walk this is a lovely morning jacob but it will be rather a warm day i expect said he come let us be off at once lay in your sculls and let us get the oars to pass how is mrs turnbull sir pretty well jacob more like the molly brown that i married than she has been for some years perhaps after all this affair may turn out one of the best things that ever happened it may bring her to her sensesbring happiness back to our hearth if so jacob the money is well spent chapter thirty one mr turnbull and i go on a party of pleasureit turns out to be an adventure and winds up with a blunderbuss a tinbox and a ladys cloak we pulled leisurely up the stream talking and every now and then resting on our oars to take breath for as the old captain said why should we make a toil of pleasure i like the upper part of the river best jacob because the water is clear and i love clear water how many hours have i when a boy on board ship hung over the gunwale of a boat lowered down in a calm and watch the little floating objects in the dark blue unfathomable water beneath me objects of all sizes of all colours and of all shapesall of them beautiful and to be admired yet of them perhaps not one in a hundred millions ever meet the eye of man you know jacob that the north seas are full of these animals you cannot imagine the quantity of them the sailors call them blubbers because they are composed of a sort of transparent jelly but the real name i am told is medusae that is the learned name the whale feeds on them and that is the reason why the whale is found where they are i should like very much to go a voyage to the whale fishery replied i ive heard so much about it from you it is a stirring life and a hard life jacob still it is an exciting one some voyages will turn out very pleasant but others are dreadful from their anxiety if the weather continues fine it is all very well but sometimes when there is a continuance of bad weather it is dreadful i recollect one voyage which made me show more grey hairs than all the others and i think i have been twentytwo in all we were in the drift ice forcing our way to the northward when it came on to blowthe sea rose and after a weeks gale it was tremendous we had little daylight and when it was daylight the fog was so thick that we could see but little there we were tossing among the large drift ice meeting immense icebergs which bore down with all the force of the gale and each time we narrowly escaped perishing the rigging was loaded with ice the bows of the ship were cased with it the men were more than half frozen and we could not move a rope through a block without pouring boiling water through it first to clear it out but then the long dreary dreadful nights when we were rising on the mountain wave and then pitching down into the trough not knowing but that at each send we might strike upon the ice below and go to the bottom immediately afterwards all pitchy darkthe wind howling and as it struck you cutting you to the backbone with its cold searching power the waves dancing all black around you and every now and then perceiving by its white colour and the foam encircling it a huge mass of ice borne upon you and hurled against you as if there were a demon who was using it as an engine for your destruction i never shall forget the turning of an iceberg during the dreadful gale which lasted for a month and three days i dont know what that means sir why you must know jacob that the icebergs are all fresh water and are supposed to have been detached from the land by the force of the weather and other causes now although ice floats yet it floats deep that is if an iceberg is five hundred feet high above the water it is generally six times as deep below the waterdo you understand perfectly sir now jacob the water is much warmer than the air and in consequence the ice under the water melts away much faster so that if the iceberg has been some time afloat at last the part that is below is not so heavy as that which is above then it turns that is it upsets and floats in another position i understand you sir well we were close to an iceberg which was to windward of us a very tall one indeed and we reckoned that we should get clear of it for we were carrying a press of sail to effect it still all hands were eagerly watching the iceberg as it came down very fast before the storm all of a sudden it blew twice as hard as before and then one of the men shouted outturning turningand sure enough it was there was its towering summit gradually bowing towards us until it almost appeared as if the peak was over our heads our fate appeared inevitable as the whole mountain of ice was descending on the vessel and would of course have crushed us into atoms we all fell on our knees praying mentally and watching its awful descent even the man at the helm did the same although he did not let go the spokes of the wheel it had nearly half turned over right for us when the ice below being heavier on one side than on the other gave it a more slanting impetus and shifting the direction of its fall it plunged into the sea about a cables length astern of us throwing up the water to the heavens in foam and blinding us all with the violence with which it dashed into our faces for a minute the run of the waves was checked and the sea appeared to boil and dance throwing up peaked pointed masses of water in all directions one sinking another rising the ship rocked and reeled as if she were drunk even the current of the gale was checked for a moment and the heavy sails flapped and cleared themselves of their icy varnishingthen all was over there was an iceberg of another shape astern of us the gale recommenced the waves pressed each other on as before and we felt the return of the gale awful as it was as a reprieve that was a dreadful voyage jacob and turned onethird of my hair grey and what made it worse was that we had only three fish on board on our return however we had reason to be thankful for eighteen of our vessels were lost altogether and it was the mercy of god that we were not among the number well i suppose you told me that story to prevent my going a voyage not a bit jacob if it should chance that you find it your interest to go to the north pole or anywhere else i would say go by all means let neither difficulty nor danger deter you but do not go merely from curiosity that i consider foolish its all very well for those who come back to have the satisfaction to talk of such things and it is but fair that they should have it but when you consider how many there are who never come back at all why then its very foolish to push yourself into needless danger and privation you are amused with my recollections of arctic voyages but just call to mind how many years of hardship of danger cold and starvation i have undergone to collect all these anecdotes and then judge whether it be worth any mans while to go for the sake of mere curiosity i then amused mr turnbull with the description of the picnic party which lasted until we had pulled far beyond kew bridge we thrust the bow of the wherry into a bunch of sedges and then we sat down to our meal surrounded by hundreds of blue dragonflies that flitted about as if to inquire what we meant by intruding upon their domiciles we continued there chatting and amusing ourselves till it was late and then shoved off and pulled down with the stream the sun had set and we had yet six or seven miles to return to mr turnbulls house when we perceived a slight handsome young man in a skiff who pulled towards us i say my lads said he taking us both for watermen have you a mind to earn a couple of guineas with very little trouble oh yes replied mr turnbull if you can show us how a fine chance for you jacob continued he aside well then i shall want your services perhaps for not more than an hour it may be a little longer as there is a lady in question and we may have to wait all i ask is that you pull well and do your best are you agreed we consented and he requested us to follow him and then pulled for the shore this is to be an adventure sir said i so it seems replied mr turnbull all the better im old now but im fond of a spree the gentleman pulled into a little boathouse by the rivers side belonging to one of the villas on the bank made fast his boat and then stepped into ours now weve plenty of time just pull quietly for the present we continued down the river and after we had passed kew bridge he directed us in shore on the right side till we came to a garden sweeping down to the river from a cottage ornee of large dimensions about fifty yards from the bank the water was up to the brickwall which rose from the river about four or five feet that will do st st not a word said he rising in the stern sheets and looking over after a minute or two reconnoitring he climbed from the boat on to the parapet of the wall and whistled two bars of an air which i had till then never heard all was silent he crouched behind a lilac bush and in a minute he repeated the same air in a whistle as before still there was no appearance of movement at the cottage he continued at intervals to whistle the portion of the air and at last a light appeared at an upper window it was removed and reappeared three times be ready now my lads said he in about two minutes afterwards a female in a cloak appeared coming down the lawn with a box in her hand panting with excitement oh william i heard your first signal but i could not get into my uncles room for the box at last he went out and here it is the gentleman seized the box from her and handed it to us in the boat take great care of that my lads said he and now cecilia we have no time to lose the sooner you are in the boat the better how am i to get down there william replied she oh nothing more easy stop throw your cloak into the boat and then all you have to do is first to get upon the top of the wall and then trust to the watermen below and to me above for helping you it was not however quite so easy a matter the wall was four feet high above the boat and moreover there was a trellised work of iron above a foot high which ran along the wall still she made every effort on her own part and we considered that we had arranged so as to conquer the difficulty when the young lady gave a scream we looked up and beheld a third party on the wall it was a stout tall elderly man as far as we could perceive in the dark who immediately seized hold of the lady by the arm and was dragging her away this was resisted by the young gentleman and the lady was relinquished by the other to defend himself at the same time that he called outhelp help thieves thieves shall i go to his assistance said i to mr turnbull one must stay in the boat jump up then jacob for i never could get up that wall i was up in a moment and gaining my feet was about to spring to the help of the young man when four servants with lights and with arms in their hands made their appearance hastening down the lawn the lady had fainted on the grass the elderly gentleman and his antagonist were down together but the elderly gentleman had the mastery for he was uppermost perceiving the assistance coming he called out look to the watermen secure them i perceived that not a moment was to be lost i could be of no service and mr turnbull might be in an awkward scrape i sprang into the boat shoved off and we were in the stream and at thirty yards distance before they looked over the wall to see where we were stop in that boat stop they cried fire if they dont cried their master we pulled as hard as we could a musquetoon was discharged but the shot dropped short the only person who fell was the man who fired it to see us he had stood upon the coping bricks of the wall and the recoil tumbled him over into the river we saw him fall and heard the splash but we pulled on as hard as we could and in a few minutes the scene of action was far behind us we then struck across to the other side of the river and when we had gained close to the shore we took breath well said mr turnbull this is a spree i little looked for to have a blunderbuss full of shot sent after me no replied i laughing thats carrying the joke rather too far on the river thames well but what a pretty mess we are in here we have property belonging to god knows whom and what are we to do with it i think sir the best thing we can do is for you to land at your own house with the property and take care of it until we find out what all this is about and i will continue on with the sculls to the hard i shall hear or find out something about it in a day or two they may still follow up the pursuit and trace us the advice is good replied mr turnbull and the sooner we cut over again the better for we are nearly abreast of my place we did so mr turnbull landed in his garden taking with him the tinbox it was what they call a deedbox and the ladys cloak i did not wait but boating the oars took my sculls and pulled down to fulham as fast as i could i had arrived and was pulling gently in not to injure the other boats when a man with a lantern came into the wherry have you anything in your boat my man said he nothing sir replied i the man examined the boat and was satisfied tell me did you see a boat with two men in it as you came along no sir replied i nothing has passed me where do you come from now from a gentlemans place near brentford brentford oh then you were far below them they are not down yet have you a job for me sir said i not wishing to appear anxious to go away no my man no nothing tonight we are on the lookout but we have two boats in the stream and a man at each landingplace i made fast my boat shouldered my oars and sculls and departed not at all sorry to get away it appeared that as soon as it was ascertained that we were not to be stopped by being fired at they saddled horses and the distance by the road being so much shorter had by galloping as hard as they could arrived at fulham some ten minutes before me it was therefore most fortunate that the box had been landed or i should have been discovered that the contents were of value was evident from the anxiety to secure them but the mystery was still to be solved i was quite tired with exertion and excitement when i arrived at stapletons mary was there to give me my supper which i ate in silence complained of a headache and went to bed chapter thirty two the waterman turns waterknighti become chivalrous see a beautiful face and go with the streamthe adventure seems to promise more law than love there being papers in the case that is in a tinbox that night i dreamed of nothing but the scene over and over again and the two bars of music were constantly ringing in my ears as soon as i had breakfasted the next morning i set off to mr turnbulls and told him what had occurred it was indeed fortunate that the box was landed said he or you might have now been in prison i wish i had had nothing to do with it but as you say whats done cant be helped i will not give up the box at all events until i know which party is entitled to it and i cannot help thinking that the lady is but jacob you will have to reconnoitre and find out what this story is tell me do you think you could remember the tune which he whistled so often it has been running in my head the whole night and i have been trying it all the way as i pulled here i think i have it exact hear siri whistled the two bars quite correct jacob quite correct well take care not to forget them where are you going today nowhere sir suppose then you pull up the river and find out the place where we landed and when you have ascertained that you can go on and see whether the young man is with the skiff at all events you may find out somethingbut pray be cautious i promised to be very careful and departed on my errand which i undertook with much pleasure for i was delighted with anything like adventure i pulled up the river and in about an hour and aquarter came abreast of the spot i recognised the cottage ornee the parapet wall even the spot where we lay and perceived that several bricks were detached and had fallen into the river there appeared to be no one stirring in the house yet i continued to pull up and down looking at the windows at last one opened and a young lady looked out who i was persuaded was the same that we had seen the night before there was no wind and all was quiet around she sat at the window leaning her head on her hand i whistled the two bars of the air at the first bar she started up and looked earnestly at me as i completed the second i looked up she waved her handkerchief once and then shut the window in a few seconds she made her appearance on the lawn walking down towards the river i immediately pulled in under the wall i laid in my sculls and held on standing up in the boat who are you and who sent you said she looking down on me and discovering one of the most beautiful faces i had ever beheld no one sent me maam replied i but i was in the boat last night i am sorry you were so unfortunate but your box and cloak are quite safe you were one of the men in the boat i trust no one was hurt when they fired at you no maam and where is the box in the house of the person who was with me can he be trusted for they will offer large rewards for it i should think so maam replied i smiling the person who was with me is a gentleman of large fortune who was amusing himself on the river he desires me to say that he will not give up the box until he knows to whom the contents legally belong good heavens how fortunate am i to believe you i should hope so maam and what are you then you are not a waterman yes maam i am she paused looked earnestly at me for a little while and then continued how did you learn the air you whistled the young gentleman whistled it six or seven times last night before you came i tried it this morning coming up as i thought it would be the means of attracting your attention can i be of any service to you maam serviceyes if i could be sure you were to be trustedof the greatest service i am confined herecannot send a letterwatched as i moveonly allowed the garden and even watched while i walk here they are most of them in quest of the tin box today or i should not be able to talk to you so long she looked round at the house anxiously and then said stop here a minute while i walk a little she then retreated and paced up and down the garden walk i still remained under the wall so as not to be perceived from the house in about three or four minutes she returned and said it would be very cruelit would be more than cruelit would be very wicked of you to deceive me for i am very unfortunate and very unhappy the tears started in her eyes you do not look as if you would what is your name jacob faithful maam and i will be true to my name if you will put your trust in me i never deceived any one that i can recollect and im sure i would not younow that ive seen you yes but money will seduce everybody not me maam ive as much as i wish for well then i will trust you and think you sent from heaven to my aid but how am i to see you tomorrow my uncle will be back and then i shall not be able to speak to you one moment and if seen to speak to you you will be laid in wait for and perhaps shot well maam replied i after a pause if you cannot speak you can write you see that the bricks on the parapet are loose here put your letter under this bricki can take it away even in daytime without being noticed and can put the answer in the same place so that you can secure it when you come out how very clever good heavens what an excellent idea was the young gentleman hurt maam in the scuffle last night inquired i no i believe not much but i wish to know where he is to write to him could you find out i told her where we had met him and what had passed that was lady auburns replied she he is often thereshe is our cousin but i dont know where he lives and how to find him i know not his name is william wharncliffe do you think you could find him out yes maam with a little trouble it might be done they ought to know where he is at lady auburns yes some of the servants mightbut how will you get to them that maam i must find out it may not be done in one day or two days but if you will look every morning under this brick if there is anything to communicate you will find it there you can write and read then i should hope so maam replied i laughing i dont know what to make of you are you really a waterman really and she turned her head round at the noise of a window opening you must godont forget the brick and she disappeared i shoved my wherry along by the side of the wall so as to remain unperceived until i was clear of the frontage attached to the cottage and then taking my sculls pulled into the stream and as i was resolved to see if i could obtain any information at lady auburns i had to pass the garden again having shoved my boat down the river instead of up when i was under the wall i perceived the young lady walking with a tall man by her side he speaking very energetically and using much gesticulation she holding down her head in another minute they were shut out from my sight i was so much stricken with the beauty and sweetness of expression in the young ladys countenance that i was resolved to use my best exertions to be of service to her in about an hourandahalf i had arrived at the villa abreast of which we had met the young gentleman and which the young lady had told me belonged to lady auburn i could see no one in the grounds nor indeed in the house after watching a few minutes i landed as near to the villa as i could made fast the wherry and walked round to the entrance there was no lodge but a servants door at one side i pulled the bell having made up my mind how to proceed as i was walking up the bell was answered by an old woman who in a snarling tone asked me what did i want i am waiting below with my boat for mr wharncliffe has he come yet mr wharncliffe nohes not come nor did he say that he would come when did you see him yesterday is lady auburn at home lady auburnno she went to town this morning everybody goes to london now that they may not see the flowers and green trees i suppose but i suppose mr wharncliffe will come continued i so i must wait for him you can do just as you like replied the old woman about to shut the gate in my face may i request a favour of you maam before you shut the gatewhich is to bring me a little water to drink for the sun is hot and i have had a long pull up here and i took out my handkerchief and wiped my face yes ill fetch you some replied she shutting the gate and going away this dont seem to answer very well thought i to myself the old woman returned opened the gate and handed me a mug of water i drank some thanked her and returned the mug i am very tired said i i should like to sit down and wait for the gentleman dont you sit down when you pull inquired the old woman yes replied i then you must be tired of sitting i should think not of standing at all events if you want to sit you can sit in your boat and mind it at the same time with this observation she shut the door upon me and left me without any more comment after this decided repulse on the part of the old woman i had nothing to do but take her adviceviz to go and look after my boat i pulled down to mr turnbulls and told him my good and bad fortune it being late he ordered me some dinner in his study and we sat there canvassing over the affair well said he as we finished you must allow me to consider this as my affair jacob as i was the occasion of our getting mixed up in it you must do all that you can to find this young man and i shall hire stapletons boat by the day until we succeed you need not tell him so or he may be anxious to know why tomorrow you go down to old beazeleys yes sir you cannot hire me tomorrow still i shall as i want to see you tomorrow morning before you go heres stapletons money for yesterday and today and now goodnight i was at mr turnbulls early the next morning and found him with the newspapers before him i expected this jacob said he read that advertisement i read as followswhereas on friday night last between the hours of nine and ten a tin box containing deeds and papers was handed into a wherry from the grounds of a villa between brentford and kew and the parties who owned it were prevented from accompanying the same this is to give notice that a reward of twenty pounds will be paid to the watermen upon their delivering up the same to messrs james and john white of number lincolns inn fields as no other parties are authorised to receive the said tin box of papers all other applications for it must be disregarded an early attention to this advertisement will oblige there must be papers of no little consequence in that box jacob depend upon it said mr turnbull however here they are and here they shall remain until i know more about it thats certain i intend to try what i can do myself with the old woman for i perceive the villa is to be let for three monthshere is the advertisement in the last column i shall go to town today and obtain a ticket from the agent and it is hard but ill ferret out something i shall see you tomorrow now you may go jacob i hastened away as i had promised to be down to old toms to breakfast an hours smart pulling brought me to the landingplace opposite to his house chapter thirty three a tenpound householder occupied with affairs of statethe advantage of the word implicationan unexpected meeting and a reconciliation resolution versus bright black eyesverdict for the defendant with heavy damages the house of old tom beazeley was situated on the verge of battersea fields about a mileandahalf from the bridge bearing the same name the river about twenty yards before itthe green grass behind it and not a tree within halfamile of it there was nothing picturesque in it but its utter loneliness it was not only lonely but isolated for it was fixed upon a delta of about halfanacre between two creeks which joined at about forty yards from the river and ran up through the fields so that the house was at high water upon an island and at low water was defended by an impassable barrier of mud so that the advances to it could be made only from the river where a small hard edged with posts worn down to the conformation of decayed doubleteeth offered the only means of access the house itself was one storey high dark red bricks and darker tiles upon the roof windows very scarce and very small although built long before the damnable tax upon light for it was probably built in the time of elizabeth to judge by the peculiarity of the style of architecture observable in the chimneys but it matters very little at what epoch was built a tenement which was rented at only ten pounds per annum the major part of the said island was stocked with cabbage plants but on one side there was half a boat set upright with a patch of green before it at the time that old beazeley hired it there was a bridge rudely constructed of old ship plank by which you could gain a path which led across the battersea fields but as all the communications of old tom were by water and mrs beazeley never ventured over the bridge it was gradually knocked away for firewood and when it was lowwater one old post redolent of mud marked the spot where the bridge had been the interior was far more inviting mrs beazeley was a clean person and frugal housewife and every article in the kitchen which was the first room you entered was as clean and as bright as industry could make it there was a parlour also seldom used both of the inmates when they did meet which was not above a day or two in three weeks during the time that old beazeley was in charge of the lighter preferring comfort to grandeur in this isolated house upon this isolated spot did mrs beazeley pass a life of most isolation and yet perhaps there never was a more lively or a more happy woman than mrs beazeley for she was strong and in good health and always employed she knew that her husband was following up his avocation on the river and laying by a provision for their old age which she herself was adding considerably to it by her own exertions she had married old tom long before he had lost his legs at a time when he was a prime active sailor and the best man of the ship she was a netmakers daughter and had been brought up to the business at which she was very expert the most difficult part of the art is that of making large seines for taking seafish and when she had no order for those to complete the making of castingnets beguiled away her time as soon as her household cares had been disposed of she made money and husbanded it not only for herself and her partner but for her son young tom upon whom she doted so accustomed was she to work hard and be alone that it was most difficult to say whether she was most pleased or most annoyed when her husband and son made their appearance for a day or two and the latter was alternately fondled and scolded during the whole of his sojourn tom as the reader may suppose from a knowledge of his character caring about as much for the one as the other i pulled into the hard and made fast my boat there was no one outside the door when i landed on entering i found them all seated at the table and a grand display of fragments in the shape of herringbones etcetera well jacobcome at lastthought you had forgot us piped to breakfast at eight bellsalways do you know said old tom on my making my appearance have you had your breakfast jacob said mrs beazeley no replied i i was obliged to go up to mr turnbulls and that detained me no more sodgers jacob said tom father and i eat them all have you replied mrs beazeley taking two more red herrings out of the cupboard and putting them on the fire to grill no no master tom theres some for jacob yet well mother you make nets to some purpose for youve always a fish when its wanted i despatched my breakfast and as soon as all had been cleared away by his wife old tom crossing his two timber legs commenced business for it appeared what i was not aware of that we had met on a sort of councilofwar jacob sit down by me old woman bring yourself to an anchor in the high chair tom sit anywhere so you sit still and leave my net alone tom cried his mother in parenthesisyou see jacob the whole long and short of it is thisi feel my toes more and more and flannels no longer warm i cant tide it any longer and i think it high time to lie up in ordinary and moor abreast of the old woman now theres tom in the first place whats to do with he i think that ill build him a wherry and as im free of the river he can finish his apprenticeship with my name on the boat but to build him a wherry would be rather a heavy pull for me if you mean to build it yourself i think it will prove a heavy pull for me replied tom silence tom i built you and god knows youre light enough and tom leave my net alone cried his mother father made me lightfingered mother ay and lighthearted too boy rejoined the dame looking fondly at her son well continued old tom supposing that tom be provided for in that way then now i comes to myself ive an idea that i can do a good bit of work in patching up boats for you see i always was a bit of a carpenter and i know how the builders extortionate the poor watermen when theres a trifle amiss now if they knew i could do it theyd all come to me fast enough but then theres a puzzle ive been thinking this week how i can make them know it i cant put out a board and say beazeley boatbuilder because im no boatbuilder but still i want a sign lord father havent you got one already interrupted young tom youve half a boat stuck up there and that means that youre half a boatbuilder silence tom with your frippery what do you think jacob could you not say boats repaired here yes but that wont exactly do they like to employ a builderand theres the puzzle not half so puzzling as this net observed tom who had taken up the needle unseen by his mother and begun to work ive made only ten stitches and six of them are long ones tom tom you goodfornothingwhy dont you let my net alone cried mrs beazeley now twill take me as much time to undo ten stitches as to have made fifty all right mother no tom alls wrong look at these meshes well then alls fair mother no alls foul boy look how its tangled still i say alls fair mother for it is but fair to give the fish one or two chances to get away and thats just what ive done and now father ill settle your affair to your own satisfaction as i have mothers that will be queer satisfaction tom i guess but lets hear what you have to say then father it seems that youre no boatbuilder but you want people to fancy that you areant that the question why tis something like it tom but i do nobody no harm certainly not its only the boats which will suffer now get a large board with boats built to order and boats repaired by tom beazeley you know if any man is fool enough to order a boat thats his concern you didnt say youre a boatbuilder although you have no objection to try your hand what do you say jacob said old tom appealing to me i think that tom has given very good advice and i would follow it ah tom has a head said mrs beazeley fondly tom let go my net again will you what a boy you are now touch it again if you dare and mrs beazeley took up a little poker from the fireplace and shook it at him tom has a head indeed said young tom but as he has no wish to have it broken jacob lend me your wherry for halfanhour and ill be off i assented and tom first tossing the cat upon his mothers back made his escape crying lord molly what a fish as the animal fixed in its claws to save herself from falling making mrs beazeley roar out and vow vengeance while old tom and i could not refrain from laughter after toms departure the conversation was renewed and everything was finally arranged between old tom and his wife except the building of the wherry at which the old woman shook her head the debate would be too long and not sufficiently interesting to detail one part however i must make the reader acquainted with after entering into all the arrangements of the house mrs beazeley took me upstairs to show me the rooms which were very neat and clean i came down with her and old tom said did the old woman show you the room with the white curtains jacob yes replied i and a very nice one it is well jacob theres nothing sure in this world youre well off at present and leave well alone is a good motto but recollect this that room is for you when you want it and everything else we can share with you its offered freely and you will accept it the same is it not old lady yes that it is jacob but may you do betterif not ill be your mother for want of a better i was moved with the kindness of the old couple the more so as i did not know what i had done to deserve it old tom gave me a hearty squeeze of the hand and then continuedbut about this wherrywhat do you say old woman what will it cost replied she gravely cost let me seea good wherry with sculls and oars will be a matter of thirty pounds the old woman screwed up her mouth shook her head and then walked away to prepare for dinner i think she could muster the blunt jacob but she dont like to part with it tom must coax her i wish he hadnt shied the cat at her hes too full of fun as old beazeley finished i perceived a wherry pulling in with some ladies i looked attentively and recognised my own boat and tom pulling in a minute more they were at the hard and who to my astonishment were there seated but mrs drummond and sarah as tom got out of the boat and held it steady against the hard he called to me i could not do otherwise than go and assist them out and once more did i touch the hands of those whom i never thought to meet again mrs drummond retained my hand a short time after she landed saying we are friends jacob are we not oh yes madam replied i much moved in a faltering voice i shall not ask that question said sarah gaily for we parted friends and as i recalled to mind her affectionate behaviour i pressed her hand and the tears glistened in my eyes as i looked into her sweet face as i afterwards discovered this was an arranged plan with old and young tom to bring about a meeting without my knowledge mrs beazeley courtesied and stroked her apronsmiled at the ladies looked very catish at tom showed the ladies into the house where old tom assisted to do the honours after his own fashion by asking mrs drummond if she would like to whet her whistle after her pull mrs drummond looked round to me for explanation but young tom thought proper to be interpreter father wants to know if you please maam whether after your pull in the boat you wouldnt like to have a pull at the brandy bottle no replied mrs drummond smiling but i should be obliged for a glass of water will you get me one jacob i hastened to comply and mrs drummond entered into conversation with mrs beazeley sarah looked at me and went to the door turning back as inviting me to follow i did so and we soon found ourselves seated on the bench in the old boat jacob said she looking earnestly at me you surely will be friends with my father i think i should have shaken my head but she laid an emphasis on my which the little gipsy knew would have its effect all my resolutions all my pride all my sense of injury vanished before the mild beautiful eyes of sarah and i replied hastily yes miss sarah i can refuse you nothing why miss jacob i am a waterman and you are much above me that is your own fault but say no more about it i must say something more which is this do not attempt to make me leave my present employment i am happy because i am independent and that i will if possible be for the future any one can pull an oar jacob very true miss sarah and is under no obligation to any one by so earning his livelihood he works for all and is paid for all will you come and see us jacob come tomorrownow dopromise me will you refuse your old playmate jacob i wish you would not ask that how then can you say that you are friends with my father i will not believe you unless you promise to come sarah replied i earnestly i will come and to prove to you that we are friends i will ask a favour of him oh jacob this is kind indeed cried sarah with her eyes swimming with tears you have made me soso very happy the meeting with sarah humanised me and every feeling of revenge was chased from my memory mrs drummond joined us soon after and proposed to return and jacob will pull us back cried sarah come sir look after your fare in both senses since you will be a waterman you shall work i laughed and handed them to the boat tom took the other oar and we were soon at the steps close to their house mamma we ought to give these poor fellows something to drink theyve worked very hard said sarah mocking come up my good men i hesitated nay jacob if tomorrow why not today the sooner these things are over the better i felt the truth of this observation and followed her in a few minutes i was again in that parlour in which i had been dismissed and in which the affectionate girl burst into tears on my shoulder as i held the handle of the door i looked at it and looked at sarah mrs drummond had gone out of the room to let mr drummond know that i had come how kind you were sarah said i yes but kind people are cross sometimes and so am iand so was mr drummond came in and stopped her jacob i am glad to see you again in my house i was deceived by appearances and did you injustice how true is the observation of the wise man that a soft word turneth away wrath that mr drummond should personally acknowledge that he was wrong to methat he should confess itevery feeling of resentment was gone and others crowded in their place i recollected how he had protected the orphanhow he had provided him with instructionhow he had made his house a home to mehow he had tried to bring me forward under his own protection i recollectedwhich alas i never should have forgottenthat he had treated me for years with kindness and affection all of which had been obliterated from my memory by one single act of injustice i felt that i was a culprit and burst into tears and sarah as before cried in sympathy i beg your pardon mr drummond said i as soon as i could speak i have been very wrong in being so revengeful after so much kindness from you we both have been wrongbut say no more on the subject jacob i have an order to give and then i will come up to you again and mr drummond quitted the room you dear good boy said sarah coming up to me now i really do love you what i might have replied was put a stop to by mrs drummond entering the room she made a few inquiries about where i at present resided and sarah was catechising me rather inquisitively about mary stapleton when mr drummond reentered the room and shook me by the hand with a warmth which made me more ashamed of my conduct towards him the conversation became general but still rather embarrassed when sarah whispered to me what is the favour you would ask of my father i had forgotten it at the moment but i immediately told him that i would be obliged if he would allow me to have a part of the money belonging to me which he held in his possession that i will with pleasure and without asking what you intend to do with it jacob how much do you require thirty pounds if there is so much mr drummond went down and in a few minutes returned with the sum in notes and guineas i thanked him and shortly afterwards took my leave did not young beazeley tell you i had something for you jacob said sarah as i wished her goodbye yes what is it you must come and see replied sarah laughing thus was a finale to all my revenge brought about by a little girl of fifteen years old with large dark eyes tom had taken his glass of grog below and was waiting for me at the steps we shoved off and returned to his fathers house where dinner was just ready after dinner old tom recommenced the argument the only hitch says he is about the wherry what do you say old woman the old woman shook her head as that is the only hitch said i i can remove it for here is the money for the wherry which i make a present to tom and i put the money into young toms hand tom counted it out before his father and mother much to their astonishment you are a good fellow jacob said tom but i say do you recollect wimbledon common what then replied i only jerry abershaw thats all do not be afraid tom it is honestly mine but how did you get it jacob said old tom it may appear strange but impelled by a wish to serve my friends i had asked for the money which i knew belonged to me but never thought of the manner in which it had been obtained the question of old tom recalled everything to my memory and i shuddered when i recollected the circumstances attending it i was confused and did not like to reply be satisfied the money is mine replied i yes jacob but how replied mrs beazeley surely you ought to be able to tell how you got so large a sum jacob has some reason for not telling missus depend upon it mayhap mr turnbull or whoever gave it to him told him to hold his tongue but this answer would not satisfy mrs beazeley who declared she would not allow a farthing to be taken unless she knew how it was obtained tom give back the money directly said she looking at me suspiciously tom laid it on the table before me without saying a word take it tom said i colouring up i had it from my mother from your mother jacob said old tom nay that could not well be if my memory sarves me right still it may be deary me i dont like this at all cried mrs beazeley getting up and wiping her apron with a quick motion oh jacob that must benot the truth i coloured up to the tips of my ears at being suspected of falsehood i looked round and saw that even tom and his father had a melancholy doubt in their countenances and certainly my confused appearance would have caused suspicion in anybody i little thought said i at last when i hoped to have so much pleasure in giving and to find that i had made you happy in receiving the money that it would have proved a source of so much annoyance i perceive that i am suspected of having obtained it improperly and of not having told the truth that mrs beazeley may think so who does not know me is not to be wondered at but that you continued i turning to old tom or you looking at his son should suspect me is very mortifying and i did not expect it i tell you that the money is mine honestly mine and obtained from my mother i ask you do you believe me i for one do believe you jacob said young tom striking his fist on the table i cant understand it but i know you never told a lie or did a dishonourable act since ive known you thank you tom said i taking his proffered hand and i would swear the same jacob said old tom although i have been longer in the world than my boy has and have therefore seen more and sorry am i to say many a good man turned bad from temptation being too great but when i looked in your face and saw the blood up to your forehead i did feel a little suspicious i must own but i beg your pardon jacob no one can look in your face now and not see that you are innocent i believe all you say in spite of the old woman andthe devil to bootand theres my hand upon it why not tellwhy not tell muttered mrs beazeley shaking her head and working at her net faster than ever but i had resolved to tell and did so narrating distinctly the circumstances by which the money had been obtained i did it however with feelings of mortification which i cannot express i felt humiliationi felt that for my own wants that money i never could touch still my explanation had the effect of removing the doubts even of mrs beazeley and harmony was restored the money was accepted by the old couple and promised to be applied for the purpose intended as for me jacob said tom when i say i thank you you know i mean it had i had the money and you had wanted it you will believe me when i say that i would have given it to you that im sure of tom still jacob it is a great deal of money and i shall lay by my earnings as fast as i can that you may have it in case you want it but it will take many a heavy pull and many a shirt wet with labour before i can make up a sum like that i did not stay much longer after this little fracas i was hurtmy pride was wounded by suspicion and fortunate it was that the occurrence had not taken place previous to my meeting with mrs drummond and sarah otherwise no reconciliation would have taken place in that quarter how much are we the sport of circumstances and how insensibly they mark out our career in this world with the best intentions we go wrong instigated by unworthy motives we fall upon our feet and the chapter of accidents has more power over the best regulated mind than all the chapters in the bible chapter thirty four how i was revenged upon my enemieswe try the bars of music but find that we are barred outbeing no go we go back i shook hands with tom who perceiving that i was vexed had accompanied me down to the boat with his usual sympathy and had offered to pull with me to fulham and walk back which offer i declined as i wished to be alone it was a fine moonlight night and the broad light and shadow with the stillness of all around were peculiarly adapted to my feelings i continued my way up the river revolving in my mind the scenes of the day the reconciliation with one whom i never intended to have spoken to again the little quarrel with those whom i never expected to have been at variance with and that at the time when i was only exerting myself to serve them and then i thought of sarah as an oasis of real happiness in this contemplated desert and dwelt upon the thought of her as the most pleasant and calming to my still agitated mind thus did i ruminate till i had passed putney bridge forgetting that i was close to my landing place and continuing in my reverie to pull up the river when my cogitations were disturbed by a noise of men laughing and talking apparently in a state of intoxication they were in a fouroared wherry coming down the river after a party of pleasure as it is termed generally one ending in intoxication i listened i tell you i can spin an oar with any man in the kings service said the man in the bow now look he threw his oar out of the rowlocks spun it in the air but unfortunately did not catch it when it fell and consequently it went through the bottom starting two of the planks of the fragilebuilt boat which immediately filled with water hilloa waterman cried another perceiving me quick or we shall sink but the boat was nearly up to the thwarts in water before i could reach her and just as i was nearly alongside she filled and turned over help waterman help me first im senior clerk cried a voice which i well knew i put out my oar to him as he struggled in the water and soon had him clinging to the wherry i then tried to catch hold of the man who had sunk the boat by his attempt to toss the oar but he very quietly said no damn it theres too many we shall swamp the wherry ill swim on shoreand suiting the action to the word he made for the shore with perfect selfpossession swimming in his clothes with great ease and dexterity i picked up two more and thought that all were saved when turning round and looking towards the bridge i saw resplendent in the bright beams of the moon and round as its orb the wellremembered face of the stupid young clerk who had been so inimical to me struggling with all his might i pulled to him and putting out my oar over the bow he seized it after rising from his first sink and was with the other three soon clinging to the side of the wherry pull me inpull me in waterman cried the head clerk whose voice i had recognised no you will swamp the boat well but pull me in if not the others im the senior clerk cant help that you must hold on replied i while i pull you on shore we shall soon be there i must say that i felt a pleasure in allowing him thus to hang in the water i might have taken them all in certainly although at some risk from their want of presence of mind and hurry arising from the feeling of selfpreservation but i desired them to hold on and pulled for the landingplace which we soon gained the person who had preferred swimming had arrived before us and was waiting on the beach have you got them all waterman said he yes sir i believe so i have four the tally is right replied he and four greater galloots were never picked up but never mind that it was my nonsense that nearly drowned them and therefore im very glad youve managed so well my jacket went down in the boat and i must reward you another time thank you sir no occasion for that its not a regular fare nevertheless give us your name oh you may ask mr hodgson the senior clerk or that fullmoonfaced fellowthey know my name waterman what do you mean replied mr hodgson shivering with cold very impudent fellow said the junior of the round face if they know your name they wont tell it replied the other now ill first tell you mine which is lieutenant wilson of the navy and now lets have yours that i may ask for it and tell me what stairs you ply from my name is jacob faithful sir replied i and you may ask your friends whether they know it or not when their teeth dont chatter quite so much at the mention of my name the senior and junior clerk walked off and the lieutenant telling me that i should hear from him again was about to leave if you mean to give me money sir i tell you candidly i shall not take it i hate these two men for the injuries they have heaped on me but i dont know how it is i feel a degree of pleasure in having saved them that i wish for no better revenge so farewell sir spoken as you ought my ladthats glorious revenge well then i will not come but if ever we meet again i shall never forget this night and jacob faithful he held out his hand shook mine warmly and walked away when they were gone i remained for some little time quite stupified at the events of the day the reconciliationthe quarrelthe revenge i was still in thought when i heard the sound of a horses hoofs this recalled me and i was hauling up my boat intending to go home to stapletons but with no great eagerness i felt a sort of dislike to mary stapleton which i could not account for but the fact was i had been in company with sarah drummond the horse stopped at the foot of the bridge and the rider giving it to his servant who was mounted on another to hold came down to where i was hauling up my boat my lad is it too late for you to launch your boat i will pay you well where do you wish to go to sir it is now past ten oclock i know it is and i hardly expected to find a waterman here but i took the chance will you take me about two miles up the river i looked at the person who addressed me and was delighted to recognise in him the young man who had hired mr turnbull and me to take him to the garden and who had been captured when we escaped with the tin box but i did not make myself known well sir if you wish it ive no objection replied i putting my shoulder to the bow of my wherry and launching her again into the water at all events this has been a day of adventure thought i as i threw my sculls again into the water and commenced pulling up the stream i was some little while in meditation whether i should make myself known to the young man but i decided that i would not let me see thought i what sort of a person this is whether he is as deserving as the young lady appeared to consider which side sir inquired i the left was the reply i knew that well enough and i pulled in silence until nearly up to the wall of the garden which ran down to the band of the river now pull in to that wall and make no noise was the injunction which i obeyed securing the boat to the very part where the coping bricks had been displaced he stood up and whistled the two bars of the tune as before waited five minutes repeated it and watched the windows of the house but there was no reply or signs of anybody being up or stirring it is too late she is gone to rest i thought there was a lady in the case sir observed i if you wish to communicate with her i think i could manage it could you replied he stop a moment ill speak to you byandby he whistled the tune once more and after waiting another ten minutes dropped himself down on the stern sheets and told me to pull back again after a minutes silence he said to me you think you could communicate with her you say pray how do you propose if you will write a letter sir ill try to let it come to her hand how that sir you must leave me to find out and trust to opportunity but you must tell me what sort of a person she is that i may not give it to another and also who there is in the house that i must be careful does not see me very true replied he i can only say that if you do succeed i will reward you handsomely but she is so strictly watched that i am afraid it will be impossible however a despairing like a drowning man will catch at a straw and i will see whether you will be able to assist me he then informed me that there was no one in the house except her uncle and his servants all of whom were spies upon her that my only chance was watching if she were permitted to walk in the garden alone which might be the case and perhaps by concealing myself from eight oclock in the morning till the evening under the parapet wall i might find an opportunity he directed me to be at the foot of the bridge next morning at seven oclock when he would come with a letter written for me to deliver if possible we had then arrived at fulham he landed and putting a guinea in my hand mounted his horse which his servant had walked up and down waiting for him and rode off i hauled up my boat and went home tired with the manifold events of the day mary stapleton who had sat up for me was very inquisitive to know what had occasioned my coming home so late but i evaded her questions and she left me in anything but goodhumour but about that i never felt so indifferent the next morning the servant made his appearance with the letter telling me that he had orders to wait till the evening and i pulled up the river i placed it under the loose brick as agreed upon with the young lady and then shoved off to the other side of the river where i had a full view of the garden and could notice all that passed in halfanhour the young lady came out accompanied by another female and sauntered up and down the gravelwalk after a while she stopped and looked on the river her companion continuing her promenade as if without hoping to find anything there she moved the brick aside with her foot perceiving the letter she snatched it up eagerly and concealed it in her dress and then cast her eyes on the river it was calm and i whistled the bar of music she heard it and turning away hastened into the house in about halfanhour she returned and watching her opportunity stooped down to the brick i waited a few minutes when both she and her companion went into the house i then pulled in under the wall lifted up the brick took the letter and hastened back to fulham when i delivered the letter to the servant who rode off with it as fast as he could and i returned home quite pleased at the successful issue of my attempt and not a little curious to learn the real facts of this extraordinary affair chapter thirty five the dominie reads me a sermon out of the largest book i ever fell in with covering nearly two acres of groundthe pages not very easy to turn over but the type very convenient to read without spectacleshe leaves off without shutting his book as parsons usually do at the end of their sermons the next day being sunday as usual i went to see the dominie and mr turnbull i arrived at the school just as all the boys were filing off two and two for church the advance led by the usher and the rear brought up by the dominie in person and i accompanied them the dominie appeared melancholy and out of spiritshardly exchanging a word with me during our walk when the service was over he ordered the usher to take the boys home and remained with me in the churchyard surveying the tombstones and occasionally muttering to himself at last the congregation dispersed and we were alone little did i think jacob said he at last that when i bestowed such care upon thee in thy childhood i should be rewarded as i have been little did i think that it would be to the boy who was left destitute that i should pour out my soul when afflicted and find in him that sympathy which i have long lost by the removal of those who were once my friends yes jacob those who were known to me in my youth those few in whom i confided and leant uponare now lying here in crumbling dust and the generation hath passed away and i now rest upon thee my son whom i have directed in the right path and who hast by the blessing of god continued to walk straight in it verily thou art a solace to me jacob and though young in years i feel that in thee i have received a friend and one that i may confide in bless thee jacob bless thee my boy and before i am laid with those who have gone before me may i see thee prosperous and happy then i will sing the nunc dimittis then will i say now lord let thy servant depart in peace i am happy sir replied i to hear you say that i am of any comfort to you for i feel truly grateful for all your kindness to me but i wish that you did not require comfort jacob in what part of a mans life does he not require comfort and consolation yea even from the time when as a child he buries his weeping face in his mothers lap till the hour that summons him to his account not that i consider this world to be as many have described it a vale of tears no jacob it is a beautiful world a glorious world and would be a happy world if we would only restrain those senses and those passions with which we have been endowed that we may fully enjoy the beauty the variety the inexhaustible bounty of a gracious heaven all was made for enjoyment and for happiness but it is we ourselves who by excess defile that which otherwise were pure thus the fainting traveller may drink wholesome and refreshing draughts from the bounteous overflowing spring but should he rush heedlessly into it he muddies the source and the waters are those of bitterness thus jacob was wine given to cheer the heart of man yet didst not thou witness me thy preceptor debased by intemperance thus jacob were the affections implanted in us as a source of sweetest happiness such as those which now yearn in my breast towards thee yet hast thou seen me thy preceptor by yielding to the infatuation and imbecility of threescore years dote in my folly upon a maiden and turn the sweet affections into a source of misery and anguish i answered not for the words of the dominie made a strong impression upon me and i was weighing them in my mind jacob continued the dominie after a pause next to the book of life there is no subject of contemplation more salutary than the book of death of which each stone now around us may be considered as a page and each page contains a lesson read that which is now before us it would appear hard that an only child should have been torn away from its doting parents who have thus imperfectly expressed their anguish on the tomb it would appear hard that their delight their solace the object of their daily care of their waking thoughts of their last imperfect recollections as they sank into sleep of their only dreams should thus have been taken from them yet did i know them and heaven was just and merciful the child had weaned them from their god they lived but in him they were without god in the world the child alone had their affections and they had been lost had not he in his mercy removed it come this way jacob i followed the dominie till he stood before another tombstone in the corner of the churchyard this stone jacob marks the spot where lies the remains of one who was my earliest and dearest friendfor in my youth i had friends because i had anticipations and little thought that it would have pleased god that i should do my duty in that station to which i have been called he had one fault which proved a source of misery through life and was the cause of an untimely death he was of a revengeful disposition he never forgave an injury forgetting poor sinful mortal for how much he had need to be forgiven he quarrelled with his relations he was shot in a duel with his friend i mention this jacob as a lesson to thee not that i feel myself worthy to be thy preceptor for i am humbled but out of kindness and love towards thee that i might persuade thee to correct that fault in thy disposition i have already made friends with mr drummond sir answered i but still your admonition shall not be thrown away hast thou jacob then is my mind much relieved i trust thou wilt no longer stand in thine own light but accept the offers which in the fulness of his heart to make redress he may make unto thee nay sir i cannot promise that i wish to be independent and earn my own livelihood then hear me jacob for the spirit of prophecy is on me the time will come when thou shalt bitterly repent thou hast received an education by my unworthy endeavours and hast been blessed by providence with talents far above the situation in life to which thou wouldst so tenaciously adhere the time will come when thou wilt repent yea bitterly repent look at that marble monument with the arms so lavishly emblazoned upon it that jacob is the tomb of a proud man whose career is well known to me he was in straitened circumstances yet of gentle racebut like the steward in the scripture work he could not to beg he was ashamed he might have prospered in the world but his pride forbade him he might have made friends but his pride forbade him he might have wedded himself to wealth and beauty but there was no escutcheon and his pride forbade him he did marry and entail upon his children poverty he died and the little he possessed was taken from his childrens necessities to build this record to his dust do not suppose that i would check that honest pride which will prove a safeguard from unworthy actions i only wish to check that undue pride which will mar thy future prospects jacob that which thou termest independence is naught but pride i could not acknowledge that i agreed with the dominie although something in my breast told me that he was not wrong i made no answer the dominie again spoke yes it is a beautiful world for the spirit of god is on it at the separation of chaos it came over the water and hath since remained with us everywhere but invisible we see his hand in the variety and the beauty of creation but his spirit we see not yet do we feel it in the still small voice of conscience which would lead us into the right path now jacob we must return for i have the catechism and collects to attend to i took leave of the dominie and went to mr turnbulls to whom i gave an account of what had passed since i last saw him he was much pleased with my reconciliation with the drummonds and interested about the young lady to whom appertained the tin box in his possession i presume jacob we shall now have that mystery cleared up i have not told the gentleman that we have possession of the box replied i no but you told the young lady you silly fellow and do you think she will keep it a secret from him very true i had forgotten that jacob i wish you to go to mr drummonds and see his family again you ought to do so i hesitated nay i shall give you a fair opportunity without wounding that pride of yours sir replied mr turnbull i owe him for some wine he purchased for me and i shall send the cheque by you to this i assented as i was not sorry of an opportunity of seeing sarah i dined with mr turnbull who was alone his wife being on a visit to a relation in the country he again offered me his advice as to giving up the profession of a waterman but if i did not hear him with so much impatience as before nor use so many arguments against it i did not accede to his wishes and the subject was dropped mr turnbull was satisfied that my resistance was weakened and hoped in time to have the effect that he desired when i went home mary told me that tom beazeley had been there that his wherry was building that his father had given up the lighter and was now on shore very busy in getting up his board to attract customers and obtain work in his new occupation i had not launched my wherry the next morning when down came the young gentleman to whom i had despatched the letter faithful said he come to the tavern with me i must have some conversation with you i followed him and as soon as we were in a room he said first let me pay my debt for i owe you much and he laid five guineas on the table i find from cecilia that you have possession of the tin case of deeds which has been so eagerly sought after by both parties why did you not say so and why did you not tell me that it was you whom i hired on the night when i was so unfortunate i considered the secret as belonging to the young lady and having told her i left it to her discretion to make you acquainted or not as she pleased it was thoughtful and prudent of you at all events although there was no occasion for it nevertheless i am pleased that you did so as it proves you to be trustworthy now tell me who is the gentleman who was with you in the boat and who has charge of the box observe faithful i do not intend to demand it i shall tell him the facts of the case in your presence and then leave him to decide whether he will surrender up the papers to the other party or to me can you take me there now yes sir replied i i can if you please i will pull you up in half an hour the house is at the rivers side the young gentleman leaped into my wherry and we were soon in the parlour of mr turnbull i will not repeat the conversation in detail but give an outline of the young mans story chapter thirty six a long story which ends in the opening of the tin box which proves to contain deeds much more satisfactory to mr wharncliffe than the deeds of his unclebegin to feel the blessings of independence and suspect that i have acted like a foolafter two years consideration i become quite sure of it and as tom says no mistake the gentleman who prevented my taking off the young lady is uncle to both of us we are therefore first cousins our family name is wharncliffe my father was a major in the army he died when i was young and my mother is still alive and is sister to lady auburn the father and mother of cecilia are both dead he went out to india to join his brother another uncle of whom i shall speak directly he has now been dead three years and out of the four brothers there is only one left my uncle with whom cecilia is living and whose christian name is henry he was a lawyer by profession but he purchased a patent place which he still enjoys my father whose name was william died in very moderate circumstances but still he left enough for my mother to live upon and to educate me properly i was brought up to the law under my uncle henry with whom for some years i resided cecilias father whose name was edward left nothing he had ruined himself in england and had gone out to india at the request of my uncle there whose name was james and who had amassed a large fortune soon after the death of cecilias father my uncle james came home on furlough for he held a very high and lucrative situation under the company a bachelor from choice he was still fond of young people and having but one nephew and one niece to leave his money to as soon as he arrived with cecilia whom he brought with him he was most anxious to see me he therefore took up his quarters with my uncle henry and remained with him during his sojourn in england but my uncle james was of a very cold and capricious temper he liked me best because i was a boy and one day declared i should be his heir the next day he would alter his intention and declare that cecilia of whom he was very fond should inherit everything if we affronted him for at the age of sixteen as a boy and fourteen as a girl worldly prospects were little regarded he would then declare that we should not be a shilling the better for his money with him money was everything it was his daily theme of conversation his only passion and he valued and respected people in proportion to what they were supposed to possess with these feelings he demanded for himself the greatest deference from cecilia and me as his expectant heirs this he did not receive but on the whole he was pleased with us and after remaining three years in england he returned to the east indies i had heard him mention to my uncle henry his intention of making his will and leaving it with him before he sailed but i was not certain whether it had been done or not at all events my uncle henry took care that i should not be in the way for at that time my uncle carried on his profession as a lawyer and i was working in his office it was not until after my uncle james returned to india that he gave up business and purchased the patent place which i mentioned cecilia was left with my uncle henry and as we lived in the same house our affections as we grew up ripened into love we often used to laugh at the threats of my uncle james and agreed that whoever might be the fortunate one to whom he left his property we would go halves and share it equally in the meantime i still followed up my profession in another house in which i at present am a partner four years after the return of my uncle james to india news came home of his death but it was also stated that no will could be found and it was supposed that he died intestate of course my uncle henry succeeded as heiratlaw to the whole property and thus were the expectations and hopes of cecilia and of myself dashed to the ground but this was not the worst of it my uncle who had witnessed our feelings for each other and had made no comment as soon as he was in possession of the property intimated to cecilia that she should be his heiress provided that she married according to his wishes and pointed out to her that a fortune such as she might expect would warrant the alliance of the first nobleman in the kingdom and he very plainly told me that he thought it advisable that i should find lodgings for myself and not be any longer an inmate in the same house as was my cousin as no good would result from it thus sir we were not only disappointed in our hopes but thwarted in our affections which had for some time been exchanged maddened at this intimation i quitted the house and at the same time the idea of my uncle james having made a will still pressed upon me as i called to mind what i had heard him say to my uncle henry previous to his sailing for india there was a box of deeds and papers the very box now in your possession which my uncle invariably kept in his bedroom i felt convinced that the will if not destroyed and i did not believe my uncle would dare to commit an act of felony was in that box had i remained in the house i would have found some means to have opened it but this was no longer possible i communicated my suspicions to cecilia and begged her to make the attempt which would be more easy as my uncle would not suspect her of being bold enough to venture it even if he had the suspicion cecilia promised and one day my uncle fortunately left his keys upon his dressingtable when he came down to breakfast and went out without missing them cecilia discovered them and opened the box and amongst other parchments found a document labelled outside as the will of our uncle james but women understand little about these things and she was in such trepidation for fear that my uncle should return that she could not examine it very minutely as it was my uncle did return for his keys just as she had locked the box and placed the keys upon the table he asked her what she was doing there and she made some excuse he saw the keys on the table and whether suspecting her for she coloured up very much or afraid that the attempt might be made at my suggestion he removed the box and locked it up in a closet the key of which i believe he left with his banker in town when cecilia wrote to me an account of what had passed i desired her to find the means of opening the closet that we might gain possession of the box and this was easily effected for the key of another closet fitted the lock exactly i then persuaded her to put herself under my protection with the determination that we would marry immediately and we had so arranged that the tin box was to have accompanied us you are aware sir how unfortunately our plan turned outat least so far unfortunately that i lost as i thought not only cecilia but the tin box containing as i expect the will of my uncle of which i am more than ever convinced from the great anxiety shown by my uncle henry to recover it since the loss he has been in a state of agitation which has worn him to a shadow he feels that his only chance is that the waterman employed might have broken open the box expecting to find money in it and being disappointed have destroyed the papers to avoid detection if such had been the case and it might have been had it not fallen into such good hands he then would have obtained his only wish that of the destruction of the will although not by his own hands now sir i have given you a full and honest account of the affair and leave you to decide how to act if you leave me to decide i shall do it very quickly replied mr turnbull a box has fallen into my hands and i do not know who is the owner i shall open it and take a list of the deeds in contains and advertise them in the times and other newspapers if your dead uncles will is in it it will of course be advertised with the others and after such publicity your uncle henry will not venture i presume to say a word but be too glad not to be exposed mr turnbull ordered a locksmith to be summoned and the tin box was opened it contained the document of the uncles purchase of the patent place in the courts and some other papers but it also contained the parchment so much looked afterthe last will and testament of james wharncliffe esquire dated two months previous to his quitting england i think observed mr turnbull that in case of accident it may be as well that this will should be read before witnesses you observe it is witnessed by henry wharncliffe with two others let us take down their names the will was read by young wharncliffe at the request of mr turnbull strange to say the deceased bequeathed the whole of his property to his nephew william wharncliffe and his niece cecilia provided they married if they did not they were left pounds each and the remainder of the fortune to go to the first male child born after the marriage of either niece or nephew to his brother the sum of pounds was bequeathed with a liberal arrangement to be paid out of the estate so long as his niece lived with him the will was read and returned to mr turnbull who shook hands with mr wharncliffe and congratulated him i am so much indebted to you sir that i can hardly express my gratitude but i am still more indebted to this intelligent lad faithful you must no longer be a waterman faithful and mr wharncliffe shook my hand i made no answer to the latter observation for mr turnbull had fixed his eye upon me i merely said that i was very happy to have been of use to him you may truly say mr wharncliffe observed mr turnbull that your future prosperity will be through his means and as it appears by the will that you have pounds per annum safe in the funds i think you ought to give a prize wherry to be rowed for every year and i will take that replied i for a receipt in full for my share in the transaction and now said mr turnbull interrupting mr wharncliffe who was about to answer me it appears to me that it may be as well to avoid any exposurethe case is too clear call upon your unclestate in whose hands the documents aretell him that he must submit to your terms which are that he proves the will and permits the marriage to take place immediately and that no more will be said on the subject he as a lawyer knows how severely and disgracefully he might be punished for what he has done and will be too happy now to accede to your terms in the meantime i keep possession of the papers for the will shall never leave my hands until it is lodged in doctors commons mr wharncliffe could not but approve of this judicious arrangement and we separated and not to interfere with my narrative i may as well tell the reader at once that mr wharncliffes uncle bowed to circumstances pretended to rejoice at the discovery of the will never mentioned the loss of his tin box put the hand of cecilia into that of william and they were married one month after the meeting at mr turnbulls which i have now related the evening was so far advanced before this councilofwar was over that i was obliged to defer the delivery of the cheque to mr drummond until the next day i left about eleven oclock and arrived at noon when i knocked at the door the servant did not know me what did you want i wanted to speak with mrs or miss drummond and my name is faithful he desired me to sit down in the hall while he went up and wipe your shoes my lad i cannot say that i was pleased at this command as i may call it but he returned desiring me to walk up and i followed him i found sarah alone in the drawingroom jacob im so glad to see you and im sorry that you were made to wait below butif people who can be otherwise will be watermen it is not our fault the servants only judge by appearances i felt annoyed for a moment but it was soon over i sat down by sarah and talked with her for some time the present i had to make you was a purse of my own knitting to put your earnings in said she laughing and then she held up her finger in mockery crying boat sir boat sir well jacob theres nothing like independence after all and you must not mind my laughing at you i do not heed it sarah replied i but i did mind it very much there is no disgrace none whatever i grant but a want of ambition which i cannot understand however let us say no more about it mrs drummond came into the room and greeted me kindly when can you come and dine with us jacob will you come on wednesday oh mamma he cant come on wednesday we have company on that day so we have my dear i had forgotten it but on thursday we are quite alone will you come then on thursday jacob i hesitated for i felt that it was because i was a waterman that i was not admitted to the table where i had been accustomed to dine at one time whoever might be invited yes jacob said sarah coming to me it must be thursday and you must not deny us for although we have greater people on wednesday the party that day will not be so agreeable to me as your company on thursday the last compliment from sarah decided me and i accepted the invitation mr drummond came in and i delivered to him mr turnbulls cheque he was very kind but said little further than that he was glad that i had promised to dine with them on thursday the footman came in and announced the carriage at the door and this was a signal for me to take my leave sarah as she shook hands with me laughing asserted that it was not considerate in them to detain me any longer as i must have lost halfadozen good fares already so go down to your boat pull off your jacket and make up for lost time continued she one of these days mamma and i intend to go on the water just to patronise you i laughed and went away but i was cruelly mortified i could not be equal to them because i was a waterman the sarcasm of sarah was not lost upon me still there was so much kindness mixed with it that i could not be angry with her on the thursday i went there as agreed they were quite alone friendly and attentive but still there was a degree of constraint which communicated itself to me after dinner mr drummond said very little there was no renewal of offers to take me into his employ nor any inquiry as to how i got on in the profession which i had chosen on the whole i found myself uncomfortable and was glad to leave early nor did i feel at all inclined to renew my visit i ought to remark that mr drummond was now moving in a very different sphere than when i first knew him he was consignee of several large establishments abroad and was making a rapid fortune his establishment was also on a very different scale every department being appointed with elegance and conducive to luxury as i pulled up the river something within my breast told me that the dominies prophecy would turn out correct and that i should one day repent of my having refused the advances of mr drummondnay i did not exactly know whether i did not even at that moment very much doubt the wisdom of my asserting my independence and now reader that i may not surfeit you with an uninteresting detail you may allow nearly two years to pass away before i recommence my narrative the events of that time i shall sum up in one or two pages the dominie continued the even tenor of his wayblew his nose and handled his rod with as much effect as ever i seldom passed a sunday without paying him a visit and benefiting by his counsel mr turnbull was always kind and considerate but gradually declining in health having never recovered from the effects of his submersion under the ice of the drummonds i saw but little when we did meet i was kindly received but i never volunteered a call and it was usually from a message through tom that i went to pay my respects sarah had grown a very beautiful girl and the wellknown fact of mr drummonds wealth and her being an only daughter was an introduction to a circle much higher than they had been formerly accustomed to every day therefore the disparity increased and i felt less inclined to make my appearance at their house stapleton as usual continued to smoke his pipe and descant upon human natur mary had grown into a splendid woman but coquettish as ever poor tom beazeley was fairly entrapped by her charms and was a constant attendant upon her but she played him fast and looseone time encouraging and smiling on him at another rejecting and flouting him still tom persevered for he was fascinated and having returned me the money advanced for his wherry he expended all his earnings on dressing himself smartly and making presents to her she had completely grown out of any control from me and appeared to have a pleasure in doing everything she knew i disapproved still we were on fair friendly terms as inmates of the same house old tom beazeleys board was up and he had met with great success and all day he might be seen hammering at the bottom of boats of every description and heard at the same time lightening his labour with his variety of song i often called there on my way up and down the river and occasionally passed a few hours listening to his yarns which like his songs appeared to be inexhaustible with respect to myself it would be more a narrative of feelings than of action my life glided on as did my wherrysilently and rapidly one day was but the forerunner of another with slight variety of incident and customers my acquaintance as the reader knows were but few and my visits occasional i again turned to my books during the long summer evenings in which mary would walk out accompanied by tom and other admirers mr turnbulls library was at my service and i profited much after a time reading became almost a passion and i was seldom without a book in my hand but although i improved my mind i did not render myself happier on the contrary i felt more and more that i had committed an act of egregious folly in thus asserting my independence i felt that i was superior to my station in life and that i had lived with those who were not companionsthat i had thrown away by foolish pride those prospects of advancement which had offered themselves and that i was passing my youth unprofitably all this crowded upon me more and more every day and i bitterly repented as the dominie told me that i should my spirit of independencenow that it was too late the offers of mr drummond were never renewed and mr turnbull who had formed the idea that i was still of the same opinion and who at the same time in his afflicted statefor he was a martyr to the rheumatismnaturally thought more of himself and less of others never again proposed that i should quit my employment i was still too proud to mention my wishes and thus did i continue plying on the river apathetic almost as to gain and only happy when in the pages of history or among the flowers of poetry i could dwell upon times that were past or revel in imagination thus did reading like the snake which is said to contain in its body a remedy for the poison of its fangs become as it enlarged my mind a source of discontent at my humble situation but at the same time the only solace in my unhappiness by diverting my thoughts from the present pass then nearly two years reader taking the above remarks as an outline and filling up the picture from the colours of your imagination with incidents of no peculiar value and i again resume my narrative chapter thirty seven a chapter of losses to all but the reader though at first tom works with his wit and receives the full value of his exertionswe make the very worst bargain we ever made in our liveswe lose our fare we lose our boat and we lose our libertyall loss and no profitfair very unfairtwo guineas worth of argument not worth twopence except on the quarterdeck of a manofwar jacob said tom to me pulling his wherry into the hard alongside of mine in which i was sitting with one of mr turnbulls books in my hand jacob do you recollect that my time is up tomorrow i shall have run off my seven years and when the sun rises i shall be free of the river how much more have you to serve about fifteen months as near as i can recollect tomboat sir yes oars my lad be smart for i am in a hurry hows tide down sir very soon but its now slack water tom see if you can find stapleton pooh never mind him jacob ill go with you i say jones tell old human natur to look after my boat continued tom addressing a waterman of our acquaintance i thought you had come up to see her said i to tom as we shoved off see her at jericho first replied tom shes worse than a dog vane what are you two again two indeedits all twowe are two fools she is too fanciful i am too fond she behaves too ill and i put up with too much however its all one i thought it was all two just now tom but two may be made one jacob you know yes by the parson but you are no parson anyhow i am something like one just now replied tom who was pulling the foremost oar for you are a good clerk and i am sitting behind you thats not so bad observed the gentleman in the sternsheets whom we had forgotten in the colloquy a waterman would make but a bad parson sir replied tom why so hes not likely to practice as he preaches again why so because all his life he looks one way and pulls another very goodvery good indeed nay sir good in practice but still not good in deedtheres a puzzle a puzzle indeed to find such a regular chain of repartee in a wherry well sir if im a regular chain today i shall be like an irregular watch tomorrow why so my lad because i shall be out of my time take that my lad said the gentleman tossing halfacrown to tom thanky sir when we meet again may you have no more wit than you have now how do you mean not wit enough to keep your money sirthats all i presume you think that i have not got much which sir wit or money wit my lad nay sir i think you have both the first you purchased just now and you would hardly have bought it if you had not money to spare but i mean wit of my own no man has wit of his own if he borrows it its not his own if he has it in himself its mother wit so its not his we pulled into the stairs near london bridge and the gentleman paid me his fare goodbye my lad said he to tom fareyouwell for well youve paid your fare replied tom holding out his arm to assist him out of the boat well jacob ive made more by my head than by my hands this morning i wonder in the long run which gains most in the world head tom depend upon it but they work best together here we were interruptedi say you watermen have you a mind for a good fare cried a darklooking not over clean squarebuilt short young man standing on the top of the flight of steps where to sir gravesend my jokers if you aint afraid of salt water thats a long way sir replied tom and for salt water we must have salt to our porridge so you shall my lads and a glass of grog into the bargain yes but the bargain ant made yet sir jacob will you go yes but not under a guinea not under two guineas replied tom aside are you in a great hurry sir continued he addressing the young man yes in a devil of a hurry i shall lose my ship what will you take me for two guineas sir very well just come up to the publichouse here and put in my traps we brought down his luggage put it into the wherry and started down the river with the tide our fare was very communicative and we found out that he was the masters mate of the immortalite fortygun frigate lying off gravesend which was to drop down next morning and wait for sailing orders at the downs we carried the tide with us and in the afternoon were close to the frigate whose blue ensign waved proudly over the taffrail there was a considerable sea arising from the wind meeting the tide and before we arrived close to her we had shipped a great deal of water and when we were alongside the wherry with the chest in her bows pitched so heavily that we were afraid of being swamped just as a rope had been made fast to the chest and they were weighing it out of the wherry the ships launch with water came alongside and whether from accident or wilfully i know not although i suspect the latter the midshipman who steered her shot her against the wherry which was crushed in and immediately filled leaving tom and me in the water and in danger of being jammed to death between the launch and the side of the frigate the seamen in the boat however forced her off with their oars and hauled us in while our wherry sank with her gunwale even with the waters edge and floated away astern as soon as we had shaken ourselves a little we went up the side and asked one of the officers to send a boat to pick up our wherry speak to the first lieutenantthere he is was the reply i went up to the person pointed out to me if you please sir what the devil do you want a boat sir to a boat the devil you do to pick up our wherry sir interrupted tom pick it up yourself said the first lieutenant passing us and hailing the men aloft maintop there hook on your stays be smart lower away the yards marines and afterguard clear launch boatswains mate here sir pipe marines and afterguard to clear launch aye aye sir but we shall lose our boat jacob said tom to me they stove it in and they ought to pick it up tom then went up to the masters mate which he had brought on board and explained our difficulty upon my soul i darnt say a word im in a scrape for breaking my leave why the devil didnt you take care of your wherry and haul ahead when you saw the launch coming how could we when the chest was hoisting out very true well i am very sorry for you but i must look after my chest so saying he disappeared down the gangway ladder ill try it again anyhow said tom going up to the first lieutenant hard case to lose our boat and our bread sir said tom touching his hat the first lieutenant now that the marines and afterguard were at a regular stamp and go had unfortunately more leisure to attend to us he looked at us earnestly and walked aft to see if the wherry was yet in sight at that moment up came the masters mate who had not yet reported himself to the first lieutenant tom said i there is a wherry close to let us get into it and go after our boat ourselves wait one moment to see if they will help usand get our money at all events replied tom and we both walked aft come on board sir said the masters mate touching his hat with humility youve broke your leave sir replied the first lieutenant and now ive to send a boat to pick up the wherry through your carelessness if you please they are two very fine young men observed the mate make capital foretopmen boats not worth sending for sir this hint given by the mate to the first lieutenant to regain his favour was not lost who are you my lads said the first lieutenant to us watermen sir watermen heh was that your own boat no sir replied i it belongs to the man that i serve with oh not your own boat are you an apprentice then yes sir both apprentices show me your indentures we dont carry them about with us then how am i to know that you are apprentices we can prove it sir if you wish it i do wish it at all events the captain will wish it will you please to send for the boat sir shes almost out of sight no my lads i cant find kings boats for such service then we had better go ourselves tom said i and we went forward to call the waterman who was lying on his oars close to the frigate stopstopnot so fast where are you going my lads to pick up our boat sir without my leave heh we dont belong to the frigate sir no but i think it very likely that you will for you have no protections we can send for them and have them down by tomorrow morning well you may do so if you please my lads but you can not expect me to believe everything that is told me now for instance how long have you to serve my lad said he addressing tom my time is up tomorrow sir up tomorrow why then i shall detain you until tomorrow and then i shall press you if you detain me now sir i am pressed today oh no you are only detained until you prove your apprenticeship thats all nay sir i certainly am pressed during my apprenticeship not at all and ill prove it to you you dont belong to the ship until you are victualled on her books now i shant victual you today and therefore you wont be pressed i shall be pressed with hunger at all events replied tom who never could lose a joke no you shant for ill send you both a good dinner out of the gunroom so you wont be pressed at all replied the lieutenant laughing at toms reply you will allow me to go sir at all events replied i for i knew that the only chance of getting tom and myself clear was my hastening to mr drummond for assistance pooh nonsense you must both row in the same boat as you have done the fact is my lads ive taken a great fancy to you both and i cant make up my mind to part with you its hard to lose our bread this way replied i we will find you bread and hard enough you will find it replied the lieutenant laughing its like a flint so we ask for bread and you give us a stone said tom thats gainst scripture very true my lad but the fact is all the scriptures in the world wont man the frigate men we must have and get them how we can and where we can and when we can necessity has no law at least it obliges us to break through all laws after all theres no great hardship in serving the king for a year or two and filling your pockets with prizemoney suppose you volunteer will you allow us to go on shore for halfanhour to think about it replied i no im afraid of the crimps dissuading you but ill give you till tomorrow morning and then i shall be sure of one at all events thanky for me replied tom youre very welcome replied the first lieutenant as laughing at us he went down the companionladder to his dinner well jacob we are in for it said tom as soon as we were alone depend upon it theres no mistake this time i am afraid not replied i unless we can get a letter to your father or mr drummond who i am sure would help us but that dirty fellow who gave the lieutenant the hint said the frigate sailed tomorrow morning there he is let us speak to him when does the frigate sail said tom to the masters mate who was walking the deck my good fellow its not the custom on board of a manofwar for men to ask officers to answer such impertinent questions its quite sufficient for you to know that when the frigate sails you will have the pleasure of sailing in her well sir replied i nettled at his answer at all events you will have the goodness to pay us our fare we have lost our wherry and our liberty perhaps through you we may as well have our two guineas two guineas its two guineas you want heh yes sir that was the fare we agreed upon why you must observe my men said the masters mate hooking a thumb into each armhole of his waistcoat there must be a little explanation as to that affair i promised you two guineas as watermen but now that you belong to a manofwar you are no longer watermen i always pay my debts honourably when i can find the lawful creditors but where are the watermen here we are sir no my lads you are menofwars men now and that quite alters the case but we are not so yet sir even if it did alter the case we are not pressed yet well then youll be tomorrow perhaps at all events we shall see if you are allowed to go on shore again i owe you two guineas as watermen and if you are detained as menofwars men why then you will only have done your duty in pulling down one of your officers you see my lads i say nothing but whats fair well sir but when you hired us we were watermen replied tom very true so you were but recollect the two guineas were not due until you had completed your task which was not until you came on board when you came on board you were pressed and became menofwars men you should have asked for your fare before the first lieutenant got hold of you dont you perceive the justice of my remarks cant say i do sir but i perceive theres very little chance of our being paid said tom you are a lad of discrimination replied the masters mate and now i advise you to drop the subject or you may induce me to pay you manofwar fashion hows that sir over the face and eyes as the cat paid the monkey replied the masters mate walking leisurely away no go tom said i smiling at the absurdity of the arguments im afraid its no go in every way jacob however i dont care much about it i have had a little hankering after seeing the world and perhaps nows as well as an other time but im sorry for you jacob its all my own fault replied i and i fell into one of those reveries so often indulged in of late as to the folly of my conduct in asserting my independence which had now ended in my losing my liberty but we were cold from the ducking we had received and moreover very hungry the first lieutenant did not forget his promise he sent us a good dinner and a glass of grog each which we discussed under the halfdeck between two of the guns we had some money in our pockets and we purchased some sheets of paper from the bumboat people who were on the maindeck supplying the seamen and i wrote to mr drummond and mr turnbull as well as to mary and old tom requesting the two latter to forward our clothes to deal in case of our being detained tom also wrote to comfort his mother and the greatest comfort which he could give was as he said to promise to keep sober having entrusted these letters to the bumboat woman who promised faithfully to put them into the postoffice we had then nothing else to do but to look out for some place to sleep our clothes had dried on us and we were walking under the halfdeck but not a soul spoke to or even took the least notice of us in a newlymanned ship just ready to sail there is a universal feeling of selfishness prevailing among the ships company some if not most had like us been pressed and their thoughts were occupied with their situation and the change in their prospects others were busy making their little arrangements with their wives or relations while the mass of the seamen not yet organised by discipline or known to each other were in a state of disunion and individuality which naturally induced every man to look after himself without caring for his neighbour we therefore could not expect nor did we receive any sympathy we were in a scene of bustle and noise yet alone a spare topsail which had been stowed for the present between two of the guns was the best accommodation which offered itself we took possession of it and tired with exertion of mind and body were soon fast asleep chapter thirty eight there are many ups and downs in this worldwe find ourselves in the downsour captain comes on board and gives us a short sermon upon antipathies which most of us never heard the like ofhe sets us all upon the go with his stop watch and never calls the watch until the watch is satisfied with all hands at daylight the next morning we were awakened with a start by the shrill whistles of the boatswain and his mates piping all hands to unmoor the pilot was on board and the wind was fair as the frigate had no anchor down but was hanging to the moorings in the river we had nothing to do but to cast off sheet home and in less than halfanhour we were under all sail stemming the last quarter of the flood tide tom and i had remained on the gangway watching the proceedings but not assisting when the ship being fairly under sail the order was given by the first lieutenant to coil down the ropes i think jacob we may as well help said tom laying hold of the main tack which was passed aft and hauling it forward with all my heart replied i and i hauled it forward while he coiled it away while we were thus employed the first lieutenant walked forward and recognised us thats what i like my lads said he you dont sulk i see and i shant forget it i hope you wont forget that we are apprentices sir and allow us to go on shore replied i ive a shocking bad memory in some things was his reply as he continued forward to the forecastle he did not however forget to victual us that day and insert our names in pencil upon the ships books but we were not put into any mess or stationed we anchored in the downs on the following morning it came on to blow hard in the afternoon and there was no communication with the shore except the signal was made third day when it moderated and the signal was made prepare to weigh and send boat for captain in the meantime several boats came off and one had a postman on board i had letters from mr drummond and mr turnbull telling me that they would immediately apply to the admiralty for our being liberated and one from mary half of which was for me and the rest to tom stapleton had taken toms wherry and pulled down to old tom beazeley with my clothes which with young toms had been despatched to deal tom had a letter from his mother half indited by his father and the rest from herself but i shall not trouble the reader with the contents as he may imagine what was likely to be said upon such an occasion shortly afterwards our clothes which had been sent to the care of an old shipmate of toms father were brought on board and we hardly had received them when the signalman reported that the captain was coming off there were so many of the men in the frigate who had never seen the captain that no little anxiety was shown by the ships company to ascertain how far by the cut of his jib that is his outward appearance they might draw conclusions as to what they might expect from one who had such unlimited power to make them happy or miserable i was looking out of the maindeck port with tom when the gig pulled alongside and was about to scrutinise the outward and visible signs of the captain when i was attracted by the face of a lieutenant sitting by his side whom i immediately recognised it was mr wilson the officer who had spun the oar and sunk the wherry from which as the reader may remember i rescued my friends the senior and junior clerk i was overjoyed at this as i hoped that he would interest himself in our favour the pipe of the boatswain reechoed as the captain ascended the side he appeared on the quarterdeckevery hat descending to do him honour the marines presented arms and the marine officer at their head lowered the point of his sword in return the omnipotent personage taking his cocked hat with two fingers and a thumb by the highest peak lifted it one inch off his head and replaced it desiring the marine officer to dismiss the guard i had now an opportunity as he paced to and fro with the first lieutenant to examine his appearance he was a tall very largeboned gaunt man with an enormous breadth of shoulders displaying herculean strength and this we found he eminently possessed his face was of a size corresponding to his large frame his features were harsh his eye piercing but his nose although bold was handsome and his capacious mouth was furnished with the most splendid row of large teeth that i ever beheld the character of his countenance was determination rather than severity when he smiled the expression was agreeable his gestures and his language were emphatic and the planks trembled with his elephantine walk he had been on board about ten minutes when he desired the first lieutenant to turn the hands up and all the men were ordered on the larboard side of the quarterdeck as soon as they were all gathered together looking with as much awe on the captain as a flock of sheep at a strange mischiefmeaning dog he thus addressed themmy lads as it so happens that we are all to trust to the same planks it may be just as well that we should understand one another i like to see my officers attentive to their duty and behave themselves as gentlemen i like to see my men well disciplined active and sober what i like i will haveyou understand me now continued he putting on a stern looknow just look in my face and see if you think you can play with me the men looked in his face and saw that there was no chance of playing with him and so they expressed by their countenances the captain appeared satisfied by their mute acknowledgments and to encourage them smiled and showed his white teeth as he desired the first lieutenant to pipe down as soon as the scene was over i walked up to mr wilson the lieutenant who was standing aft and accosted him perhaps sir you do not recollect me but we met one night when you were sinking in a wherry and you asked my name and i recollect it my lad it was faithful was it not yes sir and i then entered into an explanation of our circumstances and requested his advice and assistance he shook his head our captain said he is a very strange person he has commanding interest and will do more in defiance of the rules of the admiralty than any one in the service if an admiralty order came down to discharge you he would obey it but as for regulations he cares very little for them besides we sail in an hour however i will speak to him although i shall probably get a rap on the knuckles as it is the business of the first lieutenant and not mine but sir if you requested the first lieutenant to speak if i did he would not in all probability men are too valuable and the first lieutenant knows that the captain would not like to discharge you he will therefore say nothing until it is too late and then throw all the blame upon himself for forgetting it our captain has such interest that his recommendation would give a commanders rank tomorrow and we must all take care of ourselves however i will try although i can give you very little hopes mr wilson went up to the captain who was still walking with the first lieutenant and touching his hat introduced the subject stating as an apology that he was acquainted with me oh if the man is an acquaintance of yours mr wilson we certainly must decide replied the captain with mock politeness where is he i advanced and tom followed me we stated our case i always like to put people out of suspense said the captain because it unsettles a manso now hear me if i happened to press one of the bloodroyal and the king and the queen and all the little princesses were to go down on their knees id keep him without an admiralty order for his discharge now my lads do you perceive your chance then turning away to mr wilson he said you will oblige me by stating upon what grounds you ventured to interfere in behalf of these men and i trust your explanation will be satisfactory mr knight continued he to the first lieutenant send these men down below watch and station them we went below by the gangway ladder and watched the conference between the captain and mr wilson who we were afraid had done himself no good by trying to assist us but when it was over the captain appeared pleased and mr wilson walked away with a satisfied air as i afterwards discovered it did me no little good the hands were piped to dinner and after dinner we weighed and made sail and thus were tom and i fairly or rather unfairly embarked in his majestys service well tom said i its no use crying whats done cant be helped here we are now let us do all we can to make friends thats just my opinion jacob hang care it killed the cat i shall make the best of it and i dont see why we may not be as happy here as anywhere else father says we may if we do our duty and i dont mean to shirk mine the more the merrier they say and ill be hanged but theres not enough of us here i hardly need say that for the first three or four days we were not very comfortable we had been put into the seventh mess and were stationed in the foretop for although we had not been regularly bred up as seaman the first lieutenant so decided saying that he was sure that in a few weeks there would be no smarter men in the ship we were soon clear of the channel and all hands were anxious to know our destination which in this almost solitary instance had been really kept a secret although surmises were correct there is one point which by the present arrangements invariably makes known whether a ship is fitting foreign or for home service which is by the stores and provisions ordered on board and these stores are so arranged according to the station to which the vessel is bound that it is generally pretty well known what her destination is to be this is bad and at the same time easily remedied for if every ship whether for home service or foreign was ordered to fit foreign no one would be able to ascertain where she was about to proceed with a very little trouble strict secrecy might be preserved now that the navy board is abolished but during its existence that was impossible the immortalite was a very fast sailing vessel and when the captain whose name i have forgotten to mention it was hector maclean opened his sealed orders we found that we were to cruise for two months between the western isles and madeira in quest of some privateers which had captured many of our outwardbound west indiamen notwithstanding they were well protected by convoy and after that period to join the admiral at halifax and relieve a frigate which had been many years on that station in a week we were on our station the weather was fine and the whole of the day was passed in training the men to the guns small arms making and shortening sail reefing topsails and manoeuvring the ship the captain would never give up his point and sometimes we were obliged to make or shorten sail twenty times running until he was satisfied my lads he would say to the ships company sending for them aft you have done this pretty well you have only been two minutes not bad for a new ships company but i like it done in a minute and ahalf well try again and sure enough it was try again until in a minute and ahalf it was accomplished then the captain would say i knew you could do it and having once done it my lads of course you can do it again tom and i adhered to our good resolutions we were as active and as forward as we could be and mr knight the first lieutenant pointed us out to the captain as soon as the merits of the different men were ascertained several alterations were made in the watch and station bills as well as in the ratings on the ships books and tom and i were made second captains larboard and starboard of the foretop this was great promotion for so young hands especially as we were not bred as regular sailors but it was for the activity and zeal which we displayed tom was a great favourite among the men always joking and ready for any lark or nonsense moreover he used to mimic the captain which few others dared do he certainly seldom ventured to do it below it was generally in the foretop where he used to explain to the men what he liked one day we both ventured it but it was on an occasion which excused it tom and i were aft sitting in the jolly boat astern fitting some of her gear for we belonged to the boat at that time although we were afterwards shifted into the cutter the frigate was going about four knots through the water and the sea was pretty smooth one of the marines fell overboard out of the forechains man overboard was cried out immediately and the men became very busy clearing away the starboard cutter with all the expedition requisite on such an occasion the captain was standing aft on the signal chest when the marine passed astern the poor fellow could not swim and tom turning to me said jacob i should like to save that jolly and immediately dashed overboard and i should like to help you tom cried i following him the captain was close to us and heard us both between us we easily held up the marine and the boat had us all on board in less than a minute when we came on deck the captain was at the gangway he showed his white teeth and shook the telescope in his hand at us i heard you both and i should like to have a good many more impudent fellows like you we continued our cruise looking sharp out for the privateers but without success we then touched at madeira for intelligence and were informed that they had been seen more to the southward the frigates head was turned in that direction until we were abreast of the canary isles and then we traversed east and west north or south just as the wind and weather or the captains like thought proper we had now cruised seven weeks out of our time without success and the captain promised five guineas to the man who should discover the objects of our search often did tom and i climb to the masthead and scan the horizon and so did many others but those who were stationed at the lookout were equally on the alert the ships company were now in a very fair state of discipline owing to the incessant practice and every evening the hands were turned up to skylarkthat is to play and amuse themselves there was one amusement which was the occasion of a great deal of mirth and it was a favourite one of the captains as it made the men smart it is called follow my leader one of the men leads and all who choose follow him sometimes forty or fifty will join whatever the leader does the rest must do also wherever he goes they must follow tom who was always the foremost for fun was one day the leader and after having scampered up the rigging laid out on the yards climbed in by the lifts crossed from mast to mast by the stays slid down by the backstays blacked his face in the funnel in all which motions he was followed by about thirty others hallooing and laughing while the officers and other men were looking on and admiring their agility a novel idea came into toms head it was then about seven oclock in the evening the ship was lying becalmed tom again sprang up the rigging laid out to the main yardarm followed by me and the rest and as soon as he was at the boom iron he sprang up holding by the lift and crying out follow my leader leaped from the yardarm into the sea i was second and crying out follow my leader to the rest i followed him and the others whether they could swim or not did the same it being a point of honour not to refuse the captain was just coming up the ladder when he saw as he imagined a man tumble overboard which was tom in his descent but how much more was he astonished at seeing twenty or thirty more tumbling off by twos or threes until it appeared that half the ships company were overboard some of the men who could not swim but were too proud to refuse to follow were nearly drowned as it was the first lieutenant was obliged to lower the cutter to pick them up and they were all brought on board confound that fellow said the captain to the first lieutenant he is always at the head of all mischief follow my leader indeed send tom beazeley here we all thought that tom was about to catch it hark ye my lad said the captain a jokes a joke but everybody cant swim as well as you i cant afford to lose any of my men by your pranks so dont try that againi dont like it every one thought that tom got off very cheaply but he was a favourite with the captain although that never appeared but indirectly beg pardon sir replied tom with great apparent humility but they were all so dirtytheyd blacked themselves at the funnel and i thought a little washing would not do them any harm be off sir and recollect what i have said replied the captain turning away and showing his white teeth i heard the first lieutenant say to the captain hes worth any ten men in the ship sir he keeps them all alive and merry sets such a good example chapter thirty nine to be or not to be that is the questionsplinters on board of a manofwar very different from splinters in the finger on shoretom prevents this narrative from being wound up by my going downi receive a lawyers letter and instead of being annoyed am delighted with it in the meantime tom had gone up to the foreroyal arm and was looking round for the five guineas and just as the conversation was going on cried out sail ho strange sail reported where cried the first lieutenant going forward right under the sun masthead theredo you make her out yes sir i think shes a schooner but i can only see down to her mainyard thats one of them depend upon it said the captain up there mr wilson and see what you make of her who is the man who reported it tom beazeley sir confound that fellow he makes all my ships company jump overboard and now i must give him five guineas what do you make of her mr wilson a low schooner sir very rakish indeed black sides i cannot make out her ports but i should think she can show a very pretty set of teeth she is becalmed as well as we well then we must whistle for a breeze in the meantime mr knight we will have the boats all ready if you whistle long enough the wind is certain to come in about an hour the breeze did come and we took it down with us but it was too dark to distinguish the schooner which we had lost sight of as soon as the sun had set about midnight the breeze failed us and it was again calm the captain and most of the officers were up all night and the watch were employed preparing the boats for service it was my morning watch and at break of day i saw the schooner from the foresailyard about four miles to the north west i ran down on deck and reported her very good my lad i have her mr knight said the captain who had directed his glass to where i pointed and i will have her too one way or the other no signs of wind lower down the cutters get the yards and stays hooked all ready well wait a little and see a little more of her when its broad daylight at broad daylight the schooner with her appointments was distinctly to be made out she was pierced for sixteen guns and was a formidable vessel to encounter with the boats the calm still continuing the launch yawl and pinnace were hoisted out manned and armed the schooner got out her sweeps and was evidently preparing for their reception still the captain appeared unwilling to risk the lives of his men in such a dangerous conflict and there we all lay alongside each man sitting in his place with his oar raised on end catspaws of wind as they call them flew across the water here and there ruffling its smooth surface portending that a breeze would soon spring up and the hopes of this chance rendered the captain undecided thus did we remain alongside for tom and i were stationed in the first and second cutters until twelve oclock when we were ordered out to take a hasty dinner and the allowance of spirits was served out at one it was still calm had we started when the boats were first hoisted out the affair would have been long before decided at last the captain perceiving that the chance of a breeze was still smaller then than in the forenoon ordered the boats to shove off we were still about the same distance from the privateer from threeandahalf to four miles in less than halfanhour we were within gunshot the privateer swept her broadside to us and commenced firing guns with single round shot and with great precision they ricochetted over the boats and at every shot we made sure of our being struck at this time a slight breeze swept along the water it reached the schooner filled her sails and she increased her distance again it died away and we neared her fast she swept round again and recommenced firing and one of her shot passed through the second cutter in which i was stationed ripping open three of her planks and wounding two men beside me the boat heavy with the gun ammunition chests etcetera immediately filled and turned over with us and it was with difficulty that we could escape from the weighty hamper that was poured out of her one of the poor fellows who had not been wounded remained entangled under the boat and never rose again the remainder of the crew rose to the surface and clung to the side of the boat the first cutter hauled to our assistance for we had separated to render the shot less effectual but it was three or four minutes before she was able to render us any assistance during which time the other two wounded men who had been apparently injured in the legs or body exhausted with loss of blood gradually unloosed their holds and disappeared under the calm blue water i had received a splinter in my left arm and held on longer than the others who had been maimed but i could not hold on till the cutter came i lost my recollection and sank tom who was in the bow of the cutter perceiving me go down dived after me brought me up again to the surface and we were both hauled in the other five men were also saved as soon as we were picked up the cutter followed the other boats which continued to advance towards the privateer i recovered my senses and found that a piece of one of the thwarts of the boat broken off by the shot had been forced through the fleshy part of my arm below the elbow where it still remained it was a very dangerous as well as a painful wound the officer of the boat without asking me laid hold of the splinter and tore it out but the pain was so great from its jagged form and the effusion of blood so excessive after this operation that i again fainted fortunately no artery was wounded or i must have lost my arm they bound it up and laid me at the bottom of the boat the firing from the schooner was now very warm and we were within a quarter of a mile of her when the breeze sprang up and she increased her distance a mile there was a prospect of wind from the appearance of the sky although for a time it again died away we were within less than halfamile of the privateer when we perceived that the frigate was bringing up a smart breeze and rapidly approached the scene of conflict the breeze swept along the water and caught the sails of the privateer and she was again in spite of all the exertions of our wearied men out of gunshot and the first lieutenant very properly decided upon making for the frigate which was now within a mile of us in less than ten minutes the boats were hoisted in and the wind now rising fast we were under all sail going at the rate of seven miles an hour the privateer having also gained the breeze and gallantly holding her own i was taken down into the cockpit the only wounded man brought on board the surgeon examined my arm and at first shook his head and i expected immediate amputation but on reexamination he gave his opinion that the limb might be saved my wound was dressed and i was put into my hammock in a screened bulk under the halfdeck where the cooling breeze from the ports fanned my feverish cheeks but i must return to the chase in less than an hour the wind had increased so that we could with difficulty carry our royals the privateer was holding her own about three miles right ahead keeping our three masts in one at sunset they were forced to take in the royals and the sky gave every prospect of a rough gale still we carried on every stitch of canvas which the frigate could bear keeping the chase in sight with our nightglasses and watching all her motions the breeze increased before morning there was a heavy sea and the frigate could only carry topgallant sails over doublereefed topsails at daylight we had neared the schooner by the sextants about a quarter of a mile and the captain and officers went down to take some repose and refreshment not having quitted the deck for twentyfour hours all that day did we chase the privateer without gaining more than a mile upon her and it now blew up a furious gale the topgallant sails had been before taken in the topsails were close reefed and we were running at the speed of nearly twelve miles an hour still so well did the privateer sail that she was barely within gunshot when the sun went down below the horizon angry and fiery red there was now great fear that she would escape from the difficulty of keeping the glasses upon her during the night in a heavy sea and the expectation that she would furl all sail and allow us to pass her it appeared however that this manoeuvre did not enter into the head of the captain of the privateer he stood on under a press of sail which even in daytime would have been considered alarming and at daylight owing to the steerage during the night never being so correct as during the day she had recovered her distance and was about four miles from us the gale if anything had increased and captain maclean determined notwithstanding to shake a reef out of the topsails in the morning as usual tom came to my cot and asked me how i was i told him i was better and in less pain and that the surgeon had promised to dress my wound after breakfast for the bandages had not been removed since i had first come on board and the privateer tom i hope we shall take her it will be some comfort to me that she is captured i think we shall if the masts stand jacob but we have an enormous press of sail as you may guess by the way in which the frigate jumps there is no standing on the forecastle and there is a regular waterfall down in the waist from forward we are nearing her now it is beautiful to see how she behaves when she heels over we can perceive that all her men are lashed on deck and she takes whole seas into her fore and aft mainsail and pours them out again as she rises from the lurch she deserves to escape at all events she did not however obtain her deserts for about twelve oclock in the day we were within a mile of her at two the marines were firing small arms at her for we would not yaw to fire at her a gun although she was right under our bows when within a cables length we shortened sail so as to keep at that distance astern and the chase after having lost several men by musketry the captain of her waved his hat in token of surrender we immediately shortened sail to keep the weathergage pelting her until every sail was lowered down we then rounded to keeping her under our lee and firing at every man who made his appearance on deck taking possession of her was a difficult task a boat could hardly live in such a sea and when the captain called aloud for volunteers and i heard toms voice in the cutter as it was lowering down my heart misgave me lest he should meet with some accident at last i knew from the conversation on deck that the cutter had got safe on board and my mind was relieved the surgeon came up and dressed my arm and i then received comparative bodily as well as mental relief it was not until the next day when we lay to with the schooner close to us that the weather became sufficiently moderate to enable us to receive the prisoners and put our own men and officers on board the prize proved to be an americanbuilt schooner fitted out as a french privateer she was called the cerf agile mounting fourteen guns of nearly three hundred tons measurement and with a crew of one hundred and seventy men of which fortyeight were away in prizes it was perhaps fortunate that the boats were not able to attack her as they would have received a very warm reception thus did we succeed in capturing this mischievous vessel after a chase of two hundred and seventy miles as soon as all the arrangements were made we shaped our course with the privateer in company for halifax where we arrived in about five weeks my wound was now nearly healed but my arm had wasted away and i was unable to return to my duty it was well known that i wrote a good hand and i volunteered as i could do nothing else to assist the purser and the clerk with the ships books etcetera the admiral was at bermuda and the frigate which we were to relieve had from the exigence of the service been despatched down to the honduras and was not expected back for some months we sailed from halifax to bermuda and joined the admiral and after three weeks we were ordered on a cruise my arm was now perfectly recovered but i had become so useful in the clerks office that i was retained much against my own wishes but the captain liked it as tom said and after that there was no more said about the matter america was not the seat of war at that period and with the exception of chasing french runners there was nothing to be done on the north american station i have therefore little to narrate during the remainder of the time that i was on board the frigate tom did his duty in the foretop and never was in any disgrace on the contrary he was a great favourite both with officers and men and took more liberties with the captain than any one else dared to have done but captain maclean knew that tom was one of his foremost and best men always active zealous and indifferent as to danger and tom knew exactly how far he could venture to play with him i remained in the clerks office and as it was soon discovered that i had received an excellent education and always behaved myself respectfully to my superiors i was kindly treated and had no reason to complain of a manofwar such was the state of affairs when the other frigate arrived from the honduras and we who had been cruising for the last four months in boston bay were ordered in by a cutter to join the admiral at halifax we had now been nearly a year from england without receiving any letters the reader may therefore judge of my impatience when after the anchor had been let go and the sails furled the admirals boat came on board with several bags of letters for the officers and ships company they were handed down into the gunroom and i waited with impatience for the sorting and distribution faithful said the purser here are two letters for you i thanked him and hastened into the clerks office that i might read them without interruption the first was addressed in a formal hand quite unknown to me i opened it with some degree of wonderment as to who could possibly write to so humble an individual it was from a lawyer and the contents were as follows sirwe hasten to advise you of the death of your good friend mr alexander turnbull by his will which has been opened and read and of which you are the executor he has made you his sole heir bequeathing you at the present the sum of pounds with the remainder of his fortune at the demise of his wife with the exception of pounds left to mrs turnbull for her own disposal the legacies do not amount to more than pounds the jointure arising from the interest of the money secured to mrs turnbull during her life is pounds per annum upon the three per cent consols so that at her demise you will come into pounds consols which at will be equal to pounds sterling i beg to congratulate you upon your good fortune and with mr drummond have made application to the admiralty for your discharge this application i am happy to say has been immediately attended to and by the same mail that conveys this letter is forwarded an order for your discharge and a passage home should you think proper to treat our firm as your legal advisers we shall be most happy to enrol you among our clients i am sir yours very respectfully john fletcher i must leave the reader to judge of this unexpected and welcome communication at first i was so stunned that i appeared as a statue with the letter in my hand and in this condition i remained until roused by the first lieutenant who had come to the office to desire me to pass the word for letters for england and to desire the sailmaker to make a bag faithfulwhy whats the matter are you ill or i could not reply but i put the letter into his hand he read the contents expressed his astonishment by occasional exclamations i wish you joy my lad and may it be my turn next time no wonder you looked like a stuck pig had i received such news the captain might have hallooed till he was hoarse and the ship might have tumbled overboard before i should have roused myself well i suppose we shall get no more work out of you the captain wants you mr knight said one of the midshipmen touching his hat mr knight went into the cabin and in a few minutes returned holding the order for my discharge in his hand its all right faithful here is your discharge and an order for your passage home he laid it on the table and then went away for a first lieutenant in harbour has no time to lose the next person who came was tom holding in his hand a letter from mary with a postscript from his mother well jacob said he i have news to tell you mary says that mr turnbull is dead and has left her father pounds and that she has been told that he has left you something handsome he has indeed tom replied i read this letter while tom was reading i perceived the letter from mr drummond which i had forgotten i opened it it communicated the same intelligence as that of the lawyer in fewer words recommended my immediate return and enclosed a bill upon his house for pounds to enable me to appear in a manner corresponding to my present condition well said tom this is indeed good news jacob you are a gentleman at last as you deserve to be it has made me so happy what do you mean to do i have my discharge here replied i and am ordered a passage home better still i am so happy jacob so happy but what is to become of me and tom passed the back of his hand across his eyes to brush away a tear you shall soon follow me tom if i can manage it either by money or any influence i will manage it if you dont jacob i wont stay here without you that i am determined do nothing rashly tom i am sure i can buy your discharge and on my arrival in england i will not think of anything else until it is done you must be quick then jacob for im sure i cant stay here long trust to me tom youll still find me jacob faithful said i extending my hand tom squeezed it earnestly and with moistened eyes turned away and walked forward the news had spread through the ship and many of the officers as well as the men came to congratulate me what would i have given to have been allowed only one halfhour to myselfone halfhour in which i might be permitted to compose my excited feelingsto have returned thanks for such unexpected happiness and paid a tribute to the memory of so sincere a friend but in a ship this is almost impossible unless as an officer you can retreat to your own cabin and those gushings from the heart arising from grief or pleasure the tears so sweet in solitude must be prostituted before the crowd or altogether repressed at last the wishedfor opportunity did come mr wilson who had been away on service came to congratulate me as soon as he heard the news and with an instinctive perception of what might be my feelings asked me whether i would not like to write my letters in his cabin which for a few hours was at my service i thankfully accepted the offer and when summoned by the captain had relieved my overcharged heart and had composed my excited feelings jacob faithful you are aware there is an order for your discharge said he kindly you will be discharged this afternoon into the astrea she is ordered home and will sail with despatches in a few days you have conducted yourself well since you have been under my command and although you are now in a situation not to require a good certificate still you will have the satisfaction of feeling that you have done your duty in the station of life to which you have for a certain portion of it been calledi wish you well although captain maclean in what he said never lost sight of the relative situations in which we had been placed there was a kindness of manner especially in the last words i wish you well which went to my heart i replied that i had been very happy during the time i had been under his command and thanked him for his good wishes i then bowed and left the cabin but the captain did not send me on board the astrea although i was discharged into her he told the first lieutenant that i had better go on shore and equip myself in a proper manner and as i afterwards found out spoke of me in very favourable terms to the captain of the astrea acknowledging that i had received the education of a gentleman and had been illegally impressed so that when i made my appearance on board the astrea the officers of the gunroom requested that i would mess with them during the passage home i went on shore obtained the money for my bill hastened to a tailor and with his exertions and other fittingout people procured all that was requisite for the outward appearance of a gentleman i then returned to the immortalite and bade farewell to the officers and seamen with whom i had been most intimate my parting with tom was painful even the few days which i had been away i perceived had made an alteration in his appearance jacob said he dont think i envy you on the contrary i am as grateful even more grateful than if such good fortune had fallen to my own lot but i cannot help fretting at the thought of being left here without you and i shall fret until i am with you again i renewed my promises to procure his discharge and forcing upon him all the money i thought that i could spare i went over the side as much affected as poor tom our passage home was rapid we had a continuance of north west winds and we flew before them and in less than three weeks we dropped our anchor at spithead happy in the change of my situation and happier still in anticipation i shall only say that i never was in better spirits or in company with more agreeable young men than were the officers of the astrea and although we were so short a time together we separated with mutual regret chapter forty i interrupt a matrimonial duet and capsize the boatbeing upon dry land no one is drownedtom leaves a manofwar because he dont like iti find the profession of a gentleman preferable to that of a waterman my first object on my return was to call upon old tom and assure him of his sons welfare my wishes certainly would have led me to mr drummonds but i felt that my duty required that i should delay that pleasure i arrived at the hotel late in the evening and early next morning i went down to the steps at westminster bridge and was saluted with the usual cry of boat sir a crowd of recollections poured into my mind at the wellknown sound my life appeared to have passed in review in a few seconds as i took my seat in the stern of a wherry and directed the waterman to pull up the river it was a beautiful morning and even at that early hour almost too warmthe sun was so powerful i watched every object that we passed with an interest i cannot describe every tree every building every point of landthey were all old friends who appeared as the sun shone brightly on them to rejoice in my good fortune i remained in a reverie too delightful to be wished to be disturbed from it although occasionally there were reminiscences which were painful but they were but as light clouds obscuring for a moment as they flew past the glorious sun of my happiness at last the wellknown tenement of old tom his large board with boats built to order and the half of the boat stuck up on end caught my sight and i remembered the object of my embarkation i directed the waterman to pull to the hard and paying him well dismissed him for i had perceived that old tom was at work stumping round a wherry bottom up and his wife was sitting on a bench in the boatarbour basking in the warm sun and working away at her nets i had landed so quietly and they both were so occupied with their respective employments that they had not perceived me and i crept round by the house to surprise them i had gained a station behind the old boat where i overheard the conversation its my opinion said old tom who left off hammering for a time that all the nails in birmingham wont make this boat watertight the timbers are as rotten as a pear and the nails fall through them i have put in one piece more than agreed for and if i dont put in another here shell never swim well then put another piece in replied mrs beazeley yes so i will but ive a notion i shall be out of pocket by this job sevenandsixpence wont pay for labour and all however never mind and tom carolled forth is not the sea made for the free land for courts and chains alone there we are slaves but on the waves love and libertys all our own now if you do sing sing truth beazeley said the old woman ant our boy pressed into the service and how can you talk of liberty old tom answered by continuing his song no eye to watch and no tongue to wound us all earth forgot and all heaven around us yes yes replied the old woman no eye to watch indeed he may be in sickness and in sorrow he may be wounded or dying of a fever and theres no mothers eye to watch over him as to all the earth being forgot i wont believe that tom has forgotten his mother old tom replied seasons may roll but the true soul burns the same wherever it goes so it does tomso it does and hes thinking this moment of his father and mother i do verily believe and he loves us more than ever so i believe replied old tomthat is if he hasnt anything better to do but theres a time for all things and when a man is doing his duty as a seaman he mustnt let his thoughts wander never fear old woman hell be back again theres a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft to take care of the life of poor jack god grant it god grant it replied the old woman wiping her eyes with her apron and then resuming her netting he seems continued she by his letters to be overfond of that girl mary stapletonand i sometimes think that she cares not a little for him but shes never of one mind long i didnt like to see her flaunting and flirting so with the soldiers and at the same time tom says that she writes that she cares for nobody but him women arewomen thats sartin replied old tom musing for a time and then showing that his thoughts were running on his son by bursting out mary when yonder boundless sea shall part us and perchance for ever think not my heart can stray from thee or cease to mourn thine absencenever and when in distant climes i roam forlorn unfriended brokenhearted dont say so tomdont say so interrupted the old woman tom continued oft shall i sigh for thee and home and all those joys from which i parted aye so he does poor fellow ill be bound to say what would i give to see his dear smiling face said mrs beazeley and id give no little missus myself but still its the duty for every man to serve his country and so ought tom as his father did before him i shall be glad to see him back but im not sorry that hes gone our ships must be manned old woman and if they take men by force its only because they wont volunteerthats all when theyre once on board they dont mind it you women require pressing just as much as the men and its all much of a muchness hows that tom why when we make love and ask you to marry dont you always pout and say no you like being kissed but we must take it by force so it is with manning a ship the men all say no but when they are once there they like the service very muchonly you see like you they want pressing dont tom write and say that hes quite happy and dont care where he is so long as hes with jacob yes thats true but they say jacob is to be discharged and come home now that hes come to a fortune and what will tom say then why that is the worst of it i believe that jacobs heart is in the right place but still riches spoil a man but we shall see if jacob dont prove true blue ill never put faith in man again but there be changes in this world thats sartin we all have our taste of the ups and the downs as fortune dispenses her smiles and her frowns but may we not hope if shes frowning today that tomorrow shell lend us the light of her ray i only wish jacob was herethats all then you have your wish my good old friend cried i running up to tom and seizing his hand but old tom was so taken by surprise that he started back and lost his equilibrium dragging me after him and we rolled on the turf together nor was this the only accident for old mrs beazeley was so alarmed that she also sprang from the bench fixed in the half of the old boat stuck on end and threw herself back against it the boat rotten when first put up and with the disadvantage of exposure to the elements for many years could no longer stand such pressure it gave way to the sudden force applied by the old woman and she and the boat went down together she screaming and scuffling among the rotten planks which now after so many years close intimacy were induced to part company i was first on my legs and ran to the assistance of mrs beazeley who was half smothered with dust and flakes of dry pitch and old tom coming to my assistance we put the old woman on her legs again o deary me cried the old womano deary me i do believe my hip is out lord mr jacob how you frightened me yes said old tom shaking me warmly by the hand we were all taken aback old boat and all what a shindy you have made bowling us all down like ninepins well my boy im glad to see you and notwithstanding your gear youre jacob faithful still i hope so replied i and we then adjourned to the house where i made them acquainted with all that had passed and what i intended to do relative to obtaining toms discharge i then left them promising to return soon and hailing a wherry going up the river proceeded to my old friend the dominie of whose welfare as well as stapletons and marys i had been already assured but as i passed through putney bridge i thought i might as well call first upon old stapleton and i desired the waterman to pull in i hastened to stapletons lodgings and went upstairs where i found mary in earnest conversation with a very goodlooking young man in a sergeants uniform of the rd regiment mary who was even handsomer than when i had left her starting up at first did not appear to recognise me then coloured up to the forehead as she welcomed me with a constraint i had never witnessed before the sergeant appeared inclined to keep his ground but on my taking her hand and telling her that i brought a message from a person whom i trusted she had not forgotten he gave her a nod and walked downstairs perhaps there was a severity in my countenance as i said mary i do not know whether after what i have seen i ought to give the message and the pleasure i anticipated in meeting you again is destroyed by what i have now witnessed how disgraceful is it thus to play with a mans feelingsto write to him assuring him of your regard and constancy and at the same time encouraging another mary hung down her head if i have done wrong mr faithful said she after a pause i have not wronged tom what i have written i felt if that is the case why do you wrong another person why encourage another young man only to make him unhappy i have promised him nothing but why does not tom come back and look after me i cant mope here by myself i have no one to keep company with my father is always away at the alehouse and i must have somebody to talk to besides tom is away and may be away a long while and absence cures love in men although it does not in women it appears then mary that you wish to have two strings to your bow in case of accident should the first string break a second would be very acceptable replied mary but it is always this way continued she with increasing warmth i never can be in a situation which is not right whenever i do anything which may appear improper so certain do you make your appearance when least expected and least wished foras if you were born to be my constant accuser does not your own conscience accuse you mary mr faithful repeated she very warmly you are not my father confessor but do as you pleasewrite to tom if you please and tell him all you have seen and anything you may thinkmake him and make me miserable and unhappydo it i pray it will be a friendly act and as you are now a great man you may persuade tom that i am a jilt and a goodfornothing here mary laid her hands on the table and buried her face in them i did not come here to be your censor mary you are certainly at liberty to act as you please without my having any right to interfere but as tom is my earliest and best friend so far as his interests and happiness are concerned i shall carefully watch over them we have been so long together and i am so well acquainted with all his feelings that i really believe that if ever there was a young man sincerely and devotedly attached to a woman he is so to you and i will add that if ever there was a young man who deserved love in return it is tom when i left not a month back he desired me to call upon you as soon as i could and assure you of his unalterable attachment and i am now about to procure his discharge that he may be able to return all his thoughts are upon this point and he is now waiting with the utmost impatience the arrival of it that he may again be in your company you can best judge whether his return will or will not be a source of happiness mary raised her headher face was wet with tears then he will soon be back again and i shall see him indeed his return will be no source of unhappiness if i can make him happy indeed it shall not mr faithful but pray dont tell him of my foolish conduct pray dontwhy make him unhappyi entreat you not to do it i will not do so again promise me jacob will you continued mary taking me by the arm and looking beseechingly in my face mary i will never be a mischiefmaker but recollect i exact the performance of your promise oh and i will keep it now that i know he will soon be home i can i think i canim sure i can wait a month or two without flirting but i do wish that i was not left so much alone i wish tom was at home to take care of me for there is no one else i cant take care of myself i saw by marys countenance that she was in earnest and i therefore made friends with her and we conversed for two hours chiefly about tom when i left her she had recovered her usual spirits and said at parting looking archly at me now you will see how wise and prudent i shall be i shook my head and left her that i might find out my old friend stapleton who as usual was at the door of the publichouse smoking his pipe at first he did not recognise me for when i accosted him he put his open hand to his ear as usual and desired me to speak a little louder but i answered nonsense stapleton that wont do with me he then took his pipe out of his mouth and looked me full in the face jacob as im alive didnt know you in your long togsthought you was a gentleman wanting a boat well i hardly need say how glad i am to see you after so long thats no more than human natur and hows tom have you seen mary these two questions enabled me to introduce the subject that i wished i told him of the attachment and troth pledged between the two and how wrong it was for him to leave her so much alone the old man agreed with me and said that as to talking to the men that was on marys part nothing but human natur and that as for tom wishing to be at home and seeing her again that also was nothing but human natur but that he would smoke his pipe at home in future and keep the soldiers out of the house satisfied with this assurance i left him and taking another wherry went up to brentford to see the dominie chapter forty one all the little boys are let loose and the dominie is caughtanxious to supply my teeth he falls in with other teeth and mrs bately also shows her teethgin outside gin in and gin out again and old woman out alsodominie in for it againmore like a whig ministry than a novel i found the worthy old dominie in the schoolroom seated at his elevated desk the usher not present and the boys making a din enough to have awaked a person from a trance that he was in one of his deep reveries and that the boys had taken advantage of it was evident mr dobbs said i walking close up to the desk but the dominie answered not i repeated his name in a louder voice cosine of x plus ab minus z minus a half such must be the result said the dominie talking to himself yet it doth not prove correct i may be in error let me revise my work and the dominie lifted up his desk to take out another piece of paper when the desk lid was raised i removed his work and held it behind me but how is this exclaimed the dominie and he looked everywhere for his previous calculations nay continued he it must have been the wind and then he cast his eyes about until they fixed upon me laughing at him eheu what do my eyes perceiveit isyet it is notyes most truly it is my son jacob welcome most welcome cried the old man descending from his desk and clasping me in his arms long is it since i have seen thee my son interea magnum sol circumvolvitur annum long yes long have i yearned for thy return fearful lest nudus ignota arena thou mightest like another palinurus have been cast away thou art returned and all is well as the father said in the scripture i have found my son which i had lost but no prodigal thou though i use the quotation as apt now all is well thou hast escaped the danger of the battle the fire and the wreck and now thou mayest hang up thy wet garment as a votive offering as horace hath it uvida suspendisse potenti vestimenta maris deo during the apostrophe of the dominie the boys perceiving that he was no longer wrapped up in his algebra had partly settled to their desks and in their apparent attention to their lessons reminded me of the humming of bees before a hive on a summers day boys cried the dominie nunc est ludendum verily ye shall have a holiday put up your books and depart in peace the books were hastily put up in obedience to the command the depart in peace was not so rigidly adhered tothey gave a loud shout and in a few seconds the dominie and i stood alone in the schoolroom come jacob let us adjourn to my sanctum there may we commune without interruption thou shalt tell me thine adventures and i will communicate to thee what hath been made known to me relative to those with whom thou wert acquainted first let me beg you to give me something to eat for i am not a little hungry interrupted i as we gained the kitchen verily shalt thou have all that we possess jacob yet now i think that will not be much seeing that i and our worthy matron did pick the bones of a shoulder of mutton this having been our fourth day of repast upon it she is out yet i will venture to intrude into the privacy of her cupboard for thy sake peradventure she may be wroth yet will i risk her displeasure so saying the old dominie opened the cupboard and one by one handed to me the dishes with their contents here jacob are two hard dumplings from yesterday canst thou relish cold hard dumplingsbut stop here is something more savouryhalf of a cold cabbage which was left this day we will look again here is meatyes it is meat but now do i perceive it is a piece of lights reserved for the dinner of the cat tomorrow i am fearful that we must not venture upon that for the dame will be wroth pray put it back sir i would not interfere with puss on any account nay then jacob i see naught else unless there may be viands on the upper shelf sir here is bread the staff of life and also a fragment of cheese and now methinks i discern something dark at the back of the shelf the dominie extended his hand and immediately withdrew it jumping from his chair with a loud cry he had put his fingers into a rat gin set by the old woman for those intruders and he held up his arm and stamped as he shouted out with the pain i hastened to him and pressing down the spring released his fingers from the teeth which however had drawn blood as well as bruised him fortunately like most of the articles of their menage the trap was a very old one and he was not much hurt the dominie thrust his fingers into his capacious mouth and held them there some time without speaking he began to feel a little ease when in came the matron why whats all this said she in a querulous tone jacob here and all my cupboard on the table jacob how dare you go to my cupboard it was the dominie mrs bately who looked there for something for me to eat and he has been caught in a rattrap serve him right i have forbade him that cupboard have i not mr dobbs yea and verily quoth the dominie and i do repent me that i took not thine advice for look at my fingers and the dominie extended his lacerated digits dear me well id no idea that a rattrap pinched so hard replied the old woman whose wrath was appeased how it must hurt the poor thingsi wont set it again but leave them all to the cat hell kill them if he only can get at them the old lady went to a drawer unlocked it brought out some fragments of rags and a bottle of friars balsam which she applied to the dominies hand and then bound it up scolding him the whole time how stupid of you mr dobbs you know that i was only out for a few minutes why didnt you waitand why did you go to the cupboard havnt i always told you not to look into it and now you see the consequences verily my hand burneth replied the dominie i will go for cold water and it will ease you what a deal of trouble you do give mr dobbs youre worse than a charity boy and the old lady departed to the pump vinegar is a better thing sir said i and there is a bottle in the cupboard which i dare say is vinegar i went to the cupboard and brought out the bottle took out the cork and smelt it this is not vinegar sir it is hollands or gin then would i like a glass jacob for i feel a sickening faintness upon me yet be quick peradventure the old woman may return drink out of the bottle sir said i perceiving that the dominie looked very pale and i will give you notice of her approach the dominie put the bottle to his mouth and was taking a sufficient draught when the old woman returned by another door which was behind us she had gone that way for a washbasin before we could perceive her she came behind the dominie snatched the bottle from his mouth with a jerk that threw a portion of the spirits in his eyes and blinded him thats why you went to my cupboard is it mr dobbs cried she in a passion thats it is it i thought my bottle went very fast seeing that i dont take more than a teaspoonful every night for the wind which vexes me so much ill set the rattrap again you may depend upon it and now you may get somebody else to bind your fingers it was i who took it out mrs bately the dominie would have fainted with pain it was very lucky that he has a housekeeper who is careful to have something of the kind in the house or he might have been dead you surely dont begrudge a little of your medicine to recover mr dobbs peace woman peace said the dominie who had gained courage by his potation peace i say i knew not that thou hadst in thy cupboard either a gin for my hand or gin for my mouth since i have been taken in the one it is but fair that i should take in the other in future both thy gins will not be interfered with by me bring me the basin that i may appease my angry wounds and then hasten to procure some viands to appease the hunger of my son jacob lastly appease thine own wrath pax peace i say and the old woman who perceived that the dominie had asserted his right of dominion went to obey his orders grumbling till she was out of hearing the application of the cold pumpwater soon relieved the pain of the good old dominie and with his hand remaining in the basin we commenced a long conversation at first i narrated to him the events which had occurred during my service on board of the frigate when i told him of my parting with tom he observed verily do i remember that young tom a jocund pleasant yet intrusive lad yet do i wish him well and am grieved that he should be so taken by that maiden mary well may we say of her as horace hath of pyrrhaquis multa gracilis te puer in rosa perfusis liquidis urgit odoribus grate pyrrha sub antro cui flavam religas comam simplex munditiis i grieve at it yea grieve much heu quoties fidem mutatosque deos flebit verily jacob i do prophesy that she will lead him into error yea perhaps into perdition i trust not sir replied i but the dominie made no answer for halfanhour he was in deep and serious thought during which mrs bately entered and spreading a cloth brought in from the other room some rashers of bacon and eggs upon which i made a hasty and hearty meal the old matrons temper was now smoothed and she welcomed me kindly and shortly after went out for a fresh basin of cold water for the dominie to bathe his hand this roused him and he recommenced the conversation jacob i have not yet congratulated thee upon thy accession to wealth not that i do not sincerely rejoice in it but because the pleasure of thy presence has made me unmindful of it still was it fortunate for thee that thou hadst raised up such a friend as mr turnbull otherwise what would have been the result of thy boasted independence thou wouldst probably have remained many years on board of a manofwar and have been killed or have returned mutilated to die unknown you were right sir replied i my independence was nothing but pride and i did bitterly repent as you said i should do even before i was pressed into the kings servicebut mr drummond never repeated his offers he never did jacob but as i have since been informed by him although he was taken by surprise at thy being forced away to serve thy country still he was not sure that you would accept them and he moreover wished you fully to feel thine own folly long before you had made friends with him he had attested the will of mr turnbull and was acquainted with the contents yet did he watch over thee and had he thought that thy way of life had led thee into that which was wrong he would have interfered to save thee but he considered with shakespeare that sweet were the uses of adversity and that thou wouldst be more schooled by remaining some time under her unprepossessing frowns he hath ever been thy friend i can believe it i trust he is well and his family they were well and prosperous but a little while ago jacob yet i have seen but little of them since the death of mr turnbull it will pain thee to hear that affliction at thy absence hastened his dissolution i was at his deathbed jacob and i verily believe he was a good man and will meet the reward of one yet did he talk most strangely and reminded me of that remnant of a man you call old tom its no use old gentleman said he as he lay in his bed supported by pillows for he had wasted away till he was but a skeleton having broken a bloodvessel with his violent coughingits no use pouring that doctors stuff down my throat my anchors short stay apeak and in a few minutes i shall trip it i trust for heaven where i hope there are moorings laid down for me i would fain comprehend thee replied i but thou speakest in parables i mean to say that death has driven his harpoon in up to the shank and that i struggle in vain i have run out all my line i shall turn up in a few minutesso give my love and blessing to jacobhe saved my life oncebut now im gone with these last words his spirit took its flight and thus jacob did your benefactor breathe his last invoking a blessing on your head i remained silent for a few minutes for i was much affected by the dominies description he at length resumed the conversation thou hast not yet seen the drummonds jacob i have not i replied but i will call upon them tomorrow but it is time that i should go for i have to return to london thou needst not jacob thine own house is at hand my own house yes by the will of mr turnbull his wife has been left a handsome jointure but for reasons which he did not explain the house and furniture are not left to her but as residuary legatee belong to thee indeedthen where is mrs turnbull at bath where she hath taken up her residence mr drummond who hath acted in thy behalf permitted her to take away such articles as she might wish but they were but few chiefly those little objects which filled up rather than adorned the drawingroom the house is all ready for thy reception and thou mayst take possession this evening but why did not mr turnbull leave it to his widow i cannot exactly say but i think he did not wish her to remain in this place he therefore left her pounds at her own disposal to enable her to purchase and furnish another i then took my leave of the dominie and it being rather late i resolved to walk to the house and sleep there chapter forty two in which i take possession of my own house and think that it looks very illfurnished without a wifetoms discharge is sent out but by accident it never reaches himi take my new station in society on my arrival the front gates were opened by the gardeners wife who made me a profound courtesy the gardener soon afterwards made his appearance hat in hand everything was neat and in good order i entered the house and as soon as possible rid myself of their obsequious attentions i wished to be alone powerful feelings crowded on my mind i hastened to mr turnbulls study and sat down in the chair so lately occupied by him the proud feeling of possession softened into gratitude to heaven and sorrow at his death came over me and i remained for a long while in a deep reverie and all this and more much more are mine i mentally exclaimed the sailor before the mast the waterman on the river the charityboy the orphan sits down in quiet possession of luxury and wealth what have i done to deserve all this my heart told me nothing or if anything it was almost valueless and i poured forth my soul in thanks to heaven i felt more composed after i had performed this duty and my thoughts then dwelt upon my benefactor i surveyed the roomthe drawings the furs and skins the harpoons and other instruments all remaining in their respective places as when i last had an interview with mr turnbull i remembered his kindness his singleness of heart his honesty his good sense and his real worth and i shed many tears for his loss my thoughts then passed to sarah drummond and i felt much uneasiness on that score would she receive me or would she still remember what i had been i recollected her kindness and goodwill towards me i weighed these and my present condition against my origin and my former occupation and could not ascertain how the scale might turn i shall soon see thought i tomorrow even may decide the question the gardeners wife knocked at the door and announced that my bed was prepared i went to sleep dreaming of sarah young tom the dominie and mary stapleton i was up early the next morning and hastened to the hotel when having arranged my person to the best of my power but at the same time never so little to my satisfaction i proceeded to the house of mr drummond i knocked and this time i was not desired to wait in the hall but was immediately ushered up into the drawingroom sarah drummond was sitting alone at her drawing my name was announced as i entered she started from her chair and blushed deeply as she moved towards me we joined hands in silence i was breathless with emotion never had she appeared so beautiful neither party appeared willing to break silence at last i faltered out miss drummondand then i stopped mr faithful replied she and then after a breakhow very silly this is i ought to have congratulated you upon your safe return and upon your good fortune and indeed mr faithful no one can do so more sincerely miss drummond replied i confused when i was an orphan a charityboy and a waterman you called me jacob if the alteration in my prospects induces you to address me in so formal a mannerif we are in future to be on such different termsi can only say that i wish that i were againjacob faithful the waterman nay replied she recollect that it was your own choice to be a waterman you might have been differentvery different you might at this time have been a partner with my father for he said so but last night when we were talking about you but you refused all you threw away your education your talents your good qualities from a foolish pride which you considered independence my father almost humbled himself to younot that it is ever humiliating to acknowledge and attempt to repair a fault but still he did more than could be expected from most people your friends persuaded you but you rejected their advice and what was still more unpardonable even i had no influence over you as long as you punished yourself i did not upbraid you but now that you have been so fortunate i tell you plainly what that it is more than you deserve thats all you have said but the truth miss drummond i was very proud and very foolish but i had repented of my folly long before i was pressed and i candidly acknowledge that i do not merit the good fortune i have met with can i say more no i am satisfied with your repentance and acknowledgment so now you may sit down and make yourself agreeable before i do that allow me to ask as you address me as mr faithful how am i to address you i should not wish to be considered impertinent my name is miss drummond but those who feel intimate with me call me sarah i may reply that my name is faithful but those who feel intimate with me call me jacob very true but allow me to observe that you show very little tact you should never force a lady into a corner if i appear affronted when you call me sarah then you will do wise to fall back upon miss drummond but why do you fix your eyes upon me so earnestly i cannot help it and must beg your pardon but you are so improved in appearance since i last saw you i thought no one could be more perfect but well thats not a bad beginning jacob i like to hear of my perfections now follow up your but i hardly know what i was going to say but i think it was that i do not feel as if i ought or can address you otherwise than as miss drummond oh youve thought better of it have you well i begin to think myself that you look so well in your present dress and have become so very different a person that i ought not to address you by any other name than mr faithful so now we are agreed thats not what i mean to say well then let me know what you did mean to say this puzzling question fortunately did not require an answer for mr drummond came into the room and extended his hand my dear jacob said he in the most friendly manner im delighted to see you back again and to have the pleasure of congratulating you on your good fortune but you have business to transact which will not admit of any delay you must prove the will and arrange with the lawyers as soon as possible will you come now all the papers are below and i have the whole morning to spare we will be back to dinner sarah if jacob has no other engagement i have none replied i and shall be most happy to avail myself of your kindness miss drummond i wish you a good morning au revoir mr faithful replied sarah courtesying formally with a mocking smile the behaviour of mr drummond towards me was most kind and parental and my eyes were often suffused with tears during the occupation of the morning the most urgent business was got through and an interview with mr turnbulls solicitor put the remainder in progress still it was so late when we had accomplished it that i had no time to dress on my return mrs drummond received me with her usual kindness i narrated during the evening my adventures since we parted and took that opportunity to acknowledge to mr drummond how bitterly i had repented my folly and i may add ingratitude towards him jacob said he as we were sitting at the teatable with mrs drummond and sarah i knew at the time that you were toiling on the river for shillings that you were the inheritor of thousands for i not only witnessed but read the will of mr turnbull but i thought it best that you should have a lesson which you would never forget in after life there is no such thing in this world as independence unless in a savage state in society we are all mutually dependent upon each other independence of mind we may have but no more as a waterman you were dependent upon your customers as every poor man must be upon those who have more means and in refusing my offers you were obliged to apply for employment to others the rich are as entirely dependent upon others as the poor they depend upon them for their food their clothes their necessities and their luxuries such ever will be the case in society and the more refined the society may bethe more civilised its partsthe greater is the mutual dependence still it is an error originating in itself from high feelings and therefore must be considered as an error on the right side but recollect how much you might have thrown away had not you in the first place secured such a friend as mr turnbull and secondly if the death of that friend had not so soon put you in possession i was but too ready to acknowledge the truth of these remarks the evening passed away so rapidly that it was midnight before i rose to take my leave and i returned to the hotel as happy in my mind and as grateful as ever any mortal could possibly be the next day i removed to the house left me by mr turnbull and the first order i gave was for a wherry such was the force of habit i could not do without one and half my time was spent upon the river pulling every day down to mr drummonds and returning in the evening or late at night thus passed away two months during which i occasionally saw the dominie the stapletons and old tom beazeley i had exerted myself to procure toms discharge and at last had the pleasure of telling the old people that it was to go out by the next packet by the drummonds i was received as a member of the familythere was no hindrance to my being alone with sarah for hours and although i had not ventured to declare my sentiments they appeared to be well understood as well by the parents as by sarah herself two days after i had communicated this welcome intelligence to the old couple as i was sitting at breakfast attended by the gardener and his wife for i had made no addition to my establishment what was my surprise at the appearance of young tom who entered the room as usual laughing as he held out his hand tom exclaimed i why how did you come here by water jacob as you may suppose but how have you received your discharge is the ship come home i hope not the fact is i discharged myself jacob what did you desert even so i had three reasons for so doing in the first place i could not remain without you in the second my mother wrote to say mary was taken up with a sodger and the third was i was put into the report for punishment and should have been flogged as sure as the captain had a pair of epaulettes well but sit down and tell me all about it you know your discharge is obtained yes thanks to you jacob all the better for now they wont look after me alls well that ends well after you went away i presume i was not in the very best of humours and that rascal of a masters mate who had us pressed thought proper to bully me beyond all bearing one day he called me a lying scoundrel upon which i forgot that i was on board of a manofwar and replied that he was a confounded cheat and that he had better pay me his debt of two guineas for bringing him down the river he reported me on the quarterdeck for calling him a cheat and captain maclean who you know wont stand any nonsense heard the arguments on both sides upon which he declared that the conduct of the masters mate was not that of an officer or a gentleman and therefore he should leave the ship and that my language to my superior officer was subversive to the discipline of the service and therefore he should give me a good flogging now jacob you know that if the officers dont pay their debts captain maclean always does and with interest into the bargain so finding that i was in for it and no mistake i swam ashore the night before black monday and made my way to miramichi without any adventure except a tussle with a sergeant of marines whom i left for dead about three miles out of the town at miramichi i got on board of a timber ship and here i am i am sorry that you deserted nevertheless replied i it may come to mischief never fear the people on the river know that i have my discharge and im safe enough have you seen mary yes and alls right in that quarter i shall build another wherry wear my badge and dress and stick above bridge when im all settled ill splice and live along with the old couple but will mary consent to live there it is so quiet and retired that she wont like it mary stapleton has given herself airs enough in all conscience and has had her own way quite enough mary beazeley will do as her husband wishes or i will know the reason why we shall see tom bachelors wives are always best managed they say but now you want money to buy your boat yes if youll lend it to me i dont like to take it away from the old people and ill pay you when i can jacob no you must accept this tom and when you marry you must accept something more replied i handing the notes to him with all my heart jacob i never can repay you for what you have done for me and so i may just as well increase the debt thats good logic tom quite as good as independence is it not jacob better much better as i know to my cost replied i laughing tom finished his breakfast and then took his leave after breakfast as usual i went to the boathouse and unchaining my wherry pulled up the river which i had not hitherto done my attendance upon sarah having invariably turned the bow of my wherry in the opposite direction i swept by the various residences on the banks of the river until i arrived opposite to that of mr wharncliffe and perceived a lady and gentleman in the garden i knew them at once and as they were standing close to the wall i pulled in and saluted them do you recollect me said i to them smiling yes replied the lady i do recollect your facesurelyit is faithful the waterman no i am not a waterman i am only amusing myself in my own boat come up replied mr wharncliffe we cant shake hands with you at that distance i made fast my wherry and joined them they received me most cordially i thought you were not a waterman mr faithful although you said that you were said mrs wharncliffe why did you deceive us in that way indeed at that time i was from my own choice and my own folly a waterman now i am so no longer we were soon on the most intimate terms and i narrated part of my adventures they expressed their obligations to me and requested that i would accept their friendship would you like to have a row on the water it is a beautiful day and if mrs wharncliffe will trust herself oh i should like it above all things will you go william i will run for a shawl in a few minutes we were all three embarked and i rowed them to my villa they had been admiring the beauty of the various residences on the banks of the thames how do you like that one inquired i of mrs wharncliffe it is very handsome and i think one of the very best that is mine replied i will you allow me to show it to you yours yes mine but i have a very small establishment for i am a bachelor we landed and after walking about the grounds went into the house do you recollect this room said i to mr wharncliffe yes indeed i do it was here that the box was opened and my uncles but we must not say anything about that he is dead dead yes he never held his head up after his dishonesty was discovered he pined and died within three months sincerely repenting what he had attempted i accepted their invitation to dinner as i rowed them back to their own residence and afterwards had the pleasure of enrolling them among my sincerest friends through them i was introduced to lady auburn and many others and i shall not forget the old housekeeper recognising me one day when i was invited to lady auburns villa bless me what tricks you young gentlemen do play only to think how you asked me for water and how i pushed the door in your face and wouldnt let you rest yourself but if you young gentlemen will disguise yourselves its your own faults and you must take the consequences my acquaintances now increased rapidly and i had the advantage of the best society i hardly need observe that it was a great advantage for although i was not considered awkward still i wanted that polish which can only be obtained by an admixture with good company the reports concerning me were various but it was generally believed that i was a young man who had received an excellent education and might have been brought forward but that i had taken a passion for the river and had chosen to be a waterman in preference to any other employment that i had since come into a large fortune and had resumed my station in society how far the false was blended with the true those who have read my adventures will readily perceive for my part i cared little what they said and i gave myself no trouble to refute the various assertions i was not ashamed of my birth because it had no effect upon the drummonds still i knew the world too well to think it necessary to blazon it on the whole the balance was in my favour there was a degree of romance in my history with all its variations which interested and joined to the knowledge of my actual wealth made me to be well received and gained me attention wherever i went one thing was much to my advantagemy extensive reading added to the good classical education which i had received it is not often in society that an opportunity occurs when any one can prove his acquisitions and thus did education turn the scale in my favour and every one was much more inclined to believe the false rather than the true versions of my history chapter forty three the dominie proves stapletons human natur to be correctthe redcoat proves too much of a match for the bluemary sells tom and tom sells what is left of him for a shillingwe never know the value of anything till we have lost it i had often ruminated in what manner i could render the dominie more comfortable i felt that to him i was as much indebted as to any living being and one day i ventured to open the subject but his reply was decided i see jacob my son what thou wouldst wish but it must not be man is but a creature of habit habit becomes to him not only necessity but luxury for fiveandforty years have i toiled instilling precepts and forcing knowledge into the brains of those who have never proved so apt as thou truly it hath been a painful task yet can i not relinquish it i might at one time that is during the first ten years have met the offer with gratitude for i felt the humiliation and annoyance of wearying myself with the rudiments when i would fain have commented upon the various peculiarities of style in the ancient greek and latin authors but now all that has passed away the eternal round of concord prosody and syntax has charms for me from habit the rule of three is preferable to the problems of euclid and even the latin grammar has its delights in short i have a hujus pleasure in hic haec hoc cluck cluck and even the flourishing of the twigs of that tree of knowledge the birch hath become a pleasurable occupation to me if not to those upon whom it is inflicted i am like an old horse who hath so long gone round and round in a mill that he cannot walk straight forward and if it pleases the almighty i will die in harness still i thank thee jacob and thank god that thou hast again proved the goodness of thy heart and given me one more reason to rejoice in thee and in thy love but thine offer if accepted would not add to my happiness for what feeling can be more consolatory to an old man near into his grave than the reflection that his life if not distinguished has at least been useful i had not for some time received a visit from tom and surprised at this i went down to his fathers to make inquiry about him i found the old couple sitting indoors the weather was fine but old tom was not at his work even the old womans netting was thrown aside where is tom inquired i after wishing them good morning oh deary me cried the old woman putting her apron up to her eyes that wicked goodfornothing girl good heavens what is the matter inquired i of old tom the matter jacob replied old tom stretching out his two wooden legs and placing his hands upon his knees is that tom has listed for a sodger listed for a soldier yes thats as sartain as its true and whats worse im told the regiment is ordered to the west indies so what with fever o mind and yellow fever hes food for the land crabs thats sartain i think now continued the old man brushing a tear from his eye with his forefinger that i see his bones bleaching under the palisades for i know the place well dont say so tom dont say so o jacob beg pardon if im too free now but cant you help us i will if i can depend upon it but tell me how this happened why the long and the short of it is this that girl mary stapleton has been his ruin when he first came home he was well received and looked forward to being spliced and living with us but it didnt last long she couldnt leave off her old tricks and so that tom might not get the upper hand she plays him off with the sergeant of a recruiting party and flies off from one to the other just like the ticker of the old clock there does from one side to the other one day the sergeant was the fancy man and the next day it was tom at last tom gets out of patience and wishes to come to a fair understanding so he axes her whether she chooses to have the sergeant or to have him she might take her choice but he had no notion of being played with in that way after all her letters and all her promises upon this she huffs outright and tells tom he may go about his business for she didnt care if she never sees him no more so toms blood was up and he called her a damned jilt and in my opinion he was near to the truth so then they had a regular breeze and part company well this made tom very miserable and the next day he would have begged her pardon and come to her terms for you see jacob a man in love has no discretion but she being still angry tells him to go about his business as she means to marry the sergeant in a week tom turns away again quite mad and it so happens that he goes into the publichouse where the sergeant hangs out hoping to be revenged on him and meaning to have a regular setto and see who is the best man but the sergeant wasnt there and tom takes pot after pot to drive away care and when the sergeant returned tom was not a little in liquor now the sergeant was a knowing chap and when he comes in and perceives tom with his face flushed he guesses what was to come so instead of saying a word he goes to another table and dashes his fist upon it as if in a passion tom goes up to him and says sergeant ive known that girl long before you and if you are a man youll stand up for her stand up for her yes replied the sergeant and so i would have done yesterday but the blasted jilt has turned me to the right about and sent me away i wont fight now for she wont have meany more than she will you now when tom hears this he becomes more pacified with the sergeant and they set down like two people under the same misfortune and take a pot together instead of fighting and then you see the sergeant plies tom with liquor swearing that he will go back to the regiment and leave mary altogether and advises tom to do the same at last what with the sergeants persuasions and toms desire to vex mary he succeeds in listing him and giving him the shilling before witnesses that was all the rascal wanted the next day tom was sent down to the depot as they call it under a guard and the sergeant remains here to follow up mary without interruption this only happened three days ago and we only were told of it yesterday by old stapleton who threatens to turn his daughter out of doors cant you help us jacob said the old woman crying i hope i can and if money can procure his discharge it shall be obtained but did you not say that he was ordered to the west indies the regiment is in the indies but they are recruiting for it so many have been carried off by the yellow fever last sickly season a transport they say will sail next week and the recruits are to march for embarkation in three or four days and what is the regiment and where is the depot it is the th fusiliers and the depot is at maidstone i will lose no time my good friends replied i tomorrow i will go to mr drummond and consult with him i returned the grateful squeeze of old toms hand and followed by the blessings of the old woman i hastened away as i pulled up the river for that day i was engaged to dine with the wharncliffes i resolved to call upon mary stapleton and ascertain by her deportment whether she had become that heartless jilt which she was represented and if so to persuade tom if i succeeded in obtaining his discharge to think no more about her i felt so vexed and angry with her that after i landed i walked about a few minutes before i went to the house that i might recover my temper when i walked up the stairs i found mary sitting over a sheet of paper on which she had been writing she looked up as i came in and i perceived that she had been crying mary said i how well you have kept the promise you made to me when last we met see what trouble and sorrow you have brought upon all parties except yourself except myselfno mr faithful dont except myself i am almost mad i believe that i am madfor surely such folly as mine is madness and mary wept bitterly there is no excuse for your behaviour maryit is unpardonably wicked tom sacrificed all for your sakehe even deserted and desertion is death by the law now what have you donetaken advantage of his strong affection to drive him to intemperance and induce him in despair to enlist for a soldier he sails for the west indies to fill up the ranks of a regiment thinned by the yellow fever and will perhaps never return againyou will then have been the occasion of his death mary i have come to tell you that i despise you i despise and hate myself replied mary mournfully i wish i were in my grave oh mr faithful do for gods sakedo get him back you can i know you canyou have money and everything if i do it will not be for your benefit mary for you shall trifle with him no more i will not try for his discharge unless he faithfully promises never to speak to you again you dont say thatyou dont mean that cried mary sweeping the hair with her hand back from her foreheadand her hand still remaining on her heado god o god what a wretch i am hear me jacob hear me cried she dropping on her knees and seizing my hands only get him his dischargeonly let me once see him again and i swear by all thats sacred that i will beg his pardon on my knees as i now do yours i will do everythinganythingif he will but forgive me for i cannot i will not live without him if this is true mary what madness could have induced you to have acted as you have yes replied mary rising from her knees madness indeedmore than madness to treat so cruelly one for whom i only care to live you say tom loves me i know he does but he does not love me as i do him o my god my heart will break after a pause mary resumed read what i have written to himi have already written as much in another letter you will see that if he cannot get away i have offered to go out with him as his wife that is if he will have such a foolish wicked girl as i am i read the letter it was as she said praying forgiveness offering to accompany him and humiliating herself as much as it was possible i was much affected i returned the letter you cant despise me so much as i despise myself continued mary i hate i detest myself for my folly i recollect now how you used to caution me when a girl oh mother mother it was a cruel legacy you left to your child when you gave her your disposition yet why should i blame her i must blame myself well mary i will do all i can and that as soon as possible tomorrow i will go down to the depot god bless you jacob and may you never have the misfortune to be in love with such a one as myself chapter forty four i am made very happyin other respects a very melancholy chapter which we are sorry to inform the reader will be followed up by one still more so i left mary and hastened home to dress for dinner i mentioned the subject of wishing to obtain toms discharge to mr wharncliffe who recommended my immediately applying to the horse guards and as he was acquainted with those in office offered to accompany me i gladly accepted his offer and the next morning he called for me in his carriage and we went there mr wharncliffe sent up his card to one of the secretaries and we were immediately ushered up when i stated my wishes the reply wasif you had time to procure a substitute it would be easily arranged but the regiment is so weak and the aversion to the west indies so prevalent after this last very sickly season that i doubt if his royal highness would permit any man to purchase his discharge however we will see the duke is one of the kindesthearted of men and i will lay the case before him but let us see if he is still at the depot i rather think not the secretary rang the bell the detachment of the th fusiliers from the depothas it marched and when does it embark the clerk went out and in a few minutes returned with some a papers in his hand it marched the day before yesterday and was to embark this morning and sail as soon as the wind was fair my heart sank at this intelligence how is the wind mr g go down and look at the telltale the clerk returned east north east sir and has been steadily so these two days then replied the secretary i am afraid you are too late to obtain your wish the orders to the portadmiral are most peremptory to expedite the sailing of the transports and a frigate has been now three weeks waiting to convoy them depend upon it they have sailed today what can be done replied i mournfully you must apply for his discharge and procure a substitute he can then have an order sent out and be permitted to return home i am very sorry as i perceive you are much interested but im afraid it is too late now however you may call tomorrow the weather is clear with this wind and the portadmiral will telegraph to the admiralty the sailing of the vessels should anything detain them i will take care that his royal highness shall be acquainted with the circumstances this afternoon if possible and will give you his reply we thanked the secretary for his politeness and took our leave vexed as i was with the communications i had already received i was much more so when one of the porters ran to the carriage to show me by the secretarys order a telegraphic communication from the admiralty containing the certain and unpleasant information convoy to west indies sailed this morning then it is all over for the present said i throwing myself back in the carriage and i continued in a melancholy humour until mr wharncliffe who had business in the city put me down as near as the carriage went to the house of mr drummond i found sarah who was the depository of all my thoughts pains and pleasures and i communicated to her this episode in the history of young tom as most ladies are severe judges of their own sex she was very strong in her expressions against the conduct of mary which she would not allow to admit of any palliation even her penitence had no weight with her and yet how often is it the case sarah not perhaps to the extent carried on by this mistaken girl but still the disappointment is as great although the consequences are not so calamitous among the higher classes how often do young men receive encouragement and yield themselves up to a passion to end only in disappointment it is not necessary to plight troth a young woman may not have virtually committed herself and yet by merely appearing pleased with the conversation and company of a young man induce him to venture his affections in a treacherous sea and eventually find them wrecked you are very nautically poetical jacob replied sarah such things do happen but i think that womens affections are to use your phrase oftener wrecked than those of men that however does not exculpate either party a woman must be blind indeed if she cannot perceive in a very short time whether she is trifling with a mans feelings and base indeed if she continues to practise upon them sarah replied i and i stopped well i was replied i stammering a littlei was going to ask you if you were blind as to what jacob said sarah colouring up as to my feelings towards you no i believe you like me very well replied she smiling do you think that that is all where do you dine today jacob replied sarah that must depend upon you and your answer if i dine here today i trust to dine here often if i do not dine here today probably i never may again i wish to know sarah whether you have been blind to my feelings towards you for with the case of mary and tom before me i feel that i must no longer trust to my own hopes which may end in disappointment will you have the kindness to put me out of my misery if i have been blind to your feelings i have not been blind to your merit jacob perhaps i have not been blind to your feelings and i am not of the same disposition as mary stapleton i think you may venture to dine here today continued she colouring and smiling as she turned away to the window i can hardly believe that im to be so happy sarah replied i agitated i have been fortunate very fortunate but the hopes you have now raised are so much beyond my expectationsso much beyond my desertsthat i dare not indulge in them have pity on me and be more explicit what do you wish me to say replied sarah looking down upon her work as she turned round to me that you will not reject the orphan who was fostered by your father and who reminds you of what he was that you may not forget at this moment what i trust is the greatest bar to his presumptionhis humble origin jacob that was said like yourselfit was nobly said and if you were not born noble you have true nobility of mind i will imitate your example have i not often during our long friendship told you that i loved you yes as a child you did sarah then as a woman i repeat it and now are you satisfied i took sarah by the hand she did not withdraw it but allowed me to kiss it over and over again but your father and mother sarah would never have allowed our intimacy if they had not approved of it jacob depend upon it however you may make yourself easy on that score by letting them know what has passed and then i presume you will be out of your misery before the day was over i had spoken to mrs drummond and requested her to open the business to her husband as i really felt it more than i could dare to do she smiled as her daughter hung upon her neck and when i met mr drummond at dinnertime i was out of my misery for he shook me by the hand and said you have made us all very happy jacob for that girl appears determined either to marry you or not to marry at all come dinner is ready i will leave the reader to imagine how happy i was what passed between sarah and me in our teteatete of that evening how unwilling i was to quit the house and how i ordered a postchaise to carry me home because i was afraid to trust myself on that water on which the major part of my life had been safely passed lest any accident should happen to me and rob me of my anticipated bliss from that day i was as one of the family and finding the distance too great took up my abode at apartments contiguous to the house of mr drummond but the course of other peoples love did not run so smooth and i must now return to mary stapleton and tom beazeley i had breakfasted and was just about to take my wherry and go down to acquaint the old couple with the bad success of my application i had been reflecting with gratitude upon my own happiness in prospect indulging in fond anticipations and then reverting to the state in which i had left mary stapleton and toms father and mother contrasting their misery with my joy arising from the same source when who should rush into the diningroom but young tom dressed in nothing but a shirt and a pair of white trousers covered with dust and wan with fatigue and excitement good heavens tom are you back then you must have deserted very true replied tom sinking on a chair i swam on shore last night and have made from portsmouth to here since eight oclock i hardly need say that i am done up let me have something to drink jacob pray i went to the cellaret and brought him some wine of which he drank off a tumbler eagerly during this i was revolving in my mind the consequences which might arise from this hasty and imprudent step tom said i do you know the consequences of desertion yes replied he gloomily but i could not help it mary told me in her letter that she would do all i wished would accompany me abroad she made all the amends she could poor girl and by heavens i could not leave her and when i found myself fairly under weigh and there was no chance i was almost mad the wind baffled us at the needles and we anchored for the night i slipped down the cable and swam on shore and theres the whole story but tom you will certainly be recognised and taken up for a deserter i must think of that replied tom i know the risk i run but if you obtain my discharge they may let me off i thought this was the best plan to proceed upon and requesting tom to keep quiet i went to consult with mr wharncliffe he agreed with me that it was toms only chance and i pulled to his fathers to let them know what had occurred and then went on to the drummonds when i returned home late in the evening the gardener told me that tom had gone out and had not returned my heart misgave me that he had gone to see mary and that some misfortune had occurred and i went to bed with most anxious feelings my forebodings were proved to be correct for the next morning i was informed that old stapleton wished to see me he was ushered in and as soon as he entered he exclaimed alls up master jacobtoms nabbedmary fit after fithuman natur why what is the matter stapleton why its just thistom desarts to come to mary cause whyhe loves herhuman natur that soldier chap comes in and sees tom clutches hold and tries to take possession of him tom fights knocks out sergeants starboard eye and tries to escapehuman natur soldiers come in pick up sergeant seize tom and carry him off mary cries and screams and faintshuman naturpoor girl cant keep her head uptwo women with burnt feathers all night sad job mister jacob of all the senses loves the worst thats sartainquite upset me cant smoke my pipe this morningmarys tears quite put my pipe outand old stapleton looked as if he was ready to cry himself this is a sad business stapleton replied i tom will be tried for desertion and god knows how it will end i will try all i can but they have been very strict lately hope you will mister jacob mary will die thats sartain im more afraid that tom will if one does tother will i know the girljust like her mother never could carry her helm amidships hard a port or hard a starboard shes mad now to follow himwill go to maidstone i take her as soon as i go back to her just come up to tell you all about it this is a gloomy affair stapleton yes for sartainwish there never was such a thing as human natur after a little conversation and a supply of money which i knew would be acceptable stapleton went away leaving me in no very happy state of mind my regard for tom was excessive and his situation one of peculiar danger again i repaired to mr wharncliffe for advice and he readily interested himself most warmly this is indeed an awkward business said he and will require more interest than i am afraid that i command if not condemned to death he will be sentenced to such a flogging as will break him down in spirit as well as in body and sink him into an early grave death were preferable of the two lose no time mr faithful in going down to maidstone and seeing the colonel commanding the depot i will go to the horse guards and see what is to be done i wrote a hurried note to sarah to account for my absence and sent for posthorses early in the afternoon i arrived at maidstone and finding out the residence of the officer commanding the depot sent up my card in few words i stated to him the reason of my calling upon him it will rest altogether with the horse guards mr faithful and i am afraid i can give you but little hope his royal highness has expressed his determination to punish the next deserter with the utmost severity of the law his leniency on that point has been very injurious to the service and he must do it besides there is an aggravation of the offence in his attack upon the sergeant who has irrecoverably lost his eye the sergeant first made him drunk and then persuaded him to enlist i then stated the rivalship that subsisted between them and continued is it not disgraceful to enlist men in that waycan that be called voluntary service all very true replied the officer but still expediency winks at even more i do not attempt to defend the system but we must have soldiers the seamen are impressed by force the soldiers are entrapped by other means even more discreditable the only excuse is expediency or if you like it better necessity all i can promise you sir is to allow the prisoner every comfort which his situation will permit and every advantage at his courtmartial which mercy tempered by justice will warrant i thank you sir will you allow me and his betrothed to see him most certainly the order shall be given forthwith i thanked the officer for his kindness and took my leave chapter forty five read it i hastened to the black hole where tom was confined and the order for my admission having arrived before me i was permitted by the sergeant of the guard to pass the sentry i found tom sitting on a bench notching a stick with his knife whistling a slow tune this is kind jacob but not more than i expected of youi made sure that i should see you tonight or tomorrow morning hows poor mary i care only for her nowi am satisfiedshe loves me andi knocked out the sergeants eyespoilt his wooing at all events but tom are you aware of the danger in which you are placed yes jacob perfectly i shall be tried by a courtmartial and shot ive made up my mind to itat all events its better than being hung like a dog or being flogged to death like a nigger i shall die like a gentleman if i have never been one before thats some comfort nay i shall go out of the world with as much noise as if a battle had been fought or a great man had died how do you mean why therell be more than one bulletin this is no time for jesting tom not for you jacob as a sincere friend i grant not for poor mary as a devoted girl not for my poor father and motherno no continued tom i feel for them but for myself i neither fear nor care i have not done wrongi was pressed against the law and act of parliament and i deserted i was enlisted when i was drunk and mad and i deserted there is no disgrace to me the disgrace is to the government which suffers such acts if i am to be a victim well and goodwe can only die once very true tom but you are young to die and we must hope for the best i have given up all hope jacob i know the law will be put in force i shall die and go to another and a better world as the parson says where at all events there will be no muskets to clean no drill and none of your confounded pipeclay which has almost driven me mad i should like to die in a blue jacketin a red coat i will not so i presume i shall go out of the world in my shirt and thats more than i had when i came in mary and her father are coming down to you tom im sorry for that jacob it would be cruel not to see herbut she blames herself so much that i cannot bear to read her letters but jacob i will see her to try if i can comfort herbut she must not stay she must go back again till after the courtmartial and the sentence and thenif she wishes to take her farewell i suppose i must not refuse a few tears dropped from his eyes as he said this jacob will you wait and take her back to townshe must not stay hereand i will not see my father and mother until the last let us make one job of it and then all will be over as tom said this the door of the cell again opened and stapleton supported in his daughter mary tottered to where tom stood and fell into his arms in a fit of convulsions it was necessary to remove her and she was carried out let her not come in again i beseech you jacob take her back and i will bless you for your kindness wish me farewell now and see that she does not come again tom wrung me by the hand and turned away to conceal his distress i nodded my head in assent for i could not speak for emotion and followed stapleton and the soldiers who had taken mary out as soon as she was recovered sufficiently to require no further medical aid i lifted her into the postchaise and ordered the boys to drive back to brentford mary continued in a state of stupor during the journey and when i arrived at my own house i gave her into the charge of the gardeners wife and despatched her husband for medical assistance the application of mr wharncliffe was of little avail and he returned to me with disappointment in his countenance the whole of the next week was the most distressing that i ever passed arising from my anxiety for tom my daily exertions to reason mary into some degree of submission to the will of providenceher accusations of herself and her own follyher incoherent ravings calling herself toms murderer which alarmed me for her reason the distress of old tom and his wife who unable to remain in their solitude came all to me for intelligence for comfort and for what alas i dare not give themhope all this added to my separation from sarah during my attendance to what i considered my duty reduced me to a debility arising from mental exertion which changed me to almost a skeleton at last the courtmartial was held and tom was condemned to death the sentence was approved of and we were told that all appeals would be unavailing we received the news on the saturday evening and tom was to suffer on the tuesday morning i could no longer refuse the appeals of mary indeed i received a letter from tom requesting that all of us the dominie included would come down and bid him farewell i hired a carriage for old tom his wife stapleton and mary and putting the dominie and myself in my own chariot we set off early on the sunday morning for maidstone we arrived about eleven oclock and put up at an inn in close proximity to the barracks it was arranged that the dominie and i should see tom first then his father and mother and lastly mary stapleton verily said the dominie my heart is heavy exceeding heavy my soul yearneth after the poor lad who is thus to lose his life for a womana woman from whose toils i did myself escape yet is she exceeding fair and comely and now that it is unavailing appeareth to be penitent i made no reply we had arrived at the gate of the barracks i requested to be admitted to the prisoner and the doors were unbarred tom was dressed with great care and cleanliness in white trousers and shirt and waistcoat but his coat lay on the table he would not put it on he extended his hand towards me with a faint smile its all over now jacob and there is no hope that i am aware of and i have made up my mind to die but i wish these last farewells were over for they unman me i hope you are well sir continued tom to the dominie nay my poor boy i am as well as age and infirmity will permit and why should i complain when i see youth health and strength about to be sacrificed and many made miserable when many might be made so happy and the dominie blew his nose the trumpet sound of which reechoed through the cell so as to induce the sentry to look through the bars they are all here tom said i would you like to see them now yes the sooner it is over the better will you see your father and mother first yes replied tom in a faltering tone i went out and returned with the old woman on my arm followed by old tom who stumped after me with the assistance of his stick poor old mrs beazeley fell on her sons neck sobbing convulsively my boymy boymy dear dear boy said she at last and she looked up steadfastly in his face my god hell be dead tomorrow her head again sank on his shoulder and her sobs were choking her tom kissed his mothers forehead as the tears coursed down his cheeks and motioned me to take her away i placed her down on the floor where she remained silent moving her head up and down with a slow motion her face buried in her shawl it was but now and then that you heard a convulsive drawing of her breath old tom had remained a silent but agitated spectator of the scene every muscle in his weatherbeaten countenance twitched convulsively and the tears at last forced their way through the deep furrows on his cheeks tom as soon as his mother was removed took his father by the hand and they sat down together you are not angry with me father for deserting no my boy no i was angry with you for listing but not for deserting what business had you with the pipeclay but i do think i have reason to be angry elsewhere when i reflect that after having lost my two legs in defending her my country is now to take from me my boy in his prime its but a poor reward for long and hard servicepoor encouragement to do your duty but what do they care they have had my sarvices and they have left me a hulk well they may take the rest of me if they please now that theywell its no use crying whats done cant be helped continued old tom as the tears ran down in torrents they may shoot you tom but this i know well youll die game and shame them by proving to them they have deprived themselves of the sarvices of a good man when good men are needed i would not have so much cared continued old tom after a pauselook to the old woman jacob shes tumbling over to portif you had fallen on board a kings ship in a good frigate action some must be killed when theres hard fighting but to be drilled through by your own countrymen to die by their hands and worst of all to die in a red coat instead of a true blue father i will not die in a red coati wont put it on thats some comfort tom anyhow and comforts wanted and ill die like a man father that you will tom and thats some comfort we shall meet again father hope so tom in heaventhats some comfort and now father bless me and take care of my poor mother bless you tom bless you cried the old man in a suffocating voice extending both his hands towards tom as they rose up but the equilibrium was no longer to be maintained and he reeled back in the arms of me and tom we lowered him gently down by the side of his wife the old couple turned to each other and embracing remained sobbing in each others arms jacob said tom squeezing me by the hand with a quivering lip by your regard for me let now the last scene be got overlet me see mary and let this tortured heart once more be permitted a respite i sent out the dominie tom leant against the wall with his arms folded in appearance summoning up all his energy for the painful meeting mary was led in by her father i expected she would have swooned away as before but on the contrary although she was pale as death and gasping for breath from intensity of feeling she walked up to tom where he was standing and sat down on the form close to him she looked anxiously round upon the group and then said i know that all i now say is useless tom but still i must say itit is i who by my folly have occasioned all this distress and miseryit is i who have caused you to suffer adreadful deathyes tom i am your murderer not so mary the folly was my own replied tom taking her hand you cannot disguise or palliate to me dearest tom replied mary my eyes have been opened too late it is true but they have been opened and although it is kind of you to say so i feel the horrid conviction of my own guilt see what misery i have brought about there is a father who has sacrificed his youth and his limbs to his country sobbing in the arms of a mother whose life is bound up with that of her only son to them continued mary falling down upon her knees to them i must kneel for pardon and i ask it as they hope to be forgiven answer meoh answer me can you forgive a wretch like me a pause ensued i went up to old tom and kneeling by his side begged him to answer forgive her poor thingyes who could refuse it as she kneels there come continued he speaking to his wife you must forgive her look up dame at her and think that our poor boy may be asking the same of heaven tomorrow at noon the old woman looked up and her dimmed eyes caught a sight of marys imploring and beautiful attitude it was not to be withstood as i hope for mercy to my poor boy whom you have killed so do i forgive you unhappy young woman may god reward you when you are summoned before him replied mary it was the hardest task of all of you jacob i have to ask forgiveness for depriving you of your early and truest friendyes and for much more of you sir addressing the dominie for my conduct towards you which was cruel and indefensiblewill you forgive me yes mary from my heart i do forgive you replied i bless thee maiden bless thee sobbed the dominie father i must ask of you the samei have been a wilful childforgive me yes mary you could not help it replied old stapleton blubbering it was all human natur and now said mary turning round on her knees to tom with a look expressive of anguish and love to you tom must be my last appeal i know you will forgive mei know you haveand this knowledge of your fervent love makes the thought more bitter that i have caused your death but hear me tom and all of you hear me i never loved but you i have liked others much i liked jacob but you only ever did make me feel i had a heart and alas you only have i sacrificed when led away by my folly to give you pain i suffered more than youfor you have had my only you shall have my eternal and unceasing love to your memory i am hereafter wedded to join you will be my only wishand if there could be a boon granted me from heaven it would be to die with you tomyes in those dear arms mary held out her arms to tom who falling down on his knees embraced her and thus they remained with their faces buried in each others shoulders the whole scene was now at its climax it was too oppressive and i felt faint when i was aroused by the voice of the dominie who lifting up both his arms and extending them forth solemnly prayed o lord look down upon these thy servants in affliction grant to those who are to continue in their pilgrimage strength to bear thy chasteninggrant to him who is to be summoned to thee that happiness which the world cannot give and o god most mighty god most powerful lay not upon us burdens greater than we can bearmy children let us pray the dominie knelt down and repeated the lords prayer all followed his example and then there was a pause stapleton said i pointing to mary i beckoned to the dominie we assisted up old tom and then his wife and led them away the poor old woman was in a state of stupefaction and until she was out in the air was not aware that she had quitted her son stapleton had attempted to detach mary from tom but in vain they were locked together as if in death at last tom roused by me suffered his hold to be loosened and mary was taken out in a happy state of insensibility and carried to the inn by her father and the dominie are they all gone whispered tom to me as his head reclined on my shoulder all tom then the bitterness of death is past god have mercy on them and assuage their anguish they want his help more than i do a passionate flood of tears which lasted some minutes relieved the poor fellow he raised himself and drying his eyes became more composed jacob i hardly need tell my dying request to watch over my poor father and mother to comfort poor marygod bless you jacob you have indeed been a faithful friend and may god reward you and now jacob leave me i must commune with my god and pray for forgiveness the space between me and eternity is but short tom threw himself into my arms where he remained for some minutes he then broke gently away and pointed to the door i once more took his hand and we parted chapter forty six in which as usual in the last chapter of a work everything is wound up much to the readers satisfaction and not a little to the authors who lays down his pen exclaiming thank god i went back to the inn and ordering the horses to be put to i explained to all but mary the propriety of their now returning home mary was lifted in and it was a relief to my mind to see them all depart as for myself i resolved to remain until the last but i was in a state of feverish agitation which made me restless as i paced up and down the room the newspaper caught my eye i laid hold of it mechanically and looked at it a paragraph rivetted my attention his majestys ship immortalite chatham to be paid off then our ship has come home but what was that now yet something whispered to me that i ought to go and see captain maclean and try if anything could be done i knew his commanding interest and although it was now too late still i had an impulse to go and see him which i could not resist after all said i to myself im of no use here and i may as well go this feeling added to my restlessness induced me to order horses and i went to chatham found out that captain maclean was still on board and took boat off to the frigate i was recognised by the officers who were glad to see me and i sent a message to the captain who was below requesting to see him i was asked into the cabin and stated to him what had occurred requesting his assistance if possible faithful replied he it appears that tom beazeley has deserted twice still there is much extenuation at all events the punishment of death is too severe and i dont like iti can save him and i will by the rule of the services a deserter from one service can be claimed from the other and must be tried by his officers his sentence is therefore not legal i shall send a party of marines and claim him as a deserter from the navy and they must and shall give him upmake yourself easy faithful his life is as safe as yours i could have fallen on my knees and thanked him though i could hardly believe that such good news was true there is no time to lose sir replied i respectfully he is to be shot tomorrow at nine oclock he will be on board here tomorrow at nine oclock or i am not captain maclean but as you say there is no time to lose it is now nearly dark and the party must be off immediately i must write a letter on service to the commanding officer of the depot call my clerk i ran out and called the clerk in a few minutes the letter was written and a party of marines with the second lieutenant despatched with me on shore i ordered postchaises for the whole party and before eleven we were at maidstone the lieutenant and i sat up all night and at daylight we summoned the marines and went to the barracks where we found the awful note of preparation going forward and the commanding officer up and attending to the arrangements i introduced the lieutenant who presented the letter on service good heavens how fortunate you can establish his identity i presume every man here can swear to him tis sufficient mr faithful i wish you and your friend joy of this reprieve the rules of the service must be obeyed and you will sign a receipt for the prisoner this was done by the lieutenant and the provost marshal was ordered to deliver up the prisoner i hastened with the marines into the cell the door was unlocked tom who was reading his bible started up and perceiving the red jackets thought that he was to be led out to execution my lads exclaimed he i am ready the sooner this is over the better no tom said i advancing i trust for better fortune you are claimed as a deserter from the immortalite tom stared lifted the hair from his forehead and threw himself into my arms but we had no time for a display of feelings we hurried tom away from the barracks again i put the whole party into chaises and we soon arrived at chatham where we embarked on board of the frigate tom was given into the charge of the masteratarms as a deserter and a letter was written by captain maclean demanding a courtmartial on him what will be the result inquired i of the first lieutenant the captain says little or nothing as he was pressed as an apprentice which is contrary to act of parliament i went down to cheer tom with this intelligence and taking my leave set off for london with a light heart still i thought it better not to communicate this good news until assurance was made doubly sure i hastened to mr drummonds and detailed to them all that had passed the next day mr wharncliffe went with me to the admiralty where i had the happiness to find that all was legal and that tom could only be tried for his desertion from a manofwar and that if he could prove that he was an apprentice he would in all probability be acquitted the courtmartial was summoned three days after the letter had been received by the admiralty i hastened down to chatham to be present it was very short the desertion was proved and tom was called upon for his defence he produced his papers and proved that he was pressed before his time had expired the court was cleared for a few minutes and then reopened tom was acquitted on the ground of illegal detention contrary to act of parliament and he was free i returned my thanks to captain maclean and his officers for their kindness and left the ship with tom in the cutter ordered for me by the first lieutenant my heart swelled with gratitude at the happy result tom was silent but his feelings i could well analyse i gave to the men of the boat five guineas to drink toms health and hastening to the inn ordered the carriage and with tom who was a precious deposit for upon his welfare depended the happiness of so many i hurried to london as fast as i could stopped at the drummonds to communicate the happy intelligence and then proceeded to my own house where we slept the next morning i dressed tom in some of my clothes and we embarked in the wherry now tom said i you must keep in the background at first while i prepare them where shall we go first oh to my mother replied tom we passed through putney bridge and toms bosom heaved as he looked towards the residence of mary his heart was there poor fellow and he longed to fly to the poor girl and dry her tears but his first duty was to his parents we soon arrived abreast of the residence of the old couple and i desired tom to pull in but not turn his head round lest they should see him before i had prepared them for too much joy will kill as well as grief old tom was not at his work and all was quiet i landed and went to the house opened the door and found them both sitting by the kitchen fire in silence apparently occupied in watching the smoke as it ascended up the spacious chimney good morning to you both said i how do you find yourself mrs beazeley ah deary me replied the old woman putting her apron up to her eyes sit down jacob sit down said old tom we can talk of him now yes now that hes in heaven poor fellow interposed the old woman tell me jacob said old tom with a quivering lip did you see the last of him tell me all about it how did he look how did he behave was he soon out of his pain andjacobwhere is he buried yes yes sobbed mrs beazeley tell me where is the body of my poor child can you bear to talk about him said i yes yes we cant talk too much it does us good replied she we have done nothing but talk about him since we left him and shall till we sink down into our own graves said old tom which wont be long ive nothing to wish for now and ill never sing again thats sartain we shant last long either of us as for me continued the old man with a melancholy smile looking down at his stumps i may well say that ive two feet in the grave already but come jacob tell us all about him i will replied i and my dear mrs beazeley you must prepare yourself for different tidings than what you expect tom is not yet shot not dead shrieked the old woman not yet jacob cried old tom seizing me by the arm and squeezing it with the force of a vice as he looked me earnestly in the face he lives and i am in hopes he will be pardoned mrs beazeley sprang from her chair and seized me by the other arm i seei see by your face yes jacob he is pardoned and we shall have our tom again you are right mrs beazeley he is pardoned and will soon be here the old couple sank down on their knees beside me i left them and beckoned from the door to tom who flew up and in a moment was in their arms i assisted him to put his mother into her chair and then went out to recover myself from the agitating scene i remained about an hour outside and then returned the old couple seized me by the hands and invoked blessings on my head you must now part with tom a little while said i there are others to make happy besides yourselves very true replied old tom go my lad and comfort her come missus we mustnt forget others oh no go tom go and tell her that i dont care how soon she is my daughter tom embraced his mother and followed me to the boat we pulled up against the tide and were soon at putney tom you had better stay in the boat i will either come or send for you it was very unwillingly that tom consented but i overruled his entreaties and he remained i walked to marys house and entered she was up in the little parlour dressed in deep mourning when i entered she was looking out upon the river she turned her head and perceiving me rose to meet me you do not come to upbraid me jacob i am sure said she in a melancholy voice you are too kindhearted for that no no mary i come to comfort you if possible that is not possible look at me jacob is there not a worma cankerthat gnaws within the hollow cheek and wild flaring eye once so beautiful but too plainly told the truth mary said i sit down you know what the bible saysit is good for us to be afflicted yes yes sobbed mary i deserve all i suffer and i bow in humility but am i not too much punished jacob not that i would repine but is it not too much for me to bear when i think that i am the destroyer of one who loved me so you have not been the destroyer mary yes yes my heart tells me that i have buti tell you that you have not say mary dreadful as the punishment has been would you not kiss the rod with thankfulness if it cured you of your unfortunate disposition and prepared you to make a good wife that it has cured me jacob i can safely assert but it has also killed me as well as him but i wish not to live and i trust in a few short months to repose by his side i hope you will have your wish mary very soon but not in death merciful heavens what do you mean jacob i said you were not the destroyer of poor tomyou have not been he has not yet suffered there was an informality which has induced them to revise the sentence jacob replied mary it is cruelty to raise my hopes only to crush them again if not yet dead he is still to die i wish you had not told me so continued she bursting into tears what a state of agony and suspense must he have been in all this time and ii have caused his sufferings i trusted he had long been released from this cruel heartless world the flood of tears which followed assured me that i could safely impart the glad intelligence mary mary listen to me leave me leave me sobbed mary waving her hand no mary not until i tell you that tom is not only alive but pardoned pardoned shrieked mary yes pardoned maryfree maryand in a few minutes will be in your arms mary dropped on her knees raised her hands and eyes to heaven and then fell into a state of insensibility tom who had followed me and remained near the house had heard the shriek and could no longer retain himself he flew into the room as mary fell and i put her into his arms at the first signs of returning sensibility i left them together and went to find old stapleton to whom i was more brief in my communication stapleton continued to smoke his pipe during my narrative glad of it glad of it said he when i finished i were just thinking how all these senses brought us into trouble more than all that sense of love got me into trouble and made me kill a mangot my poor wife into trouble and drowned herand now almost shot tom and killed mary had too much of human natur latelynothing but moist eyes and empty pipes met that sergeant yesterday had a turn up tom settled one eye and old as i am ive settled the other for a time hes in bed for a fortnightcouldnt help ithuman natur i took leave of stapleton and calling in upon tom and mary shaking hands with the one and kissing the other i despatched a letter to the dominie acquainting him with what had passed and then hastened to the drummonds and imparted the happy results of my mornings work to sarah and her mother and now sarah having so successfully arranged the affairs of other people i should like to plead in my own behalf i think that after having been deprived almost wholly of your dear company for a month i deserve to be rewarded you do indeed jacob said mrs drummond and i am sure that sarah thinks so too if she will but acknowledge it i do acknowledge it mamma but what is this reward to be that you will allow your father and mother to arrange an early day for our nuptials and also allow tom and mary to be united at the same altar mamma have i not always been a dutiful daughter yes my love you have then i shall do as i am bidden by my parents jacob it will be probably the last command i receive from them and i shall obey it will that please you dear jacob that evening the day was fixed and now i must not weary the reader with a description of my feelings or of my happiness in the preparations for the ceremony sarah and i mary and tom were united on the same day and there was nothing to cloud our happiness tom took up his abode with his father and mother and mary radiant with happiness even more beautiful than ever has settled down into an excellent doting wife for sarah i hardly need say the same she was my friend from childhood she is now all that a man could hope and wish for we have been married several years and are blessed with a numerous family i am now almost at a conclusion i have only to acquaint the reader with a few particulars relative to my early friends stapleton is still alive and is wedded to his pipe which with him although the taste for tobacco has been considered as an acquired one may truly be asserted to be human nature he has two wherries with apprentices and from them gains a good livelihood without working himself he says that the boys are not as honest as i was and cheat him not a little but he consoles himself by asserting that it is nothing but human natur old tom is also strong and hearty and says that he dont intend to follow his legs for some time yet his dame he says is peaking but mary requires no assistance old tom has left off mending boats his sign is taken down for he is now comfortable when tom married i asked him what he wished to do he requested me to lend him money to purchase a lighter i made him a present of a new one just launched by mr drummonds firm but old stapleton made over to him the pounds left to him by mr turnbull and his mother brought out an equal sum from her hoards this enabled tom to purchase another lighter and now he has six or seven i forget which at all events he is well off and adding to his wealth every year they talk of removing to a better house but the old couple wish to remain old tom especially has built an arbour where the old boat stood and sits there carolling his songs and watching the crafts as they go up and down the river mr and mrs wharncliffe still continue my neighbours and dearest friends mrs turnbull died a few months back and i am now in possession of the whole property my father and motherinlaw are well and happy mr drummond will retire from business as soon as he can wind up his multifarious concerns i have but one more to speak ofthe old dominie it is now two years since i closed the eyes of this worthy man as he increased in years so did he in his abstractions of mind and the governors of the charity thought it necessary to superannuate him with a pension it was a heavy blow to the old man who asserted his capabilities to continue to instruct but people thought otherwise and he accepted my offer to take up his future residence with us upon the understanding that it was necessary that our children the eldest of whom at that time was but four years old should be instructed in latin and greek he removed to us with all his books etcetera not forgetting the formidable birch but as the children would not take to the latin of their own accord and mrs faithful would not allow the rod to be made use of the dominies occupation was gone still such was the force of habit that he never went without the latin grammar in his pocket and i have often watched him sitting down in the poultryyard fancying i presume that he was in his school there would he decline construe and conjugate aloud his only witnesses being the poultry who would now and then raise a gobble gobble gobble while the ducks with their quack quack quack were still more impertinent in their replies a sketch of him in this position has been taken by sarah and now hangs over the mantelpiece of my study between two of mr turnbulls drawings one of an iceberg on the th of august and the other showing the dangerous position of the camel whaler jammed between the floe of ice in latitude and longitude reader i have now finished my narrative there are two morals i trust to be drawn from the events of my life one of which is that in society we naturally depend upon each other for support and that he who would assert his independence throws himself out of the current which bears to advancement the other is that with the advantages of good education and good principle although it cannot be expected that everyone will be so fortunate as i have been still there is every reasonable hope and every right to expect that we shall do well in this world thrown up as the dominie expressed himself as a tangled weed from the river you have seen the orphan and charityboy rise to wealth and consideration you have seen how he who was friendless secured to himself the warmest friends he who required everything from others became in a situation to protect and assist in return he who could not call one individual his relation united to the object of his attachment and blessed with a numerous family and to amass all these advantages and this sum of happiness the only capital with which he embarked was a good education and good principles reader farewell
