edition of olla podrida does not include the diary on the continent which appeared first in the metropolitan magazine as the diary of a blase continued in the new monthly magazine as confessions and opinions of ralph the restless marryat himself described the diary as very good magazine stuff and it has no fitting place in an edition of his novels from which the diary in america is also excluded the space thus created is occupied by the gipsy the fairy's wand and a rencontre which i have ventured to print here in spite the author's protesta that the original edition of olla podrida contained all the miscellaneous matter contributed by him to periodicals that he wished to acknowledge as his writing the statement may be regarded as a challenge to his editors to produce something worthy and i certainly consider that the gipsy is superior to some of his fragments and may be paired as a comedy with the monk of seville as a tragedy footnote a preface to first edition of op printed below but i have not attempted any systematic search for scraps the fairy's wand was published in the same year as and probably later than olla podrida itself and need not therefore be considered as disavowed and rejected by him a rencontre was always reprinted and acknowledged by its author being for no ostensible reason bound up with joseph rushbrook or the poacher this seems the most appropriate occasion to supplement and in some measure to correct the list of novels contributed to periodicals by marryat which i compiled from statements in the life and letters by florence marryat also

magazine and a rencontre from the first edition of the poacher r b j author's preface to the first edition i have not yet ventured upon a preface to any of my writings and i did not expect that i should ever have written one except in a work of importance which may demand it a preface is generally speaking a request for indulgence which never will be accorded or an explanation to which the public is indifferent it is only when an explanation is due to the public or to the author's reputation that he should venture to offer one if a work is well written the public are satisfied if not they have just cause to feel otherwise and if an author obtains justice he obtains all that he has a right to expect i write this preface because i consider that it may save me from a hasty remark or two which it may be just as well to forestall during the ten years which i have taken up the pen i have furnished miscellaneous matter to various periodicals which if it were all collected together would swell into many volumes among it as must be the case under the circumstances in which it was written there is some which i consider tolerable but the major portion is but indifferent and i should be very sorry indeed if at any future time when i may not have the power to prevent it all these articles should be collected and printed as mine if ever it were done it certainly would not be by my friends i wish it therefore to be understood that in the portions of these volumes which consist of republications i have selected from the mass all that i wish to acknowledge as my writing and that the remainder with the exception of the papers on nautical subjects which are of no interest to the general reader may be considered as disavowed and rejected the major part of these volumes consist of a diary written when i was on the continent it first appeared in the periodicals under the title of a diary of a blase the title was a bad one as i did not write up to the character i have therefore for want of a better name simply called it a diary on the continent and i mention this that i may not be accused of having intentionally deceived f m the monk of seville a play in five acts dramatis personae anselmo don gaspar a monk disguised as a cavalier don felix a spanish nobleman don perez do superior of the monastery antonio servant to don gasper manuel a monk jacobo porter to the monastery sancho servant to don perez donna inez a noble lady isidora her niece donna serafina beppa servant to serafina both wives of antonio nina do to isidora monks choristers attendants c scene laid in seville olla podrida the monk of seville act i scene i enter don felix and don perez felix you say his name's don gaspar perez so he styles himself but of what house parentage or country cannot be gained he keeps aloof from all bears himself gallantly and 'tis manifest that any question discourteously put he'd answer with his sword felix he's skill'd in fence then perez there's none to match him i who have foiled half seville am but a scholar in his hands when at the school we've joined the assault in courtesy felix a proper man perez beyond comparison he hath all the stamp of true nobility pride in his eye in his address dignified in modes most perfect the most envied of the men and the most admired by all the dames of seville felix successful then perez he confides in none and hath no intimate but i am informed he is resistless and i much suspect my rival felix with the donna serafina perez even so she has changed much of late and i have discovered that one who from report answers to his description is highly favoured felix but perez did you not tell me you had left her perez in faith i had but when i discovered that another sought her my passion then returned and now that she rejects me i dote upon her more than ever felix perez when will you be wise when will you cease to trifle with the sex perez never i hope women are my game and i live but on the chase sighs oaths and amorous ditties are my ammunition my guitar is my fowling piece and you must acknowledge that i seldom miss my aim felix i grant it perez but it's cruel sport and quite unworthy of a cavalier how many wounded birds have hid themselves to die perez poor things why did they not keep out of shot range it's useless to preach felix i must have my amusement felix be careful perez that it prove not dangerous there is no honour gained by broken vows false oaths and tampering with maidens' hearts it is a fault in you i would were mended and our relationship makes me thus free to speak my mind it is unworthy of you perez but sufficing good for women they are but playthings and thus far am i renegade that with the prophet i cannot allow them souls felix you are incorrigible change the discourse or i shall lose my temper and that opinion of you which 'gainst my better sense i fain would keep our subject was don gaspar perez yes and my object is to find out who he is and if basely born to hunt him out of seville felix that there's mystery is evident but when you hunt see if such quarry good perez turn not to bay but new in seville i ne'er have encountered this prodigy if his rank be mere assumption he must be exposed yet perez there may be many causes for an incognito our spain is wide and well peopled with those who boast high ancestry perez if then so wide there's room for him elsewhere but here comes sancho with intelligence enter sancho how now sancho what have you discovered san affectedly i am not quite a fool santa petronila knows that good sirs not quite a fool i think you are fortunate in your servant you'll excuse me but i have seen the person whom you mentioned perez well san i have seen him sir by saint petronila perez and spoke to him i trust san yes sir and by the same holy saint i have spoken to him perez to what purpose have you spoken to this antonio san to your purpose sir perez what did he tell you i cry your patience felix but this mule cannot be driven what did he tell you sirrah san you do not know what first i said to him would you have the answer before the question perez well what said you first to him san with all good courtesy i wished him a good morning he did the same to me perez well san i then discoursed about saint petronila the wind the pope and the weather no i recollect it was the weather before the saint i think yes i am sure it was how the saint brought in the wine i know not but we proceeded on to wine and women which last discourse made us thirsty so we adjourned into a wine house saint petronila shrive me when we became most intimate and after much beating about the bush i discovered that his master perez who what san don gaspar sir perez idiot is that all san no only half i found out more without him he finished off his wine and left me without any more information declaring that was all he knew himself and that he had to meet a lady let me alone for finding out saint petronila be my guide i watched him and as i turned the corner found him in close whispering with the senora beppa perez the attendant of donna serafina then are my doubts confirmed treacherous sex but i'll be revenged did you speak to them san not when antonio was there i never interfere between man and wife the blessed saint knows that perez his wife san yes his wife but when antonio quitted her i then accosted her and to my cross questions perez she gave you crooked answers san precisely so signor and record it saint petronila she said that i was a fool perez the wisdom of the woman come felix sancho you will go home and await my return exit perez and felix san that antonio is a good fellow saint petronila assist him how he does make me laugh we were sworn friends in two hours and he promised to drink with me whenever i pleased i wonder why he never offers to pay his share of the reckoning he thinks it would affront me i suppose but when we are more intimate i'll hint the contrary excellent fellow how he did make me laugh then when next we meet i'll ask his advice about my love affair i am sadly in want of a confidant now i've only my own wit and the good saint he's a man you may trust i'll be sworn lord how he did make me laugh exit scene ii street opposite anselmo's lodgings enter antonio well i'm supposed to have as much wit as my neighbours and yet i cannot make out this master of mine he's a perfect mystery and the more i try to unriddle him the more he riddles me if i am deep he is deeper in short i am no match for him and thus i prove it in the first place he finds out everything i would conceal and conceals everything i would find out secondly he reads all my thoughts and takes care that i shall read none of his then he disappears when i turn my back and re appears before i turn my face he has discovered that i am a rogue yet retains me in his service his chamber is always locked when he goes out and i am obliged to wait below upon board wages there's some mystery about that chamber i have watched repeatedly on the staircase to see him enter but never can and when i would swear that he is not in it is i only who am out for i am summoned to his presence there's mystery when he does appear who is he don gaspar but of what family and from what part of spain no one can tell mystery upon mystery he may be the devil and i feel my conscience touched for no good ever came from the devil's wages i'll to my confessor and seek his counsel he's a good man and lenient too to such poor rogues as i but he insists that i appear each se'nnight and sum the catalogue of my offences perhaps he's right for if i staid longer away some of them as i am no scholar say half would be forgotten enter nina veiled who passed by him and exit there's a nice girl what a foot and ankle now had my master seen her there had been a job for me to dog her home we lacqueys are like sporting dogs we follow up the game and when they stop their running make a dead point until our masters bag them for themselves nina returns enter she's coming back this time i'll poach a little for myself fair lady can i serve you nina stops but turns away

custom aloud will you not answer i love you madam have loved you long and by my soul ne'er said so much before to any woman breathing nina turns round and lifts her veil antonio turns away aside by

ever saw with a foot and ankle so pretty as my nina's and the more i looked at you the more your sweet figure reminded me of yourself in fact it was your likeness to yourself that created the first emotion in my widowed heart had i fallen in love with anybody else my dearest nina you might have cause for anger but i assert to fall in love with my own wife proves me a paragon of fidelity nina o lopez could i but believe you antonio turns away and takes out his handkerchief aside as my master says turning to nina lay bare my heart my nina read each thought and there your image deeply graven

masters reminded me of your dear self i could not bear it so i changed my name nina dear lopez and do you really tell the truth antonio kisses her enter beppa ant by this kiss i do bep aside so so

called you lopez ant she did i would not give my name no other shall call me dear antonio excepting my own true lawful wife bep turning away with indifference and putting the purse in her pocket well allowing all this to be true and that's of no great importance what a villain is your master sir to pay his court unto another when he vows fidelity to my mistress donna serafina ant upon my honour i've enough to do to defend myself though i must confess that his conduct is infamous bep i'll to my mistress and make known his treachery going ant do no such thing bad news though true is never paid

senora 'tis not time isid 'tis more than time i heard the convent bell strike long ago nina 'twas not the hour of night but the sad toll announcing some high obsequy isid yet still 'tis time he came nina and here he would have been but you forget you chided him for venturing so early your aunt had not retired when last he came isid he does not wish to come i will not see him tell him my resolution exit petulantly nina following enter gaspar in the dress of a cavalier i overheard her vented thoughts poor girl she counts the minutes by her throbbing heart and that beats time too fast now will she hang her head and weep awhile like flow'rets waiting for the morning sun that raise their mournful heads at his approach and every dew drop like a diamond glistens while they exhale sweet perfume in their joy so at our meeting smiling through her tears will she appear more fresh and beautiful re enter isidora and nina as they appear gaspar retires isid the moon's so bright that faintly you discover the little stars which stud th' unclouded heav'n the wind but scarcely moves the trembling aspen and not a sound breaks through the still of night all nature's hush'd and every passion lull'd save love or fierce revenge is this a night to stay away false yet loved don gaspar nina be patient lady he will soon be here isid he cannot sure be false perchance some danger hangs upon his steps men are so envious of the fair and good nina looking senora look i see him in the distance isid he comes where nina o yes that is he well now i'll tease him nina quickly in i vow i will not show myself this night exit isidora nina i wish i had ten ducats on the hazard exit nina gaspar sings to his guitar without song mournful strain the mocking moon doth coldly fling her rays upon my breast of flame and echo mocks me as i sing o my guitar to thee what shame she answers not though thy best string is loudly hymning forth her name isidora isidora isidora appears at the balcony a livelier strain no more the moon doth mock me now her bright rays glad my breast of flame and echo beautiful art thou o my guitar to thee no shame she comes love throned upon her brow my strings hymn forth once more her name isidora isidora enter gaspar who approaches balcony isid why hast thou staid so late did but the moon turn on my anxious features her soft rays thou wouldst perceive how fretfulness and tears have doubled every minute of thine absence gasp and would 'twere day that thou sweet love mightst see the fervid passion stamp'd upon my brow i dared not disobey thy late command yet did i fret and champ the bit of duty like some proud battle steed arching his neck spurning the earth impatient for the fray so my young heart throbs with its new delight that it e'en now would burst its cords asunder and make one joyous bound into thy bosom isid say gaspar dost thou fondly truly love me gasp do i love thee isidora if it were not for thee sweet love the world would be a blank and this existence a dreary void i would not stumble through but having thee a paradise it is so full of perfumed airs and flow'rets sweet i would resist the angel's flaming sword if it were raised between our plighted loves ere i would be from thy loved presence thrust thou art the heav'n of my idolatry for thee i live and move for thee i breathe for thee and for thy love if thou knew'st all isid i would know all there's mystery about thee gaspar thine image here's so deeply graven that nought can e'er efface it trust me then love as i would thee there's not a thought i own no not a fond emotion of my soul not e'en the slightest ripple o'er the mind when calm and pensive as it used to be but i would tell it thee o couldst thou view my heart and see thyself so firmly master of its deep recesses thou wouldst be confident if thou shouldst be ignoble fear not me love shall draw out thy patent of descent and trace thy ancestry to more than mortal if thou hast hated and hast found revenge yet fear not me dear gaspar whate'er priests say it is a noble passion and holds an empire in the heart of man equal in strength and dignity with love be it a tale of sorrow or of crime o say 'tis not the last still let me share it that i may comfort thee whene'er we meet and mourn it only when i grieve thine absence gasp my isidora oft thou'st press'd me thus since thou wilt hear it then it shall be told but one sad chance most fatal to us both is fetter'd to it isid and what is that my gaspar gasp that once reveal'd we ne'er may meet again isid then i'll not hear't away with prying thoughts so fraught with mischief not to see thee more then might the angel pour the vial out that vial of fierce wrath which is to quench the sun the moon the host of stars in blood not see thee more then may they work my shroud and cull the flowers to strew my maiden corpse without thee gaspar i should surely die wert thou the ruler of the universe commanding all i could not love thee more wert thou a branded slave from bondage 'scap'd 'tis now too late i could not love thee less gasp aside one soul so pure redeems a world of sin thou heav'n that i have mock'd o hear me now and spare let her not feel the bitter pangs of disappointed love draw the barb gently that she may sigh her soul away and sleep throughout her passage to a better world isid what say'st thou gaspar gasp i call'd down blessings loveliest on thy head heav'n grant my prayers isid i too have pray'd for thee and will again but speak to me why didst thou come so late how short methinks are nights there's hardly time for those who've toil'd to gain their needful rest for those who wake to whisper half their love gasp night is our day and day becomes our night love changes all o'er nature rules supreme alters her seasons mocks her wisest laws and like the prophet checks the planet's course but from this world of hate the night has fled and i must hie me hence o isidora though my seeming's doubtful yet remember 'tis true as heaven i love thee isid i'm sure thou dost and feeling thus assured i am content enter nina hastily from balcony nina madam the lady inez pass'd your door and passing tried the bolt e'en now i hear her footsteps in the corridor isid we must away dear gaspar fare thee well nina shall tell thee when we next can meet exit isidora and nina at balcony gasp so parts the miser from his hoarded wealth and eyes the casket when the keys are turn'd i must away the world e'en now awakes and the wan moon like some tired sentinel his vigil o'er sinks down beneath yon trees the morning mist already seeks the skies ascending straight like infant's prayers or souls of holy martyrs i must away the world will not revolve another hour ere hives of men will pour their millions forth to seek their food by labour or supply their wants by plunder flattery or deceit avarice again will count the dream'd of hoards envy and rancour stab whilst sobbing charity will bind the fest'ring wounds that

difficulties aloud what love a married woman for shame sancho i had thought better of you san i loved her years before she married and since the marriage her husband has deserted her and i have met her often nina for that's her name has often told me how much she repented of her marriage with the fellow and could i prove that he were dead she'd marry me saint petronila directing her and make a wiser choice in second wedlock ant aside the cockatrice aloud sancho i knew this lopez he is not quite the person you describe but never mind yesterday he came to seville and told me how much

lopez was a noisy braggadocio last night we had some words whilst waiting near the gate of donna serafina from words we came to weapons and by a lucky thrust i sent his prying soul the devil knows where his body i secreted in the garden san i envy you would he were alive again that i might kill him too my guardian saint assisting i should be the better welcome ant indeed san not that it matters i am convinced she loves me well i'll to her straight and with these welcome tidings make her right happy ant not quite so fast when that you tell her she will ask for proofs and from whence you had your information san why that is true and she'll never rest till she worms the secret from me saint petronila lock my breast ant therefore sancho it must appear as if there was no secret tell her 'twas by your hand that lopez fell i am content that you shall have with her all the credit of the deed she'll love you better san why so she will my dear antonio you are like my holy saint a friend indeed ant if she doubts the fact you'll come to me i'll give you proofs most positive san thanks thanks ant now take advice women like eels are rather slippery already she has once slipped through

i often call upon the saints gasp i trust thou dost and not as i have heard that worldlings do invoke them in mere blasphemy ant nay father when i call i am sincere gasp thou dost evade i fear with double meaning but to the purpose by what sins hast thou since last we met endanger'd thy poor soul ant father my mind is ill at ease i serve a master most equivocal a false one in all he says and does in love in everything i know not what to think he's here and there in fact i do believe he is the devil gasp give me the grounds for this thy strange suspicion ant he keeps his chamber lock'd his haunts unknown he comes when least expected how he comes i cannot tell he goes and heaven knows where i ne'er can make him out with all my prying gasp it would appear thy master doth not trust thee why should'st thou watch and seek to find out that he would conceal this base prying nature is a dark sin and must be check'd by penance hast thou no more ant yes father i've a grievous fault to tell one that i'm fearful thou wilt much abhor an accident 'tis true and most unlucky i have two wives in seville gasp two wives thou hast profaned the holy rite what wedded twice and say 'twas accident

three years since i did wed the second i had forgot my memory is so bad i wedded was before till yesterday i chanced to meet with both of them in seville gasp thy memory's most convenient but the law will not o'erlook thy crime when it is known ant we'll leave it to the law then please thee father the sin is one that carries its own penance gasp how could'st thou venture on so foul a deed ant example holy father bad example it is our masters who do ruin us my present one for instance loves two ladies and woos them both sad reprobate he is gasp another's fault can't sanctify thine own else all th' ordinances of our church were useless thou art more knave than fool antonio and yet made up of both for this thy crime i have no absolution haste thee hence and tremble at thy state of sad perdition exit gaspar ant looking after him more knave than fool why yes that's true what a scurvy fellow no absolution i shall take the liberty of changing my confessor so good sir i give you your warning must not pry either does he not pry into my conscience as far as he can why his whole life is a life of prying i have no opinion of these monks they're no better than they should be the law

felix and perez meeting felix perez well met i hoped to find you have you discovered who your rival may be and what answer have you gained from donna serafina to your most urgent pleadings perez confusion light upon her she hath returned my letter without opening it and sent a request that i will desist from useless persecution beppa her confidante i have contrived to parley with and what with bribes and much entreaty i have ascertained that this don gaspar is the rival who supplants me felix i doubt it perez doubt it much i too have gained some information from sancho who associates much with one nina isidora's favoured woman from this source i've learned that this don gaspar is her favoured cavalier and that last night they had a meeting perez yet i am sure my knowledge is correct and that the donna serafina grants him those favours which i consider are but due to me felix why what a conscientious cavalier is this who thus monopolises all our beauties i fain would see him what is he like his properties must be wondrous indeed where is he to be met perez he often passes this way to the prado i wish to meet him also but not in courtesy indeed see here he comes enter don gaspar and as he would pass by perez steps before him gaspar moves on one side and perez again intercepts him gasp don perez at first i imagined this was accident but now your conduct will admit no such interpretation do you dispute my passage perez i do until we have had some little parley gasp then sir your parley be brief indeed i know not what there is between us that demands it perez i believe don gaspar that you woo a lady gasp 'tis not impossible perez you will oblige me if you cease to woo gasp don perez i never brook affront what has already passed demands a deadly meeting but to reply to your strange request who is the lady i am commanded not to woo and upon what grounds perez the lady is the donna serafina i grant a fickle yet a lovely one you call yourself don gaspar who is this don gaspar that ruffles thus with our nobility detail your ancestry and lineage of what family are you where are your possessions show me the patent of your descent or else gasp or else don perez perez i publish you through seville gasp then do it quickly you've no time to lose first let me tell you sir that had not reasons and those the most cogent ones forced me to hide my quality i had not so long submitted to the doubts which are abroad still my secret is mine own and shall remain so who and what i am don perez you shall never know you have not long to live and now sir let me pass we meet again when least you wish it felix perez indeed you are to blame don gaspar has the right of every man to wear the incognito either from choice or from necessity he has never intruded on your company bears himself correctly and wears the form and stamp of true nobility thus much in justice must i say if you must quarrel let your cause be good gasp sir i thank you bowing to don felix perez still do i hold my words and challenge him impostor gasp did you retract them it would not avail but time is pressing and i cannot wait perez when do we meet again gasp i said before when least you wish it to don felix signor farewell exit gaspar perez by heavens i hold him craven do you think that i shall hear from him felix hear from him i saw no signs of fear but much of rage and that but ill suppressed in faith he is a noble cavalier you'll hear and see and suffer from him too or i mistake perez what did he say when least i wished it felix those were his words perez they're pregnant with some meaning felix no doubt we'll ravel out this mystery as we walk come to the prado this smiling day will bring the fair ones forth come come exeunt scene iv a street before anselmo's lodgings enter antonio what with the messages from my master's two mistresses i am not a little puzzled to keep my two wives apart i have spread a report of my absence by another channel which will reach nina and unless she comes for my effects which beppa surely would there is no fear now must i wait for sancho enter beppa bep one is as sure to find you standing here as to find the figure of our lady in the church ant i wish the likeness went further and that the same presents were offered to me i should be rich bep you will never be rich you are not honest ant it is my poverty has made me otherwise bep and while you are otherwise you will be poor you shut the only gate by which riches can enter ant and yet good wife i have occasionally seen great rogues amass great wealth bep castles built upon the sand without a good foundation a pile of industry heaped up in vain but i have known you long and it is useless to reason with you ant pray may i ask what has made you in such a sermonising humour to day bep no but you may hear why i am come to you i am sent to know if your rogue of a master comes to my lady to night ant he does to the best of my knowledge and belief enter sancho ant sancho i have been waiting for you to sancho aside i'll speak to you directly pointing to beppa bep i'm sure there is mischief i'll stay to plague him ant well beppa you have your answer and i have no doubt but donna serafina is impatient bep she may be but antonio i want to put a question to you now that i am here who is that girl with whom i caught you the other day that nina san saint petronila caught him with nina why he's a married man and your husband bep i know he is to my misfortune yet still he makes love to other women i caught him kissing her ant aside confound her san kissing her to antonio your most obedient then i understand why you fought her husband bep fought her husband did you say san yes and killed him a dirty rascal whose name was ant putting his hand on sancho's mouth your honour sancho recollect your oath san i had forgotten saint petronila refresh my memory but this requires some little explanation ant and you shall have it but not now all's right san all's right ant aside to sancho yes this woman's jealous of her as soon as she is gone i will explain the whole bep aside now are there knavish tricks in practice aloud you know this nina this girl of his san why yes i know the woman bep then if you do tell her she's a shameless wanton thus to seduce a married man and that antonio's wife will spoil her beauty if she come across her you understand me san why yes it is very plain by saint petronila bep husband farewell i trust you'll mend your ways exit beppa ant cursed jealous cockatrice why sancho you are serious san why yes a little i thought you were my friend but if you are only doing a friendly act for nina in getting her a husband ant my dear sancho i'll explain it all nina is virtuous it was her husband that she kissed and this alone has made that woman jealous san why should she be jealous of nina's kissing her own husband ant because that husband had my livery on and beppa swears 'twas i when lopez arrived here he wanted a situation but his clothes were so shabby he could not offer himself to any gentleman i lent him a suit of mine a very good one too and yet the wretch had the ingratitude to quarrel with me although dressed in my clothes they are on his body now when he met his wife he kissed her and beppa who was passing by thought it was i and this is the whole mystery you can ask nina how her husband was dressed when she met him and her answer will prove the truth of what i say only you must not mention a word of me or of beppa i hope you're satisfied san why yes it seems the truth ant well now sancho let me know how nina received the news of her husband's death san women are strange creatures would you believe it when i told his death saint petronila be merciful to me although she always disliked him she cried and sobbed most bitterly and when i would have consoled her she pushed me yes me sancho away saint petronila ant i almost repent of my scheme i wish it had been beppa that the fool fancied san but this did not last above ten minutes she then wiped her eyes and suffered me to kiss her ant so soon confound her he shall have her aside san o more than that when she became more tranquil she smiled hi hi hi by the lips of the holy saint she did ant aside the jezebel aloud but sancho was she quite satisfied with your assertion of his being killed san no she said she must have more proof that there might be no mistake for as she truly observed it would be an awkward thing to have two husbands ant aside it is to have two wives aloud sancho proceed san i followed your advice and told her 'twas by my hand that lopez fell saint petronila pardon me the lie ant what said she then san why at first she repulsed but then remembering that second thoughts as well as second husbands were the best she dried her eyes and was content don't you see how fresh i am with the joy ant aside and looking contemptuously on sancho confound him san what say you ant that you're a happy man did you press her hard to marry you at once as i advised you san i did and at last she promised as soon as she had seen her husband dead to marry me immediately ant now sancho i will be your friend of course i must not appear in this nor must my name be mentioned but if to morrow at dusk will suit you i'll drag his body from the place where i concealed it and lay it in the path which leads to the summer house you know where i mean just where the row of tall chestnut trees san i know exactly thank you antonio she said to morrow night she thought she would be able to come out i'll go to her immediately and make the appointment saint petronila smile on my joys of wedlock exit sancho ant how i hate women if that fool had mentioned the name of lopez the crafty beppa would have discovered the whole affair what with keeping my own secrets and finding out those of my master i have enough to do so far the former has been well managed now for the latter exit into house scene v an apartment in the guzman palace donna inez discovered seated at table inez last night again beneath my niece's window i heard that tuneful voice and if mine ears deceived me not my isidora's too as i pass'd by a light whose feeble rays shone thro' the vacancy beneath the door proved that she'd not retired i much suspect she is entangled in some web of love yet oft have i enjoin'd her to advise with me her friend and truest counsellor but 'tis in vain love ne'er would be so sweet so fondly cherish'd if not envelop'd in the veil of secrecy and good intents are oft in maidens check'd by that strange joyous fear that happy awe which agitates the breast when first the trembler receives its dangerous inmate i've summon'd her for now i must endeavour to be her confidante muses 'twere better first i made her mine and sympathy may win the treasured key which startled love would willingly retain enter isidora isid you wish my presence aside hush my tell tale heart inez hast thou slept well my child isid my dreams have been confused but not unhappy inez oh may'st thou never wake to mystery thine is a dang'rous age my isidora thou little know'st that while thy path is strew'd with flow'rs how many serpent dangers lurk beneath the sweets isid i will not stray then inez it is a happy resolution if in my youth i had been so resolved i had not loaded mine old age with care nor soak'd my pillow with remorseful tears isid i've often seen you weep and then retire nor glad me with your presence until after you had communion held with father philip then have you smiled again that is to say smiled mournfully as does the winter's sun gleaming through heavy clouds and scarce deigning to light up sober nature for the minute inez true dearest child for such is our blindness that we reject our greatest boon until we can receive support from it alone 'tis time thou should'st receive my confidence and learn the danger of clandestine love isid aside she must suspect me aloud i'm all attention inez to say i once was fair and that mine eyes were bright as thine are now were almost needless i had a mother most considerate kind to excess yet ever pointing out the path to virtue and to happiness one precept above all did she enjoin and sure 'twas little in exchange to ask for so much kindness wisely to seek her counsel ere the heart was wounded you hear me love i oft have made the same request of you isid faintly you have inez i promised faithfully as thou hast done and well i know wilt keep the promise made but virgin fear induced me to withhold my confidence until it was too late my heart was given and my troth was plighted don felipe such was his cherish'd name implored my silence our frequent meetings were sanctified by marriage then i learn'd it was an old and deadly feud that barr'd his long sought entrance to our house but soon he hoped our marriage publicly t'announce and strife of years to end and peace restore by our acknowledged union alas two days before this much sought hour my brothers were inform'd i did receive my husband in my chamber he was surprised and murder'd basely in my presence slain isid oh heavens inez they would not listen to my frantic words they would not credit our asserted union they dragg'd me to a convent in their wrath and left me to my widowhood and tears tore my sweet infant from my longing arms and while i madly scream'd and begg'd for pity the abbess spoke of penitence and prayer reason for weeks forsook me when again i was awaken'd to a cruel world they would have forced me to assume the veil isid to me that force had been most needlessly exerted what haven could the world offer so meet for such a wreck of happiness what could induce you to repel that force inez the hope that one day i might find my boy a hope which still i cherish years have fled my brothers fell by those who sought revenge and i remain'd sole scion of our noble house in line direct then did i seek my child those who attended at the birth inform'd me it had a sanguine bracelet on the wrist by threats and bribes at last i ascertained my child had been removed unto the hospital built in this city for receiving foundlings full of a mother's joy a mother's fear i hasten'd there alas to disappointment all clue of him was lost and should my boy survive the heir of guzman's noble house may be some poor mechanic's slave in anguish throws herself into a chair isidora kneels beside inez indeed 'tis dreadful i marvel not you grieve to think that he survives in hapless penury unconscious of his right perchance unfitted and if recover'd prove no source of joy but one of deep regret that a young stock which culture and the graft of education would now have loaded on each bough with fruit neglect hath left degenerate and worthless how should i joy yet dread to meet my cousin should your maternal hopes be realised inez he is my child you cannot feel the pangs which rack a mother sever'd from her own isid i've often thought how sweet that love must be where all is sanction'd nought is to conceal when hand may lock in hand heart beat with heart and the whole world may smile but not upbraid such love a sister towards a brother bears and such a mother feels towards her son i have no brother none of kin but you now dearest mother for mother you have been unto my childhood and now budding youth would that my feebleness could e'er repay your years of love o that i could console you and prove me grateful heaven ne'er be mine if these my sobbing words be not sincere inez 'tis well my child thou canst console me much let my sad tale but prove to thee a beacon and i am satisfied tell me my love hast thou no secrets hidden in thy breast isidora still kneeling covers her face with her hands hast thou fulfill'd thy oft repeated promise isid forgive me dearest aunt forgive and pity me inez last night my child i heard the sound of music methought thy name was wafted by the air with most harmonious utterance isid forgive me aunt but say that you forgive me you shall know all inez i do my isidora i forgive thee raises her but i must have thy confidence my child who is this cavalier isid alas i know not inez not know my isidora hast thou then been so unwise as to receive a stranger isid alas i have but too much for my peace inez thou lov'st him then isidora throws herself into the arms of inez and bursts into tears aside the barb has entered deeply aloud isidora come come cheer up my love i mean not to reproach all may yet be well inez kisses isidora and they separate thou say'st he is a stranger isid i only know he calls himself don gaspar i have indeed been foolish inez has he ne'er mention'd his condition his family or descent isid never and when that i would question him he answers vaguely there is some mystery inez with honest love concealment never dwells when does he come again isid to morrow even and he'll keep his word inez then will i see him fear not my love no trifling cause shall bar thy happiness be he but gentle e'en of moorish blood and honest he is thine go to thy chamber thither will i follow that we some project may devise which shall remove all obstacle exit isidora i like not this don gaspar and my heart forebodes some evil nigh i may be wrong but in my sear'd imagination he is some snake whose fascinating eyes fix'd on my trembling bird

most strange say manuel hast thou discover'd aught doth he continue steadfast and devout or borne away by youthful phantasies neglect the duties of our sacred order man he bears himself correctly and e'er since his last offence when self inflicted pain proved his contrition he hath ever seem'd to be absorb'd in holy meditation sup may this continue he's of great import to the well doing of our monastery yet he hath not of late confess'd his sins man perchance he hath not err'd forgive me heav'n rash words like these when all are born to sin i deem'd that he had nothing to confess except the warring of his youthful passions o'er which he strives to hold dominion sup i would it were so but too frequently i do perceive a furtive glance of fire from 'neath his fringed eyelash wildly start as does the lightning from a heavy cloud it doth denote strong passion much too strong for youthful resolution to control man why then permit him to behold the world and all its vanities 'tis true our coffers are somewhat help'd by that he brings to them instructing music a gift from nature in him most perfect were it not better that he within our cloister'd gates should stay sup then would he pine for our monastic vows are much too harsh too rigid save for those who having proved the world at length retire when they have lost the appetite to sin there's much depending on the boy anselmo he is a prize whose worth i little knew when first into our brotherhood he came man i comprehend you not sup thou canst not manuel but i will confide what has been reveal'd to me alone well thou know'st for years i have confess'd the donna inez from her i late have learn'd she bore a child in wedlock which she lost and by the notices which she has given i find him in anselmo man in anselmo then he's the rightful heir to all the guzman wealth sup 'tis even so man father how long since you discover'd this sup but a few months before he took his vows man why did you then permit them sup to serve our holy church which either way must gain by his belonging to our order the lady mourns her son if i restore him she must be grateful thus our convent will become endow'd with acres of broad land and should he choose still to retain his vows when he has learnt the story of his birth then will our monast'ry no doubt receive the wealth he values not but we require man i do perceive 'twas prudently arranged what wait you for sup to see if he will turn his thoughts to heav'n but look he moves this way leave me with him exit manuel and enter anselmo where hast thou been my child ans lending mine ear to those who would unload a conscience heavy with repeated sin giving advice and absolution free to those who riot in a sinful world sup yet still be lenient we in holy bonds expect not men exposed to be so perfect tell me for lately thou hast not confess'd how throbs thy heart do holy thoughts prevail art thou at peace within or does thy youth regret its vow and yield to vain repinings ans i am most holy father as heav'n made me content and not content as in their turns the good or evil thoughts will be ascendant when that the evil thoughts the mastery gain i try to curb them man can do no more sup at thy rebelling age 'tis doing much now put my question to thy inmost soul and answer me could'st thou rejoin the world and all its pleasures now so bright in fancy to youth's all

would this be a dispensation sought might be obtain'd ans at first with joy in his countenance then assuming a mournful expression it would not be a kindness who my father in this wide glorious world is kindred to anselmo i will confess i sometimes have indulged half dreaming thoughts o say not they are sinful of the sweet hours of those who lapp'd in bliss see brothers sisters offspring clust'ring round loving and loved then have i wept to think that i have none and sadly felt convinced 'tis for my happiness that i am here sup true my anselmo 'tis a dreary world and still more dreary when we've nought to cling to but say if thou hadst found a doting mother one that was nobly born and rich who hail'd in thee the foundling heir to large estates what then ans starts and after a pause i cannot say my thoughts ne'er stray'd so far father you oft the dangers have set forth of dreaming fancies which may lead astray yet do you try to tempt me by supposing that which shakes my firmness yet can never be sup we are but mortal i did wish to know thy secret thoughts and thou withhold'st them still at night come to me then shalt thou confess for i would learn the workings of thy soul ans first let me strive to calm my troubled mind i will confess to morrow sup then be it so exit superior ans 'tis strange he ne'er before essay'd me thus a doting mother wealthy too and noble o if 'twere true and i could gain my freedom but these are very dreamings hold my brain for he has conjured up a vision wild and beautiful as wild wealth ancestry a mother's love but what are these to thee thou monk anselmo go go and hang thy head within the cowl droop'd humbly on thy breast for know thou art a monk and vow'd to heav'n oh parents stern to fling me thus on fate but vows more stern that thus

impossible ans giving him money i must jacobo here's for thy wine much watching needs it jac the superior calls me brother i only wish there was brotherhood in our drinking the noble juice which mantles in his cup would cheer me in my vigils ans and that will purchase it i must be out to night let the superior have the key but do not lock the door you understand jacobo jac i do but there's danger in it holy virgin the superior comes this way anselmo you had better to your cell ans i detest it now must i play the hypocrite enter superior followed by jacobo sup observing anselmo thou here

risk it exit antonio scene iii interior of don gaspar's room enter antonio ant pugh what a heat i'm in i really tremble with delight or fear i can't tell which if he should come what shall i say oh the news i gained from beppa that will do looking round well i see nothing after all why should he keep his chamber locked but then there's that chest let me try locked fast nothing to be gained from that still he comes in by some other way than the door that's clear we must have a search for a trap door he looks round and then under the bed while he is on his knees feeling the boards don gaspar enters by the secret sliding panel and observing him draws his sword and as antonio rises he points it to his breast gasp villain how cam'st thou hither ant much alarmed sir sir i came came recovers himself i came to save your life unless it please you to take mine before i can speak to you gasp to save my life ant yes sir i knew not where to find you i thought you might be here and so i forced the lock with a rusty key i meant to say that i knew you had another way out from your chamber and i have been looking for it that i might hasten to you to save your life gasp well sirrah first prove to me that you can save my life and then perhaps i may overlook this impertinent intrusion ant sir i overheard a conversation between the valet of don felix and a woman in which they stated that bravos were hired by don perez to waylay and murder you don perez not caring to meet you with his sword this night they wait for you gasp is don perez then so basely treacherous ant indeed he is sir you must not out to night gasp i must and fear them not for this i overlook your prying nay more i will in confidence explain the secret of this chamber but mark you keep it or i shall soil my rapier with thy knavish blood this private entrance hath much served me showing the sliding panel ant may i be so bold as to ask how gasp it oft has saved my life it is about a year since and about three months before you entered my service that i gained the love of one named julia she was too fond and urged me to marry her which i refused her brothers who were at home at the time wrested from her the cause of those tears which she could not control i met them both and with ease disarmed them i did not wish to slay them i had already done them injury these officers who were more annoyed by my conquest than even their sister's shame hired bravos as perez now has done who sought to murder me each night that i went home i found them near my door twice i fought an entrance to my own house a friend who was aware of the inveteracy of those who toiled to procure my assassination hired me this chamber for months they watched the door with disappointment until the brothers being recalled to join their troops in murcia the bravos ceased their persecutions ant how did you escape them in the city senor gasp in daylight i was safe at night i wore the garb of a holy monk that lies upon that chair you'll keep my secret ant yes sir when i know it gasp have i not told it you ant you have told me that at times you are a monk and at times a cavalier which is the real character him of the rosary or him of the rapier gasp aside the knave is deep aloud i am a monk but when it suits me ant but sir is there not danger in thus assuming a holy character if it were known the inquisition gasp i grant it but we do many things which if known would subject us to something unpleasant i serve two mistresses but should i marry them both ant starting back then would you to the galleys at east gasp exactly so i merely put the case for i was told by donna isadora's maid you are her husband and this i also know from your own mouth you are married to beppa ant there's some mistake sir for nina is married to one whose name is lopez i cannot sure be he gasp if i can be both monk and cavalier as you assert why may not you be lopez and antonio a name is changed as easily as a garment but in your face i read conviction i'm certain you have two wives ant it must be as you please sir perhaps i may have confessed as much to you as a holy monk gasp laughs when did you ever meet me in a church ant i do not say i have sir but then your knowledge is so certain gasp suppose then that i know your secrets thou wilt surely not reveal mine there's for thine intelligence throws him a purse ant may heaven preserve my gracious master gasp this night must i to donna serafina's ant will you then venture forth gasp yes i'll robe myself as holy monk they dare not strike even though they have suspicion you may go i shall not return to night exit antonio scoundrel he is too cunning to believe me yet still i have the secret of his wives muses this night i have discover'd the base perez again essays his most inconstant fair blind as inconstant she rejected me when as friar anselmo teaching music i offer'd her 'tis true unholy love and i by perez was thrust out with shame spurn'd with contumely as the door was closed with threats if ever i appear'd again to blazon forth my impious attempt and yet did she cozen me with melting eyes and first roused up the demon in my breast then laugh'd in malice i hate her for it now as don gaspar i've supplanted him pride and revenge not love impelling me these gratified i would shake off a chain which now in amorous violence she'd rivet further don perez in his jealous mood has as don gaspar braved me they shall find i hold life cheap when i would have revenge exit scene iv a garden near the house of donna serafina which is in the back of the scene a balcony enter gaspar in a friar's dress over that of a cavalier i pass'd them and they bow'd unto my blessing why what a world of treachery is this who would imagine that this holy robe professing but humility and love conceal'd the cavalier swelling in pride seeking revenge and thirsting for hot blood off with this first disguise throws off friar's gown what then appears a fair proportion more deceiving still in holy garb i fret within my cell sigh for the joyous world i have renounced and spurn the creed which hath immured me there when like the chrysalis i 'scape my prison and range a free and garish butterfly i find the world so hollow base and vile that in my mood i hasten back once more with thoughts of never wand'ring forth again but see don perez comes i will retire gaspar withdraws enter perez perez fool that i am like some robb'd bird to hover about the nest that's void her heart's not mine 'tis now three moons that i have sued in vain her casement closed by night her door by day o woman woman thy mysterious power chains the whole world and men are nought but slaves unto the potent talisman if man prove false and treach'rous he is spurn'd contemn'd and punish'd with resentment just to woman faithless still we kneel and sue for that return our reason holds as worthless well this shall be my last for by yon moon so oft a witness to my fervent vows so true an emblem of inconstant beauty this night i woo her back or woo no more retires sings to his guitar unseen or beckons on chorus ere lady that you close in sleep those eyes that i would die to view think think on mine that watch and weep and on my heart that breaks for you the sun does not disdain to turn and on the meanest weed to shine that scorch'd up dies and seems to burn with love as hopelessly as mine one look one word hear hear my call o cruel can you still deny one look though it in scorn should fall one word although it bid me die perez coming forward looking up at the window after pause she will not hear nor bless me with her sight enter gaspar in cavalier's dress gasp well met don perez thus i keep my word and when you least do wish it i am here was it well done to send out hired stilettos when you had challenged me to measure swords perez aside the scoundrels then have miss'd him aloud know don gaspar i do not deem thee worthy of my steel but as we meet 'tis well defend thyself draws gasp defend thyself don perez thy best might and skill befriend thee else thy life is nought they fight round don perez falls perez i'm slain don gaspar or whoe'er thou art if thou have christian charity seek out some holy man gaspar retires he's gone gaspar with friar's gown and hood on returns to don perez gasp look up don perez knowest thou this form thou dost require some holy man to shrive thee ere thou pass away don perez answer know'st thou this form these features perez thou art the friar anselmo i have wrong'd thee and ask forgiveness o then pardon me and as thou hop'st t' enjoy eternal life feel no resentment 'gainst a dying man faintly shrive me good father for i'm sinking fast yon stream of blood will not creep on its course another foot ere i shall be no more gasp thou saw'st anselmo now raise up thine eyes throws off his disguise and see don gaspar who has just reveng'd the wrongs inflicted on the spurn'd at monk perez whoe'er thou art mysterious awful being at least be satisfied with thy revenge if thou art holy shrive me gasp i am a monk and yet not holy putting on gown and folding his arms perez if thou art a monk by vows thou'rt holy 'tis not my blood that's now upon thy hand and shall hereafter be upon thy soul which makes thee less so thou'rt but an instrument i pray thee shrive me that my guilty soul may quit in peace this tenement of clay gasp does he not speak the truth tell me my heart i think i feel i can forgive him now gaspar takes out his crucifix returns to don perez and kneeling presents it to him perez kisses the crucifix and falls back dead gaspar remains hanging over him don felix without what hoa enter don felix with servants bearing torches gasp still kneeling by the body who calls felix we seek don perez who this way did bend his steps some hours ago and not returning at th' appointed time we fear some mischief hath befallen him gasp behold then here the body of some gallant whose face i know not as i pass'd this way i heard the clash of high and fierce contention and when i came this most unhappy man lay breathing here his last i shrived him and he since has died felix it is don perez holy father saw you the other party in the contest gasp save that a manly figure flitted by and vanish'd in the shadow of yon trees felix raise up the corpse and bear it to my house this bloody work don gaspar must be thine perez thou hear'st me not but by this sword i will revenge thy death exit don felix and servants carrying body gasp thus far have i escaped suspicion now will i to the monastery casement opens and donna serafina appears at window ser who's there gasp aside i had forgotten her ser who's there gasp a father of the neighbouring monastery attracted hither by the clash of swords and but in time to shrive a dying man ser good father didst thou hear the names of those who were engaged gasp not of the murderer who has escaped the one whose body has been borne away was call'd don gaspar ser don gaspar father surely thou mistak'st it was the other cavalier who fell gasp the words of dying men are those of truth he call'd himself don gaspar and he begg'd i would take off his scarf and with his love bear it to donna serafina ser then it is true and i am lost for ever father recall those words those dreadful words say 'twas not don gaspar and i'll load thy monastery with the wealth of india its shrines shall blaze with gold and precious gems and holy relics shall be purchased thee to draw all faithful christians to thy gates gasp i cannot change the name and if i could 'twere no less a murder lady good night ser good father stop thou hast a scarf for donna serafina i am she where is it give it me gasp are you that woe struck lady serafina alas indeed you have much cause to grieve he loved you well ser give me the scarf gasp i cannot lady 'tis not fit to offer for it is tinged with blood ser give me the scarf i'll kiss away the blood or wash it off with tears gasp that i cannot the casement is too high nor can i tarry longer the last message together with the scarf i will deliver before to morrow's sun shall gild these trees ser then be it so o gaspar gaspar exit from window and closes it gasp one hour of misery like hers exceeds an age of common earthly suffering and when at last she hears the unvarnish'd truth 'twill but perplex her more oh destiny why am i thus a blood stain'd guilty man in early years still yearning towards virtue yet ever falling in the snares of vice now do i loathe the amorous serafina who sacrifices all her fame her honour at passion's shrine how do i adore the chaste the innocent sweet isidora yet in my love so ardent and so pure there's guilt deep damning guilt and more there's cruelty and baseness i plant a dagger in the fond breast that cherishes the wound nor will she feel the pain until withdrawn and happiness nay life will issue with it how inconsistent selfish treacherous heav'n pardon me how can i pardon ask for that i never can forgive myself exit gaspar act iv scene i street before anselmo's lodgings enter antonio ant at last i have his secret and one of moment too a monk and yet a cavalier a friar's gown and a gala suit vowing to heaven and vowing to the ladies abjuring the world and roaming through it with a vengeance telling his beads and telling me lies but i am not so easily to be deceived i thought very often that there was a similarity of voice between his and my confessor's but when i saw the friar's gown and he accused me of having two wives it all flashed upon me at once a pretty fool has he made of me no wonder that he knew my rogueries when i confessed them to him what's the having two wives to this mine is a paltry secret of a poor lacquey but his is one which will obtain a price and it is well to be first in the market whom shall i sell it to let me see don felix enter beppa bep what of don felix husband do you wish to serve him ant yes if he'll pay me well bep i presume don gaspar has not paid you then must you help yourself ant why so i do whenever i can but he takes care of that bep he might have done but hardly will do so now ant why not bep because he's dead ant dead are you sure of that bep quite sure for i myself beheld the contest such fierce exchange of hate i ne'er imagined or that you men were such incarnate devils ant pray tell me where this happened bep 'twas in the garden near our house under the chestnut trees deep in the shade the full moon could not pierce the closely woven foliage all her beams were caught on the topmost boughs which waved in silver a lovely night to stain with murder oh me i see them now ant proceed good beppa i'm eager to know all bep their forms were not distinct yet could we perceive their gleaming swords darting like fiery serpents 'twas horrible at last one fell it proved to be don gaspar ant indeed you're sure there's no mistake bep i saw the body borne away my mistress weeps and tears her hair nor deems that he was false i must to the church but will return again immediately exit ant now could i weep and tear my hair like donna serafina my secret is worth nothing 'tis strange too that he should be o'ermatched by don perez whose sword he so despised i cannot yet believe it and yet she saw the body and her mistress weeps what can she gain by this if 'twere deceit nothing why then 'tis plain don gaspar's dead his foot slipped i suppose and thus the vaunted skill of years will often fail through accident what's to be done now i'm executor of course here comes don felix enter don felix felix art thou the lacquey of don gaspar ant pulling out his handkerchief and putting it to his eyes i was most noble sir felix you've left him then ant he hath left me last night he fell in combat with don perez felix 'tis false he hath slain my friend whose body now lies in my house ant indeed sir may i credit this felix i tell you it is true where can a message find your master ant wherever he may be sir felix and where is that trifle not with me knave or you'll repent it sorely ant i do not trifle sir don gaspar's motions are unknown to me give me your message when he re appears i will deliver it felix then tell him he's a villain of no parentage a vile impostor whom i mean to punish that if there's manhood in him he will appoint a time and place where we may meet ant you seek his life then felix you may so construe by the message ant pardon me sir but will you risk your noble person against one but too well practised in the sword excuse me sir you're hasty there are other means more fitting for your purpose i have his secret one that will administer to your revenge and win a triumph far greater than your sword felix tell me this secret ant why should i sacrifice a liberal master whom just now you saw me weep for and that to one to whom i have no obligation felix i understand thee knave thou'lt sell it me takes out a purse ant softly don felix it bears no common price nor can i tell it here i've paid most dearly for it and from distress alone am now obliged to sell it felix and i will buy it dearly in half an hour come to my house there will i exchange a heavy purse for what you may confide to me if as you say it leads to his perdition exit felix ant so this works well and yet my conscience smites me why does it smite me because 'tis heavily laden with what this secret then must i unburthen myself of it and as till lately i have confessed to one don gaspar i will now confess to one don felix the former refused me absolution the latter offers me a purse i was right when i gave warning to my old confessor the new one is more suited to me here come my ten plagues of egypt in one enter beppa bep well antonio you have lost no time i hope what have you collected you often quote the proverb service is no inheritance ant service is no inheritance yet you would that i constituted myself my master's heir i cannot do it beppa i dare not there's something tells me it is wrong to rob so good a master i am more honest than you take me to be bep then is the devil turned saint think not that you deceive me there's nought but cowardice that will prevent your knavery now tell me how long have you been thus scrupulous ant ever since i found out that my master was not dead bep not dead ant don perez 'twas who fell bep a holy friar who shrived the dying man told me the name of him who fell was gaspar ant he was a holy friar said you i see it all aside bep he said he had a scarf to give to donna serafina at the request of him who died ant hath he delivered it bep no and donna serafina in frantic grief awaits his coming ant aside she'll wait till doomsday i understand it all aloud beppa don gaspar now will soon be here go and console your mistress bep then it must have been a plan of don gaspar's to rid himself of my mistress i do not understand it but believe you do when master and man are so much alike they cannot deceive each other i'll to donna serafina and tell her of this base stratagem which with his wooing of another will make her cease to grieve for the treacherous villain and turn her ardent love to deadly hate exit beppa ant as i have mine for you i was about to say only i do not recollect that i ever loved you i think i married her to keep myself from starving but i forget why exactly 'tis so long ago what a fool is a man who marries but a double fool is he who like me am doubly i can't bear to mention it exit antonio scene ii donna serafina's chamber donna serafina discovered ser they tell me i am fair yet what avails this gift of nature could those who envy me but see my heart my bleeding lacerated breaking heart how would their bitter nature change to pity i did require but him in this wide world my beauty valued but to gain his love my wealth rejoiced in but to share with him he was my all and every other 'vantage was but of value as subservient to him as is the gold of costly workmanship round the fair gem imbedded in the centre oh gaspar were i sure i could o'ertake thy spirit soaring up in its young flight this little steel should free my anxious soul to join thine in the high empyrean and fondly link'd in joy ascend to heaven why waits the friar some idle mummery to him more sacred than my gaspar's relic from his dull memory hath chased his promise why waits my woman whom i have despatch'd to learn the history of my gaspar's death alas alas they know not love enter beppa bep madam i've news for you but news so strange that i can scarce impart it dry your tears nor more lament don gaspar for he lives ser he lives say that again you said he lived did you not beppa then may heav'n reward you for those blissful words he lives support me faints in beppa's arms bep i should have first inform'd her he was false now will the shock be greater dear lady serafina recovering gradually ser faintly now do i feel like some poor criminal who having closed his eyes to look no more upon the world he is about to leave with curdling blood and faint and flutt'ring pulse waits for the last terrific moment when the sharp axe shall free his trembling soul so wakes he at the distant shouts of men rolling the waves of sound until they dash against his worn out sense the glad reprieve don gaspar lives oh heav'n i thank thee bep at the cup's brim the sweets have kiss'd your lips but madam like some weak distemper'd child you've yet to taste the nauseous dreaded draught which is to cure you ser what mean you cure me bep 'tis true don gaspar lives as true he's false ser false beppa false bep most false and treacherous he loves another ser after a pause did i hear rightly impossible it was but three days gone he swore such oaths if true as heav'n would register should they prove false as hell might chuckle at bep and yet it is so i am most assured ser if it be true then everything is false it cannot cannot be have i not lavish'd all i could bestow myself and mine rejected all to live within his arms to breathe one breath with him and dwell in ecstasy upon his words oh no he is not false you must belie him bep nay i would i did i wonder not your doting heart rejects such monstrous treachery yet it is true and true as curs'd the donna isidora by her charms has won him and his feign'd death was but a stratagem to shake you off as you last night asserted perez fell don felix swearing vengeance seeks don gaspar ser after a pause who is this isidora bep a lovely creature in her early bloom the noble blood of guzman in her veins a rival worthy of your beauty madam and therefore one most dangerous ser would that i had her here my heart is now so full of anger malice and fierce hate with all those direful and envenom'd passions by which the breasts of demons are infected if i but even look'd upon her face my scorching breath would wither up her charms like adder's poison would i had her here bep yet blame her not she's good and beautiful report doth much commend her early worth and ever active charity ser were she not so i yet might have retain'd my truant love each virtue that she hath with me's a vice each charm deformity they are my foes array'd against my power and i must hate them as they've vanquish'd me bep but my hate should fall on gaspar lady ser that's not so easy the strong tide of love though check'd still flows against the adverse hate in their opposing strife my troubled breast heaves as the elements in wild commotion bep it must not last i've much to tell you yet of this base man when you have heard it all a rapid flood of rage shall sweep its course lash'd by the storm raised in your much wrong'd soul o'erwhelming all remorse to gaspar's ruin ser direct me heav'n come to my chamber beppa i must unrobe me when my swollen heart can throb more freely i will hear your tale come on good beppa exeunt scene iii street in seville enter antonio ant this is a strange world what a simpleton is this don felix first he buys my secret at a heavy price and then after two minutes' deliberation declares that he will make no use of it but that i must deliver the message that he gave me i've no objection i like to see my betters dismiss each other to the next world the more room for those who remain behind and poor rogues like me are not so much jostled this world is certainly much too full for comfort ah here comes one that stands a chance of going out of it enter don gaspar gasp antonio i must for a time remain concealed don perez is no more and in this friar's gown which i put on to elude the bravos i have convinced the donna serafina of my death thus do i rid myself of her unwelcome love remember should you meet your wife i don't know which of them you will keep my secret you will remain here in charge till i return ant most certainly sir but i had almost forgotten i have a message which may interfere with your departure gasp from whom ant don felix sir the friend of him you slew last night gasp well what is this message ant one sir that will demand a life or yours or his it is so coarsely worded that i dare not give it it will too much provoke you gasp give it me straight and let me have it word for word ant he told me first sir that you were a villain gasp catching antonio by the throat how sirrah ant it was not i who said so 'twas don felix gasp true i was hasty now proceed ant a villain of no parentage gasp what scoundrel ant i have said too much sir you'll excuse the rest gasp much irritated no no no go on leave out a word and i will murder you ant aside then i stand a bad chance either way not so amusing as i thought aloud he did say something else but 'twas of no moment gasp putting his hand to his sword your message to the letter ant a vile impostor gasp striking him how ant oh mercy sir you take me for don felix gasp i am wrong throws his purse to antonio you said a villain of no parentage a vile impostor ha was there any more ant yes sir and which i think i may deliver without farther danger to myself he added if there's manhood in him he will appoint a time and place when and where i may meet him gasp i ask no better tell him this evening at the copse of trees where perez fell he may expect me take my answer straight ant shall i go now gasp yes fly to his house tell him from me no no tell him no more than i have said already i'll wait for your return haste haste exit antonio a villain of no parentage impostor a vile impostor he but states the truth yet will i crush him that he hath stumbled on that truth yes of no parentage why why is this constant pining of the heart as if it felt itself defrauded still of rights inherent if i'm basely born why do i spurn the common herd of men the eaglet that regains its liberty soars to the sun at once it is its nature while meaner birds would hop from spray to spray oh would i had ne'er been born to morrow i intend to leave for ever her whom i love the sacred walls i hate in some far distant land to die unheeded my isidora has desired my presence and strange admits me in the open day within an hour of this she will receive me then must i falter out my last adieu this evening also i must meet don felix re enter antonio so soon return'd hast thou then seen him ant i have sir i met him as i gained the door and your message was duly delivered he answered that he would not fail and that he trusted his sword would not fail either gasp should his sword fail i must not return for many days should it not fail i return no more but having balanced thus my brief account of love and hate i'll quit fair spain for ever exit ant taking out a purse this purse is a heavy one but not so heavy as the one i received from don felix i hardly dared deliver the message but there's seldom profit without danger i will say this for my master that he knows the salve for every wound let me see one purse for my intelligence or rather for keeping my master's secret and another from don felix for betraying it and a third for a blow ah here comes beppa puts up purse hastily enter beppa bep what's that you've put into your pocket ant only an empty purse bep it appeared to me well filled ant appearances are very deceitful how is your mistress bep alas she has watched all night now the tears pouring down her cheeks whilst heavy sobs hindered all utterance and then would she turn to rage and pace her chamber with frantic gestures oh what a wretch is this don gaspar ant he fights this evening bep with whom ant don felix a better match for him than perez bep they say the former's skilled in fence heaven grant his sword may prove the master where do they meet ant nay that's a secret bep tell me antonio should don felix not prevail a woman's vengeance yet may reach don gaspar antonio do tell me where they meet ant it is a secret bep but i must know there is nothing i would not give to win this secret from you antonio you must tell me ant that i cannot i made a promise puts his hand to his heart bep scornfully you made a promise i know your promises too well what will you sell this secret for ant my purse of ten moidores bep then you shall have it but will you tell it truly ant honour when i have the money bep takes out purse and throws it at him then there it is i believe that you will keep a roguish contract although no other ant you're right they meet at sunset under the copse of trees where perez fell bep the copse of trees where perez fell does he not fear his ghost no he fears nothing breaking the hearts of women and piercing those of men is all the same to this fell gaspar well i have bought your secret and will make good use of it ant had you not known that it was a marketable commodity you never had purchased it you'll turn a penny never fear i must unto my master's lodgings exit bep yes to follow thy old trade of pilfering i must unto my lady and bear her this intelligence thus will i rouse the woman in her and urge her to revenge exit

perdition a monk and marry 'tis impossible each time i quit her then do i resolve never to see her more yet one hour's absence kills my resolution and each moment seems an eternity till in her presence vows i repeat that vows alone make false 'tis not in human nature to withstand against such strong temptation to fold her in my arms inhale her breath kiss tears away neither of grief nor joy but from both fountains equally o'erflowing oh 'tis a bliss indeed to gain which angels might leave their bright cerulean home and barter their eternal heaven of joy enter donna inez gaspar advances quickly to her thinking it is isidora but finding his mistake stops abruptly and bows to donna inez inez don gaspar for 'tis so i hear you're styled hither you came in ardent expectation of meeting one more suited to your age my beauteous niece the donna isidora now would i have some conference with one who by insidious means hath gain'd her heart yet shrouds himself in mystery she has placed her fortunes in my hands she resigns her all to me confiding to unlock your secret when once you're manifest and fully known a task which must precede senor it will decide whether i join your hands and bless your union or curse the fatal day she first beheld you gasp madam i thank you much i'll speak directly but i'm so overcome with wretchedness your kindness must bear with me you ask me who i am a question fair as fairly answer'd now i cannot tell inez is it you know not or you will not tell gasp i do not know and therefore cannot tell though from this hour i date my misery i am resign'd you may dismiss me with stern remonstrance at my daring love yet it is better i am of those forsaken who have no parents owing to the state a nurture most unkind a foundling child inez a foundling child aside his voice his presence and those words make my heart leap in agony gasp yes and must live to curse the hearts of those unnatural parents who could thus renounce me love conquer'd shame and brought me into being but in her turn shame triumph'd over love and i was left to destiny the bloody tigress parts not with her young her cruel nature never known to pity is by maternal feeling changed to tenderness the eyes which fiercely gleam on all creation beam softly as she views her snarling cubs but cruel man unruly passion sated leaves to neglect the offspring of his guilt i have no more to say dismiss me now and when henceforth you rail at my presumption consider the perfection that has caused it i oft have made the healthy resolution to quit for ever her whom i adore take my farewell to her your lovely niece although i'm friendless she will pity me inez aside how strange it is i feel not anger'd strange indeed there is a pulse which makes me lean to his presumptuous love

love and duty from the world's scorn i've suffer'd much and my unbending pride would rather that my birth remain'd in doubt than find a parentage which was obscure now all is perfect and to you i tender kneeling my truth and love still in their infancy and therefore may they seem to you but feeble rises yet blame me not this sudden change of state hath left me so bewilder'd i scarce know myself or what i feel like to the eyes of one long plunged in gloom on whom the sun at length admitted pours at once a flood of glorious light so are my senses dazzled inez and i am faint with

errors of an impious son to put in counterpoise the deep disgrace the insult offer'd to our brotherhood with the atonement you would make to heav'n inez and you are merciful sup lady there is nought which heav'n detests so much as sacrilege 'tis the most damn'd of all the damning sins the fire of hell can purge away all crimes howe'er atrocious save this deed of death to life eternal if not here

grace his rank and dignity sup he that hath mock'd high heav'n with sacrilege should live for nought except to make his peace your son must straight renew his broken vows with tears and penance must wash out his sin his life however long too short to plead for mercy and forgiveness and his wealth however great too small to make atonement inez father this cannot be sup it shall be so inez then i'll appeal elsewhere i'll to the king and tell him this sad story the guzmans have too well served him not to gain his help in this their need if we must pay a price the bargain shall be made with rome herself who will be less exacting sup aside i must not grasp too much or i lose all aloud lady i know your thoughts and do not blame you you are divided as frail mortals are in this imperfect state 'twixt heaven and earth your holy wishes check'd by love maternal now would i know the course that you would steer between the two we can arrange this point the church is generous and she oft resigns that she might claim in justice tell me lady what do you proffer inez there is a fair domain of great extent water'd by the guadalquiver's wave whose blushing harvests each returning autumn yield the best vintage in our favour'd land six hamlets tenanted by peaceful swains and dark eyed maidens portion'd to the soil foster its increase the fairest part of spain which heav'n hath made i render back to heav'n sup i know the land and will accept the gift but to it must be added sums of gold to pay for holy rites to be perform'd for years to purify our monastery which has been desecrated inez that will i give and freely now good father remember in exchange for these you promise to pardon all and to obtain from rome a dispensation to my truant child sup i do inez father i'll

if i'm to blame good father are not you sup how ans i had it from my mother she reveal'd to you her history and did make known the mark by which i might be recognised that mark so oft the theme of idle wonder in the convent before i took my vows you therefore must have known my station the rank i held by birthright and the name which i inherited why did you press me then to take those vows it

unceasing prayer and thy resumed vows is it not well anselmo ans isidora are racking tortures well is liquid fire rushing and bubbling through the burning veins until they shrivel well and is it well

unloose than monks to bind thou'rt answer'd isid answer'd but not content if false to vows more sacred far yet surely not more sacred for what should be more sacred than the vows which link the

know me not anselmo but till late i scarcely knew myself talk not to me of heaven's vicegerent can man absolve from compact made with god ans isidora it is now my duty t' assume the monitor and point out to thee how e'en the purest of us in our frailty may haply slide a maiden in her pride but scarce in womanhood dare to dispute the tenets of our faith strikes at the head of our religion and what for ages holy men have reverenced and believed hath been by her denounced as not her creed isid 'tis true 'tis true the sin of unbelief 'gainst which i've rail'd i fall into myself swayed by my foolish pride turns to anselmo but still as yet thou'rt bound anselmo e'en this discourse methinks is sacrilege ans nay isidora does not the father he whose spiritual sway i yet acknowledge grant me

gipsy or whose son am i a comedy in three acts dramatis personae men sir gilbert etheridge an old admiral captain etheridge his son grave captain mertoun gay old bargrove young peter bargrove his son william the admiral's sailor footman bill gipsies dick women lady etheridge the admiral's wife agnes her daughter lucy the daughter of bargrove mrs bargrove nelly the gipsy the gipsy scene the hall the residence of sir gilbert and the vicinity time that of acting act i scene i a room in a respectable country inn enter captain etheridge and captain mertoun ushered in by the landlord land will you be pleased to take anything gentlemen capt eth i can answer for myself nothing capt mer i agree and disagree with you that is i coincide with you in nothing capt eth then i trust mr harness that you will coincide with us in expediting the greasing of that radical wheel as soon as possible and let us know when the horses are put to land most certainly captain etheridge i will superintend it myself exit landlord capt eth an old butler of my father's who set up many years ago with a few hundred pounds and the etheridge arms as a sign he has done well capt mer that is to say the etheridge arms have put him on his legs and drawing corks for your father has enabled him to draw beer for himself and his customers of course he married the lady's maid capt eth no he did more wisely he married the cook capt mer with a good fat portion of kitchen stuff and a life interest of culinary knowledge i have no doubt but that he had a further benefit from your liberal father and mother capt eth by the bye i have spoken to you of my father repeatedly edward but you have not yet heard any remarks relative to my mother capt mer i take it for granted from your report of your father and my knowledge bowing of the offspring that she must be equally amiable capt eth had she been so i should not have been silent but as i have no secrets from you i must say she is not the the very paragon of perfection capt mer i am sorry for it capt eth my father disgusted with the matrimonial traps that were set for the post captain and baronet of ten thousand a year resolved as he imagined wisely to marry a woman in inferior life who having no pretensions of her own would be humble and domestic he chose one of his tenant's daughters who was demure to an excess the soft paw of the cat conceals her talons my mother turned out the very antipodes of his expectations capt mer hum capt eth without any advantages excepting her alliance with my father and a tolerable share of rural beauty she is as proud as if descended from the house of hapsburg insults her equals tramples on her inferiors and what is worse than all treats my father very ill capt mer treats him ill what he that was such a martinet such a disciplinarian on board she does not beat him capt eth no not exactly but so completely has she gained the upper hand that the admiral is as subdued as a dancing bear obeying her orders with a growl but still obeying them at her command he goads himself into a passion with whomsoever she may point as the object of his violence capt mer how completely she must have mastered him how can he submit to it capt eth habit my dear mertoun reconciles us too much and he at whose frown hundreds of gallant fellows trembled is now afraid to meet the eye of a woman to avoid anger with her he affects anger with every one else this i mention to you that you may guide your conduct towards her aware of your partiality to my sister it may be as well capt mer to hold the candle to the devil you mean your pardon etheridge for the grossness of the proverb capt eth no apology my dear fellow hold the candle when you will it will not burn before a saint and that's the truth follow my advice and i will insure you success i only wish that my amatory concerns had so promising an appearance capt mer why i never knew that you were stricken capt eth the fact is that i am not satisfied with myself and when i am away from my circe i strive all i can to drive her from my memory by change of scene absence and occupation i contrive to forget her indifferent well add to all this i have not committed myself by word or deed i have now been three years in this way but the moment i find myself within two miles of my fair one as the towers of my home rise upon my sight so rises the passion in my bosom and what i supposed i had reasoned away to a mere dwarfish penchant becomes at once a mighty sentiment capt mer that looks very like attachment three years did you say my dear brother in affliction make me your confident capt eth i intended to do so or i should not have originated the subject my father brought up the daughter of our steward bargrove with my sister agnes i have therefore known lucy from her infancy and ought i to be ashamed to say how much i am in love with her capt mer etheridge this is a point on which i am afraid my advice would not be well received capt eth of course you would imply that she must be renounced capt mer most assuredly that is my opinion on a prima facie view of the case you have your father's example capt eth i have but still there are many points in my favour bargrove is of a very old though decayed family indeed much more ancient than our own capt mer i grant you there is one difficulty removed but still your relative position he is now your father's steward capt eth that is certainly a great obstacle but on the other hand she has been really well educated capt mer another point in your favour i grant capt eth with respect to lucy herself she is capt mer as your father thought your mother perfection recollect the soft paw of the cat conceals the talons capt eth judge for yourself when you see and converse with her i presume i am to consider myself blind at all events i have decided upon nothing and have neither by word or deed allowed her to suppose an attachment on my part still it is a source of great anxiety i almost wish that she were happily married by the bye my mother hates her capt mer that's not in your favour though it is in hers capt eth and my father doats upon her capt mer that's in favour of you both capt eth now you have the whole story you may advise me as you please but remember i still preserve my veto capt mer my dear etheridge with your permission i will not advise at all your father tried in the same lottery and drew a blank you may gain the highest prize but my hopes with your sister render it a most delicate subject for my opinion your own sense must guide you capt eth unfortunately it often happens that when a man takes his feelings for a guide he walks too fast for good sense to keep pace with him capt mer at all events be not precipitate and do not advance one step which as a man of honour you may not retrace capt eth i will not if i can help it but here comes mr harness enter landlord land the horses are to captain etheridge and the wheel is in order capt eth come then edward we shall not be long getting over these last eight miles the boys know me well capt mer going out yes and the length of your purse i suspect my dear fellow exeunt ambo scene

brutal seaman warning or to avoid such a plebeian mode of expression advertise him to depart adm my dear old barnstaple has served me afloat and ashore these four and twenty years and he's a little the worse for wear and tear in a cutting out affair his sword warded off the blow that would have sacrificed my life we must overlook a little lady eth yes that's always your way always excusing a serving man to appear fuddled in the presence of lady etheridge faugh and yet not immediately to have his coat stripped off his back and be kicked out of doors or to avoid the plebeian expatriated from the portals adm expatriated lady eth how you take one up admiral you know i meant to say expatiated adm ah that is mending the phrase indeed i grant that he was a little so so but then recollect it was i who gave them the ale lady eth yes that's your way sir gilbert you spoil them all i shall never get a servant to show me proper respect i may scold scold scold or to speak more aristocratically vituperate from morning till night adm well then my dear why trouble yourself to vituperate at all as you call it keep them at a distance and leave scolding to the housekeeper lady eth housekeeper indeed no sir gilbert she's just as bad as the rest once give her way and she would treat me with disrespect and cheat you in the bargain or less plebeianly nefariously depropriate adm appropriate you mean my dear lady eth and appropriate i said admiral did i not adm why really lady eth raising her voice did i not sir gilbert adm why my dear i suppose it was a mistake of mine well my love let them appropriate a little i can afford it lady eth you can't afford it sir gilbert adm my dear lady etheridge money can but buy us luxuries and as i don't know a greater luxury than quiet i am very willing to pay for it lady eth you may be so admiral but my duty as a wife will not permit me to suffer you to squander away your money so foolishly buy quiet indeed i would have you to know sir gilbert you must first consult your wife before you can make a purchase adm yes my lady it is a fatal necessity lady eth fatal fal lal but sir gilbert you were always a spendthrift witness the bringing up of the steward's children with your own mixing the aristocratic streams with plebeian dregs sir gilbert the bargroves are constantly intruding in our house and agnes will be no gainer by keeping such company adm whose company my dear do you mean lucy bargrove's i wish all our fashionable acquaintance were only half so modest and so well informed she is a sweet girl and an ornament to any society lady eth indeed sir gilbert perhaps you intend to wear the ornament yourself a second lady etheridge he he he when you have vexed me to death or to speak more like a lady when you have inurned my mortal remains adm indeed my lady i have no idea of the kind i don't want to break the fixed resolution that i have long since made never to marry a second wife lady eth i presume you mean to imply that you have had sufficient torment in the first adm i said not so my dear i only meant to remark that i should not again venture on matrimony lady eth i can take a hint sir gilbert though i don't believe you all husbands tell their wives they'll never marry again but as dead men tell no tales so dead wives adm aside don't scold lady eth what's that sir gilbert adm nothing not worth repeating but to revert to the bargroves i think my dear when you consider their father's long and faithful services some gratitude on my part lady eth which they may live not to thank you for adm recollect my dear that the bargroves are a very old though decayed family one half of this estate was at one time the property of their ancestors it was lost by a suit in chancery lady eth then it never was rightfully theirs adm i beg your pardon there my dear chancery will as often take the property from as give it to the rightful owner bargrove is of a good old family and has some money to leave to his children lady eth out of your pocket sir gilbert adm not so bargrove has a property of his own nearly three hundred acres which has been in the family for many years lady eth ever since you afforded him the means of purchasing it adm i said many years long before my name was added to the baronetage lady eth well admiral it may be the case but still there is no excuse for your folly and mark me sir gilbert i will not have that pert minx lucy bargrove closeted with my daughter agnes as to the boy it is a downright puppy and fool or to speak less plebeianly is a non composite mentus adm peter is not clever but without education he would have been worse it is not our fault if we are not blessed with talent lucy has wit enough for both lady eth lucy again i declare admiral my nerves are lacerated or to descend to your meanness of expression it is quite shocking in a person of your age to become so infatuated with an artful hussy now sir gilbert am i to be protected or am i to submit to insult is that sea brute to remain or am i to quit the house adm aside i should prefer the latter aloud why my lady if he must go lady eth must go rings the bell yes sir gilbert and with a proper lecture from you enter william lady etheridge sits down with a wave of her hand lady eth now admiral adm william you you ought to be ashamed of yourself getting half seas over and behaving in that manner but to be sure i sent you the ale will yes your honour famous stuff it was lady eth sir gilbert adm and that's no excuse i did not tell you to get drunk and the consequence is that that without a proper apology will beg your pardon admiral and yours too my lady lady eth sir gilbert adm the fact is that without the apology in one word you you looking round at lady etheridge must take warning sir you leave this house sir will leave yer honour arter twenty five years' sarvitude lady eth sir gilbert adm yes sir leave the house damme will if yer honour hadn't given the ale i shouldn't have got into trouble lady eth rising and as she is leaving the room sir gilbert i am glad to perceive that you have a proper respect for me and for yourself exit adm william william you must be aware that i cannot permit you to remain when lady etheridge is displeased with you will first offence yer honour adm but however i'll try and get you another place as your general conduct has been correct will thank you i little thought that after twenty five years' sarvitude wipes his eyes i can always get a ship admiral adm why yes and i only wish that i had one in which to give you a good rating my good fellow but william you must be aware will yes yer honour i see how the cat jumps adm what do you mean will i sees that yer honour is no longer in command of your own ship adm you scoundrel what do you mean will lord sir gilbert we all knows how the matter be and as how you can't call your soul your own it warn't so in the menelaus when your little finger was enough to make every man jump out of his shoes you were a bit of a tartar that's sartin and now you've cotched a tartar adm you insolent scoundrel will your honour arn't angry i hope but we all pities ye we do indeed adm unbearable will and we says in the servants' hall and we be all agreed there that you be the kindest master in the world but that as for my lady adm silence sir what insolence is this out of the room immediately now if i had you on board you scoundrel i'd give you as good a four dozen as ever a fellow had in his life i was just going to pension the blackguard now i'll see him hanged first the admiral walks up and down the room in a rage william still remains behind well well even my servants laugh at pity me here i am cooled down into the quietest man in the world yet obliged to put myself in a passion whenever my wife pleases it is very hard to lose my temper and my character at her bidding but if i don't she would put herself into such a rage with me that i should be even worse off of the two evils i must choose the least but in falling in love i was a great fool and that's the truth will so you was admiral that's sartin the admiral runs at him with a stick william runs off adm scoundrel well it is the truth enter lady etheridge op lady eth what is the truth sir gilbert adm truth my lady why that when a man's intoxicated he commits great folly lady eth yes and ought to be punished for it adm aside i am sure that i have been enter agnes who runs up and kisses her father adm well agnes my little clipper where are you going this morning agnes down to the homestead papa with lucy bargrove lady eth i must request miss etheridge that you will be more select in your company a steward's daughter is not the proper companion for the house of etheridge agnes indeed mamma the society of lucy bargrove will never be prejudicial to me i wish you knew what an unassuming girl she is and yet so clever and well informed besides mamma have we not been playmates since we have been children it would be cruel to break with her now even if we felt so inclined i could not do it lady eth there admiral you feel the effect of your want of prudence of your ridiculous good nature an unequal friendship insisted upon and a mother treated with disrespect agnes indeed mamma i had no such intention i only pleaded my own cause if my father and you insist upon it much as i regret it it will be my duty to obey you lady eth miss etheridge we insist upon it adm nay lady etheridge i do not that is exactly lady etheridge looks astonished and bounces out of the room my dearest agnes i must defend poor lucy against the prejudices of your mother if i can but i'm afraid very much afraid your mother is an excellent woman but her over anxiety for your welfare agnes there was no occasion to remind me of my mother's kindness when a daughter looks into a parent's heart through the medium of her duty she should see there no error and believe no wrong adm that's a good girl now let us take a turn in the garden before dinner agnes shall i ask mamma to accompany us adm no no my love she's busy depend upon it exeunt ambo scene iv the hall of an old fashioned farming house old bar outside don't take the saddle off her boy i'll be out again in ten minutes enter bargrove poof this is indeed fine weather for the harvest we can't cut fast enough and such crops seats himself my dear where are you mrs bar outside i'm coming enters bar is dinner ready no time my dear to wait we are carrying at north breck and fifteen acre good three miles off the people will have dined before i'm back mrs bar lord bless you bargrove don't fuss can't they go on without you bar yes my dear they can but the question is if they will this fine weather mustn't be lost mrs bar nor your dinner either it will be ready in five minutes bar well well where's lucy mrs bar upstairs with miss agnes she's a sweet young lady bar yes and so mild and so good tempered mrs bar that sweet temper of hers don't come from her mother but from me bar from you mrs bar didn't i suckle her as well as master edward 'tis the milk makes the nature bar good natured you are my dear that's certain there may be something in it for look at peter he was nursed by that foolish woman sally stone when you put him away for master edward i can make nothing of peter dame mrs bar well really mr bargrove i can't find much fault in him bating that he's idle and extravagant and won't mind what's said to him and don't try to please you and talks foolishly i see no harm in the boy bar no harm heh mrs bar all this may appear improper in another but somehow it does not appear so very bad in one's own child bar he's his mother's child that's plain but i say striking his stick upon the ground he's a foolish ungrateful wicked boy mrs bar not wicked bargrove don't say that he is a little foolish i grant but then he's young and by and bye he'll grow tired of being idle bar that's what no one was ever tired of when he once took a liking to it but however i will try if i can't bring him to his senses where is he now mrs bar heaven knows he was up very early for him this morning and took a book with him so you see there are some signs of amendment bar well well we shall see but i think dinner must be ready by this time come my dear time's precious exeunt ambo enter agnes in a walking dress with lucy agnes now lucy dear i will stay no longer for your dinner is ready lucy indeed miss agnes i beg that you will not go so soon of what consequence is it when i dine i dine every day but every day i am not honoured with your company agnes nonsense honoured how you have altered in your behaviour to me lately so formal and so stiff now i quite hate you lucy indeed my heart is neither formal nor stiff but when i was familiar with you i was young and knew not the difference of our situations i do now and only pay respect to whom respect is due agnes then you have become very stupid and i shall detest you that's all your knowledge will have gained you miss lucy nay more i will not come here so often if you do not treat me as you used to do and call me agnes lucy rather than that you should stay away i will obey you but i still think that it is not right consider when we used to learn and play together i called your brother edward but how improper it would be if i were to call him so now agnes i don't think that his objections would be very decided lucy as you happen to be such a pretty girl however i'll ask him when he comes home to day lucy ah miss agnes pray pray don't mention it agnes well you are pretty enough without blushing so much i'll let you off provided you speak to me as i wish but now miss gravity i've a secret to tell you lucy a secret agnes i have found out that there's a gang of gipsies in the wood lucy is that your secret then dame fowler was let into it last night for she lost her best turkey and she frets about it very much it was the one that she intended to send to the hall on christmas day agnes but that is not the secret lucy the real secret is that i wish to have my fortune told and you must contrive with me how to manage it lucy shall i send the woman up to the hall she was here yesterday agnes no no you stupid thing lady etheridge hates the very name of a gipsy one was at the hall yesterday and she threatened her with bridewell lucy well then shall i find out where they are and we can go together agnes that's exactly what i wish lucy but it must be soon as we expect my brother and his friend belonging to the same regiment and i must not be out of the way when they arrive lucy who is this friend agnes a captain mertoun sighs i have seen him before lucy he is then acquainted with your family agnes not with my father and mother when i was at cheltenham with my aunt i met him very often there is a little secret there too lucy lucy another agnes yes another don't you long to hear it lucy smiling if you long to tell it agnes how provoking you are you know i do well then this captain mertoun is a very handsome man lucy is that all agnes no but it's something to the point because he says he is very much in love with me lucy i'll believe that who is not agnes don't be silly lucy but the last part of the secret is the most important i think lucy that i like him that is a little a very little now since my father has told me he was coming down with my brother i've been in a perfect fever i don't know why and so and so that is the reason why i wish to have my fortune told i know that it's very silly and all nonsense but still nonsense is very agreeable sometimes lucy but you will not believe a word that you are told agnes no not one word unless it happens to meet with my own wishes and then you know but i really must be gone good bye lucy remember our meeting in the wood exit agnes lucy god bless thee dearest agnes yet would that i had never seen either you or your brother what is intended in kindness is too often cruelty the kiss of affection that is implanted on the lips may take so deep a root as to entwine the heart heigho what an elegant young man is captain etheridge i recollect when we used to romp and quarrel and kiss then i had no fear of him and now if he but speaks to me i tremble and feel my face burn with blushes heigho this world demands more philosophy than is usually possessed by a girl of nineteen scene v the gipsy encampment enter nelly nelly i have been plotting my revenge on lady etheridge and i have a scheme which may succeed i must however be guided by circumstances yet by the means of this senseless fool i hope to make much mischief o here he comes enter peter good day again i have been waiting for you the stars are in the ascendant peter i thought they were up in the sky nelly exactly now let me read the lines on your face the finest gentleman in the land would give half his fortune for those lines peter then pray what is my fortune good woman nelly one that requires gold with which to cross my hand and then it would be too cheap peter gold won't a shilling do nelly i wish you good day sir i thought you were a gentleman peter well so i am but gentlemen are not always very flush of guineas however i have one here and it shall go for my fortune gives money nelly the planet georgium sidum says that you are the son of the steward and your name is bargrove peter now that is surprising nelly but georgium sidum tells not the truth peter do the stars ever lie nelly o the new ones do they have not been long in the business but the old ones never fail peter astonishing and only supposed to be bargrove's son go on good woman go on what do the old planets say nelly nay i must stop a little that is all i can see just now but more will be revealed to me by and bye what does artemidorus say in his ninety ninth chapter written in double chaldean before letters were invented peter i don't know what does he say nelly that you must gain great truths by little ones so you must tell me all you know about yourself and i shall be able to find out more peter i was educated with mr edward etheridge and when our education was completed he went into the army and i was sent home to my father's that is to mr bargrove's nelly i understand peter this mr bargrove proposed that i should accompany him every day to obtain a knowledge of agriculture and employ my evenings in keeping the accounts that i might be able to succeed him in his office of steward nelly exactly but the stars tell me that you did not like it peter couldn't bear it why my boots which i am so particular in having well polished were so loaded with clay the very first time that i could hardly lift my legs and i stumbled into a ditch filled with stinging nettles so i gave it up and the old gentleman constantly swears that i am no son of his nelly did not i the priestess of the stars tell you so peter but if i am no son of his the question is whose son am i nelly a gentleman's son no doubt but i shall discover more when i consult the stars anon you must return peter that i surely will consult the old stars if you please nelly i always do sir no dependence upon the others in fact we've quarrelled i am hardly on speaking terms with them peter speaking terms with the stars how intimate you must be nelly you'll have to cross my hand again golden truths will not come out without gold peter what gold again nelly yes another guinea one for telling you who you are not and another for telling you who you are don't you see peter one for telling me who i am not yes that's told i am not my father's son they say it's a wise man who knows his own father nelly wisely said peter and another for telling me who i am well i think that is as well worth a guinea as the other nelly better i should imagine peter yes better well good bye good woman i'll be sure to be here nelly fail not or you'll repent it exit peter the gudgeon takes the bait kindly peter peter you had always an immense swallow when sally stone nursed him she was forced to feed the little cormorant with a tablespoon as far as i can see notwithstanding his partnership education with the young squire i think the grown babe should be fed with spoon meat still but what dainty lasses are these that come this way lucy and miss etheridge how fortunate enter agnes and lucy lucy there is the woman so if you are inclined to hear her nonsense you must wait the sibyl's pleasure agnes i hope she will not keep us long or my brother will arrive before we return nelly advances nelly save you fair lady which of you will first look into futurity lucy this young lady pointing to agnes nelly then you must retire out of hearing agnes no no i have no secrets from her she must stay nelly that cannot be my art will be useless and i decline the task lucy yield to her mummery it can make no difference agnes well then lucy don't go far away lucy i'll be out of hearing but not out of sight lucy retires and amuses herself in collecting flowers nelly your name is agnes agnes laughing i know that and i am the daughter of sir gilbert of the hall come i'll help you good woman nelly i did not say the last agnes what do you mean nelly i only said that your name was agnes agnes well and i told you more than you knew nelly the stars reveal not what you assert agnes well then i do so i know more than the stars nelly you are wrong you know not so much you are not what you think you are agnes in the name of wonder what do you mean nelly i have said it let me see your hand your fate is a dark one poor young lady you will be crossed in everything agnes laughing faintly love included i suppose shall i not marry the man of my affections nelly if he is more generous than men usually are agnes i cannot understand you nelly there is a dark cloud hanging over your fate the storm will soon rage poor young lady agnes you almost frighten me speak more intelligibly nelly i have said enough agnes bargrove fare thee well agnes astonished agnes bargrove what can she mean good woman will you not tell me more nelly go home you will soon hear more from others aside the wound is given let it fester nelly retires agnes lucy lucy lucy advances lucy dear agnes how confused you are what can be the matter agnes much flurried i can hardly tell the woman was so strange i was a little surprised that's all recovering herself now lucy it's your turn nelly comes forward there good woman is your money nelly shakes her head and refuses it how very strange come lucy let her tell your fortune and then we'll go home lucy nay agnes i have no curiosity agnes i insist upon it lucy i will not be the only foolish one i shall retire until you call me lucy well then as you please i know my fortune but too well sighs agnes retires nelly looking lucy earnestly in the face for a time you are perhaps come here for amusement in olden times there were many false prophets but still some of them were true so in these days there are many who pretend to our art but really few who do possess it do you take this for a mocking matter lucy why really good woman i will not promise to believe all you may say but i shall be glad to listen to it nelly i thought as much but were i to tell you what is known only to yourself would you then credit my asserted powers lucy i should certainly feel more inclined nelly there are marks upon your person known but to yourself lucy 'tis very possible nelly can you recollect them lucy smiling incredulously can you describe them nelly to prove my power before i read your destiny i will you have a large mole beneath your right shoulder lucy starts you have a scar on your instep by falling over a sickle in your infancy nay more nelly whispers her lucy merciful heavens nelly are you satisfied lucy i'm a little frightened nelly so much to prove that i am no impostor now let me see your hand lucy holds out her hand trembling you have lost your fortune and your rank in society but you will soon regain them the cloud is dispersing from before the sun of your happiness sweet girl i wish thee joy lucy what mean you nelly others will tell you soon there are two in the secret nelly armstrong and martha bargrove lucy my mother nelly no not your mother i said martha bargrove lets go her hand lucy etheridge fare thee well exit nelly lucy o god agnes agnes agnes runs up to her agnes my dear lucy has she frightened you too lucy o yes indeed she has let us go home miss agnes i am so unhappy agnes so am i lucy i wish we had never seen the odious woman exeunt ambo arm in arm crying act ii scene i a drawing room in the hall enter captain etheridge captain mertoun and william will sir gilbert be within gunshot captain edward and i'll make sail after him i think he have the gardener in tow capt eth you will oblige me william how are you my good fellow you look dull what's the news here will why mr edward mortal bad there be a misfortune happened in the family this morning capt eth not to my father i trust capt mer not to miss etheridge will no it be mr edward that sir gilbert have given me warning and i have a month's law to find another berth captain etheridge and mertoun look at each other and laugh capt eth well william i think i can doctor that will i'se afraid not mr edward for the admiral be superseded has hauled down his flag and i'd as soon have my discharge as not putting his finger to his nose a woman be at the bottom of all mischief capt eth you observe mertoun how things are managed here now if any difference or dispute arise between my father and mother do you immediately espouse the cause of the lady recollect i'll bear you harmless capt mer i am guided by you but i'm going to observe enter sir gilbert adm my dear edward welcome again to your inheritance capt eth thanks my dear father allow me to introduce to you my most particular friend captain mertoun of our regiment adm sir you have the welcome of a father who loves all whom his children love capt mer sir gilbert i am indeed flattered by your kind expressions enter lady etheridge capt eth my dear mother permit me to renew my duty lady eth edward i have been a martyr to painful anxiety and maternal sentiment but my sighs are accomplished now that i embrace my only son turning to mertoun and curtseying haughtily your friend capt eth my friend is captain mertoun who is most anxious to pay his homage and i trust will find favour in the sight of lady etheridge capt mer that were indeed anticipating bliss bowing very low lady eth captain mertoun you may approximate our kindly feelings capt mer lady etheridge i duly appreciate the distinction aside to etheridge why don't you ask after your sister capt eth where is my sister agnes my dear mother how is it that she is not here to receive her brother lady eth indeed edward i am ashamed to say that forgetful of her aristocratic birth she has permitted herself to be seduced by bad company adm aside whew now for a breeze capt eth bad company did i hear rightly surely my lady lady eth i have said it edward and i am sorry to add that the admiral eggs her on o pardon captain mertoun the plebeian slip of the tongue i mean to say corroborates the mesalliance capt mer aside to etheridge for heaven's sake ask her to explain capt eth what would you infer my lady surely my sister cannot so far forget herself much less my father approve of such conduct adm edward this bad company is lucy bargrove lady eth yes sir gilbert i am sorry to retort before strangers but just as you have confessed it is even so my daughter has formed an unequal connection and and dissipates her rank among unequal associates capt eth i am truly glad that it is no worse my lady lady eth what can be worse sir rank is rank but your father has absorbed notions which disgrace his baronetage adm lady etheridge if i never disgrace my title by any other act i shall be proud of the manner in which i have supported it aside i won't give up this point if i can help it lady eth you hear edward i am quite cagged i am all confusion stigmatised i mean by his conduct his infatuation is quite adulterous capt eth aside now mertoun coincide with her never mind me or my father lady eth did you speak captain mertoun capt mer i did my lady but venture to express to captain etheridge my admiration of the elegance and elevation of your sentiments adm aside what the devil does he interfere for confounded puppy lady eth captain mertoun i conceive at once that you are of oh tone i am sorry that family squabbles pardon the low word captain mertoun we cannot touch pitch without being defiled looking at sir gilbert adm sorry you ever meddled with a tar lady eth i am grieved captain mertoun that domestic fractions should be promulgated on our first meeting and feel much prepossession for your corroboration of the admiral's folly capt mer i cannot but assert that his conduct is most indefensible sir gilbert allow me to take the privilege of an early friend and to express my regret at your infatuation and my hope that you will be swayed by superior judgment adm sir i am much obliged to you for your friendly and polite interference does your friend stay dinner edward lady eth admiral assuredly i trust that captain mertoun will do us the honour of taking many dinners with us at present captain mertoun you will excuse me but when you are at leisure i do not say that i will show you the grounds as sir gilbert would have expressed himself but i shall as we of the oh tone say be most happy to be your cicero exit lady etheridge adm angrily to captain mertoun and pray sir what do you mean by offering your opinion so confounded freely and disapproving of my conduct capt eth my dear father you must blame me and not him let us retire to your library and i will explain everything you will find that captain mertoun has no other object in view than the happiness of all parties adm then i can tell captain mertoun that interfering between man and wife is not the way to secure his own capt mer your son will soon offer a satisfactory explanation it is most true that the liberty i have taken with you is most essential to my happiness adm going up and lifting his cane the devil it is but not to all parties captain mertoun and i am sorry to say this to any friend of my son's but you are a d d impudent puppy and i expect satisfaction capt eth that you shall have sir from me who requested captain mertoun to follow that line of conduct do me the favour to retire to the library adm you requested him to insult your father i am not so old as to be insulted with impunity and i hope as you are a party that the explanation will be satisfactory walks about in a rage captain mertoun you'll excuse us there are the grounds and as you have been so very assiduous to fall out with me you may be equally so to fall in with lady etheridge bowing in derision very low then exit attended by captain etheridge capt mer well this is excellent that a man who is henpecked till he has not a decent feather left should be jealous about such a woman but i feel assured that etheridge will make all right i shall take the advice of the old gentleman and walk about the grounds perhaps as he says i may fall in with lady etheridge and improve my acquaintance exit scene ii the gipsy encampment in the wood nelly comes forward nelly lady etheridge you spurned me you chased me from your doors what shall humanity in any shape be worried by your pampered dogs when youth was fresh upon our brows our steps light upon the green and our hearts still more light with innocence had then the lady etheridge more admirers than the poor outcast gipsy nelly armstrong have you forgotten your origin proud lady of the hall had his partial eyes fallen upon me when sir gilbert chose his wife from among the cottage maidens and you proud lady had come hungry and in rags to my door should i have unslipped the hounds upon your cry for charity no no no you have given insult expect retaliation but here comes one of my instruments unbend eleanor armstrong from this lofty carriage and be again the miserable the cheating gipsy enter young bargrove nelly a fine morning most fortunate sir peter well my good woman have you found it out nelly what youth of a brilliant horoscope do you mean the starlit mystery it is revealed but the planets have been very cross i watched and watched and watched peter well and what did you discover nelly the discovery sir is precious golden sir golden a guinea it is worth twenty peter a bargain's a bargain there's your guinea takes out his purse and gives money and now let me have my value for it nelly i cast a trine through the rays of saturn and placing a quadrature upon his seventh house i travelled wearily through the heavens and at last this afternoon at about thirty five minutes forty nine seconds after the hour of three i discovered that your mother was wet nurse to both sir gilbert's children peter miraculous and so indeed she was nelly you were born at nearly the same time as captain etheridge and was put out to nurse to one sally stone i discovered all about this nursing and suckling in the milky way peter did the stars there tell you all this wonderful nelly yes and a great deal more but first promise me if your fate is no sordid one you will not yourself be sordid for now comes the great secret money sir money for the prophetess suppose now i should prove you a gentleman of ten thousand a year what would you give me then peter give you another guinea perhaps two holding up his purse ten thousand a year i would give you the whole purse nelly laying hold of one end of the purse then listen to me you were changed at nurse you are the son of sir gilbert etheridge of the hall peter the son of sir gilbert etheridge and changed by the nurse nelly why don't you clasp your hands turn up your eyes and thank the stars that have gained for you your patrimony peter so i will clasps his hands and lets the purse go nelly pockets it but what nurse changed me nelly why mrs bargrove to be sure who nursed you and put her own son in your place peter infamous old woman but how is this possible nelly the stars have said it peter my stars nelly yes yours peter but how am i to prove this nelly there again i can assist you did you never hear of a girl called nelly armstrong peter to be sure she nursed my sister that is she nursed lucy bargrove a sad reprobate was nelly nelly reprobate in your teeth young man speak of that person with the utmost respect for 'tis she that will appear and divulge the whole she was the accomplice of mrs bargrove but you must lose no time challenge mrs bargrove and she may confess all then hasten to lady etheridge and flinging yourself into her arms sob out upon her bosom that she is your mother peter excellent it will be quite moving i think a white handkerchief looks most interesting nelly i hope when your honour comes to your property you won't forget the gipsy woman peter forget you good woman no that i won't you shall have a right of encampment here and permission to rob any tenants upon the estate leave me exit nelly curtseying several times to the ground peter solus strutting up and down well i knew that i was a gentleman born i knew i was rubbing his hands why what a shameful trick of the old woman but i'll make her confess directly and then and then i'll pardon her for she has been very kind to me that's certain sir peter etheridge with ten thousand a year o it will sound well pray says the traveller from london to one of my tenants whose superb mansion is that sir peter's ha ha ha and that fine equipage sir peter's he he he and that beautiful lady all over jewels sir peter's ho ho ho lucky lucky sir peter hum ha i'll turn old bargrove off for his impudence that's decided and i must cease to be cheerful and familiar melancholy melancholy is your only gentlemanlike bearing as shakespeare says exit scene iii a room in the hall enter agnes with her bonnet in her hand she sits down musing agnes i never was so unhappy before for that gipsy woman has raised doubts and fears which overwhelm me lucy too has been told something that affects her deeply she never spoke during the whole way home and seemed glad to get rid of me as she ran into her father's house if this should be true and why raise such a report without foundation no one could be so wicked what a discovery at all events until the truth be ascertained i shall be miserable heigho i anticipated so much pleasure in meeting my brother and captain mertoun now what am i to do if he were to to offer to cries it would be so unhandsome knowing this report to say yes sobs and so unkind to say no o dear i'm very miserable enter sir gilbert adm why agnes the servants have been out everywhere seeking you for shame to be out of the way when you know that your brother was coming edward is much hurt at your indifference why what's the matter child you appear to have been crying my dear girl what has vexed you see here they both come enter captain etheridge and mertoun capt eth my dear agnes agnes runs up to him embraces him and then bursts into tears why what is the matter my dear sister agnes hanging on her brother's neck o i am so rejoiced to see you capt eth kisses her you look the personification of joy but agnes here is one whom you have met before is it necessary to introduce mertoun captain mertoun advances agnes o no curtseying formally to captain mertoun who offers his hand capt mer confused and apart to captain etheridge good heavens i must have displeased her capt eth aside impossible i do not comprehend it capt mer i am most happy to renew our acquaintance miss etheridge under the sanction of your parents' roof agnes inclining her head i shall always be most happy to receive my brother's friends adm agnes my love the heat has overpowered you you have hastened home too fast come out with me you'll be better soon exeunt sir gilbert and agnes capt eth what can it be she is certainly distressed capt mer her reception of me is indeed very different from what i had anticipated from the manner in which we parted i must say that either her conduct is very inconsistent or her memory very treacherous capt eth nay mertoun it is some time since you met and then not under the auspices of her father's roof make some allowances for maidenly reserve capt mer still i must say i am both mortified and disappointed capt eth i can feel for you but knowing her generous character i do not hesitate to take up her defence something presses heavily on her mind what i cannot surmise but i will see her and find it out till then wear your willow as gracefully as you do your laurels and construe nothing to your disadvantage this i ask in justice capt mer you may with confidence capt eth but here comes lady etheridge now will i hasten to agnes and leave you to pay your court though you have already made a sufficiently favourable impression yet still remember my injunctions enter lady etheridge lady etheridge my sister has just quitted the room far from well if you will permit me i will inquire after her leaving captain mertoun to cultivate your acquaintance exit capt etheridge capt mer an honour madam i have long courted lady eth o sir if your leisure is now as it were unoccupied i should be most happy to be your cicero there are such grounds capt mer ogling lady etheridge for admiration when i cast my eyes that way lady eth the quintessence of politeness i declare this way sir capt mer the arm of the humblest of your slaves offering his arm lady eth infinitely honoured exeunt ambo ceremoniously and mutually complimenting each other in dumb show scene iv a drawing room at the hall enter sir gilbert and captain etheridge capt eth well my dear father where is agnes adm she has been here just now she appears to be much distressed about something she will return directly capt eth what can have annoyed her adm that i don't know perhaps my lady etheridge she wishes her to break off with lucy bargrove but that i will resist that is that is as much as i can capt eth my dear father why do you submit to such tyranny you that have led fleets to victory to be governed by a woman a little firmness on your part would soon relieve you from your thraldom and bring my mother to a proper sense of her duties adm shaking his head too late too late edward capt eth never too late sir take courage for once and i'll answer for the success with all respect to my mother bullies are always cowards adm why really edward your advice is good and as i must always keep up a running fight i don't see why we shouldn't have a general action capt eth bravo sir a decisive engagement to your honour if you only bring decision into play i agree with you in respect to lucy bargrove heartily adm edward this girl has been so long with me and has so entwined herself about my heart that i cannot bear that she should be used ill your sister is fond of her and i dote upon her capt eth why yes sir i acknowledge that she is a nice girl but still there is a line to be drawn you would not for instance like to see her my wife adm indeed but i would edward for your own sake you would have a fair prospect of matrimonial bliss talking about marriage edward i again repeat if as you say the happiness of agnes depends upon her union with mertoun from the character you have given him i shall raise no objections but as i do think in the disposal of her children the mother has some claim to be consulted i suppose he must be permitted to follow up your plan rather a novel one of bearding the father to gain the daughter capt eth you forget sir that you are to have a general action and then it will be no longer necessary enter captain mertoun here comes mertoun adm true true i forgot that well captain mertoun i hope you have found amusement capt mer i have sir been walking with my lady who has just gone into her room to take off her bonnet enter lady etheridge and agnes lady eth i am quite exhausted with my pedestrian performance captain mertoun hands a chair she sits sir gilbert i am sorry to request that you will reprove your daughter for disobedience for notwithstanding my command of this morning i find that she has again visited lucy bargrove you say that you have no objection but i tell you it shall not be so there is an end of the matter and of the discussion and i insist upon it admiral i insist that you give her a proper lecture in my presence now sir gilbert capt eth aside now sir this is your time we'll support you adm my dear lucy is concerned i don't feel that i want any support agnes your mother has expressed her disapprobation at your visit to lucy bargrove agnes my dear father adm and i don't agree with your mother lady eth sir gilbert adm i consider lucy bargrove a very amiable good girl i am partial to her and have no objection to your visiting her whenever you please lady eth more loudly sir gilbert capt eth aside excellent sir gilbert adm i repeat again agnes that so far from agreeing with i totally disagree with lady and in this matter i will not allow her to interfere in future i intend to be master of my own house lady eth screaming sir gilbert capt eth aside the day's our own adm angrily yes my lady master of my own house and expect humility and submission on your part softening although i never shall forget that i have advanced you to the dignity of lady etheridge lady eth captain mertoun captain mertoun oh oh will nobody assist me oh lead me to my room adm edward help your mother to her room captain mertoun will assist you exeunt lady etheridge captains mertoun and etheridge manent sir gilbert and agnes adm i have my dear agnes as you perceive made a resolution to be no longer second in my own house but your good sense will point out to you that your mother deserves your respect agnes my dear father i have never believed otherwise but still i must rejoice at what has taken place as i am convinced it is for her happiness as well as for your own adm come dear let us take a walk i feel rather excited no wonder this being firm is one of the most unsteady feelings imaginable for i have no sooner come to a resolution of making a stand than i find my head running round consumedly exeunt scene v a parlour in the homestead enter dame bargrove mrs bar well i wonder whether mr bargrove intends to come home to day i never knew a man work so hard for his employer he is an honest man i will say that and there are not many wives who are in their husband's secrets can say the same aye and he's no poor man either his own property to nurse and twenty years' service with a liberal master have made him independent and our boy and girl will be none the worse for it well it has been fairly and honourably earned and there are few who can count so much and say the same i wish peter were not so idle and thoughtless it frets his father very much here he comes and i'll try if i can't reason with him enter peter bargrove with great consequence mrs bar well peter have you seen your father peter i have not yet communicated the important intelligence mrs bar why what's the matter with the boy important intelligence peter

mother i tell you to look in my face mrs bar look in your face well sir i do look in your face and a very foolish face you're making of it are you mad peter mad no mrs bargrove i'm not mad but i've discovered all mrs bar all peter yes all down on your knees and confess mrs bar confess confess what down on my knees too why you ungracious boy what do you mean enter mr bargrove unperceived who

and so you are peter etheridge are you peter i am and she knows it well old bar well but i don't i only know you as my foolish son peter bargrove and so long as you are so supposed to be i shall not permit you to insult your mother so mr peter i'll just take the liberty of giving you a little wholesome chastisement which i hope may prove beneficial old bargrove beats peter round the room while mrs bargrove tries to prevent him peter i'll tell my mother lady etheridge that i will i'll go directly peter runs off mr and mrs bargrove sit down mrs bargrove sobbing old bar panting the scoundrel enter lucy in her bonnet from walking lucy good heavens father what was all that noise mother why what is the matter old bar matter enough here's your brother peter gone out of his senses but i have

woman old bar what do you say lucy lucy nothing father old bar did you ever hear of such conduct lucy he must have been told so or he never would have been so violent old bar so violent who could have told him such a falsehood or who would have believed it for a moment but a fool like him mrs bar how could he have known anything about nelly armstrong lucy nelly armstrong did he mention her name mrs bar yes he asked me where she was and says that she was my accomplice lucy remains in thought old bar lucy why don't you comfort your mother one would think you were leagued with peter lucy i father

from a strange quarter and most strangely told i am not well father lucy bursts into tears and exit old bar after a pause looking his wife earnestly in the face why dame bargrove how is this lucy is not a fool and she is evidently of the same opinion as peter walks up and down the room and betrays much agitation dame dame if for foolish love of thine own children and i see that thou lovest the other two as well if not better than these if i say thou hast done this great wrong down on thy knees and confess it guilt can never prosper and reparation must be made mrs bar throwing herself on her knees before her husband on my knees husband i swear to you before god that these children peter and lucy were born to me and are the fruits of our marriage may i never prosper in this world and lose all hope of mercy in the next if i speak not now the truth old bar taking up his wife and kissing her i do believe thee dame thou hast ever been honest but there is mischief brewing and we must find

exeunt bill and dick nelly sola am i so fallen never to recover must i sink deeper and deeper with these villains since i joined them they have never yet attempted anything like this petty theft to support existence i have participated in but nothing more can i retreat ah when i look upon these hills and remember the time when i roved here careless innocent and happy how often do i wish that i could retrace my steps yonder is the church where i used to pray how long is it now since i have dared perform that sacred duty yet how often since i have returned to this spot have i longed to fall upon my knees but i am an outcast pride and vanity have made me so and pride has reduced me so to remain although i loathe myself and those connected with me this intention of theirs has however resolved me the deed shall not take place i will by some means warn them at the hall a letter but how to get it there it shall be done and done directly they can but murder me if i am discovered and what is my life now a burden to myself exit scene ii an ornamental shrubbery near the lodge of the hall enter peter bargrove peter what a stupid old woman not to confess after the stars had told the truth as to old bargrove i will have my revenge upon him beat me me sir peter's heir to the property how confounded strong he is the old brute out of respect to his age i did not strike him again but i should like to see just like to see the next man who will venture to lay his stick across my back now i'll to the hall and make myself known to lady etheridge how affected she will be i'll lay my life there will be a scene who comes here o the fictitious heir to the property captain bargrove as he will find himself in a very short time i must hold myself rather high it will prepare him as it were for the bad news poor fellow enter captain etheridge and mertoun from the gates of the lodge capt eth holding out his hand hail peter my good fellow how are you all at home peter turning away and folding his arms pretty well captain capt mer aside i say etheridge that's a dead cut who is your friend capt eth astonished what's the matter now i think mr peter when i offer my hand it is not very courteous in you to refuse it peter ostentatiously property captain is property you'll allow that my hand is my own and i have it in possession you'll allow that but there is other property which at present is not in my possession but which you will allow to be hereafter aside that's a hard hit capt mer property is property etheridge and to judge by his manners your friend must have an excess of it in possession capt eth property is property but i doubt if my friend has much of it in possession peter no but i hope to have capt eth well i hope so too but what's the matter with you peter peter excessively familiar capt mer upon my word etheridge i wonder at your patience who is the brute peter brute sir did you say brute capt mer yes sir i did peter then sir if you say brute i beg to observe to you sir that that capt mer what well sir peter that sir a brute is a beast sir capt mer exactly peter and if that's what you meant there's no offence now if you say brute beast capt mer well sir i do say so peter you do you do say so well then sir allow me to tell you in very positive terms sir that you have been guilty of of tautology capt mer your friend is very harmless etheridge capt eth i am aware of that but still i was not prepared for this impertinence considering the obligations he is under to my family peter obligations sir what obligations do you refer to the advantages that you had in being educated with me capt eth i have ever considered the reverse and that it was you who had the advantages had you had sense enough to profit by them peter now observe there's your mistake capt eth to capt mer the fool is mad peter mad captain what's your name capt eth captain what's your name peter don't stand insult peter there is no insult i repeat again captain what's your name do you know your name capt eth to capt mer why he's as mad as a march hare capt mer yes but not so hot as a welsh rabbit peter a rabbit that's a boroughmonger now i ought to take that up it is a downright insult but perhaps he did not mean it captain what's your name i tell you a secret you don't know your own name no nor you don't know your station in life capt eth i'm sure you forget yours mr peter how long has this change taken place peter ask your nurse aside that was a hard hit he must smell a rat now capt eth ask my nurse capt mer ask your granny etheridge upon my soul it's as good as a play capt eth to the audience perhaps but i feel rather inclined to be in earnest hark you mr peter do you know i am very particular in payment and always give every man his due peter that's it exactly all that i wish is that you would give me mine but if you don't i shall oblige you depend upon it capt mer i rather expect he will etheridge if he goes on much longer peter thank you for taking my part that's handsome perhaps you will persuade him to do me justice capt mer if you had been in my hands i should have done you justice long before this peter there's virtue still extant as the play has it sir as you have joined my side i'll permit you to shake hands with me capt mer o certainly we always do preparatory to a set to now then take my advice on your guard peter aside now i don't fear him aloud captain what's your name shall i tell you your fortune capt eth o certainly you look like a conjuror peter it is your fortune sir to be under the baleful influence of the stars georgium sidum and copernicum in a few days you will find your name to be bargrove and you will have to change situations with me capt eth indeed peter yes captain bargrove so it is a wicked woman changed us in our cradles but the secret is come out and evidence is at hand you must return to obscurity whilst i emerge from mine the stars will have it so your fortune's told capt eth nonsense the fool has been imposed upon now mr peter i'll tell your fortune peter i thank you it has been already told to my satisfaction capt eth nevertheless it must be told again although perhaps not to your satisfaction mr peter i can put up with folly but never with impertinence mars and saturn are about to be in strong opposition and heavy saturn will soon jump about like mercury the stars will have it so peter i don't comprehend that capt eth it shall be explained you peter bargrove have been excessively insolent to me edward etheridge in consequence i shall now take the liberty of giving you a little wholesome correction seizes peter by the collar capt mer don't use violence to the natural he offends more in ignorance than malice peter thank you sir i see that you are a well behaved gentleman o sir sir 'tis a vile ungrateful world i intended to do something for that young man captain etheridge shakes him why yes i did i not only intended to allow you forty pounds a year but to do what would be more agreeable to your sister agnes capt eth agreeable to miss etheridge what do you mean sir peter mean why i'm not quite sure recollect i don't promise but i was thinking of marrying her captain mertoun flies at him and seizes him by the collar on the other side they both shake him violently capt eth my sister you marry you scoundrel capt mer miss etheridge capt mer letting him go i am sorry that i was provoked to lay hands on him etheridge i'll leave his chastisement entirely to you peter thank you sir i always thought ye were on my side i suppose that was a mistake just now capt mer i certainly had no right to interfere between you and captain etheridge capt eth still holding peter by the collar but mr peter we do not part yet you may have made your peace with captain mertoun but not with me how dare you insult me thus peter i insult you to captain mertoun arn't you of my side capt mer laughing yes if you are knocked down i as your second will help you up again no more peter well but i'm not a nine pin why not prevent him from knocking me down capt mer the stars won't permit that capt eth and the stars ordain this lifting his cane peter captain etheridge one word let go my collar behave like a reasonable man and i now promise upon my word of honour that i will elevate your sister to my nuptial bed captain mertoun shakes his cane and makes signs to captain etheridge to thrash him capt eth i can bear no more beats peter round the stage peter oh oh my stars again why don't you help me sir capt mer you are not down yet peter captain etheridge continues striking peter throwing himself down and panting now i am capt mer yes and now i may help you up then you may go at it again peter what am i to have more of it if i am up capt mer i rather suspect so peter then i prefer lying here you need not wait captain bargrove i sha'n't get up this half hour rubbing his shoulders capt eth you observe peter i told you your fortune correctly the stars would have it so i hope when next we meet you will be a little more reasonable and also a little more respectful if not i hold your fortune in my hands holding up his cane peter didn't i tell you that you did why don't you return it like an honest man as i said before i'll make you an allowance capt eth that's more than i will for you if i have any more impertinence come mertoun he'll not come to time that's clear capt mer no nor to his fortune or title either i'm afraid good morning peter ha ha ha capt eth farewell sir peter ha ha ha exeunt captains mertoun and etheridge peter sitting up come to time nor to my title and fortune well i hope they'll both come to the gallows i thought of that as a repartee when they were here but it was too good to be thrown away upon them rises it is very odd that nobody will believe me when the facts are so plain as shakespeare says the ladder of my ambition is so hard to climb i presume these are all the sticks i am to get up by i'm almost tired of it already but however after two misses comes a hit and i'll try the last now to lady etheridge discover myself to her sob upon her bosom as the gipsy foretold i should and then if she is but on my side why i defy all the men in the family exit scene iii a parlour in the homestead enter old bargrove and mrs bargrove old bar why dame i can make nothing out of it i have questioned lucy as closely as possible and it appears that it was a gipsy woman who told their fortunes but still as lucy told me the story there is something very strange about it mrs bar lucy appears to take it very much to heart poor thing old bar she does dame but in the right way she thinks of others and not of herself i tell you this dame if i thought that lucy was not my daughter it would almost break my heart mrs bar she's a good girl and content with her father and mother i only wish that peter was the same old bar peter was born a fool dame and he'll never be anything else but i hope this may prove of service to him i hear that he has already been up to the hall mrs bar had we not better go there too bargrove and see sir gilbert or they may suppose we be parties to the report old bar why should they and who knows the report as yet mrs bar o everybody i was told of it ten minutes back by mrs benson she heard it of the footman william he says that captain etheridge has given peter a sound thrashing old bar did he then i am very much indebted to him i'll tell you what dame i'll to the wood and find out this gipsy woman and if threatening her with the stocks and bridewell won't make her confess i have a warrant in my pocket just made out by the magistrates' clerk for the apprehension of the gang on suspicion of their stealing mrs fowler's turkey and farmer groves' geese we'll first see what can be done there and then i'll come back and we'll walk up to the hall mrs bar do so bargrove let us show that we've a clear conscience at all events old bar i'll be back in an hour dame i must go down to wilson the constable exit old bar mrs bar i never was so put out in my life that boy peter's folly worries me to death who comes here why it's captain etheridge i do declare i am almost afraid to see one of the family now enter captain etheridge capt eth my dear mrs bargrove with your permission kissing her i can't leave off my old habit of kissing my nurse how are you and your husband and how is pretty lucy mrs bar quite well thank you mr edward dear me what a man you do grow capt eth if i am not a man at five and twenty dame i never shall be mrs bar five and twenty dear heart so it is but time does fly fast it appears to me but the other day that i had you in my arms how does miss agnes to day capt eth not very well dame she has something to vex her indeed there's a rumour flying about and i've come down to speak with you and lucy on the subject mrs bar i know it all but it's all false mr edward all stuff and nonsense from beginning to end bargrove has now gone to sift the matter i'm sure i ought to know a pretty trouble i've had about it what with foolish peter even bargrove himself spoke to me as if i could have been guilty of such an act capt eth what does lucy think of it mrs bar lucy is more vexed than any of us i really think if she thought it true that she would make away with herself capt eth what at the idea of being miss etheridge no cause that for suicide either mrs bar no not that captain etheridge but at the idea of rising in the world at the expense of those to whom she owes both love and gratitude she's a good girl captain etheridge capt eth i agree with you dame she's a very sweet girl i wish to speak to her will you send her to me mrs bar to be sure i will master edward she'll be glad to see you she's always asking after you when you be away exit mrs bargrove capt eth i did but say a few words to her on my arrival i dared not trust myself with more she looked so beautiful i have not been able to drive her from my thoughts ever since heigho the conflict between love and pride is well contested nothing but opportunity can give the victory to the one and absence to the other the more i know of her the more deserving she appears i often try to find faults in her but i cannot discover them i suppose that i inherit all my pride from my mother that i cherish it in preference to my happiness is clear but should this report prove true such things have occurred and this may have been done without the knowledge of mrs bargrove agnes and lucy then change situations and i with that cub peter bargrove very pleasant indeed the former is not of much consequence but to be jostled out of my supposed birthright by a booby enter lucy capt eth going up to her and taking her by the hand i took the liberty to request a few minutes' interview lucy smiling surely not a very great liberty with one whom you have known so long and who is so very much indebted to your father capt eth not so much as his children are indebted to your mother but the object of my visit is lucy to request that you will give me some information relative to a ridiculous report lucy i can and i can assure you captain etheridge that i believe it to be without the shadow of a foundation that agnes and i were both taken by surprise at the moment you must not wonder at but on reflection i am convinced that it is a fabrication indeed the very idea is most injurious to the character of my mother capt eth i grant this but the change may have taken place without the knowledge of your mother lucy it is possible but barely possible who but a foolish mother blinded by partiality would ever have been guilty of an act which never could benefit herself capt eth you are not well acquainted with the knavery of the world to prove a fact like this in a court of justice would in most instances be rewarded liberally your brother for instance seems to view the affair in a very different light lucy captain etheridge i can honestly assert that the rumour has occasioned to me the greatest uneasiness and were it to prove true i should be still more unhappy capt eth i cannot understand you you would find yourself raised to a position in society which you did not expect courted by those who at present disregard you and moving in a circle to which i must say your beauty and your other natural gifts would contribute to adorn lucy do not flatter me i have a great dislike to it i am i trust satisfied in my present situation and were i weak enough to indulge a transient feeling of vanity the reminiscence which would instantly intrude that my advancement was founded on the misery of those i love better than myself would render it a source of deep and unceasing regret capt eth those you love better than yourself lucy who are they lucy confused i referred to your sister agnes and to your father capt eth o not to me then i am an exclusion lucy my gratitude to your father for his kindness and our intimacy from childhood ought to assure you captain etheridge that i must ever wish for your happiness capt eth but suppose my dear lucy this should prove to be true lucy i have already stated my sentiments capt eth you have lucy generally and much to your honour but i am just putting the case for my amusement suppose it were proved true you would not look down upon me as the child of your inferiors lucy captain etheridge the very observation for your amusement is both ungenerous and unkind i acknowledge our present inferiority but not perhaps to the extent which would be exacted from your family but oblige me by not carrying your suppositions any further tremulously i am not very happy as it is capt eth forgive me lucy i did not intend to inflict pain i am much too fond of you for that lucy then why do you come here to make me miserable capt eth to make you miserable my dear lucy i should indeed be a wretch when my own happiness depends upon you lucy starts aside it is out at last now there's no retreat in honour and i thank heaven for it aloud did you hear me lucy lucy appears fainting etheridge supports her are you angry with me lucy she weeps i will confess to you honestly that i have long struggled with my passion but pride ridiculous pride has severely punished me for listening to its selfish dictates believe me when i assert that never was man more attached than i am to you answer me lucy am i then indifferent to you lucy separating herself gently from captain etheridge i will be as candid as you have been remains for a little time silent whether you are indifferent to me or not i must leave you to judge from the effects of your communication but i have also pride and that pride never will allow me to enter a family against the wishes of those who have a right to be consulted on a question of such serious importance capt eth only one question lucy if my father consents to our union will you be satisfied without the concurrence of my mother lucy i should abide by the decision of my own father and mother but to confess the truth i should not be satisfied capt eth am i then to consider this as a mere act of duty lucy is there no feeling towards me lucy o yes why should i deny it indeed edward if you could have read my heart for some time back you would have found capt eth what my dear lucy lucy that your image has long occupied it to its unhappiness capt eth as yours has mine now i trust they will cherish their inmates with delight farewell my dearest lucy i hasten to my father and i've an idea in my brain which may procure the completion of our wishes they embrace exit captain etheridge lucy god give me strength and make me sufficiently grateful this was so unexpected o edward edward you have opened such a vista of delight through the dark clouds that surrounded me that i tremble as i gaze how dreadful will be this suspense now am i arrived at the crisis of my fate either i am blessed beyond all hope and all desert or else i die exit scene iv a room in the hall enter william showing in peter bargrove will step in this room mr peter and i'll let my lady know that you are here i say mr peter what can you want with my lady peter consequentially that cannot concern you sir i should think will what's the matter now why you used to be civil and genteel i say i suppose you have found a mare's nest peter don't be saucy

etheridge who recovers what's the matter my love lady eth spitting o the wretch the brute he has taken liberties adm taken liberties the scoundrel pray sir what liberties have you taken with lady etheridge peter i only smothered her with kisses adm what do you mean sir are you mad smothering her with kisses peter smiling i certainly did assume that privilege sir gilbert adm did you you rascal then i'll just assume another thrashes peter round the room peter my father o my honoured parent oh your own son oh your affectionate exit peter pursued by the admiral adm returning puffing and blowing why positively the fellow is stark staring mad enter agnes captains etheridge and mertoun capt eth what is all this disturbance my dear father adm what is it why i hardly can tell there has been an impudent scoundrel that young bargrove kissing your mother till she has fainted and swearing that he is my son called me his honoured parent but i cudgelled the rascal agnes leaning on captain etheridge's shoulder o heavens capt eth the fellow himself has just now been trying to elbow me out of my birthright however i met his pretensions with the same argument as you did who could have put all this nonsense into his addled head so firmly that two good cudgellings cannot beat it out capt mer etheridge your sister is unwell capt eth don't be alarmed my dear agnes agnes oh but indeed i am i expected this adm expected this have you then heard anything my love agnes yes i have indeed just before my brother arrived i was told that my real name was agnes bargrove adm how very extraordinary who told you so agnes a very strange woman but she appeared to know all about it it has made me very unhappy ever since adm this must be inquired into where did you meet with her agnes in the lower wood but lucy can tell you more speak to her lady eth i'm very ill lead me to my room exeunt sir gilbert and lady etheridge cap eth and i must away to unravel this deep laid plot mertoun i must leave you to take care of agnes exit capt etheridge capt mer a pleasing change if i am not unwelcome may i be permitted miss etheridge from a very great interest which i must ever take in the prosperity of your family may i ask if you imagine there is any truth in this report agnes it is impossible for me to answer captain mertoun why should such a report be raised without some foundation true or not i have ever since felt in a situation so awkward that i fear my conduct may have appeared strange to others capt mer i must confess that your evident restraint towards me so different from what perhaps my vanity induced me to hope has been to me a source of wonder as well as regret may i flatter myself that this rumour has been the occasion of an apparent caprice which i never could have imagined that miss etheridge would have indulged in agnes you must be aware captain mertoun that i could not receive you as agnes etheridge until those doubts upon my parentage were removed it would not have been honest capt mer and was this the only cause for your change of behaviour towards me agnes agnes why yes i believe so capt mer now then let me declare that whether you prove to be agnes etheridge or agnes bargrove those sentiments which i have felt towards you and which have not hitherto been revealed excepting to your brother must ever remain the same for your own sake and for the sake of sir gilbert and lady etheridge who would deeply regret the loss of such a daughter i trust that the report is without foundation for my own part i rather rejoice at this opportunity of proving the sincerity of my attachment let me but find favour in the sight of agnes and the surname will be immaterial agnes immaterial captain mertoun capt mer yes quite so for i shall persuade you to change it as soon as possible for my own kneels tell me dearest agnes agnes tell you what capt mer something that will make me happy agnes smiling shall i tell you what the gipsy woman said when she told me my fortune capt mer nay do not trifle with me agnes archly i asked whether i should marry the person that i loved capt mer a very natural question agnes she replied yes if he is more generous than the generality of his sex gives her hand captain mertoun you have proved yourself so to be and since you offer to take agnes truly speaking for better or for worse i will not keep you in suspense by disguising my real sentiments capt mer dearest agnes you have indeed made me happy embraces her i accompanied your brother with the sole view of pleading my own cause imagine then my misery at your cruel reception agnes that you may not think me interested by my accepting your generous offer during this state of uncertainty i will own how often i have thought of you and how eagerly i looked for your arrival let us go now mertoun and see whether lady etheridge is recovered exeunt arm in arm scene v the wood enter nelly nelly i have tried in vain to dissuade them to abandon their projects they are preparing their instruments and their weapons they have determined to attempt the hall to night i have written this letter to sir gilbert and if i can find any one to convey it the scoundrels will be taken and punished if i cannot i must contrive some means to escape to the hall but they suspect me and watch me so narrowly that it is almost impossible what shall i do there is somebody coming it is that fool peter bargrove then all is right i will make use of him enter peter your servant fortunate sir peter fortunate why now ar'n't you an infamous hussy hav'n't you taken my purse and my money for your intelligence that i was changed in my cradle and what has been the consequence nelly that everybody has been astonished peter i have been astonished at all events i have had so many cudgellings that i must count them with my fingers first a huge one from old bargrove secondly a smart one from captain etheridge and thirdly a severe one from sir gilbert what is the value of your good news if no one will believe it nelly very true but how could you expect they would peter then what's the good of knowing it nelly you must know a fact before you attempt to prove it you only bought the knowledge of me you never paid for the proof peter no but i've paid for the knowledge rubbing his shoulders but didn't you say that mrs bargrove would confess nelly i thought it likely but if she won't we must make her peter how nelly bring evidence against her that will convict her so that she will find it useless denying it peter but where is it nelly here holding out the letter peter give it me nelly stop stop you've not paid for it peter upon my honour i've not got a farthing in the world i durst not ask either father or mother after the bobbery we've had indeed i hardly know whether i dare go home and get my victuals won't you trust me nelly when will you pay me peter when i come to my title and estate nelly well then as i think you are a gentleman i will trust you now observe this letter is addressed to sir gilbert it contains a statement of facts that will astonish and convince him you must not trust it into other hands but deliver it yourself peter he'll cudgel me nelly no he will not but even if he did would you mind a few blows for the certainty of being one day sir peter etheridge peter no hang me if i do they might all cudgel me together if they could cudgel me into the only son of a baronet of ten thousand a year nelly well then as soon as you can go boldly up to the hall and say to sir gilbert sir gilbert in justice to yourself read this letter and do not despise the caution as it is all true you will then see the effect of it peter see not feel you are certain he won't be angry well then i will in this case i'm in a great hurry as anybody i can promise so good bye exit nelly now i think all is safe but i must quit the gang or my life will be in danger enter old bargrove with constable oh that i could recall the last twenty years how wicked how infamous have i become covers her face with her hands old bargrove advances and taps her on the shoulder nelly starts mercy on me old bar you must not expect much i believe you tell

thief you must come along with me nelly along with you sir old bar do you see this little bit of paper but now i look at you haven't we met before nelly met before sir old bar yes hold your head up a little either my eyes deceive me or you yes i'll swear to it you are nelly armstrong not quite so good looking as you were when we parted now i understand all come take her along to the hall at once nelly indeed sir old bar not a word away with her slanderous lying mischievous exeunt omnes scene vi a drawing room in the hall enter sir gilbert and captain etheridge adm i love lucy as my own daughter and it often occurred to me how delighted i should be to receive her as such but your mother's dislike to her is most unaccountable capt eth there is the difficulty which i am most anxious to surmount i am afraid that without my mother's concurrence lucy will never consent to enter into the family she has pride as well as lady etheridge adm yes but of a very different quality a proper pride edward a respect for herself added to a little feeling to which she adheres in the decayed state of her family which once was superior to ours capt eth if my mother could but once be induced to suppose that this rumour is correct we might obtain her unwilling consent adm the report i believe to be wholly without foundation and so i would even if it were given against us in a court of justice capt eth my opinion coincides with yours but my happiness is at stake and i therefore shall not pause at a trifling deception which may be productive of so much good will you assist me adm why edward can't you manage without me capt eth not very well let me entreat you i hear my mother coming adm well well she is always asserting i deceive her when i don't for once i'll not be accused without a cause enter lady etheridge they pretend not to see her capt eth aside now sir aloud the proofs are indeed too strong my dear sir to hope for any other issue and i regret that we have all been so long and so cruelly deceived adm well edward i can only say if you are not really my son you will always be considered as such for whether your name be etheridge or bargrove you must still look upon me as your father capt eth i thank you sir but there are circumstances over which you have no control the title and estate must descend to the lawful heir and that silly fellow peter will in future claim the affections of yourself and of my dear lady etheridge it is on her account more than my own that i feel so much distressed lady eth coming forward what is this that i hear is there then any foundation for that vile report that hideous tale that turned the brain of that silly wretch the admiral shakes his head in mournful silence edward will you not answer me capt eth i'm afraid that my answer will be most unsatisfactory madam i had my doubts indeed i spurned the idea until i called upon lucy etheridge i believe i must call her now and the proofs which she can bring forward lady eth the hussy capt eth nay my lady i must do justice to her she is more inclined to conceal the facts than to disclose them her regard for my father her profound respect for you and a certain feeling of good will towards me lady eth well i am glad to see a little good sense in the girl indeed if the admiral had not spoilt her adm lady etheridge i have always felt towards that girl as my own daughter it's very odd do you think edward that this matter could not be hushed up capt eth i know but of one way sir which is to sacrifice myself for the welfare of the family i will do it i may say almost willingly adm how is that edward capt eth by a marriage with lucy lady eth never capt eth who will then for her own sake keep the proofs in her possession lady eth never never i cannot consent to it capt eth may i ask my dear lady etheridge if you refuse me as your son or is lucy refused to me as your daughter lady eth oh capt eth and again my dear madam when you reflect on the establishment of these facts by undoubted proofs that booby peter will have a right to claim your maternal kindness lady eth odious wretch capt eth to occupy that place in your affections which hitherto i have so proudly held and must surrender with such deep regret lady eth i would consent to submit to anything rather than that monster should dare to call me mother capt eth yet so he will madam without you consent to the proposed arrangement lucy has always treated you with respect and expressed the warmest gratitude for your protection but as for peter he will be more bearish and insolent than ever again smother you with his nauseous kisses and claim them as an offspring's right lady eth i really feel quite ill again at the very idea save me from that and i'll consent to anything capt eth well then madam have i your permission enter william will please sir gilbert here be mr bargrove and madam bargrove and miss lucy and the constables and the malefactors coming up to prove the whole truth of the consarn to your's and my lady's satisfaction lady eth i'll not see them i must leave you capt eth nay madam stay but one moment and acquaint lucy that you give your consent she may not believe me enter old bargrove lucy constables and nelly old bar your servant my lady your servant sir gilbert i've got the whole story out at last i have brought up lucy who will prove the facts my son peter i have sent after and i took the liberty to tell the servant that miss agnes would be necessary capt eth leading up lucy to lady etheridge lady etheridge will you honour us so far as to give your consent lady etheridge hesitates my dear madam recollect the circumstances enter peter adm come lady etheridge they have mine and your's must not be refused peter sir gilbert i am your's seeing nelly

true gives the letter adm how do you know reads your house will be robbed this night the parties are well armed and resolute take immediate precautions and despise not this warning from one who has a sincere regard for you and for your family capt eth a friendly caution sir it must be attended to the favour is intended us by the gang of gipsies in the wood perhaps this woman may know something about it old bar like enough for we have an old acquaintance here who knows every part of the hall this is nelly armstrong who nursed lucy mrs bar i'll swear to her and it is she who has been the occasion of all this mischief enter agnes and capt mertoun agnes my dear lucy i did not know that you were here turning to nelly nelly yes miss agnes the gipsy woman that told you your fortune and as mrs bargrove states nursed you miss lucy at her breast sir gilbert i will save you trouble by confessing that all i told these young people was from a feeling of revenge towards lady etheridge who spurned me from her door my long residence in the family enabled me to give a show of truth to what has occasioned so much uneasiness peter what ar'n't it all true then nelly not one word mr peter old bar then we must have you to bridewell nelly i trust sir gilbert you will be merciful for i have proved my strong regard to your family adm what by making us all miserable nelly sir gilbert by that letter in your hand that i wrote little expecting that i should ever appear before you peter o the letter is true then adm holding up his cane silence sir old bar holding up his stick yes silence sir nelly i know sir gilbert that you have too kind a heart to injure any one and if repentance for my folly and wickedness can if you miss lucy will plead for me and my letter sir gilbert ought to plead for me too all i beg is that you will place me in a situation to keep my good resolutions capt eth lucy will plead for her sir and so do i for to her i owe my present happiness adm well well woman it shall be your own fault if you do wrong again nelly curtseying then let me beg pardon of all those to whom i have occasioned uneasiness adm well it's all settled now except the affair of the letter which we must attend to bargrove capt mer not quite all sir here are two who wish for your sanction adm hah is it so agnes in this instance i may safely join your hands for your mother for this morning she expressed a wish that it might be so at the same time mr and mrs bargrove i must request your sanction for the choice that my son has made he has already secured mine and that of lady etheridge mrs bar wiping her eyes this is indeed a joyous end to all my vexations nelly with emotion may heaven bless your union my dear miss lucy old bar god bless you both now with your permission sir gilbert i will resign my office of steward for many years i have filled it through gratitude and not from any wish of emolument i have enough to portion my daughter and even to make that foolish boy a gentleman according to his notions of gentility peter have you my dear father then i am glad that i was not changed but i say etheridge i'm your brother in law indeed you've a strong hand brother edward capt eth there peter take it in friendship shake hands adm and mine capt mer peter mine old bar well i suppose peter i must do the same and forget and forgive mrs bar and me peter peter jumps up clasps her round the neck and gives her a hearty kiss the boy's heart is right after all adm thus then do all our vexations end in happiness and may we be allowed to indulge the hope that the

entrap you into marriage with only one hundred and fifty pounds no no judge me better i sacrifice myself my happiness all for you banish myself from your dear presence and retire to pass the remainder of my existence in misery and regret maddened with the feeling that some happier mortal will obtain that dear hand and will rejoice in the possession of those charms which i had too fondly too

be generous i now absolve you from all your vows you are free should the time ever come that prosperity shine upon me and i find that i have sufficient for both of us of that dross which i despise

weeping jel alone well i really thought i should have burst to be forced not to allow people to suppose that i cared when i should like to tear the old wretch out of his coffin to beat him his wardrobe if people knew his wardrobe as well as i do who have been patching at it these last ten years not a shirt or a stocking that would fetch sixpence and as for his other garments why a jew would hardly put them into his bag crying oh dear oh dear after all i'm just like miss clementina for sergeant o'callaghan when he knows all this will as surely walk off without beat of drum as did mr edward and that too with all the money i have lent him oh these men these men whether they are living or dying there is nothing in them but treachery and disappointment when they pretend to be in love they only are trying for your money and e'en when they make their wills they leave to those behind them nothing but ill will exit crying off the stage as the curtain falls how to write a fashionable novel scene chambers in lincoln's inn arthur ansard at a briefless table tete a tete with his wig on a block a casts a disconsolate look upon his companion and soliloquises yes there you stand partner of my toils my feelings and my fame we do not suit for we never gained a suit together well what with reporting for the bar writing for the annuals and the pocket books i shall be able to meet all demands except those of my tailor and as his bill is most characteristically long i think i shall be able to make it stretch over till next term by which time i hope to fulfil my engagements with mr c who has given me an order for a fashionable novel written by a nobleman but how i who was never inside of an aristocratical mansion in my life whose whole idea of court is comprised in the court of king's bench am to complete my engagement i know no more than my companion opposite who looks so placidly stupid under my venerable wig as far as the street door the footman and carriage and the porter are concerned i can manage well enough but as to what occurs within doors i am quite abroad i shall never get through the first chapter yet that tailor's bill must be paid knocking outside come in i pray enter barnstaple b merry christmas to you arthur a sit down my dear fellow but don't mock me with merry christmas he emigrated long ago answer me seriously do you think it possible for a man to describe what he never saw b putting his stick up to his chin why 'tis possible but i would not answer for the description being quite correct a but suppose the parties who read it have never seen the thing described b why then it won't signify whether the description be correct or not a you have taken a load off my mind but still i am not quite at ease i have engaged to furnish c with a fashionable novel b what do you mean to imply by a fashionable novel a i really can hardly tell his stipulations were that it was to be a fashionable novel in three volumes each volume not less than three hundred pages b that is to say that you are to assist him in imposing on the public a something very like it i'm afraid as it is further agreed that it is to be puffed as coming from a highly talented nobleman b you should not do it ansard a so conscience tells me but my tailor's bill says yes and that is a thing out of all conscience only look here displays a long bill b why i must acknowledge ansard that there is some excuse one needs must when the devil drives but you are capable of better things a i certainly don't feel great capability in this instance but what can i do the man will have nothing else he says the public will read nothing else b that is to say that because one talented author astonished the public by style and merits peculiarly his own and established as it were a school for neophites his popularity is to be injured by contemptible imitators it is sufficient to drive a man mad to find that the tinsel of others if to be purchased more cheaply is to be pawned upon the public instead of his gold and more annoying still that the majority of the public cannot appreciate the difference between the metal and the alloy do you know ansard that by getting up this work you really injure the popularity of a man of great talent a will he pay my tailor's bill b no i daresay he has enough to do to pay his own what does your tailor say a he is a staunch reformer and on march the st he declares that he will have the bill the whole bill and nothing but the bill carried to my credit mr c on the th of february also expects the novel the whole novel and nothing but the novel and that must be a fashionable novel look here barnstaple shows his tailor's bill b i see how it is he pays your poverty and not your will a and by your leave i thus must pay my bill bowing b well well i can help you nothing more difficult than to write a good novel and nothing more easy than to write a bad one if i were not above the temptation i could pen you a dozen of the latter every ordinary year and thirteen perhaps in the bissextile so banish that christmas cloud from your brow leave off nibbling your pen at the wrong end and clap a fresh nib to the right one i have an hour to spare a i thank you that spare hour of yours may save me many a spare day i'm all attention proceed b the first point to be considered is the tempus or time the next the locus or place and lastly the dramatis personae and thus chapter upon chapter will you build a novel a build b yes build you have had your dimensions given the interior is left to your own decoration first as to the opening suppose we introduce the hero in his dressing room we have something of the kind in pelham and if we can't copy his merits we must his peculiarities besides it always is effective a dressing room or boudoir of supposed great people is admitting the vulgar into the arcana which they delight in a nothing can be better b then as to time as the hero is still in bed suppose we say four o'clock in the afternoon a in the morning you mean b no the afternoon i grant you that fashionable young men in real life get up much about the same time as other people but in a fashionable novel your real exclusive never rises early the very idea makes the tradesman's wife lift up her eyes so begin it was about thirty three minutes after four post meridian a minute to a minute b that the honourable augustus bouverie's finely chiselled a chiselled b yes great people are always chiselled common people are only cast finely chiselled head was still recumbent upon his silk encased pillow his luxuriant and antinous like curls were now confined in papillotes of the finest satin paper and the tout ensemble of his head a tout ensemble b yes go on was gently compressed by a caul of the finest net work composed of the threads spun from the beauteous production of the italian worm a ah now i perceive a silk nightcap but why can't i say at once a silk nightcap b because you are writing a fashionable novel with the forefinger of his gloved left hand a but he's not coming in from a walk he's not yet out of bed b you don't understand it gloved left hand he applied a gentle friction to the portal of his right eye which unclosing at the silent summons enabled him to perceive a repeater studded with brilliants and ascertain the exact minute of time which we have already made known to the reader and at which our history opens a a very grand opening indeed b not more than it ought to be for a fashionable novel at the sound of a silver clochette his faithful swiss valet coridon who had for some time been unperceived at the door waiting for some notice of his master having thrown off the empire of somnus in his light pumps covered with beaver moved with noiseless step up to the bedside like the advance of eve stealing over the face of nature a rather an incongruous simile b not for a fashionable novel there he stood like taciturnity bowing at the feet of proud authority a indeed barnstaple that is too outre b not a whit i am in the true cambysis' vein coridon having softly withdrawn the rose coloured gros de naples bed curtains which by some might have been thought to have been rather too extravagantly fringed with the finest mechlin lace exclaimed with a tone of tremulous deference and affection 'monsieur a bien dormi' 'coridon' said the honourable augustus bouverie raising himself on his elbow in that eminently graceful attitude for which he was so remarkable when reclining on the ottomans at almack's a are you sure they have ottamans there b no but your readers can't disprove it 'coridon' said he surveying his attendant from head to foot and ultimately assuming a severity of countenance 'coridon you are becoming gross if not positively what the people call fat' the swiss attendant fell back in graceful astonishment three steps and arching his eyebrows extending his inverted palms forward and raising his shoulders above the apex of his head exclaimed 'pardon mi lor j'en aurois un horreur parfait' 'i tell you' replied our gracefully recumbent hero 'that it is so coridon and i ascribe it to your partiality for that detestable wine called port confine yourself to hock and moselle sirrah i fear me you have a base hankering after mutton and beef restrict yourself to salads and do not sin even with an omelette more than once a week coridon must be visionary and diaphanous or he is no coridon for me remove my night gloves and assist me to rise it is past four o'clock and the sun must have by this time sufficiently aired this terrestrial globe' a i have it now i feel i could go on for an hour b longer than that before you get him out of his dressing room you must make at least five chapters before he is apparelled or how can you write a fashionable novel in which you cannot afford more than two incidents in the three volumes two are absolutely necessary for the editor of the gazette to extract as specimens before he winds up an eulogy do you think that you can proceed now for a week without my assistance a i think so if you will first give me some general ideas in the first place am i always to continue in this style b no i thought you knew better you must throw in patches of philosophy every now and then a philosophy in a fashionable novel b most assuredly or it would be complained of as trifling but a piece now and then of philosophy as unintelligible as possible stamps it with deep thought in the dressing room or boudoir it must be occasionally epicurean elsewhere especially in the open air more stoical a i'm afraid that i shall not manage that without a specimen to copy from now i think of it eugene aram says something very beautiful on a starry night b he does it is one of the most splendid pieces of writing in our language but i will have no profanation arthur to your pen again and write we'll suppose our hero to have retired from the crowded festivities of a ball room at some lordly mansion in the country and to have wandered into a churchyard damp and dreary with a thick london fog in the light dress of fashion he throws himself on a tombstone ye dead exclaims the hero where are ye do your disembodied spirits now float around me and shrouded in this horrible veil of nature glare unseen upon vitality float ye upon this intolerable mist in yourselves still more misty and intolerable hold ye high jubilee to night or do ye crouch behind these monitorial stones gibbering and chattering at one who dares thus to invade your precincts here may i hold communion with my soul and in the invisible presence of those who could but dare not to reveal away it must not be a what mustn't be b that is the mystery which gives the point to his soliloquy leave it to the reader's imagination a i understand but still the honourable augustus cannot lie in bed much longer and i really shall not be able to get him out without your assistance i do not comprehend how a man can get out of bed gracefully he must show his bare legs and the alteration of position is in itself awkward b not half so awkward as you are do you not feel that he must not be got out of bed at all that is by description a how then b by saying nothing about it re commence as follows 'i should like the bath at seventy six and a half coridon' observed the honourable augustus bouverie as he wrapped his embroidered dressing gown round his elegant form and sank into a chaise longue wheeled by his faithful attendant to the fire there you observe he is out of bed and nothing said about it a go on i pray thee b 'how is the bath perfumed' 'eau de mille fleurs' 'eau de mille fleurs did not i tell you last week that i was tired of that villanous compound it has been adulterated till nothing remains but its name get me another bath immediately au violet and coridon you may use that other scent if there is any left for the poodle but observe only when you take him an airing not when he goes with me' a excellent i now feel the real merits of an exclusive but you said something about dressing room or in door philosophy b i did and now is a good opportunity to introduce it coridon goes into the ante chamber to renew the bath and of course your hero has met with a disappointment in not having the bath to his immediate pleasure he must press his hands to his forehead by the bye recollect that his forehead when you describe it must be high and white as snow all aristocratical foreheads are at least are in a fashionable novel a what the women's and all b the heroine's must be the others you may lower as a contrast but to resume with the philosophy he strikes his forehead lifts his eyes slowly up to the ceiling and drops his right arm as slowly down by the side of the chaise longue and then in a voice so low that it might have been considered a whisper were it not for its clear and brilliant intonation he exclaims a exclaims in a whisper b to be sure you exclaim mentally why should you not in a whisper a i perceive your argument is unanswerable b stop a moment it will run better thus the honourable augustus bouverie no sooner perceived himself alone than he felt the dark shades of melancholy ascending and brooding over his mind and enveloping his throbbing heart in their their adamantine chains yielding to the overwhelming force he thus exclaimed 'such is life we require but one flower and we are offered noisome thousands refused that we wish we live in loathing of that not worthy to be received mourners from our cradle to our grave we utter the shrill cry at our birth and we sink in oblivion with the faint wail of terror why should we then ever commit the folly to be happy' a hang me but that's a poser b nonsense hold your tongue it is only preparatory to the end conviction astonishes and torments destiny prescribes and falsifies attraction drives us away humiliation supports our energies thus do we recede into the present and shudder at the elysium of posterity a i have written all that down barnstaple but i cannot understand it upon my soul b if you had understood one particle that particle i would have erased this is your true philosophy of a fashionable novel the extreme interest of which consists in its being unintelligible people have such an opinion of their own abilities that if they understood you they would despise you but a dose like this strikes them with veneration for your talents a your argument is unanswerable but you said that i must describe the dressing room b nothing more easy as a simile compare it to the shrine of some favoured saint in a richly endowed catholic church three tables at least full of materials in methodised confusion all tending to the beautification of the human form divine tinted perfumes in every variety of cut crystal receivers gold and silver if at a loss call at bayley's and blew's or smith's in bond street take an accurate survey of all you see and introduce your whole catalogue you cannot be too minute but arthur you must not expect me to write the whole book for you a indeed i am not so exorbitant in my demands upon your good nature but observe i may get up four or five chapters already with the hints you have given me but i do not know how to move such a creation of the brain so ethereal that i fear he will melt away and so fragile that i am in terror lest he fall to pieces now only get him into the breakfast room for me and then i ask no more for the present only dress him and bring him down stairs b there again you prove your incapability bring him down stairs your hero of a fashionable novel never ascends to the first floor bed room dressing room breakfast room library and boudoir all are upon a level as for his dressing you must only describe it as perfect when finished but not enter into a regular detail except that in conversation with his valet he occasionally asks for something unheard of or fastidious to a degree you must not walk him from one chamber to another but manage it as follows it was not until the beautiful airs of the french clock that decorated the mantel piece had been thrice played with all their variations that the honourable augustus bouverie entered his library where he found his assiduous coridon burning an aromatic pastile to disperse the compound of villanous exhalations arising from the condensed metropolitan atmosphere once more in a state of repose to the repeated and almost affecting solicitations of his faithful attendant who alternately presented to him the hyson of pekoe the bohea of twankay the fragrant berry from the asiatic shore and the frothing and perfumed decoction of the indian nut our hero shook his head in denial until he at last was prevailed upon to sip a small liqueur glass of eau sucree the fact is arthur he is in love don't you perceive now introduce a friend who rallies him then a resolution to think no more of the heroine a billet on a golden salver a counter resolution a debate which equipage to order a decision at last hat gloves and furred great coat and by that time you will have arrived to the middle of the first volume a i perceive but i shall certainly stick there without your assistance b you shall have it my dear fellow in a week i will call again and see how you get on then we'll introduce the heroine that i can tell you requires some tact au revoir a thanks many thanks my dear barnstaple fare you well exit barnstaple a looking over his memoranda it will do hopping and dancing about the room hurrah my tailor's bill will be paid after all part ii mr arthur ansard's chambers as before mr ansard with his eyes fixed upon the wig block gnawing the feather end of his pen the table covered with sundry sheets of foolscap shows strong symptoms of the novel progressing ansard solus where is barnstaple if he do not come soon i shall have finished my novel without a heroine well i'm not the first person who has been foiled by a woman continues to gnaw his pen in a brown study barnstaple enters unperceived and slaps ansard on the shoulder the latter starts up b so friend ansard making your dinner off your pen it is not every novel writer who can contrive to do that even in anticipation have you profited by my instructions a i wish i had i assure you that this light diet has not contributed as might be expected to assist a heavy head and one feather is not sufficient to enable my genius to take wing if the public knew what dull work it is to write a novel they would not be surprised at finding them dull reading ex nihilo nihil fit barnstaple i am at the very bathos of stupidity b you certainly were absorbed when i entered for i introduced myself a i wish you had introduced another personage with you you would have been doubly welcome b who is that a my heroine i have followed your instructions to the letter my hero is as listless as i fear my readers will be and he is not yet in love in fact he is only captivated with himself i have made him dismiss coridon b hah how did you manage that a he was sent to ascertain the arms on the panel of a carriage in his eagerness to execute his master's wishes he came home with a considerable degree of perspiration on his brow for which offence he was immediately put out of doors b bravo it was unpardonable but still a o i know what you mean that is all arranged he has an annuity of one hundred pounds per annum b my dear ansard you have exceeded my expectations but now for the heroine a yes indeed help me for i have exhausted all my powers b it certainly requires much tact to present your heroine to your readers we are unfortunately denied what the ancients were so happy to possess a whole cortege of divinities that might be summoned to help any great personage in or the author out of a difficulty but since we cannot command their assistance like the man in the play who forgot his part we will do without it now have you thought of nothing new for we must not plagiarise even from fashionable novels a i have thought and thought and can find nothing new unless we bring her in in a whirlwind that has not yet been attempted b a whirlwind i don't know that's hazardous nevertheless if she were placed on a beetling cliff overhanging the tempestuous ocean lashing the rocks with its wild surge of a sudden after she has been permitted to finish her soliloquy a white cloud rising rapidly and unnoticed the sudden vacuum the rush of mighty winds through the majestic and alpine scenery the vortex gathering round her first admiring the vast efforts of nature then astonished and lastly alarmed as she finds herself compelled to perform involuntary gyrations till at length she spins round like a well whipped top nearing the dangerous edge of the precipice it is bold and certainly quite novel i think it will do portray her delicate little feet peeping out pointing downwards the force of the elements raising her on her tip toes now touching now disdaining the earth her dress expanded wide like that of herbele in her last and best pirouette round round she goes her white arms are tossed frantically in the air corinne never threw herself into more graceful attitudes now is seen her diminishing ankle now the rounded symmetry mustn't go too high up though the wind increases her distance from the edge of the precipice decreases she has no breath left to shriek no power to fall threatened to be ravished by the wild and powerful god of the elements she is discovered by the honourable augustus bouverie who has just finished his soliloquy upon another adjacent hill he delights in her danger before he rushes to her rescue makes one pause for the purpose of admiration and another for the purpose of adjusting his shirt collar a the devil he does b to be sure the hero of a fashionable novel never loses caste whether in a storm a whirlwind up to his neck in the foaming ocean or tumbling down a precipice he is still the elegant and correct honourable augustus bouverie to punish you for your interruption i have a great mind to make him take a pinch of snuff before he starts well he flies to her assistance is himself caught in the rushing vortex which prevents him from getting nearer to the lady and despite of himself takes to whirling in the opposite direction they approach they recede she shrieks without being heard holds out her arms for help she would drop them in despair but cannot for they are twisted over her head by the tremendous force of the element one moment they are near to each other and the next they are separated at one instant they are close to the abyss and the waters below roar in delight of their anticipated victims and in the next a favouring change of the vortex increases their distance from the danger there they spin and there you may leave them and commence a new chapter a but is not all this naturally and physically impossible b by no means there is nothing supernatural in a whirlwind and the effect of a whirlwind is to twist everything round why should the heroine and the honourable augustus bouverie not be submitted to the laws of nature besides we are writing a fashionable novel wild and improbable as this whirlwind may appear it is within the range of probability whereas that is not at all adhered to in many novels witness the drinking scene in and others equally outrees in which the author having turned probability out of doors ends by throwing possibility out of the window leaving folly and madness to usurp their place and play a thousand antics for the admiration of the public who pleased with novelty cry out how fine a buy the book and laud the author b exactly now having left your hero and heroine in a situation peculiarly interesting with the greatest nonchalance pass over to the continent rave on the summit of mont blanc and descant upon the strata which compose the mountains of the moon in central africa you have been philosophical now you must be geological no one can then say that your book is light reading a that can be said of few novels in most of them even smoke assumes the ponderosity of lead b there is a metal still heavier which they have the power of creating gold to pay a dunning tailor's bill a but after having been philosophical and geological ought one not to be a little moral b pshaw i thought you had more sense the great art of novel writing is to make the vices glorious by placing them in close alliance with redeeming qualities depend upon it ansard there is a deeper more heartfelt satisfaction than mere amusement in novel reading a satisfaction no less real because we will not own it to ourselves the satisfaction of seeing all our favourite and selfish ideas dressed up in a garb so becoming that we persuade ourselves that our false pride is proper dignity our ferocity courage our cowardice prudence our irreligion liberality and our baser appetites mere gallantry a very true barnstaple but really i do not like this whirlwind b well well i give it up then it was your own idea we'll try again cannot you create some difficulty or dilemma in which to throw her so that the hero may come to her rescue with eclat a her grey palfrey takes fright b so will your readers stale quite stale a a wild bull has his horns close to her and is about to toss her b as your book would be away with contempt vapid quite vapid a a shipwreck the waves are about to close over her b your book would be closed at the same moment worn out quite worn out a in the dead of the night a fire breaks out she is already in the midst of the flames b where your book would also be by the disgusted reader worse and worse a confound it you will not allow me to expose her to earth air fire or water i have a great mind to hang her in her garters and make the hero come and cut her down b you might do worse and better a what hang myself b that certainly would put an end to all your difficulties but ansard i think i can put your heroine in a situation really critical and eminently distressing and the hero shall come to her relief like the descent of a god to the rescue of a greek or trojan warrior a or of bacchus to ariadne in her distress b perhaps a better simile the consequence will be that eternal gratitude in the bosom of the maiden will prove the parent of eternal love which eternity of passion will of course last until they are married a i'm all attention b get up a splendid dinner party for their first casual meeting place the company at table a surely you are not going to choke her with the bone of a chicken b you surely are about to murder me as samson did the philistines a with the jaw bone of a fashionable novel writer you mean b exactly but to proceed they are seated at table can you describe a grand dinner a certainly i have partaken of more than one b where a i once sat down three hundred strong at the freemasons' tavern b pshaw a mere hog feed a well then i dined with the late lord mayor b still worse my dear ansard it is however of no consequence nothing is more difficult to attain yet nothing is more easy to describe than a good dinner i was once reading a very fashionable novel by a very fashionable bookseller for the author is a mere nonentity and was very much surprised at the accuracy with which a good dinner was described the mystery was explained a short time afterwards when casually taking up eustache eude's book in sams's library i found that the author had copied it out exactly from the injunctions of that celebrated gastronome you can borrow the book a well we will suppose that done but i am all anxiety to know what is the danger from which the heroine is to be rescued b i will explain there are two species of existence that of mere mortal existence which is of little consequence provided like caesar the hero and heroine die decently the other is of much greater consequence which is fashionable existence let them once lose caste in that respect and they are virtually dead and one mistake one oversight is a death blow for which there is no remedy and from which there is no recovery for instance we will suppose our heroine to be quite confounded with the appearance of our hero to have become distraite reveuse and in short to have lost her recollection and presence of mind she has been assisted to fillet de soles say that the only sauce ever taken with them is au macedoine this is offered to her and at the same time another which to eat with the above dish would be unheard of in her distraction she is about to take the wrong sauce actually at the point of ruining herself for ever and committing suicide upon her fashionable existence while the keen grey eyes of sir antinous antibes the arbiter of fashion are fixed upon her at this awful moment which is for ever to terminate her fashionable existence the honourable augustus bouverie who sits next to her gently touches her seduisante sleeve blandly smiling he whispers to her that the other is the sauce macedoine she perceives her mistake trembles at her danger rewards him with a smile which penetrates into the deepest recesses of his heart helps herself to the right sauce darts a look of contemptuous triumph upon sir antinous antibes and while she is dipping her sole into the sauce her soul expands with gratitude and love a i see i see many thanks my heroine is now a fair counterpart of my hero ah sure a pair were never seen so justly form'd to meet by nature b and now i'll give you another hint since you appear grateful it is a species of claptrap in a novel which always takes to wit a rich old uncle or misanthrope who at the very time that he is bitterly offended and disgusted with the hero who is in awkward circumstances pulls out a pocket book and counts down say fifteen or twenty thousand pounds in bank notes to relieve him from his difficulties an old coat and monosyllables will increase the interest a true sighing alas there are no such uncles in real life i wish there were b i beg your pardon i know no time in which my uncle forks out more bank notes than at the present a yes but it is for value or more than value received b that i grant but i'm afraid it is the only uncle left now except in a fashionable novel but you comprehend the value of this new auxiliary a nothing can be better barnstaple you are really but i say no more if a truly great man cannot be flattered with delicacy it must not be attempted at all silence then becomes the best tribute your advice proves you to be truly great i am silent therefore you understand the full force of the oratory of my thanks b bowing well ansard you have found out the cheapest way of paying off your bills of gratitude i ever heard of poor even in thanks was well said by shakespeare but you it appears are rich in having nothing at all wherewith to pay if you could transfer the same doctrine to your tradesmen you need not write novels a alas my dear fellow mine is not yet written there is one important feature nay the most important feature of all the style of language the diction on that barnstaple you have not yet doctrinated b pompously when demosthenes was asked what were the three principal attributes of eloquence he answered that the first was action on being asked which was the second he replied action and the third action and such is the idea of the irish mimbers in the house of commons now there are three important requisites in the diction of a fashionable novel the first my dear fellow is flippancy the second flippancy and flippancy is also the third with the dull it will pass for wit with some it will pass for scorn and even the witty will not be enabled to point out the difference without running the risk of being considered invidious it will cover every defect with a defect still greater for who can call small beer tasteless when it is sour or dull when it is bottled and has a froth upon it a the advice is excellent but i fear that this flippancy is as difficult to acquire as the tone of true eloquence b difficult i defy the writers of the silver fork school to write out of the style flippant read but one volume of and you will be saturated with it but if you wish to go to the fountain head do as have done most of the late fashionable novel writers repair to their instructors the lady's maid for flippancy in the vein spirituelle to a london footman for the vein critical but if you wish a flippancy of a still higher order at once more solemn and more empty which i would call the vein political read the speeches of some of our members of parliament only read them i wish no man so ill as to inflict upon him the torture of hearing them read them i say and you will have taken the very highest degree in the order of inane flippancy a i see it at once your observations are as true as they are severe when we would harangue geese we must condescend to hiss but still my dear barnstaple though you have fully proved to me that in a fashionable novel all plot is unnecessary don't you think there ought to be a catastrophe or sort of a kind of an end to the work or the reader may be brought up short or as the sailors say all standing when he comes to the word finis and exclaim with an air of stupefaction and then b and then if he did it would be no more than the fool deserved i don't know whether it would not be advisable to leave off in the middle of a sentence of a word nay of a syllable if it be possible i'm sure the winding up would be better than the lackadaisical running down of most of the fashionable novels snap the main spring of your watch and none but an ass can expect you to tell by it what it is o'clock snap the thread of your narrative in the same way and he must be an unreasonable being who would expect a reasonable conclusion finish thus in a case of delicate distress say the honourable mr augustus bouverie was struck in a heap with horror he rushed with a frantic grace a deliberate haste and a graceful awkwardness and whispered in her ear these dread and awful words 'it is too late' follow up with a and finis a i see the fair and agitated reader will pass a sleepless night in endeavouring to decipher the mutilated sentence she will fail and consequently call the book delightful but should there not have been a marriage previously to this happy awful climax b yes everything is arranged for the nuptials carriages are sent home jewellery received but not paid for dresses all tried on the party invited nay assembled in the blue and white drawing room the right reverend my lord bishop is standing behind the temporary altar he has wiped his spectacles and thumbed his prayer book all eyes are turned towards the door which opens not the bride faints for the bridegroom cometh not he's not i' the vein a something as like nothing as possible has given him a disgust that is insurmountable he flings his happiness to the winds though he never loved with more outrageous intensity than at the moment he discards his mistress so he fights three duels with the two brothers and father he wounds one of the young men dangerously the other slightly fires his pistol in the air when he meets her father for how could he take the life of him who gave life to his adored one your hero can always hit a man just where he pleases vide every novel in mr c's collection the hero becomes misanthropical the heroine maniacal the former marries an antiquated and toothless dowager as an escape from the imaginary disgust he took at a sight of a matchless woman and the latter marries an old brute who threatens her life every night and puts her in bodily fear every morning as an indemnity in full for the loss of the man of her affections they are both romantically miserable and then come on your tantalising scenes of delicate distress and so the end of your third volume and then finish without any end at all verb sap sat or if you like it better kill the old dowager of a surfeit and make the old brute who marries the heroine commit suicide and after all these unheard of trials marry them as fresh and beautiful as ever a a thousand thanks your verba are not thrown to a sap can i possibly do you any favour for all this kindness b oh my dear fellow the very greatest as i see yours will be at all points a most fashionable novel do me the inestimable favour not to ask me to read it how to write a book of travels mr ansard's chambers a alone well i thought it hard enough to write a novel at the dictate of the bibliopolist but to be condemned to sit down and write my travels travels that have never extended farther than the lincoln's inn coffee house for my daily food and a walk to hampstead on a sunday these travels to be swelled into travels up the rhine in the year why it's impossible o that barnstaple were here for he has proved my guardian angel lazy clever dog enter barnstaple b pray my dear ansard to whom did you apply that last epithet a my dear barnstaple i never was more happy to see you sit down i have much to tell you all about myself and my difficulties b the conversation promises to be interesting to me at all events a everything is interesting to true friendship b now i perceive that you do want something well before you state your case tell me how did the novel go off a wonderfully well it was ascribed to lord g the bait took and went off in a first edition and the remainder of the copies printed went off in a second b without being reprinted a exactly i was surprised at my success and told my publisher so but he answered that he could sell an edition of any trash he pleased b that was not flattering a not very but his bill was honoured and that consoled me however to proceed to business he has given me another order a journey up the rhine in two vols large octavo in the year now barnstaple what's to be done b write it to be sure a but you well know i have never been out of england in my life b never mind write it a yes it's very well to say write it but how the devil am i to write it write what i have never seen detail events which never occurred describe views of that which i have not even an idea travel post in my old armchair it's all very well to say write it but tell me how b i say again write it and pocket the money ansard allow me to state that you are a greenhorn i will make this mountain of difficulties vanish and melt away like snow before the powerful rays of the sun you are told to write what you have never seen but if you have not others have which will serve your purpose just as well to detail events which have never occurred invent them they will be more amusing describe views c of which you are ignorant so are most of your readers but have we not the art of engraving to assist you to travel post in your armchair a very pleasant and a very profitable way of travelling as you have not to pay for the horses and postilions and are not knocked to pieces by continental roads depend upon it the best travels are those written at home by those who have never put their foot into the calais packet boat a to me this is all a mystery i certainly must be a greenhorn as you observe b why ansard my dear fellow with a book of roads and a gazetteer i would write a more amusing book of travels than one half which are now foisted on the public all you have to do is to fill up the chinks a all i want to do is to fill up the chinks in my stomach barnstaple for between you and me times are rather queer b you shall do it if you will follow my advice i taught you how to write a fashionable novel it will be hard indeed if i cannot send you up the rhine one little expense must be incurred you must subscribe a quarter to a circulating library for i wish that what you do should be well done a barnstaple i will subscribe to anything b well then since you are so reasonable i will proceed you must wade through all the various journies on the rhine two months on the rhine autumns on the rhine c which you can collect this you will find the most tiresome part of your task select one as your guide one who has a reputation follow his course not exactly that i will explain afterwards and agree with him in everything generally speaking praise his exactitude and fidelity and occasionally quote him this is but fair after you rob a man and i intend you shall rifle him most completely it is but decent to give him kind words all others you must abuse contradict and depreciate now there is a great advantage in so doing in the first place you make the best writer your friend he forgets your larcenies in your commendation of him and in your abuse of others if his work be correct so must yours be he praises it everywhere perhaps finds you out and asks you to dine with him a how should i ever look at his injured face b on the contrary he is the obliged party your travels are a puff to his own a but barnstaple allowing that i follow this part of your advice which i grant to be very excellent how can i contradict others when they may be and probably are perfectly correct in their assertions b if they are so virtue must be its own reward it is necessary that you write a book of travels and all travellers contradict each other ergo you must contradict or nobody will believe that you have travelled not only contradict but sneer at them a well now do explain how that is to be done b nothing more simple for instance a man measures a certain remarkable piece of antiquity its length is feet you must measure it over again and declare that he is in error that it is only to be sure of your being correct measure it twice over and then convict him a but surely barnstaple one who has measured it is more likely to be correct than one who has not b i'll grant you that he is correct to half an inch that's no matter the public will in all probability believe you because you are the last writer and because you have decreased the dimensions travellers are notorious for amplification and if the public do not believe you let them go and measure it themselves a a third traveller may hereafter measure it and find that i am in the wrong b ten to one if you are not both in the wrong but what matter will that be your book will have been sold a most true o king i perceive now the general outline and i feel confident that with your kind assistance i may accomplish it but barnstaple the beginning is everything if i only had the first chapter as a start i think i could get on it is the modus that i want the style a first chapter would be a keynote for the remainder of the tune with all the variations b well then take up your pen but before i commence it may be as well to observe that there is a certain method required even in writing travels in every chapter you should have certain landmarks to guide you for instance enumerate the following and select the works from which they may be obtained so as to mix up the instructive with the amusing travelling remarks on country passed through anecdote arrival at a town churches population historical remarks another anecdote eating and drinking natural curiosities egotism remarks on the women never mind the men another anecdote reflections an adventure and go to bed you understand ansard that in these memoranda you have all that is required the rule is not to be followed absolutely but generally as you observed such is to be the tune but your variations may be infinite when at a loss or you think you are dull always call in a grisette and a little mystery and above all never be afraid of talking too much about yourself a many many thanks but now my dear barnstaple for the first chapter b let your style be flowery i should say florid never mind a false epithet or two in a page they will never be observed a great deal depends upon the first two pages you must not limp at starting we will therefore be particular take your pen barnstaple muses for a little while and then continues a severe cough which refused to yield even to the balmy influence of the genial spring of and threatened a pulmonary complaint induced me to yield to the reiterated persuasions of my physicians to try a change of air as most likely to ward off the threatened danger where to direct my steps was the difficult point to ascertain brighton torquay cromer ilfracombe had all been visited and revisited at either of these fashionable resorts i was certain to fall in with a numerous acquaintance whose persuasions would have induced me to depart from that regularity of diet and of rest so imperiously insisted upon by my medical advisers after much cogitation i resolved upon a journey up the rhine and to escape the ruthless winter of our northern clime in the more genial land of history a land of history i presume you mean italy but am i to go there b no you may recover and come back again to skate upon the serpentine if you please you observe ansard i have not made you a fellow with l in his pocket setting out to turn it into l by a book of travels i have avoided mention of margate ramsgate broadstairs and all common watering places i have talked of physicians in the plural in short no one who reads that paragraph but will suppose that you are a young man of rank and fortune to whom money is no object and who spends hundreds to cure that which might be effected by a little regularity and a few doses of ipecacuanha a i wish it were so nevertheless i'll travel en grand seigneur that's more agreeable even in imagination than being rumbled in a diligence b and will produce more respect for your work i can assure you but to proceed always when you leave england talk about hospitality the english like it have you no relations or friends in whose opinion you wish to stand well public mention in print does wonders especially with a copy handsomely bound from the author a really barnstaple i do not know any one my poor mother is in cumberland and that is not en route i have a maternal uncle of the name of forster who lives on the road a rich old miserly bachelor but i can't say much for his hospitality i have called upon him twice and he has never even asked me to dinner b never mind people like being praised for a virtue which they do not possess it may prove a legacy say then that you quitted the hospitable roof of your worthy and excellent hearted relation mr forster and felt a felt how b how why you felt as he wrung your hand that there was a sudden dissolution of the ties of kindred and affection a there always has been in that quarter so my conscience is so far clear b you arrive at dovor mind you spell it dovor go to bed tired and reflective embark early the next morning a rough passage a and sea sick of course b no ansard there i'll give you a proof of my tact you sha'n't be sea sick a but i'm sure i should be b all travellers are and all fill up a page or two with complaints ad nauseam for that reason sick you shall not be observe to your astonishment you are not sea sick the other passengers suffer dreadfully one young dandy puffs furiously at a cigar in bravado until he sends it over the side like an arrow from the blow pipe of a south american indian introduce a husband with a pretty wife he jealous as a dog until he is sick as a cat your attentions she pillowed on your arms while he hangs over the lee gunwale her gratitude safe arrival at calais sweet smiles of the lady sullen deportment of the gentleman a few hints and draw the veil do you understand a perfectly i can manage all that b then when you put your foot on shore you must for the first time feel sea sick a on shore b yes reel about not able to stand every symptom as if on board express your surprise at the strange effect pretend not to explain it leave that to medical men it being sufficient for you to state the fact a the fact o barnstaple b that will be a great hit for a first chapter you reverse the order of things a that i do most certainly shall i finish the first chapter with that fact b no travellers always go to bed at the end of each chapter it is a wise plan and to a certain degree it must be followed you must have a baggage adventure be separated from it some sharp little urchin has seized upon your valise it is no where to be found quite in despair walk to the hotel d'angleterre and find that you are met by the landlord and garcons who inform you that your carriage is in the remise and your rooms ready ascend to your bedroom find that your baggage is not only there but neatly laid out your portmanteau unstrapped your trunk uncorded and the little rascal of a commissaire standing by with his hat in his hand and a smile de malice having installed himself as your domestique de place take him for his impudence praise the cotelettes and the vin de beaune wish the reader good night and go to bed thus ends the first chapter ansard gets up and takes barnstaple's hand which he shakes warmly without speaking barnstaple smiles and walks out ansard is left hard at work at his desk arthur ansard in his chambers solus with his pen in his hand ans capital that last was a hit it has all the appearance of reality to be sure i borrowed the hint but that nobody will be able to prove yawns heigho i have only got half way on my journey yet and my ideas are quite exhausted i am as much worn out and distressed as one of the german post horses which i described in my last chapter nods and then falls fast asleep barnstaple taps at the door receiving no answer he enters b so quite fast what can have put him to sleep reads the manuscript on the table no wonder enough to put anybody to sleep apparently why ansard a starting up still half asleep already why i've hardly shut my eyes well i'll be dressed directly let them get some cafe ready below henri did you order the hind spring to be repaired nods again with his eyes shut b hallo what now ansard do you really think that you are travelling a waking up upon my word barnstaple i was so dreaming i thought i was in my bed at the hotel de londres after the fatiguing day's journey i described yesterday i certainly have written myself into the conviction that i was travelling post b all the better you have embodied yourself in your own work which every writer of fiction ought to do but they can seldom attain to such a desideratum now tell me how do you get on a thank you pretty well i have been going it with four post horses these last three weeks b and how far have you got a half way that is into the middle of my second volume but i'm very glad that you're come to my assistance barnstaple for to tell you the truth i was breaking down b yes you said something about the hind spring of your carriage a that i can repair without your assistance but my spirits are breaking down i want society this travelling post is dull work now if i could introduce a companion b so you shall at the next town that you stop at buy a poodle a a poodle barnstaple how the devil shall i be assisted by a poodle b he will prove a more faithful friend to you in your exigence and a better companion than one of your own species a male companion after all is soon expended and a female which would be more agreeable is not admissible if you admit a young traveller into your carriage what then he is handsome pleasant romantic and so forth but you must not give his opinions in contradiction to your own and if they coincide it is superfluous now a poodle is a dog of parts and it is more likely that you fall in with a sagacious dog than with a sagacious man the poodle is the thing you must recount your meeting his purchase size colour and qualifications and anecdotes of his sagacity vouched for by the landlord and all the garcons of the hotel as you proceed on your travels his attachment to you increases and wind up every third chapter with your faithful mouton a will not all that be considered frivolous b frivolous by no means the frivolous will like it and those who have more sense although they may think that mouton does not at all assist your travelling researches are too well acquainted with the virtues of the canine race and the attachment insensibly inbibed for so faithful an attendant not to forgive your affectionate mention of him besides it will go far to assist the versimilitude of your travels as for your female readers they will prefer mouton even to you a all powerful and mighty magician whose wand of humbug like that of aaron's swallows up all others not excepting that of divine truth i obey you mouton shall be summoned to my aid he shall flourish and my pen shall flourish in praise of his endless perfections but barnstaple what shall i give for him b thinks awhile not less than forty louis a forty louis for a poodle b most certainly not a sous less the value of anything in the eyes of the world is exactly what it costs mouton at a five franc piece would excite no interest and his value to the reader will increase in proportion to his price which will be considered an undeniable proof of all his wonderful sagacity with which you are to amuse the reader a but in what is to consist his sagacity b he must do everything but speak indeed he must so far speak as to howl the first part of lieber augustin a his instinct shall put our boasted reason to the blush but i think i had better not bring him home with me b of course not in the first place it's absolutely necessary to kill him lest his reputation should induce people to seek him out which they would do although in all probability they never will his master lady cork would certainly invite him to a literary soiree you must therefore kill him in the most effective way possible and you will derive the advantage of filling up at least ten pages with his last moments licking your hand your own lamentations violent and inconsolable grief on the part of henri and tanning his skin as a memorial a a beautiful episode for which receive my best thanks but barnstaple i have very few effective passages as yet i have remodelled several descriptions of mountains precipices waterfalls and such wonders of the creation expressed my contempt and surprise at the fear acknowledged by other travellers in several instances i have lost my way twice met three wolves been four times benighted and indebted to lights at a distance for a bed at midnight after the horses have refused to proceed all is incident and i am quite hard up for description now i have marked down a fine passage in 's work a beautiful description of a cathedral with a grand procession reads what with the effect of the sun's brightest beams upon the ancient glass windows various hues reflected upon the gothic pillars gorgeousness of the procession sacerdotal ornaments tossing of censers crowds of people elevation of the host and sinking down of the populace en masse it really is a magnificent line of writing and which my work requires one or two like that in my book would do well to be quoted by impartial critics before the public are permitted to read it but here you observe is a difficulty i dare not borrow the passage b but you shall borrow it you shall be even finer than he is and yet he shall not dare to accuse you of plagiarism a how is that possible my dear barnstaple i'm all impatience b his description is at a certain hour of the day all you have to do is to portray the scene in nearly the same words you have as much right to visit a cathedral as he has and as for the rest here is the secret you must visit it at night instead of glorious beams you will talk of pale melancholy light instead of the stained windows throwing their various hues upon the gothic pile you must darken the massive pile and light up the windows with the silver rays of the moon the glorious orb of day must give place to thousands of wax tapers the splendid fretwork of the roof you must regret was not to be clearly distinguished but you must be in ecstasies with the broad light and shade the blaze at the altar solemn hour of night feelings of awe half a catholic religious reflections c don't you perceive a i do like the rest of my work it shall be all moonshine it shall be done barnstaple but have you not another idea or two to help me with b have you talked about cooks a as yet not a word b by this time you ought to have some knowledge of gastronomy talk seriously about eating a writes i have made a mem b have you had no affront a not one b then be seriously affronted complain to the burgomaster or mayor or commandant whoever it may be they attempt to bully you are resolute and firm as an englishman insist upon being righted they must make you a thousand apologies this will tickle the national vanity and be read with interest a writes i have been affronted anything else which may proceed from your prolific brain barnstaple b have you had a serious illness a never complained even of a headache b then do everything but die henri weeping and inconsolable mouton howling at the foot of your bed kick the surgeons out of the room and cure yourself with three dozen of champagne a writes very sick cured with three dozen of champagne i wish the illness would in reality come on if i were certain of the cure gratis go on my dear barnstaple b you may work in an episode here delirium lucid intervals gentle female voice delicate attentions mysterious discovery from loquacious landlady eternal gratitude but no marriage an apostrophe and all the rest left to conjecture a writes down silent attentions conjecture i can manage that i think b by the bye have you brought in madame de stael a no how the devil am i to bring her in b as most other travellers do by the head and shoulders never mind that so long as you bring her in a writes madame de stael by the shoulders that's not very polite towards a lady these hints are invaluable pray go on b why you have already more hints this morning than are sufficient for three volumes but however let me see b thinks a little find yourself short of cash a a sad reality barnstaple i shall write this part well for truth will guide my pen b all the better but to continue no remittances awkward position explain your situation receive credit to any amount and compliment your countrymen a writes credit to any amount pleasing idea but i don't exactly perceive the value of this last hint barnstaple b all judicious travellers make it a point throughout the whole of their works to flatter the nation upon its wealth name and reputation in foreign countries by doing so you will be read greedily and praised in due proportion if ever i were to write my travels into the interior of africa or to the north pole i would make it a point to discount a bill at timbuctoo or get a cheque cashed by the esquimaux without the least hesitation in either case i think now that what with your invention your plagiarism and my hints you ought to produce a very effective book of travels and with that feeling i shall leave you to pursue your journey and receive at its finale your just reward when we meet again i hope to see you advertised a yes but not exposed i trust i am incog you know b to be sure that will impart an additional interest to your narrative all the world will be guessing who you may be adieu voyageur exit barnstaple a and heaven forfend that they should find me out but what can be done in brief i cannot get a brief and thus i exercise my professional acquirements how i can proving myself as long winded as prosy perhaps and certainly as lying as the more fortunate of my fraternity how to write a romance mr arthur ansard standing at his table selecting a steel pen from a card on which a dozen are ranged up like soldiers on parade i must find a regular graver to write this chapter of horrors no goose quill could afford me any assistance now then let me see reads and during his reading barnstaple comes in at the door behind him unperceived at this most monstrously appalling sight the hair of piftlianteriscki raised slowly the velvet cap from off his head as if it had been perched upon the rustling quills of some exasperated porcupine i think that's new his nostrils dilated to that extent that you might with ease have thrust a musket bullet into each his mouth was opened so wide so unnaturally wide that the corners were rent asunder and the blood slowly trickled down each side of his bristly chin while each tooth loosened from its socket with individual fear not a word could he utter for his tongue in its fright clung with terror to his upper jaw as tight as do the bellies of the fresh and slimy soles paired together by some fishwoman but if his tongue was paralysed his heart was not it throbbed against his ribs with a violence which threatened their dislocation from the sternum and with a sound which reverberated through the dark damp subterrene i think that will do there's force there b there is with a vengeance why what is all this a my dear barnstaple you here i'm writing a romance for b it is to be supposed to be a translation b the germans will be infinitely obliged to you but my dear fellow you appear to have fallen into the old school that's no longer in vogue a my orders are for the old school b was most particular on that point he says that there is a re action a great re action b what on literature well he knows as well as any man i only wish to god there was in everything else and we could see the good old times again a to confess the truth i did intend to have finished this without saying a word to you i wished to have surprised you b so you have my dear fellow with the few lines i have heard how the devil are you to get your fellow out of that state of asphyxia a by degrees slowly very slowly as they pretend that we lawyers go to heaven but i'll tell you what i have done just to give you an idea of my work in the first place i have a castle perched so high up in the air that the eagles even in their highest soar appear but as wrens below b that's all right a and then it has subterraneous passages to which the sewers of london are a mere song and they all lead to a small cave at high water mark on the sea beach covered with brambles and bushes and just large enough at its entrance to admit of a man squeezing himself in b that's all right you cannot be too much underground in fact the two first and the best part of the third volume should be wholly in the bowels of the earth and your hero and heroine should never come to light until the last chapter a then they would never have been born till then and how could i marry them but still i have adhered pretty much to your idea and barnstaple i have such a heroine such a love she has never seen her sweetheart yet she is most devotedly attached and has suffered more for his sake than any mortal could endure b most heroines generally do a i have had her into various dungeons for three or four years on black bread and a broken pitcher of water she has been starved to death lain for months and months upon wet straw had two brain fevers five times has she risked violation and always has picked up or found in the belt of her infamous ravishers a stiletto which she has plunged into their hearts and they have expired with or without a groan b excellent and of course comes out of her dungeons each time as fresh as sweet as lovely as pure as charming and as constant as ever a exactly nothing can equal her infinite variety of adventure and her imperishable beauty and unadhesive cleanliness of person and as for lives she has more than a thousand cats after nine months' confinement in a dungeon four feet square when it is opened for her release the air is perfumed with the ambrosia which exhales from her sweet person b of course it does the only question is what ambrosia smells like but let me know something about your hero a he is a prince and a robber b the two professions are not at all incompatible go on a he is the chief of a band of robbers and is here there and everywhere he fills all europe with terror admiration and love b very good a his reasons for joining the robbers are of course a secret and upon my word they are equally a secret to myself but it is wonderful the implicit obedience of his men and the many acts of generosity of which he is guilty i make him give away a great deal more money than his whole band ever take which is so far awkward that the query may arise in what way he keeps them together and supplies them with food and necessaries b of course with i o u's upon his princely domains a i have some very grand scenes amazingly effective for instance what do you think at the moment after the holy mass has been performed in st peter's at rome just as the pope is about to put the sacred wafer into his mouth and bless the whole world i make him snatch the wafer out of the pope's hand and get clear off with it b what for may i ask a that is a secret which i do not reveal the whole arrangement of that part of the plot is admirable the band of robbers are disguised as priests and officiate without being found out b but isn't that rather sacrilegious a no it appears so to be but he gives his reasons for his behaviour to the pope and the pope is satisfied and not only gives him his blessing but shows him the greatest respect b they must have been very weighty reasons a and therefore they are not divulged b that is to say not until the end of the work a they are never divulged at all i leave a great deal to the reader's imagination people are fond of conjecture all they know is that he boldly appears and demands an audience he is conducted in the interview is private after a sign made by our hero and at which the pope almost leaps off his chair after an hour he comes out again and the pope bows him to the very door every one is astonished and of course almost canonise him b that's going it rather strong in a catholic country but tell me ansard what is your plot a plot i have none b no plot a no plot and all plot i puzzle the reader with certain materials i have castles and dungeons corridors and creaking doors good villains and bad villains chain armour and clank of armour daggers for gentlemen and stilettos for ladies dark forests and brushwood drinking scenes eating scenes and sleeping scenes robbers and friars purses of gold and instruments of torture an incarnate devil of a jesuit a handsome hero and a lovely heroine i jumble them all together sometimes above and sometimes underground and i explain nothing at all b have you nothing supernatural a o yes i've a dog whose instinct is really supernatural and i have two or three visions which may be considered so as they tell what never else could have been known i decorate my caverns and dungeons with sweltering toads and slimy vipers a constant dropping of water with chains too ponderous to lift but which the parties upon whom they are riveted clang together as they walk up and down in their cells and soliloquise so much for my underground scenery above i people the halls with pages and ostrich feathers and knights in bright armour a constant supply of generous wine and goblets too heavy to lift which the knights toss off at a draught as they sit and listen to the minstrel's music b bravo ansard bravo it appears to me that you do not want assistance in this romance a no when i do i have always a holy and compassionate friar who pulls a wonderful restorative or healing balm out of his bosom the puffs of solomon's balm of gilead are a fool to the real merits of my pharmacopoeia contained in a small vial b and pray what may be the title of this book of yours for i have known it take more time to fix upon a title than to write the three volumes a i call it the undiscovered secret and very properly so too for it never is explained but if you please i will read you some passages from it i think you will approve of them for instance now let us take this in the second volume you must know that angelicanarinella for that is the name of my heroine is thrown into a dungeon not more than four feet square but more than six hundred feet below the surface of the earth the ways are so intricate and the subterranean so vast and the dungeons so numerous that the base ethiop who has obeyed his master's orders in confining her has himself been lost in the labyrinth and has not been able to discover what dungeon he put her in for three days he has been looking for it during which our heroine has been without food and he is still searching and scratching his woolly head in despair as he is to die by slow torture if he does not reproduce her for you observe the chief who has thrown her into this dungeon is most desperately in love with her b that of course and that is the way to prove romantic love you ill treat but still she is certainly in a dilemma as well as the ethiop a granted but she talks like the heroine of a romance listen ansard reads the beauteous and divinely moulded form of the angelic angelicanarinella pressed the dank and rotten straw which had been thrown down by the scowling thick lipped ethiop for her repose she for whom attendant maidens had smoothed the sybaritic sheet of finest texture under the elaborately carved and sumptuously gilt canopy the silken curtains and the tassels of the purest dust of gold b tassels of dust of gold only figuratively i suppose a nothing more each particular straw of this dank damp bed was elastic with delight at bearing such angelic pressure and as our heroine cast her ineffably beaming eyes about the dark void lighting up with their effulgent rays each little portion of the dungeon as she glanced them from one part to another she perceived that the many reptiles enclosed with her in this narrow tomb were nestling to her side their eyes fixed upon her in mute expressions of love and admiration her eclipsed orbs were each for a moment suffused with a bright and heavenly tear and from the suffusion threw out a more brilliant light upon the feeling reptiles who paid this tribute to her undeserved sufferings she put forth her beauteous hand whose 'faint tracery' i stole that from cooper whose faint tracery had so often given to others the idea that it was ethereal and not corporeal and lifting with all the soft and tender handling of first love a venerable toad which smiled upon her she placed the interesting animal so that it could crawl up and nestle in her bosom 'poor child of dank of darkness and of dripping' exclaimed she in her flute like notes 'who sheltereth thyself under the wet and mouldering wall so neglected in thy form by thy mother nature repose awhile in peace where princes and nobles would envy thee if they knew thy present lot but that shall never be these lips shall never breathe a tale which might endanger thy existence fear not therefore their enmity and as thou slowly creepest away thy little round of circumscribed existence forget me not but shed an occasional pearly tear to the memory of the persecuted the innocent angelicanarinella' what d'ye think of that b umph a very warm picture certainly however it is natural you know a person of her consequence could never exist without a little toadyism a i have a good many subterraneous soliloquies which would have been lost forever if i did not bring them up b that one you have just read is enough to make everybody else bring up a i rather plume myself upon it b yes it is a feather in your cap and will act as a feather in the throat of your readers a now i'll turn over the second volume and read you another morceau in which i assume the more playful vein i have imitated one of our modern writers who must be correct in her language as she knows all about heroes and heroines i must confess that i've cribbed a little b let's hear a the lovely angelicanarinella pottered for some time about this fairy chamber then 'wrote journal' at last she threw herself down on the floor pulled out the miniature gulped when she looked at it and then cried herself to sleep b pottered and gulped what language do you call that a it's all right my dear fellow i understand that it is the refined slang of the modern boudoir and only known to the initiated b they had better keep it entirely to their boudoirs i should advise you to leave it all out a well i thought that one who was so very particular must have been the standard of perfection herself b that does not at all follow a but what i wish to read to you is the way in which i have managed that my secret shall never be divulged it is known only to four b a secret known to four people you must be quick then a so i am as you shall hear they all meet in a dark gallery but do not expect to meet any one but the hero whom they intend to murder each one having unknown to the others made an appointment with him for that purpose on the pretence of telling him the great secret altogether the scene is well described but it is long so i'll come at once to the denouement b pray do a absenpresentini felt his way by the slimy wall when the breath of another human being caught his ear he paused and held his own breath 'no no' muttered the other 'the secret of blood and gold shall remain with me alone let him come and he shall find death' in a second the dagger of absenpresentini was in the mutterer's bosom he fell without a groan 'to me alone the secret of blood and gold and with me it remains' exclaimed absenpresentini 'it does remain with you' cried phosphorini driving his dagger into his back absenpresentini fell without a groan and phosphorini withdrawing his dagger exclaimed 'who is now to tell the secret but me' 'not you' cried vortiskini raising up his sword and striking at where the voice proceeded the trusty steel cleft the head of the abandoned phosphorini who fell without a groan 'now will i retain the secret of blood and gold' said vortiskini as he sheathed his sword 'thou shalt' exclaimed the wily jesuit as he struck his stiletto to the heart of the robber who fell without a groan 'with me only does the secret now rest by which our order might be disgraced with me it dies' and the jesuit raised his hand 'thus to the glory and the honour of his society does manfredini sacrifice his life' he struck the keen pointed instrument into his heart and died without a groan 'stop' cried our hero b and i agree with your hero stop ansard or you'll kill me too but not without a groan a don't you think it would act well b quite as well as it reads pray is it all like this a you shall judge for yourself i have half killed myself with writing it for i chew opium every night to obtain ideas now again b spare me ansard spare me my nerves are rather delicate for the remainder i will take your word a i wish my duns would do the same even if it were only my washerwoman but there's no more tick for me here except this old watch of my father's which serves to remind me of what i cannot obtain from others time but however there is a time for all things and when the time comes that my romance is ready my creditors will obtain the ready b your only excuse ansard a i beg your pardon the public require strong writing now a days we have thousands who write well and the public are nauseated with what is called good writing b and so they want something bad eh well ansard you certainly can supply them a my dear barnstaple you must not disparage this style of writing it is not bad there is a great art in it it may be termed writing intellectual and ethereal you observe that it never allows probabilities or even possibilities to stand in its way the dross of humanity is rejected all the common wants and grosser feelings of our natures are disallowed it is a novel which is all mind and passion corporeal attributes and necessities are thrown on one side as they would destroy the charm of perfectability nothing can soil or defile or destroy my heroine suffering adds lustre to her beauty as pure gold is tried by fire nothing can kill her because she is all mind as for my men you will observe when you read my work b when i do a which of course you will that they also have their appetites in abeyance they never want to eat or drink or sleep are always at hand when required without regard to time or space now there is a great beauty in this description of writing the women adore it because they find their sex divested of those human necessities without which they would indeed be angels the mirror is held up to them and they find themselves perfect no wonder they are pleased the other sex are also very glad to dwell upon female perfectability which they can only find in a romance although they have often dreamt of it in their younger days b there is some truth in these remarks every milliner's girl who devours your pages in bed by the half hour's light of tallow stolen for the purpose imagines a strong similarity between herself and your angelicanarinella and every shop boy measuring tape or weighing yellow soap will find out attributes common to himself and to your hero a exactly as long as you draw perfection in both sexes you are certain to be read because by so doing you flatter human nature and self love and transfer it to the individual who reads now a picture of real life b is like some of wouvermans' best pictures which will not be purchased by many because his dogs in the fore ground are doing exactly what all dogs will naturally do when they first are let out of their kennels a wouvermans should have known better and made his dogs better mannered if he expected his pictures to be hung up in the parlour of refinement b very true a perhaps you would like to have another passage or two b excuse me i will imagine it all i only hope ansard this employment will not interfere with your legal practice a my dear barnstaple it certainly will not because my legal practice cannot be interfered with i have been called to the bar but find no employment in my calling i have been sitting in my gown and wig for one year and may probably sit a dozen more before i have to rise to address their lordships i have not yet had a guinea brief my only chance is to be sent out as judge to sierra leone or perhaps to be made a commissioner of the court of requests b you are indeed humble in your aspirations i recollect the time ansard when you dreamt of golden fame and aspired to the wool sack when your ambition prompted you to midnight labour and you showed an energy a putting his hands up to his forehead with his elbows on the table what can i do barnstaple if i trust to briefs my existence will be but brief we all must live b i will not reply as richelieu did to a brother author je ne vois pas la necessite but this i do say that if you are in future to live by supplying the public with such nonsense the shorter your existence the better sw and by w w jack littlebrain was physically considered as fine grown and moreover as handsome a boy as ever was seen but it must be acknowledged that he was not very clever nature is in most instances very impartial she has given plumage to the peacock but as everyone knows not the slightest ear for music throughout the feathered race it is almost invariably the same the homeliest clad are the finest songsters among animals the elephant is certainly the most intelligent but at the same time he cannot be considered as a beauty acting upon this well ascertained principle nature imagined that she had done quite enough for jack when she endowed him with such personal perfection and did not consider it was at all necessary that he should be very clever indeed it must be admitted not only that he was not very clever but as the truth must be told remarkably dull and stupid however the littlebrains have been for a long while a well known numerous and influential family so that if it were possible that jack could have been taught anything the means were forthcoming he was sent to every school in the country but it was in vain at every following vacation he was handed over from the one pedagogue to the other of those whose names were renowned for the busbian system of teaching by stimulating both ends he was horsed every day and still remained an ass and at the end of six months if he did not run away before that period was over he was invariably sent back to his parents as incorrigible and unteachable what was to be done with him the littlebrains had always got on in the world somehow or another by their interest and connections but here was one who might be said to have no brains at all after many pros and cons and after a variety of consulting letters had passed between the various members of his family it was decided that as his maternal uncle sir theophilus blazers gcb was at that time the second in command in the mediterranean he should be sent to sea under his command the admiral having in reply to a letter on the subject answered that it was hard indeed if he did not lick him into some shape or another and that at all events he'd warrant that jack should be able to box the compass before he had been three months nibbling the ship's biscuit further that it was very easy to get over the examination necessary to qualify him for lieutenant as a turkey and a dozen of brown stout sent in the boat with him on the passing day as a present to each of the passing captains would pass him even if he were as incompetent as a camel or as they say at sea a cable to pass through the eye of a needle that having once passed he would soon have him in command of a fine frigate with a good nursing first lieutenant and that if he did not behave himself properly he would make his signal to come on board of the flag ship take him into the cabin and give him a sound horsewhipping as other admirals have been known to inflict upon their own sons under similar circumstances the reader must be aware that from the tenour of sir theophilus's letter the circumstances which we are narrating must have occurred some fifty years ago when jack was informed that he was to be a midshipman he looked up in the most innocent way in the world and innocent he was sure enough turned on his heels and whistled as he went for want of thought for the last three months he had been at home and his chief employment was kissing and romping with the maids who declared him to be the handsomest littlebrain that the country had ever produced our hero viewed the preparations made for his departure with perfect indifference and wished everybody good bye with the utmost composure he was a happy good tempered fellow who never calculated because he could not never decided for he had not wit enough to choose never foresaw although he could look straight before him and never remembered because he had no memory the line if ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise was certainly made especially for jack nevertheless he was not totally deficient he knew what was good to eat or drink for his taste was perfect his eyes were very sharp and he could discover in a moment if a peach was ripe on the wall his hearing was quick for he was the first in the school to detect the footsteps of his pedagogue and he could smell anything savoury nearly a mile off if the wind lay the right way moreover he knew that if he put his fingers in the fire that he would burn himself that knives cut severely that birch tickled and several other little axioms of this sort which are generally ascertained by children at an early age but which jack's capacity had not received until at a much later date such as he was our hero went to sea his stock in his sea chest being very abundant while his stock of ideas was proportionally small we will pass over all the trans shipments of jack until he was eventually shipped on board of the mendacious then lying at malta with the flag of sir theophilus blazers at the fore a splendid ship carrying guns and nearly midshipmen of different calibres i pass over captain lieutenant and ship's company having made mention of her most valuable qualifications jack was received with a hearty welcome by his uncle for he came in pudding time and was invited to dinner and the admiral made the important discovery that if his nephew was a fool in other points he was certainly no fool at his knife and fork in a short time his messmates found out that he was no fool at his fists and his knock down arguments ended much disputation indeed as the french would say jack was perfection in the physique although so very deficient in the morale but if pandora's box proved a plague to the whole world jack had his individual portion of it when he was summoned to box the compass by his worthy uncle sir theophilus blazers who in the course of six months discovered that he could not make his nephew box it in the three which he had warranted in his letter every day our hero's ears were boxed but the compass never it required all the cardinal virtues to teach him the cardinal points during the forenoon and he made a point of forgetting them before the sun went down whenever they attempted it and various were the teachers employed to drive the compass into jack's head his head drove round the compass and try all he could jack never could compass it it appeared as some people are said only to have one idea as if jack could only have one point in his head at a time and to that point he would stand like a well broken pointer with him the wind never changed until the next day his uncle pronounced him to be a fool but that did not hurt his nephew's feelings he had been told so too often already i have said that jack had a great respect for good eating and drinking and moreover was blessed with a good appetite every person has his peculiar fancies and if there was anything which more titillated the palate and olfactory nerves of our hero it was a roast goose with sage and onions now it so happened that having been about seven months on board of the mendacious jack had one day received a summons to dine with the admiral for the steward had ordered a roast goose for dinner and knew not only that jack was partial to it but also that jack was the admiral's nephew which always goes for something on board of a flag ship just before they were sitting down to table the admiral wishing to know how the wind was and having been not a little vexed with the slow progress of his nephew's nautical acquirements said now mr littlebrain go up and bring me down word how the wind is and mark me as when you are sent nine times out of ten you make a mistake i shall now bet you five guineas against your dinner that you make a mistake this time so now be off and we will soon ascertain whether you lose your dinner or i lose my money sit down gentlemen we will not wait for mr littlebrain jack did not much admire this bet on the part of his uncle but still less did he like the want of good manners in not waiting for him he had just time to see the covers removed to scent a whiff of the goose and was off the admiral wants to know how the wind is sir said jack to the officer of the watch the officer of the watch went to the binnacle and setting the wind as nearly as he could replied tell sir theophilus that it is sw and by w w that's one of those confounded long points that i never can remember cried jack in despair then you'll 'get goose' as the saying is observed one of the midshipmen no i'm afraid that i sha'n't get any replied jack despondingly what did he say sw and by n e not exactly replied his messmate who was a good natured lad and laughed heartily at jack's version sw and by w w i never can remember it cried jack i'm to have five guineas if i do and no dinner if i don't and if i stay here much longer i shall get no dinner at all events for they are all terribly peckish and there will be none left well if you'll give me one of the guineas i'll show you how to manage it said the midshipman i'll give you two if you'll only be quick and the goose a'n't all gone replied jack the midshipman wrote down the point from which the wind blew at full length upon a bit of paper and pinned it to the rim of jack's hat now said he when you go into the cabin you can hold your hat so as to read it without their perceiving you well so i can i never should have thought of that said jack you hav'n't wit enough replied the midshipman well i see no wit in the compass replied jack nevertheless it's full of point replied the midshipman now be quick our hero's eyes served him well if his memory was treacherous and as he entered the cabin door he bowed over his hat very politely and said as he read it off sw and by w w and then he added without reading at all if you please sir theophilus steward said the admiral tell the officer of the watch to step down how's the wind mr growler sw and by w w replied the officer then mr littlebrain you have won your five guineas and may now sit down and enjoy your dinner our hero was not slow in obeying the order and ventured upon the strength of his success to send his plate twice for goose having eaten their dinner drunk their wine and taken their coffee the officers at the same time took the hint which invariably accompanies the latter beverage made their bows and retreated as jack was following his seniors out of the cabin the admiral put the sum which he had staked into his hands observing that it was an ill wind that blew nobody good so thought jack who having faithfully paid the midshipman the two guineas for his assistance was now on the poop keeping his watch as midshipmen usually do that is stretched out on the signal lockers and composing himself to sleep after the most approved fashion answering the winks of the stars by blinks of his eyes until at last he shut them to keep them warm but before he had quite composed himself he thought of the goose and the five guineas the wind was from the same quarter blowing soft and mild jack lay in a sort of reverie as it fanned his cheek for the weather was close and sultry well muttered jack to himself i do love that point of the compass at all events and i think that i never shall forget sw and by w w no i never never liked one before though is that true whispered a gentle voice in his ear do you love 'sw and by w w' and will you as you say never forget her why what's that said jack opening his eyes and turning half round on his side it's me 'sw and by w w' that you say you love littlebrain raised himself and looked round there was no one on the poop except himself and two or three of the after guard who were lying down between the guns why who was it that spoke said jack much astonished it was the wind you love and who has long loved you replied the same voice do you wish to see me see you see the wind i've been already sent on that message by the midshipmen thought jack do you love me as you say and as i love you continued the voice well i like you better than any other point of the compass and i'm sure i never thought i should like one of them replied jack that will not do for me will you love only me i'm not likely to love the others replied jack shutting his eyes again i hate them all and love me well i do love you that's a fact replied jack as he thought of the goose and the five guineas then look round and you shall see me said the soft voice jack who hardly knew whether he was asleep or awake did at this summons once more take the trouble to open his eyes and beheld a fairy female figure pellucid as water yet apparently possessing substance her features were beautifully soft and mild and her outline trembled and shifted as it were waving gently to and fro it smiled sweetly hung over him played with his chestnut curls softly touched his lips with her own passed her trembling fingers over his cheeks and its warm breath appeared as if it melted into his then it grew more bold embraced his person searched into his neck and collar as if curious to examine him jack felt a pleasure and gratification which he could not well comprehend once more the charmer's lips trembled upon his own now remaining for a moment now withdrawing again returning to kiss and kiss again and once more did the soft voice put the question do you love me better than goose replied jack i don't know who goose may be replied the fairy form as she tossed about jack's waving locks you must love only me promise me that before i am relieved what have you got the first watch as well as me replied jack i am on duty just now but i shall not be so long we southerly winds are never kept long in one place some of my sisters will probably be sent here soon i don't understand what you talk about replied jack suppose you tell me who you are and what you are and i'll do all i can to keep awake i don't know how it is but i've felt more inclined to go to sleep since you have been fanning me about than i did before then i will remain by your side while you listen to me i am as i told you a wind that's puzzling said jack interrupting her my name is 'sw and by w w' yes and a very long name it is if you wish me to remember you you should have had a shorter one this ruffled the wind a little and she blew rather sharp into the corner of jack's eye however she proceeded you are a sailor and of course you know all the winds on the compass by name i wish i did but i don't replied littlebrain i can recollect you and not one other again the wind trembled with delight on his lips and she proceeded you know that there are thirty two points on the compass and these points are divided into quarters so that there are in fact different winds there are more than i could ever remember i know that said jack well we are in all all the winds which have northerly in them are coarse and ugly all the southern winds are pretty you don't say so replied our hero we are summoned to blow as required but the hardest duty generally falls to the northerly winds as it should do for they are the strongest although we southerly winds can blow hard enough when we choose our characters are somewhat different the most unhappy in disposition and i may say the most malevolent are the north and easterly winds the nw winds are powerful but not unkind the se winds vary but at all events we of the sw are considered the mildest and most beneficent do you understand me not altogether you're going right round the compass and i never could make it out that's a fact i hear what you say but i cannot promise to recollect it i can only recollect sw and by w w i care only for your recollecting me if you do that you may forget all the rest now you see we south wests are summer winds and are seldom required but in this season i have often blown over your ship these last three months and i always have lingered near you for i loved you thank you now go on for seven bells have struck some time and i shall be going to turn in is your watch out no i shall blow for some hours longer why will you leave me why wo'n't you stay on deck with me what stay on deck after my watch is out no if i do blow me we midshipmen never do that but i say why can't you come down with me and turn in my hammock it's close to the hatchway and you can easily do it well i will upon one promise you say that you love me now i'm very jealous for we winds are always supplanting one another promise me that you will never mention any other wind in the compass but me for if you do they may come to you and if i hear of it i'll blow the masts out of your ship that i will you don't say so replied jack surveying her fragile trembling form yes i will and on a lee shore too so that the ship shall go to pieces on the rocks and the admiral and every soul on board her be drowned no you wouldn't would you said our hero astonished not if you promise me then i'll come to you and pour down your windsails and dry your washed clothes as they hang on the rigging and just ripple the waves as you glide along and hang upon the lips of my dear love and press him in my arms promise me then on no account ever to recollect or mention any other wind but me well i think i may promise that replied jack for i'm very clever at forgetting and then you'll come to my hammock wo'n't you and sleep with me you'll be a nice cool bedfellow these warm nights i can't sleep on my watch as midshipmen do but i'll watch you while you sleep and i'll fan your cheeks and keep you cool and comfortable till i'm relieved and when you go when will you come again that i cannot tell when i'm summoned and i shall wait with impatience that you may be sure of there's eight bells said jack starting up i must go down and call the officer of the middle watch but i'll soon turn in for my relief is not so big as myself and i can thrash him littlebrain was as good as his word he cut down his relief and then thrashed him for venturing to expostulate the consequence was that in ten minutes he was in his hammock and sw and by w w came gently down the hatchway and rested in his arms jack soon fell fast asleep and when he was wakened up the next morning by the quarter master his bedfellow was no longer there a mate inquiring how the wind was was answered by the quarter master that they had a fresh breeze from the nnw by which jack understood that his sweetheart was no longer on duty our hero had passed such a happy night with his soft and kind companion that he could think of nothing else he longed for her to come again and to the surprise of everybody was now perpetually making inquiries as to the wind which blew he thought of her continually and in fact was as much in love with sw and by w w as he possibly could be she came again once more did he enjoy her delightful company again she slept with him in his hammock and then after a short stay she was relieved by another we do not intend to accuse the wind of inconstancy as that was not her fault nor of treachery for she loved dearly nor of violence for she was all softness and mildness but we do say that sw and by w w was the occasion of jack being very often in a scrape for our hero kept his word he forgot all other wind and with him there was not other except his dear sw and by w w it must be admitted of jack that at all events he showed great perseverance for he stuck to his point our hero would argue with his messmates for it is not those who are most capable of arguing who are most fond of it and like all arguers not very brilliant he would flounder and diverge away right and left just as the flaws of ideas came into his head what nonsense it is your talking that way would his opponent say why don't you come to the point and so i do cried jack well then what is your point sw and by w w replied our hero who could reply to this but in every instance and through every difficulty our hero kept his promise until his uncle sir theophilus was very undecided whether he should send him home to be locked up in a lunatic asylum or bring him on in the service to the rank of post captain upon mature consideration however as a man in bedlam is a very useless member of society and a tee total non productive whereas a captain in the navy is a responsible agent the admiral came to the conclusion that littlebrain must follow up his destiny at last jack was set down as the greatest fool in the ship and was pointed out as such the ladies observed that such might possibly be the case but at all events he was the handsomest young man in the mediterranean fleet we believe that both parties were correct in their assertions time flies even a midshipman's time which does not fly quite so fast as his money and the time came for mr littlebrain's examination sir theophilus who now commanded the whole fleet was almost in despair how was it possible that a man could navigate a ship with only one quarter point of the compass in his head sir theophilus scratched his wig and the disposition of the mediterranean fleet so important to the country was altered according to the dispositions of the captains who commanded the ships in those days there were martinets in the service officers who never overlooked an offence or permitted the least deviation from strict duty who were generally hated but at the same time were most valuable to the service as for his nephew passing his examination before any of those of the first or second or even of the third degree the admiral knew that it was impossible the consequence was that one was sent away on a mission to genoa about nothing another to watch for vessels never expected off sardinia two more to cruise after a french frigate which had never been built and thus by degrees did the admiral arrange so as to obtain a set of officers sufficiently pliant to allow his nephew to creep under the gate which barred his promotion and which he never could have vaulted over so the signal was made our hero went on board his uncle had not forgotten the propriety of a little douceur on the occasion and as the turkeys were all gone three couple of geese were sent in the same boat as a present to each of the three passing captains littlebrain's heart failed him as he pulled to the ship even the geese hissed at him as much as to say if you were not such a stupid ass we might have been left alive in our coops there was a great deal of truth in that remark if they did say so nothing could have been made more easy for littlebrain than his examination the questions had all been arranged beforehand and some kind friend had given him all the answers written down the passing captains apparently suffered from the heat of the weather and each had his hand on his brow looking down on the table at the time that littlebrain gave his answers so that of course they did not observe that he was reading them off as soon as littlebrain had given his answer and had had sufficient time to drop his paper under the table the captains felt better and looked up again there were but eight questions for our hero to answer seven had been satisfactorily got through then came the eighth a very simple one what is your course and distance from ushant to the start this question having been duly put the captains were again in deep meditation shrouding their eyes with the palms of their hands littlebrain had his answer he looked at the paper what could be more simple than to reply and then the captains would have all risen up shaken him by the hand complimented him upon the talent he had displayed sent their compliments to the commander in chief and their thanks for the geese jack was just answering north recollect your promise cried a soft voice which jack well recollected jack stammered the captains were mute and waited patiently i must say it muttered jack you shan't replied the little wind indeed i must said jack or i shall be turned back the captains surprised at this delay and the muttering of jack looked up and one of them gently inquired if mr littlebrain had not dropped his handkerchief or something under the table and then they again fixed their eyes upon the green cloth if you dare i'll never see you again cried sw and by w w never come to your hammock but i'll blow the ship on shore every soul shall be lost admiral and all recollect your promise then i shall never pass replied jack do you think that any other point in the compass shall pass you except me never i'm too jealous for that come now dearest and the wind again deliriously trembled upon the lips of our hero who could no longer resist sw and by w w exclaimed jack firmly you have made a slight mistake mr littlebrain said one of the captains look again i meant to say think again sw and by w w again repeated jack dearest how i love you whispered the soft wind why mr littlebrain said one of the captains for jack had actually laid the paper down on the table what's in the wind now she's obstinate replied jack you appear to be so at all events replied the captain pray try once more i have it thought jack who tore off the last answer from his paper i gained five guineas by that plan once before he then handed the bit of paper to the passing captain i believe that's right sir said our hero yes that is right but could you not have said it instead of writing it mr littlebrain jack made no reply his little sweetheart pouted a little but said nothing it was an evasion which she did not like a few seconds of consultation then took place as a matter of form each captain asked of the other if he was perfectly satisfied as to mr littlebrain's capabilities and the reply was in the affirmative and they were perfectly satisfied that he was either a fool or a madman however as we have had both in the service by way of precedent jack was added to the list and the next day was appointed lieutenant our hero did his duty as lieutenant of the forecastle and as all the duty of that officer is when hailed from the quarter deck to answer ay ay sir he got on without making many mistakes and now he was very happy no one dared to call him a fool except his uncle he had his own cabin and many was the time that his dear little sw and by w w would come in by the scuttle and nestle by his side you wo'n't see so much of me soon dearest said she one morning gravely why not my soft one replied jack don't you recollect that the winter months are coming on so they are replied jack well i shall long for you back and jack did long and long very much for he loved his dear wind and the fine weather which accompanied her winter came on and heavy gales and rain and thunder and lightning nothing but double reefed topsails and wearing in succession and our hero walked the forecastle and thought of his favourite wind the ne winds came down furiously and the weather was bitter cold the officers shook the rain and spray off their garments when their watch was over and called for grog steward a glass of grog cried one and let it be strong the same for me said jack only i'll mix it myself jack poured out the rum till the tumbler was half full why littlebrain said his messmate that is a dose that's what we call a regular nor wester is it replied jack well then nor westers suit me exactly and i shall stick to them like cobbler's wax and during the whole of the winter months our hero showed a great predilection for nor westers it was in the latter end of february that there was a heavy gale it had blown furiously from the northward for three days and then it paused and panted as if out of breath no wonder and then the wind shifted and shifted again with squalls and heavy rain until it blew from every quarter of the compass our hero's watch was over and he came down and called for a nor wester as usual how is the wind now asked the first lieutenant to the master who came down dripping wet ssw but drawing now fast to the westward said old spunyarn and so it was and it veered round until sw and by w w with an angry gust came down the sky light and blowing strongly into our hero's ear cried oh you false one false exclaimed jack what you here and so angry too what's the matter what's the matter do you think i don't know what have you been doing ever since i was away comforting yourself during my absence with nor westers why you an't jealous of a nor wester are you replied littlebrain i confess i'm rather partial to them what this to my face i'll never come again without you promise me that you will have nothing to do with them and never call for one again be quick i cannot stay more than two minutes for it is hard work now and we relieve quick say the word well then replied littlebrain you've no objection to half and half none in the world that's quite another thing and has nothing to do with the wind it has though thought jack for it gets a man in the wind but i wo'n't tell her so and continued he you don't mind a raw nip do you no i care for nothing except a nor wester i'll never call for one again replied jack it is but making my grog a little stronger in future it shall be half and half that's a dear now i'm off don't forget me and away went the wind in a great hurry it was about three months after this short visit the fleet being off corsica that our hero was walking the deck thinking that he soon should see the object of his affections when a privateer brig was discovered at anchor a few miles from bastia the signal was made for the boats of the fleet to cut her out and the admiral wishing that his nephew should distinguish himself somehow gave him the command of one of the finest boats now jack was as brave as brave could be he did not know what danger was he hadn't wit enough to perceive it and there was no doubt but he would distinguish himself the boats went on the service jack was the very first on board cheering his men as he darted into the closed ranks of his opponents whether it was that he did not think that his head was worth defending or that he was too busy in breaking the heads of others to look after his own this is certain that a tomahawk descended upon it with such force as to bury itself in his skull and his was a thick skull too the privateer's men were overpowered by numbers and then our hero was discovered under a pile of bodies still breathing heavily he was hoisted on board and taken into his uncle's cabin the surgeon shook his head when he had examined that of our hero it must have been a most tremendous blow said he to the admiral to have penetrated it must have been indeed replied the admiral as the tears rolled down his cheeks for he loved his nephew the surgeon having done all that his art would enable him left the cabin to attend to the others who were hurt the admiral also went on the quarter deck walking to and fro for an hour in a melancholy mood he returned to the cabin and bent over his nephew jack opened his eyes my dear fellow said the admiral how's your head now sw and by w w faintly exclaimed our hero constant in death as he turned a little on one side and expired it was three days afterwards as the fleet were on a wind making for malta that the bell of the ship tolled and a body sewed up in a hammock and covered with the union jack was carried to the gangway by the admiral's bargemen it had been a dull cloudy day with little wind the hands were turned up the officers and men stood uncovered the admiral in advance with his arms folded as the chaplain read the funeral service over the body of our hero and as the service proceeded the sails flapped for the wind had shifted a little a motion was made by the hand of the officer of the watch to the man at the helm to let the ship go off the wind that the service might not be disturbed and a mizzling soft rain descended the wind had shifted to our hero's much loved point his fond mistress had come to mourn over the loss of her dearest and the rain that descended were the tears which she shed at the death of her handsome but not over gifted lover the sky blue domino it was a fine autumnal evening i had been walking with a friend until dusk on the piazza grande or principal square in the town of lucca we had been conversing of england our own country from which i had then banished myself for nearly four years having taken up my residence in italy to fortify a weak constitution and having remained there long after it was requisite for my health from an attachment to its pure sky and the dolce far niente which so wins upon you in that luxurious climate we had communicated to each other the contents of our respective letters arrived by the last mail had talked over politics great men acquaintances friends and kindred and tired of conversation had both sank into a pleasing reverie as we watched the stars twinkling above us when my friend rose hastily and bid me good night where are you going alfred inquired i i had nearly forgetten i had an appointment this evening i promised to meet somebody at the marquesa di cesto's masquerade pshaw are you not tired of these things replied i that eternal round of black masks and dominos of all colours heavy harlequins fools and clowns by nature wearing their proper dresses there and only in masquerade when out of it nuns who have no holiness in their ideas friars without a spice of religion ugly venuses dianas without chastity and hebes as old as your grandmother all very true herbert and life itself is masquerade enough but the fact is that i have made an appointment it is of importance and i must not fail well i wish you more amusement than i have generally extracted from these burlesque meetings replied i adieu and may you be successful and albert hastened away i remained another half hour reclining on the bench and then returned to my lodgings my servant antonio lighted the candle and withdrew on the table lay a note it was an invitation from the marquesa i threw it on one side and took up a book one that required reflection and deep examination but the rattling of the wheels of the carriages as they whirled along past my window would not permit me to command my attention i threw down the book and taking a chair at the window watched the carriages full of masks as they rolled past apparently so eager in the pursuit of pleasure i was in a cynical humour what fools thought i and yet what numbers will be there there will be an immense crowd and what can be the assignation which albert said was of such consequence such was my reflection for the next ten minutes during which at least fifty carriages and other vehicles had passed in review before me and then i thought of the princely fortune of the marquesa the splendid palazzo at which the masquerade was given and the brilliant scene which would take place the grand duke is to be there and everybody of distinction in lucca i have a great mind to go myself a few minutes more elapsed i felt that i was lonely and i made up my mind that i would go i turned from the window and rang the bell antonio see if you can procure me a domino a dark coloured one if possible and tell carlo to bring the carriage round as soon as he can antonio departed and was away so long that the carriage was at the door previous to his return signor i am sorry very very sorry but i have run to every shop in lucca and there is nothing left but a sky blue domino which i have brought with me sky blue why there will not be two sky blue dominos in the whole masquerade i might as well tell my name at once i shall be so conspicuous you are as well hidden under a sky blue domino as a black one signor if you choose to keep your own secrets observed antonio very true replied i give me my mask enshrouding myself in the sky blue domino i went down the stairs threw myself into the carriage and directed carlo to drive to the palazzo of the marquesa in half an hour we arrived at the entrance gates of the marquesa's superb country seat from these gates to the palazzo a sweep of several hundred yards the avenue through which the driver passed was loaded with variegated lamps hanging in graceful festoons from branch to branch and the notes of music from the vast entrance hall of the palazzo floated through the still air when i arrived at the area in front of the flight of marble steps which formed the entrance of the palazzo i was astonished at the magnificence the good taste and the total disregard of expense which were exhibited the palazzo itself appeared like the fabric built of diamonds and precious stones by the genii who obeyed the ring and lamp of aladdin so completely was its marble front hidden with a mass of many coloured lamps the reflection from whose galaxy of light rendered it bright as day for nearly one hundred yards around various mottoes and transparencies were arranged in the walks nearest to the palazzo and then all was dark rendered still darker from the contrast with the flood of light which poured to a certain distance from the scene of festivity groups of characters and dominos were walking to and fro in every direction most of them retracing their steps when they arrived at the sombre walks and alleys some few pairs only continuing their route where no listeners were to be expected this is an animating scene thought i as the carriage stopped and i am not sorry that i have made one of the party as soon as i had descended i walked up the flight of marble steps which led to the spacious hall in which the major part of the company were collected the music had for a moment ceased to play and finding that the perfume of the exotics which decorated the hall was too powerful i was again descending the steps when my hand was seized and warmly pressed by one in a violet coloured domino i am so glad that you are come we were afraid that you would not i will see you again directly said the domino and it then fell back into the crowd and disappeared it immediately occurred to me that it was my friend albert who spoke to me very odd thought i that he should have found me out and again i fell into the absurdity of imagining that because i had put on a conspicuous domino i was sure to be recognised what can he want with me he must be in some difficulty some unexpected one that is certain such were my reflections as i slowly descended the steps occasionally pausing for a moment on one as i was lost in conjecture when i was again arrested by a slight slap on the shoulder i looked around it was a female and although she wore her half mask it was evident that she was young and i felt convinced that she was beautiful not a word whispered she putting her finger to her lip follow me of course i followed who could resist such a challenge you are late said the incognito when we had walked so far away from the palazzo as to be out of hearing of the crowd i did not make up my mind to come until an hour ago replied i i was so afraid that you would not come albert was sure that you would he was right he told me just now that he had spoken to you what was that albert in the rose coloured domino yes but i dare not stay now my father will be looking for me albert is keeping him in conversation in half an hour he will speak to you again has he explained to you what has occurred not one word if he has not had time and i doubt if he will have as he must attend to the preparations i will write a few lines if i can and explain or at least tell you what to do but i am so harassed so frightened we do indeed require your assistance adieu so saying the fair unknown tripped hastily away what the deuce is all this muttered i as i watched her retreating figure albert said that he had an appointment but he did not make me his confidant it appears that something which has occurred this night occasions him to require my assistance well i will not fail him for about half an hour i sauntered up and down between the lines of orange trees which were dressed up with variegated lamps and shed their powerful fragrance in the air i ruminated upon what might be my friend's intentions and what might be the result of an intrigue carried on in a country where the stiletto follows love so close through all the mazes of his labyrinth when i was again accosted by the violet coloured domino hist whispered he looking carefully round as he thrust a paper into my hand read this after i leave you in one hour from this be you on this spot are you armed no replied i but albert you may not need it but nevertheless take this i cannot wait so saying he put a stiletto into my hand and again made a hasty retreat it had been my intention to have asked albert what was his plan and further why he did not speak english instead of italian as he would have been less liable to be understood if overheard by eavesdroppers but a little reflection told me that he was right in speaking italian as the english language overheard would have betrayed him or at least have identified him as a foreigner a very mysterious affair this thought i but however this paper will i presume explain the business that there is a danger in it is evident or he would not have given me this weapon and i turned the stiletto once or twice to the light of the lamp next to me examining its blade when looking up i perceived a black domino standing before me it is sharp enough i warrant said the domino you have but to strike home i have been waiting for you in the next walk which i thought was to be our rendezvous here is a paper which you will fasten to his dress i will contrive that he shall be here in an hour hence by a pretended message after his death you will put this packet into his bosom you understand fail not remember the one thousand sequins and here is my ring which i will redeem as soon as your work is done the others will soon be here the pass word is 'milano' but i must not be seen here why a sky blue domino it is too conspicuous for escape and as i received from him the packet and ring the black domino retreated through the orange grove which encircled us i was lost in amazement there i stood with my hands full two papers a packet a stiletto and a diamond ring well thought i this time i am most assuredly taken for somebody else for a bravo i am not there is some foul work going on which perhaps i may prevent but why a sky blue domino said he i may well ask the same question why the deuce did i come here in a sky blue domino or any domino at all i put the ring on my finger the stiletto and packet in my bosom and then hastened away to the garden on the other side of the palazzo that i might read the mysterious communication put into my hands by my friend albert and as i walked on my love for admiration led me away so as to find myself pleased with the mystery and danger attending upon the affair and feeling secure now that i had a stiletto in my bosom for my defence i resolved that i would go right through it until the whole affair should be unravelled i walked on till i had gained the last lamp on the other side of the palazzo i held up to its light the mysterious paper it was in italian and in a woman's handwriting we have determined upon flight as we cannot hope for safety here surrounded as we are by stilettoes on every side we feel sure of pardon as soon as the papers which albert received by this day's mail and which he will entrust to you when you meet again are placed in my father's hands we must have your assistance in removing our treasure our horses are all ready and a few hours will put us in safety but we must look to you for following us in your carriage and conveying for me what would prove so great an incumbrance to our necessary speed when albert sees you again he will be able to tell you where it is deposited follow us quick and you will always have the gratitude of viola ps i write in great haste as i cannot leave my father's side for a moment without his seeking for me what can all this mean albert told me of no papers by this day's mail viola i never heard him mention such a name he said to me 'read this and all will be explained' i'll be hanged if i am not as much in the dark as ever follow them in my carriage with the treasure never says where i presume he is about to run off with some rich heiress confound this sky blue domino here i am with two papers a packet a stiletto and a ring i am to receive another packet and am to convey treasure well it must solve itself i will back to my post but first let me see what is in this paper which i am to affix upon the man's dress after i have killed him i held it up to the light and read in capital letters the reward of a traitor short and pithy muttered i as i replaced it in my pocket now i'll back to the spot of assignation for the hour must be nearly expired as i retraced my steps i again reverted to the communication of viola 'surrounded as we are by stilettoes on every side' why surely albert cannot be the person that i am required by the black domino to despatch and yet it may be so and others are to join me here before the hour is passed a thought struck me whoever the party might be whose life was to be taken whether albert or another i could save him my reverie was again broken by a tap on the shoulder am i right what is the pass word milano replied i in a whisper all's right then giacomo and tomaso are close by i will fetch them the man turned away and in a minute re appeared with two others bending as they forced their way under the orange trees here we all are felippo whispered the first he is to be here in a few minutes hush replied i in a whisper and holding up to them the brilliant ring which sparkled on my finger ah signor i cry your mercy replied the man in a low voice i thought it was felippo not so loud replied i still in a whisper all is discovered and felippo is arrested you must away immediately you shall hear from me to morrow corpo di bacco where signor at the old place yes now away and save yourselves in a few seconds the desperate men disappeared among the trees and i was left alone slaves of the ring you have done my bidding at all events this time thought i and i looked at the ring more attentively it was a splendid solitaire diamond worth many hundred crowns will you ever find your way back to your lawful owner was the question in my mind when albert made his appearance in his violet coloured domino 'twas imprudent of you to send me the paper by the black domino said he hastily did i not tell you that i would be here in an hour we have not a moment to spare follow me quickly and be silent i followed the paper which albert referred to needed no explanation it was indeed the only part of the whole affair which i comprehended he led the way to about three hundred yards of the path through the wood there said he in that narrow avenue you will find my faithful negro with his charge he will not deliver it up without you show him this ring and albert put a ring upon my finger but albert my mind misgave me albert never had a faithful negro to my knowledge it must be some other person who had mistaken me for his friend i am afraid continued i afraid let me not hear you say that you never yet knew fear said he interrupting me what have you to fear between this and pisa your own horses will take you there in three hours but here's the packet which you must deliver yourself now that you know where the negro is return to the palazzo deliver it into his own hands requesting his immediate perusal after that do not wait a moment but hasten here to your charge while the grand duke is reading it i will escape with viola i really cannot understand all this said i taking the packet all will be explained when we meet at pisa away now to the grand duke i will go to the negro and prepare him for your coming but allow me not a word more if you love me replied the violet coloured domino who i was now convinced was not albert it was not his voice there was a mystery and a mistake but i had become so implicated that i felt i could not retreat without sacrificing the parties whoever they might be well said i as i turned back to the palazzo i must go on now for as a gentleman and man of honour i cannot refuse i will give the packet to the grand duke and i will also convey his treasure to pisa confound this sky blue domino as i returned to the palazzo i was accosted by the black domino milano replied i is all right felippo said he in a whisper all is right signor was my answer where is he i pointed with my finger to a clump of orange trees and the paper and packet i nodded my head then you had better away i will see you to morrow at the old place signor yes replied the black domino cutting into a cross path and disappearing i arrived at the palazzo mounted the steps forced my way through the crowd and perceived the grand duke in an inner saloon the lady who had accosted me leaning on his arm it then occurred to me that the grand duke had an only daughter whose name was viola i entered the saloon which was not crowded and walking boldly up to the grand duke presented the packet requesting that his highness would give it his immediate attention i then bowed and hastened away once more passed through the thronged hall and gained the marble steps of the palazzo have you given it said a low voice close to me i have replied i but signor not a word carlo hasten to the wood if you love me and the violet coloured domino forced his way into the crowd which filled the hall now for my journey to pisa said i here i am implicated in high treason perhaps in consequence of my putting on a sky blue domino well there's no help for it in a few minutes i had gained the narrow avenue and having pursued it about fifty yards perceived the glaring eyes of the crouched negro by the starlight i could just distinguish that he had a basket or something like one before him what do you come for signor said the negro rising on his feet for what has been placed under your charge here is the ring of your master the negro put his fingers to the ring and felt it that he might recognise it by its size and shape here it is signor said he lifting up the basket gently and putting it into my arms it was not heavy although somewhat cumbrous from its size hark signor there is confusion in the palazzo you must be quick and i must not be seen with you and away darted the negro like lightning through the bushes i also hastened away with the basket contents unknown for it appeared to me that affairs were coming to a crisis i heard people running different ways and voices approaching me when i emerged from the narrow avenue i perceived several figures coming down the dark walk at a rapid pace and seized with a sort of panic i took to my heels i soon found that they were in pursuit and i increased my speed in the gloom of the night i unfortunately tripped over a stone and fell with the basket to the ground and then the screams from within informed me that the treasure intrusted to my safe keeping was a child fearful that it was hurt and forgetting for the time the danger of being captured i opened the lid and examined its limbs while i tried to pacify it and while i was sitting down in my sky blue domino thus occupied in hushing a baby i was seized by both shoulders and found myself a prisoner what is the meaning of this rudeness signors said i hardly knowing what to say you are arrested by order of the grand duke was the reply i am arrested why i am an englishman that makes no difference the orders are to arrest all found in the garden in sky blue dominos confound the sky blue domino thought i for the twentieth time at least well signors i will attend you but first let me try to pacify this poor frightened infant strange that he should be found running away with a child at the same time that the lady viola has disappeared observed one of my captors you are right signors replied i it is very strange and what is more strange is that i can no more explain it than you can i am now ready to accompany you oblige me by one of you carrying the basket while i take care of the infant in a few minutes we had arrived at the palazzo i had retained my mask and i was conducted through the crowd into the saloon into which i had previously entered when i delivered the packet to the grand duke there he is there he is was buzzed through the crowd in the hall holy virgin he has a child in his arms bambino bellissimo such were the exclamations of wonder and surprise as they made a lane for my passage and i was in the presence of the grand duke who appeared to be in a state of great excitement it is the same person exclaimed the duke confess are you not the party who put a packet into my hands about a quarter of an hour since i am the person your highness replied i as i patted and soothed the frightened child who gave it to you may it please your highness i do not know what child is that may it please your highness i do not know where did you get it out of that basket your highness who gave you the basket may it please your highness i do not know you are trifling with me let him be searched may it please your highness i will save them that trouble if one of the ladies will take the infant i have received a great many presents this evening all of which i will have the honour of displaying before your highness one of the ladies held out her arms to the infant who immediately bent from mine toward her naturally clinging to the other sex as its friend in distress in the first place your highness i have this evening received this ring taking off my finger the one given by the party in a violet coloured domino and presenting it to him and from whom said his highness instantly recognising the ring may it please your highness i do not know i have also received another ring your highness continued i taking off the ring given me by the black domino and who gave you this interrogated the duke again evidently recognising it may it please your highness i do not know also this stiletto but from whom i must again repeat i do not know also this packet with directions to put it into a dead man's bosom and you are i presume equally ignorant of the party who gave it to you equally so your highness as ignorant as i am of the party who desired me to present you with the other packet which i delivered here is also a paper i was desired to pin upon a man's clothes after i had assassinated him indeed and to this also you plead total ignorance i have but one answer to give to all your highness which is i do not know perhaps sir you do not know your own name or profession observed his highness with a sneer yes your highness replied i taking off my mask that i do know i am an englishman and i trust a gentleman and a man of honour my name is herbert and i have more than once had the honour to be a guest at your highness's entertainments signor i recognise you replied the grand duke let the room be cleared i must speak with this gentleman alone when the company had quitted the saloon i entered into a minute detail of the events of the evening to which his highness paid the greatest attention and when i had finished the whole mystery was unravelled to me by him and with which i will now satisfy the curiosity of my readers the grand duke had one daughter by name viola whom he had wished to marry to rodolph count of istria but viola had met with albert marquis of salerno and a mutual attachment had ensued although the grand duke would not force his daughter's wishes and oblige her to marry count rodolph at the same time he would not consent to her espousals with the marquis albert count rodolph had discovered the intimacy between viola and the marquis of salerno and had made more than one unsuccessful attempt to get rid of his rival by assassination after some time a private marriage with the marquis had been consented to by viola and a year afterwards the lady viola retired to the country and without the knowledge or even suspicions of her father had given birth to a male child which had been passed off as the offspring of one of the ladies of the court who was married and to whom the secret had been confided at this period the secret societies especially the carbonari had become formidable in italy and all the crowned heads and reigning princes were using every exertion to suppress them count rodolph was at the head of these societies having joined them to increase his power and to have at his disposal the means of getting rid of his rival of this the marquis of salerno had received intimation and for some time had been trying to obtain proof against the count for he knew that if once it was proved count rodolph would never be again permitted to appear in the state of lucca on the other hand count rodolph had been making every arrangement to get rid of his rival and had determined that it should be effected at this masquerade the marquis of salerno had notice given him of this intention and also had on that morning obtained the proof against count rodolph which he was now determined to forward to the grand duke but aware that his assassination by the carbonari was to be attempted and also that the wrath of the grand duke would be excessive when he was informed of their private marriage he resolved to fly with his wife to pisa trusting that the proofs of count rodolph being connected with the carbonari and a little time would soften down the grand duke's anger the marquis had arranged that he should escape from the duke's dominions on the night of the masquerade as it would be much easier for his wife to accompany him from thence than from the grand duke's palace which was well guarded but it was necessary that they should travel on horseback and they could not take their child with them viola would not consent that it should be left behind and on this emergency he had written to his friend the count d'ossore to come to their assistance at the masquerade and that they might recognise him to wear a sky blue domino a colour but seldom put on the count d'ossore had that morning left his town mansion on a hunting excursion and did not receive the letter of which the marquis and viola were ignorant such was the state of affairs at the time that i put on the sky blue domino to go to the masquerade my first meeting with the marquis in his violet coloured domino is easily understood being in a sky blue domino i was mistaken for the count d'ossore i was myself led into the mistake by the marquis albert having the same christian name as my english friend the second meeting with the count rodolph in the black domino was accidental the next walk had been appointed as the place of meeting with the carbonari felippo and his companions but count rodolph perceiving me examining my stiletto by the light of the lamp presumed that i was felippo and that i had mistaken the one path for the other which had been agreed upon the papers given to me by count rodolph were carbonari papers which were to be hid in the marquis's bosom after he had been assassinated to make it appear that he had belonged to that society and by the paper affixed to his clothes that he had been murdered by the agents of the society for having betrayed them the papers which the marquis had requested me to give to the grand duke were the proofs of count rodolph's belonging to the secret society and with those papers was enclosed a letter to the grand duke in which they acknowledged their secret union and now i believe the reader will comprehend the whole of this mysterious affair after all had been explained i ventured to ask his highness if he would permit me to fulfil my promise of taking the child to its mother as i considered it a point of honour that i should keep my engagement the more so as the delay would occasion the greatest distress to his daughter and i ventured to add that i trusted his highness would pardon what could not now be remedied and that i should have the satisfaction of being the bearer of such pleasing intelligence to his daughter and the marquis the grand duke paced the room for a minute and then replied signor herbert i feel so disgusted with the treachery and baseness of count rodolph that i hardly need observe if my daughter were free he never should espouse her indeed he will have immediate orders to quit the state you have been instrumental in preserving the life of the marquis of salerno who is my son in law and as matters now stand i am indebted to you your dismissal of the bravos by means of the count's ring was a masterly stroke you shall have the pleasure of taking my forgiveness to my daughter and her husband but as for the child it may as well remain here tell viola i retain it as a hostage for the quick return of its mother i took my leave of his highness and hastened to pisa where i soon found out the retreat of the marquis and his wife i sent up my name requesting immediate admittance as having a message from the grand duke i found them in great distress the count d'ossore had returned late on the night of the masquerade found the letter hastened to the marquesa de cesto's and had arrived just after the elopement had been discovered he immediately followed them to pisa when an explanation took place and they discovered that they had been communicating with some unknown person by whom they had in all probability been betrayed it would be difficult to portray their astonishment and joy when i entered into a detail of what had occurred and wound up with the message from the grand duke and i hardly need add now that i wind up my story that the proofs of gratitude i received from the marquis and his wife during my subsequent residence in italy left me no occasion to repent that i had gone to the masquerade of the marquesa de cesto in a sky blue domino modern town houses i have often thought when you consider the difference of comfort between houses built from sixty to a hundred years back in comparison with the modern edifices that the cry of the magician in aladdin had he called out new houses instead of new lamps for old ones would not have appeared so very absurd it was my good fortune for the major part of my life to occupy an ancient house built i believe in the reign of queen elizabeth my father lived in it before i was in existence i was born in it and it was bequeathed to me it has since been my misfortune to have lived three years in one of the modern built houses and although i have had my share of the ills to which we all are heir i must date my real unhappiness from the first month after i took possession with your permission i will enter into my history as it may prove a warning to others who will not remember the old proverb of let well alone i am a married man with six children my three eldest are daughters and have now quitted a school near portman square to which my wife insisted upon my sending them as it was renowned for finishing young ladies until their return to domiciliate themselves under my roof i never heard a complaint of my house which was situated at brompton it was large airy and comfortable with excellent shrubberies and a few acres of land and i possessed every comfort and even luxury which could be rationally required my wife and daughters having their carriage and in every respect my establishment being that of a gentleman i had not however taken my daughters from school more than two months before i was told that we were living out of the world although not a mile and a half from hyde park corner and to my surprise my wife joined in the cry it was always from morn to night we might do this but we cannot do this because we are here quite out of the world it was too far to dine out in town too far for people to come and dine with us too far to go to the play or the opera too far to drive in the park too far even to walk in kensington gardens i remonstrated that we had managed to dine out to receive visitors and to enjoy all other amusements very well for a considerable number of years and that it did not appear to me that brompton had walked away from london on the contrary that london was making rapid advances towards brompton but it would not do all day the phrase rang in my ears out of the world until i almost began to wish that i was out too but it is no use having the best of an argument when opposed to women i had my choice either to give up my house and take another in london or to give up my peace with an unwilling sigh i at last consented to leave a place dear to me from long association and many reminiscences and it was arranged that brompton hall was to be let or sold and that we were to look out immediately for a house in some of the squares in the metropolis if my wife and daughters found that the distance from london was too far for other purposes at all events it was not too far for house hunting they were at it incessantly week after week and at last they fixed upon one in the neighbourhood of belgrave square which as they repeated possessed all the cheerfulness and fresh air of the country with all the advantages of a town residence the next day i was to be dragged to see it and give my opinion at the same time from the commendations bestowed upon it previous to my going i felt assured that i was expected to give their opinion and not my own the next day accordingly we repaired thither setting off immediately after breakfast to meet the surveyor and builder who was to be on the spot the house in question was one of a row just building or built whitened outside in imitation of stone it was no no was finished but the windows still stained with the drippings of the whitewash and colouring no the one in question was complete and as the builder asserted ready for immediate occupation no was not so far advanced as for the others they were at present nothing but carcases without even the front steps built to them and you entered them by a drawbridge of planks the builder stood at the front door and bowed most respectfully why observed i looking at the piles of mortar lime and bricks standing about in all directions we shall be smothered with dust and lime for the next two years don't be alarmed sir replied the builder every house in the row will be finished before the winter we really cannot attend to the applications for them we entered the house is not the entrance handsome observed my wife so neat and clean to this i had not a reply to make it certainly did look neat and clean we went into the dining room what a nice room exclaimed my eldest daughter how many can we dine in this room um replied i about twelve i suppose comfortably dear me observed the builder you have no notion of the size of the house rooms are so deceiving unfurnished you may sit down twenty with ease i'll appeal to the lady don't you think so ma'am yes i do replied my wife after that we went over the drawing rooms bedrooms and attics every bedroom was apportioned by my wife and daughters and the others were allotted to the servants and that in the presence of the builder who took good note of all that passed the kitchen was admired so were the pantry scullery coal hole dust hole c all so nice and clean so compact and as the builder observed not a nail to drive anywhere well my dear what do you think now isn't it a charming house said my wife as we re ascended into the dining parlour it's a very nice house my dear but still it requires a little consideration replied i consideration my dear replied my wife what now that you have gone over it i am afraid that i cannot give you very long sir observed the builder there are two other parties after the house and i am to give them an answer by two o'clock mr smithers told me the same yesterday whispered my wife what did you say the rent was mr smithers only l per annum any ground rent only l s and the taxes oh they will be a mere trifle the rent appears to me to be very high high my dear sir consider the situation the advantages we can't build them fast enough at that price but of course sir you best know replied he carelessly walking towards the window take it my dear said my wife you must take it papa pray take it papa mr whats your name i beg your pardon smithers sir said the builder turning round pray mr smithers what term of lease do you let at seven fourteen or twenty one at the option of either party sir i should have no objection to take it for three years three years my dear sir that would be doing yourself an injustice you would lose half the value of your fixtures provided you left and then the furniture depend upon it sir if you once get into it you will never wish to leave it that may or not be replied i but i will not take it for more than three years the town air may not agree with me and if as you say people are so anxious to take the houses of course it can make no difference to you i'm afraid sir that for so short a time i will not take it for longer replied i rising up glad of an excuse to be off oh papa my dear mr b on that point replied i i will not be overruled i will not take a lease for more than three years with the right of continuing if i please the builder perceived that i was in earnest well sir replied he i hardly know what to say but rather than disappoint the ladies i will accept you as a tenant for three years certain confound the fellow thought i but i was pinned and there was an end of the matter mr smithers pulled out paper and ink two letters of agreement were written upon a small deal table covered with blotches of various coloured paints and the affair was thus concluded we got into the carriage and drove home my wife and daughters in ecstasies and i obliged to appear very well satisfied that i might not damp their spirits yet i must say that although the house appeared a very nice house i had my forebodings at all events thought i the lease is only for three years and thus i consoled myself the next day the whole house was in commotion i believe my wife and daughters were up at daybreak when i went into the breakfast room i discovered that the pictures had been taken down although there was no chance of their being hung up for many weeks at least and everything was in preparation for packing up after breakfast my wife set off for town to order carpets and curtains and did not come home till six o'clock very tired with the fatigues of the day she had also brought the measure of every grate to ascertain what fenders would suit the measure of the bedrooms and attics to remodel the carpets for it was proposed that brompton hall should be disposed of the new occupier taking at a valuation what furniture might be left to this i appeared to consent but was resolved in my own mind that if taken it should only be for the same term of years as my new lease i will pass over a month of hurry bustle and confusion at the end of which i found myself in our new habitation it was completely furnished with the exception of the drawing room carpet which had not been laid down but was still in a roll tied up with packthread in the middle of the room the cause of this i soon understood from my wife it was always the custom she said to give a house warming upon entering a new house and she therefore proposed giving a little dance to this as it would please her and my daughters i raised no objection i have always observed that what is proposed as a little dance invariably ends in a great one for from the time of proposing till the cards are about it increases like a snow ball but that arises perhaps from the extreme difficulty of knowing when to draw the line between friends and acquaintances i have also observed that when your wife and daughters intend such a thing they always obtain permission for the ball first and then tack on the supper afterwards commencing with a mere stand up affair sandwiches cakes and refreshments and ending with a regular sit down affair with gunter presiding over all the music from two fiddles and a piano also swells into collinet's band verifying the old adage in for a penny in for a pound but to all this i gave my consent i could afford it well and i liked to please my wife and daughters the ball was given and this house warming ended in house breaking for just before the supper quadrille as it was termed when about twenty four young ladies and gentlemen were going the grand ronde a loud noise below with exclamations and shrieks was heard and soon afterwards the whole staircase was smothered with dust what is the matter cried my wife who had passed to the landing place on the stairs before me ma'am said one of mr gunter's men shaking the lappets of his blue coat which were covered with white dust the whole ceiling of the dining room has come down ceiling come down screamed my wife yes ma'am replied our own servant and the supper and supper tables are all smashed flat with the weight on it here was a catastrophe my wife hastened down and i followed sure enough the weight of mortar had crushed all beneath it all was chaos and confusion jellies blancmanges pates cold roasts creams trifles all in one mass of ruin mixed up with lime horse hair plaster of paris and stucco it wore all the appearance of a swiss avalanche in miniature good heavens how dreadful exclaimed my wife how much more so if there had been people in the room replied i what could be the cause of it exclaimed my wife these new houses sir won't bear dancing in observed mr gunter's head man so it appears replied i this unfortunate accident was the occasion of the party breaking up they knew that there was no chance of supper which they had looked forward to so they put on their shawls and departed leaving us to clear up the wreck at our leisure in fact as my daughters declared it quite spoiled the ball as well as the supper the next morning i sent for mr smithers who made his appearance and showed him what had taken place dear me i'm very sorry but you had too many people above stairs that is very clear very clear indeed mr smithers we had a ball last night a ball sir oh then no wonder no wonder what do you mean to say that balls are not to be given why really sir we do not build private houses for ball rooms we could not sir the price of timber just now is enormous and the additional strength required would never pay us what then do you mean to say that there are no balls to be given in london oh no sir certainly not but you must be aware that few people do even our aristocracy hire willis's rooms for their balls some of the old houses indeed such as devonshire house may do for such a thing but mr smithers i expect you will make this ceiling good much obliged to you sir for giving me the preference i will do it as reasonable as anybody replied mr smithers bowing i will order my workmen directly they are only next door for a fortnight we were condemned to dine in the back dining room and after that mr smithers sent in a bill which cost me more than the ball and supper so soon as all was right again i determined that i would hang up my pictures for i had been accustomed to look at them for years and i missed them i sent for a carpenter and gave him directions i have the middle now sir exactly said the man standing on the high steps but continued he tapping with his hammer i can't find wood can't find wood no sir replied the man tapping as far as he could reach from right to left nothing to nail to sir but there never is no wood in these new built houses confound your new houses exclaimed i well it is very provoking my dear exclaimed my wife i suppose that their new houses are not built for pictures any more than for balls replied i and i sighed what must be done i think sir if you were to order brass rods to be fixed from one corner to the other we might find means to fasten them observed the carpenter but there's no wood that's certain what the devil is the house built of then exclaimed i all lath and plaster sir replied the man tapping right and left at a heavy expense i procured the rods and at last the pictures were hung up the next annoyance that we had was a very bad smell which we found to proceed from the drains and the bricklayers were sent for all the drains were choked it appeared from their being so very narrow and after having up the whole basement at the expense of l that nuisance was abated we now had two months' repose and i was in hopes that things would go on more comfortably but one day i overheard a conversation between my wife and daughters as i passed by the door of the room which i must candidly acknowledge gave me satisfaction it's really very awkward mamma one don't know where to put anything there's not a cupboard or stow hole in the whole house not even a store room well it is so my dear i wonder we did not observe it when we looked over it what a nice set of cupboards we had at brompton hall oh yes i wish we had them here mamma couldn't we have some built i don't like to speak to your papa about it my dear he has already been put to such expense what with the ceiling and the drains then don't mamma papa is really very good natured the equinoxes now came on and we had several gales of wind with heavy rain the slates blew off and rattled up and down all night while the wind howled round the corner of the square the next morning complaints from all the attic residents one's bed was wetted quite through with the water dropping through the ceiling another had been obliged to put a basin on the floor to catch the leak all declared that the roof was like a sieve sent again for mr smithers and made a complaint this time mr smithers said i with the lease in my hand i believe you will acknowledge these are landlord's repairs certainly sir certainly exclaimed mr smithers i shall desire one of my men to look to it immediately but the fact is with such heavy gales the slates must be expected to move a little duchesses and countesses are very light and the wind gets underneath them duchesses and countesses very light exclaimed my wife what do you mean it's the term we give to slates madam replied he we cannot put on a heavy roof with a brick and a half wall it would not support one brick and a half wall exclaimed i surely mr smithers that's not quite safe with a house so high not quite safe my dear sir if it were a single house but added he in a row one house supports another thank heaven thought i i have but a three years' lease and sixth months are gone already but the annoyances up to this period were internal we now had to experience the external nuisances attending a modern built house no is taken papa and they are getting the furniture in said my eldest daughter one day i hope we shall have nice neighbours and william told mary that mr smithers told him when he met him in the street that he was now going to fit up no as fast as he could the report was true as we found from the report of the carpenters' hammers for the next three or four weeks we could not obtain a moment's sleep except in the early part of the night or a minute's repose to our ears during the day the sound appeared as if it was in our house instead of next door and it commenced at six o'clock in the morning and lasted till seven in the evening i was hammered to death and unfortunately there was a constant succession of rain which prevented me from going out to avoid it i had nothing to do but to watch my pictures as they jumped from the wall with the thumps of the hammers at last no was floored wainscotted and glazed and we had a week's repose by this time no was furnished and the parties who had taken it came in they were a gouty old gentleman and his wife who report said had once been his cook my daughters' hopes of pleasant neighbours were disappointed before they had been in a week we found ourselves at issue the old gentleman's bed was close to the partition wall and in the dead of the night we could distinctly hear his groans and also his execrations and exclamations when the fit came on him my wife and daughters declared that it was quite horrible and that they could not sleep for them upon the eighth day there came a note mrs whortleback's compliments to mr and mrs and begs that the young people will not play on the piany as mr whortleback is very ill with the gout now my daughters were proficients on the piano and practised a great deal this note was anything but satisfactory to play when the old gentleman was ill would be barbarous not to play was to deprive ourselves of our greatest pleasure oh dear how very disagreeable cried my daughters yes my dear but if we can hear his groans it's no wonder that he can hear the piano and harp recollect the wall is only a brick and a half thick i wonder music don't soothe him observed the eldest music is mockery to a man in agony a man who has been broken on the wheel would not have his last hours soothed by the finest orchestra after a week during which we sent every day to inquire after mr whortleback's health we ventured to resume the piano and harp upon which the old gentleman became testy and sent for a man with a trumpet placing him in the balcony and desiring him to play as much out of tune as possible whenever the harp and piano sounded a note thus were we at open hostility with our only neighbour and as we were certain if my daughters touched their instruments to have the trumpet blowing discord for an hour or two either that day or the next at last the piano was unopened and the harp remained in its case before the year closed no became tenanted and here we had a new annoyance it was occupied by a large family and there were four young ladies who were learning music we now had our annoyance it was strum strum all day long one sister up another down and every one knows what a bore the first lessons in music are to those who are compelled to hear them they could just manage to play a tune and that eternal tune was ringing in our ears from morning to night we could not send our compliments or blow a trumpet we were forced to submit to it the nursery also being against the partition wall we had the squalls and noise of the children on the one side added to groans and execrations of the old gentleman on the other however custom reconciled us to everything and the first vexation gradually wore off yet i could not help observing that when i was supposed not to be in hearing the chief conversation of my wife when her friends called upon her consisted of a description of all the nuisances and annoyances that we suffered and i felt assured that she and my daughters were as anxious to return to brompton hall as i was in fact the advantages which they had anticipated by their town residence were not realised in our situation we were as far off from most of our friends and still farther from some than we were before and we had no longer the same amusements to offer them at our former short distance from town access was more easy to those who did not keep a carriage that is the young men and those were the parties who of course my wife and daughters cared for most it was very agreeable to come down with their portmanteaus enjoy the fresh air and green lanes of the country for an afternoon dine sleep and breakfast and return the next morning by conveyances which passed us every quarter of an hour but to dine with us in square when the expense of a hackney coach there and back was no trifle and to return at eleven o'clock at night was not at all agreeable we found that we had not so much society nor were we half so much courted as at brompton hall this was the bitterest blow of all and my wife and daughters would look out of the windows and sigh often a whole day passed without one friend or acquaintance dropping in to relieve its monotony we continued to reside there nevertheless for i had made up my mind that the three years would be well spent if they cured my wife and daughters of their town mania and although anxious as i am sure they were to return i never broached the matter for i was determined that the cure should be radical nos and were finished the next year and by the persuasions of mr smithers were taken by different parties in the spring and now we had another nuisance nothing but eternal rings at the bell the man servant grumbled and was behind with his work and when scolded replied that there was no time for anything that when cleaning his knives and plate the bell was rung and he was obliged to wash himself throw on his jacket and go up to answer the front door that the bell was not rung for us but to find out where some new comer lived and to ascertain this they always rang at the house which appeared the longest inhabited there was no end to the ringing for some months and we had three servants who absolutely refused to stay in so bad a place we had also to contend with letters and notes in the same way brought to us at haphazard does mr so and so live here no he does not then pray where does he this was interminable and not five minutes in the day passed without the door bell being rung for the sake of not changing my servants i was at last put to the expense of an extra boy for no other purpose but to answer the constant applications at the door at last we had remained there for two years and nine months and then my wife would occasionally put the question whether i intended to renew the lease and i naturally replied that i did not like change then she went upon another tack observed that clara did not appear well for some time and that she thought that she required country air but in this i did not choose to agree with her one day i came home and rubbing my hands as if pleased said well at last i've an offer for brompton villa for a term of seven years a very fair offer and good tenants so that will now be off my hands my wife looked mortified and my daughters held down their heads have you let it papa said one of my daughters timidly no not yet but i am to give an answer to morrow morning it requires consideration my dear replied my wife requires consideration said i why my dear the parties have seen the house and i have been trying to let it these three years i recollect when i took this house i said it required consideration but you would not allow any such thing i'm sure i wish we had said clara and so do i the fact is my dear said my wife coming round to the back of my chair and putting her arms round my neck we all wish to go back to brompton yes yes papa added my daughters embracing me on each side you will allow then that i was right in not taking a lease for more than three years yes how lucky you were so positive well then if that is the case we will unfurnish this house and as soon as you please go back to brompton hall i hardly need observe that we took possession of our old abode with delight and that i have had no more applications for a change of residence or have again heard the phrase that we were living out of the world the way to be happy cut your coat according to your cloth is an old maxim and a wise one and if people will only square their ideas according to their circumstances how much happier might we all be if we only would come down a peg or two in our notions in accordance with our waning fortunes happiness would be always within our reach it is not what we have or what we have not which adds or subtracts from our felicity it is the longing for more than we have the envying of those who possess that more and the wish to appear in the world of more consequence than we really are which destroy our peace of mind and eventually lead to ruin i never witnessed a man submitting to circumstances with good humour and good sense so remarkably as in my friend alexander willemott when i first met him since our school days it was at the close of the war he had been a large contractor with government for army clothing and accoutrements and was said to have realised an immense fortune although his accounts were not yet settled indeed it was said that they were so vast that it would employ the time of six clerks for two years to examine them previous to the balance sheet being struck as i observed he had been at school with me and on my return from the east indies i called upon him to renew our old acquaintance and congratulate him upon his success my dear reynolds i am delighted to see you you must come down to belem castle mrs willemott will receive you with pleasure i'm sure you shall see my two girls i consented the chaise stopped at a splendid mansion and i was ushered in by a crowd of liveried servants everything was on the most sumptuous and magnificent scale having paid my respects to the lady of the house i retired to dress as dinner was nearly ready it being then half past seven o'clock it was eight before we sat down to an observation that i made expressing a hope that i had not occasioned the dinner being put off willemott replied on the contrary my dear reynolds we never sit down until about this hour how people can dine at four or five o'clock i cannot conceive i could not touch a mouthful the dinner was excellent and i paid it the encomiums which were its due do not be afraid my dear fellow my cook is an artiste extraordinaire a regular cordon bleu you may eat anything without fear of indigestion how people can live upon the english cookery of the present day i cannot conceive i seldom dine out for fear of being poisoned depend upon it a good cook lengthens your days and no price is too great to insure one when the ladies retired being alone we entered into friendly conversation i expressed my admiration of his daughters who certainly were very handsome and elegant girls very true they are more than passable replied he we have had many offers but not such as come up to my expectations baronets are cheap now a days and irish lords are nothings i hope to settle them comfortably we shall see try this claret you will find it excellent not a headache in a hogshead of it how people can drink port i cannot imagine the next morning he proposed that i should rattle round the park with him i acceded and we set off in a handsome open carriage with four greys ridden by postilions at a rapid pace as we were whirling along he observed in town we must of course drive but a pair but in the country i never go out without four horses there is a spring in four horses which is delightful it makes your spirits elastic and you feel that the poor animals are not at hard labour rather than not drive four i would prefer to stay at home our ride was very pleasant and in such amusements passed away one of the most pleasant weeks that i ever remembered willemott was not the least altered he was as friendly as sincere as open hearted as when a boy at school i left him pleased with his prosperity and acknowledging that he was well deserving of it although his ideas had assumed such a scale of magnificence i went to india when my leave expired and was absent about four years on my return i inquired after my friend willemott and was told that his circumstances and expectations had been greatly altered from many causes such as a change in the government a demand for economy and the wording of his contracts having been differently rendered from what willemott had supposed their meaning to be large items had been struck out of his balance sheet and instead of being a millionaire he was now a gentleman with a handsome property belem castle had been sold and he now lived at richmond as hospitable as ever and was considered a great addition to the neighbourhood i took the earliest opportunity of going down to see him oh my dear reynolds this is really kind of you to come without invitation your room is ready and bed well aired for it was slept in three nights ago come mrs willemott will be delighted to see you i found the girls still unmarried but they were yet young the whole family appeared as contented and happy and as friendly as before we sat down to dinner at six o'clock the footman and the coachman attended the dinner was good but not by the artiste extraordinaire i praised everything yes replied he she is a very good cook she unites the solidity of the english with the delicacy of the french fare and altogether i think it a decided improvement jane is quite a treasure after dinner he observed of course you know i have sold belem castle and reduced my establishment government have not treated me fairly but i am at the mercy of commissioners and a body of men will do that which as individuals they would be ashamed of the fact is the odium is borne by no one in particular and it is only the sense of shame which keeps us honest i am afraid however here you see me with a comfortable fortune and always happy to see my friends especially my old school fellow will you take port or claret the port is very fine and so is the claret by the bye do you know i'll let you into a family secret louisa is to be married to a colonel willer an excellent match it has made us all happy the next day we drove out not in a open carriage as before but in a chariot and with a pair of horses these are handsome horses observed i yes replied he i am fond of good horses and as i only keep a pair i have the best there is a certain degree of pretension in four horses i do not much like it appears as if you wished to overtop your neighbours i spent a few very pleasant days and then quitted his hospitable roof a severe cold caught that winter induced me to take the advice of the physicians and proceed to the south of france where i remained two years on my return i was informed that willemott had speculated and had been unlucky on the stock exchange that he had left richmond and was now living at clapham the next day i met him near the exchange reynolds i am happy to see you thompson told me that you had come back if not better engaged come down to see me i will drive you down at four o'clock if that will suit it suited me very well and at four o'clock i met him according to appointment at a livery stables over the iron bridge his vehicle was ordered out it was a phaeton drawn by two longed tailed ponies altogether a very neat concern we set off at a rapid pace they step out well don't they we shall be down in plenty of time to put on a pair of shoes by five o'clock which is our dinner time late dinners don't agree with me they produce indigestion of course you know that louisa has a little boy i did not but congratulated him yes and has now gone out to india with her husband mary is also engaged to be married a very good match a mr rivers in the law he has been called to the bar this year and promises well they will be a little pinched at first but we must see what we can do for them we stopped at a neat row of houses i forget the name and as we drove up the servant the only man servant came out and took the ponies round to the stable while the maid received my luggage and one or two paper bags containing a few extras for the occasion i was met with the same warmth as usual by mrs willemott the house was small but very neat the remnants of former grandeur appeared here and there in one or two little articles favourites of the lady we sat down at five o'clock to a plain dinner and were attended by the footman who had rubbed down the ponies and pulled on his livery a good plain cook is the best thing after all observed willemott your fine cooks won't condescend to roast and boil will you take some of this sirloin the under cut is excellent my dear give mr reynolds some yorkshire pudding when we were left alone after dinner willemott told me very unconcernedly of his losses it was my own fault said he i wished to make up a little sum for the girls and risking what they would have had i left them almost penniless however we can always command a bottle of port and a beef steak and what more in this world can you have will you take port or white i have no claret to offer you we finished our port but i could perceive no difference in willemott he was just as happy and as cheerful as ever he drove me to town the next day during our drive he observed i like ponies they are so little trouble and i prefer them to driving one horse in this vehicle as i can put my wife and daughters into it it's selfish to keep a carriage for yourself alone and one horse in a four wheeled double chaise appears like an imposition upon the poor animal i went to scotland and remained about a year on my return i found that my friend willemott had again shifted his quarters he was at brighton and having nothing better to do i put myself in the times and arrived at the bedford hotel it was not until after some inquiry that i could find out his address at last i obtained it in a respectable but not fashionable part of this overgrown town willemott received me just as before i have no spare bed to offer you but you must breakfast and dine with us every day our house is small but it's very comfortable and brighton is a very convenient place you know mary is married a good place in the courts was for sale and my wife and i agreed to purchase it for rivers it has reduced us a little but they are very comfortable i have retired from business altogether in fact as my daughters are both married and we have enough to live upon what can we wish for more brighton is very gay and always healthy and as for carriages and horses they are no use here there are flies at every corner of the streets i accepted his invitation to dinner a parlour maid waited but everything although very plain was clean and comfortable i have still a bottle of wine for a friend reynolds said willemott after dinner but for my part i prefer whisky toddy it agrees with me better here's to the health of my two girls god bless them and success to them in life my dear willemott said i i take the liberty of an old friend but i am so astonished at your philosophy that i cannot help it when i call to mind belem castle your large establishment your luxuries your french cook and your stud of cattle i wonder at your contented state of mind under such a change of circumstances i almost wonder myself my dear fellow replied he i never could have believed at that time that i could live happily under such a change of circumstances but the fact is that although i have been a contractor i have a good conscience then my wife is an excellent woman and provided she sees me and her daughters happy thinks nothing about herself and further i have made it a rule as i have been going down hill to find reasons why i should be thankful and not discontented depend upon it reynolds it is not a loss of fortune which will affect your happiness as long as you have peace and love at home i took my leave of willemott and his wife with respect as well as regard convinced that there was no pretended indifference to worldly advantages that it was not that the grapes were sour but that he had learned the whole art of happiness by being contented with what he had and by cutting his coat according to his cloth the legend of the bell rock there was a grand procession through the streets of the two towns of perth and of dundee the holy abbots in their robes walked under gilded canopies the monks chanted the censers were thrown flags and banners were carried by seamen lighted tapers by penitents st antonio the patron of those who trust to the stormy ocean was carried in all pomp through the streets and as the procession passed coins of various value were thrown down by those who watched it from the windows and as fast as thrown were collected by little boys dressed as angels and holding silver vessels to receive the largesses during the whole day did the procession continue and large was the treasure collected in the two towns everyone gave freely for there were few indeed none who if not in their own circle at least among their acquaintances had not to deplore the loss of some one dear to them or to those they visited from the dangerous rock which lay in the very track of all the vessels entering the frith of tay these processions had been arranged that a sufficient sum of money might be collected to enable them to put in execution a plan proposed by an adventurous and bold young seaman in a council held for the purpose of fixing a bell on the rock which could be so arranged that the slightest breath of wind would cause the hammer of it to sound and thus by its tolling warn the mariner of his danger and the sums given were more than sufficient a meeting was then held and it was unanimously agreed that andrew m'clise should be charged with the commission to go over to amsterdam and purchase the bell of a merchant residing there whom andrew stated to have one in his possession which from its fine tone and size was exactly calculated for the purport to which it was to be appropriated andrew m'clise embarked with the money and made a prosperous voyage he had often been at amsterdam and had lived with the merchant whose name was vandermaclin and the attention to his affairs the dexterity and the rapidity of the movements of andrew m'clise had often elicited the warmest encomiums of mynheer vandermaclin and many evenings had andrew m'clise passed with him drinking in moderation their favourite scheedam and indulging in the meditative meerschaum vandermaclin had often wished that he had a son like andrew m'clise to whom he could leave his property with the full assurance that the heap would not be scattered but greatly added to vandermaclin was a widower he had but one daughter who was now just arrived at an age to return from the pension to her father's house and take upon herself the domestic duties m'clise had never yet seen the beautiful katerina and so mynheer m'clise said vandermaclin who was sitting in the warehouse on the ground floor of his tenement you come to purchase the famous bell of utrecht with the intention of fixing it upon that rock the danger of which we have so often talked over after the work of the day has been done i too have suffered from that same rock as you well know but still i have been fortunate the price will be heavy and so it ought to be for the bell itself is of no small weight we are prepared to pay it mynheer vandermaclin nevertheless in so good a cause and for so good a purport you shall not be overcharged i will say nothing of the beauty of the workmanship or even of the mere manufacture you shall pay but its value in metal the same price which the jew isaacs offered me for it but four months ago i will not ask what a jew would ask but what a jew would give which makes no small difference have you ten thousand guilders i have and more that is my price mynheer m'clise and i wish for no more for i too will contribute my share to the good work are you content and is it a bargain it is and the holy abbots will thank you on vellum mynheer vandermaclin for your generosity i prefer the thanks of the bold seamen to those of the idle churchmen but never mind it is a bargain now we will go in it is time to close the doors we will take our pipes and you shall make the acquaintance of my fair daughter katerina at the time we are speaking of m'clise was about six and twenty years of age he was above the middle size elegant in person and with a frankness and almost nobility in his countenance which won all who saw him his manners were like those of most seamen bold but not offensively so his eye was piercing as an eagle's and it seemed as if his very soul spoke from it at the very first meeting between him and the daughter of vandermaclin it appeared to both as if their destinies were to unite them they loved not as others love but with an intensity which it would be impossible to portray but they hardly exchanged a word again and again they met their eyes spoke but nothing more the bell was put on board the vessel the money had been paid down and m'clise could no longer delay he felt as if his heartstrings were severed as he tore himself away from the land where all remained that he coveted upon earth and katerina she too felt as if her existence was a blank and as the vessel sailed from the port she breathed short and when not even her white and lofty top gallant sail could be discovered as a speck she threw herself on her couch and wept and m'clise as he sailed away remained for hours leaning his cheek on his hand thinking of over and over again every lineament and feature of the peerless katerina the months passed away during which m'clise was busied every ebb of the tide in superintending the work on the rock at last all was ready and once more was to be beheld a gay procession but this time it was on the water it was on a calm and lovely summer's morn that the abbots and the monks attended by a large company of the authorities and others who were so much interested in the work in hand started from the shore of aberbrothwick in a long line of boats decorated with sacred and with other various banners and devices the music floated along the water and the solemn chants of the monks were for once heard where never yet they had been heard before or ever will again m'clise was at the rock in a small vessel purposely constructed to carry the bell and with sheers to hang it on the supports imbedded in the solid rock the bell was in its place and the abbot blessed the bell and holy water was sprinkled on the metal which was for the future to be lashed by the waves of the salt sea and the music and the chants were renewed and as they continued the wind gradually rose and with the rising of the wind the bell tolled loud and deep the tolling of the bell was the signal for return for it was a warning that the weather was about to change and the procession pulled back to aberbrothwick and landed in good time for in one hour more and the rocky coast was again lashed by the waves and the bell tolled loud and quick although there were none there but the sea gull who screamed with fright as he wheeled in the air at this unusual noise upon the rock which at the ebb he had so often made his resting place m'clise had done his work the bell was fixed and once more he hastened with his vessel to amsterdam once more was he an inmate of vandermaclin's house once more in the presence of the idol of his soul this time they spoke this time their vows were exchanged for life and death but vandermaclin saw not the state of their hearts he looked upon the young seaman as too low too poor to be a match for his daughter and as such an idea never entered his head so did he never imagine that he would have dared to love but he was soon undeceived for m'clise frankly stated his attachment and demanded the hand of katerina and at the demand vandermaclin's face was flushed with anger mynheer m'clise said he after a pause as if to control his feelings when a man marries he is bound to show that he has wherewithal to support his wife to support her in that rank and to afford her those luxuries to which she has been accustomed in her father's house show me that you can do so and i will not refuse you the hand of katerina as yet i have not replied m'clise but i am young and can work i have money and will gain more tell me what sum do you think that i should possess to warrant my demanding the hand of your daughter produce twelve thousand guilders and she is yours replied the merchant i have but three thousand replied m'clise then think no more of katerina it is a foolish passion and you must forget it and mynheer m'clise i must not have my daughter's affections tampered with she must forget you and that can only be effected by your not meeting again i wish you well mynheer m'clise but i must request your absence m'clise departed from the presence of the merchant bowed down with grief and disappointment he contrived that a letter containing the result of his application should be put in the hands of katerina but vandermaclin was informed of this breach of observance and katerina was sent to a convent there to remain until the departure of her lover and vandermaclin wrote to his correspondent at dundee requesting that the goods forwarded to him might not be sent by the vessel commanded by m'clise of this our young captain received information all hope was nearly gone still he lingered and delayed his departure he was no longer the active energetic seaman he neglected all even his attire m'clise knew in which convent his fair katerina had been immured and often would he walk round its precincts with the hope of seeing her if it were but for a moment but in vain his vessel was now laden and he could delay no longer he was to sail the next morning and once more did the unhappy young man take his usual walk to look at those walls which contained all that was dear to him on earth his reverie was broken by a stone falling down to his feet he took it up there was a small piece of paper attached to it with a silken thread he opened it it was the handwriting of katerina and contained but two words the bell the bell m'clise started for he immediately comprehended what was meant the whole plan came like electricity through his brain yes then there was a promise of happiness the bell was worth ten thousand guilders that sum had been offered and would now be given by isaacs the jew he would be happy with his katerina and he blessed her ingenuity for devising the means for a minute or two he was transported but the re action soon took place what was he about to attempt sacrilege cruelty the bell had been blessed by the holy church it had been purchased by holy and devout alms it had been placed on the rock to save the lives of his brother seamen and were he to remove it would he not be responsible for all the lives lost would not the wail of the widow and the tears of the orphan be crying out to heaven against him no no never the crime was too horrible and m'clise stamped upon the paper thinking he was tempted by satan in the shape of a woman but when woman tempts man is lost he recalled the charms of katerina all his repugnance was overcome and he resolved that the deed should be accomplished and that katerina should be gained even if he lost his soul andrew m'clise sailed away from amsterdam and katerina recovered her liberty vandermaclin was anxious that she should marry and many were the suitors for her hand but in vain she reminded her father that he had pledged himself if m'clise counted down twelve thousand guilders that she should be his wife and to that pledge she insisted that he was bound fast and vandermaclin after reasoning with her and pointing out to her that twelve thousand guilders was a sum so large that m'clise might not procure until his old age even if he were fortunate acknowledged that such was his promise and that he would like an honest man abide by it provided that m'clise should fulfil his part of the agreement in the space of two years after which he should delay her settlement no longer and katerina raised her eyes to heaven and whispered as she clasped her hands the bell alas that we should invoke heaven when we would wish to do wrong but mortals are blind and none so blind as those who are impelled by passion it was in the summer of that year that m'clise had made his arrangements having procured the assistance of some lawless hands he had taken the advantage of a smooth and glassy sea and a high tide to remove the bell on board his own vessel a work of little difficulty to him as he had placed it there and knew well the fastenings he sailed away for amsterdam and was permitted by heaven to arrive safe with his sacrilegious freight he did not as before enter the canal opposite to the house of vandermaclin but one that ran behind the habitation of the jew isaacs at night he went into the house and reported to the jew what he had for sale and the keen grey eyes of the bent double little israelite sparkled with delight for he knew that his profit would be great at midnight the bell was made fast to the crane and safely deposited in the warehouse of the jew who counted out the ten thousand guilders to the enraptured m'clise whose thoughts were wholly upon the possession of his katerina and not upon the crime he had committed but alas to conceal one crime we are too often obliged to be guilty of even deeper and thus it was with andrew m'clise the people who had assisted upon the promise of a thousand guilders being divided among them now murmured at their share and insisted upon an equal division of the spoils or threatened with an immediate confession of the black deed m'clise raved and cursed and tore his hair promised to give them the money as soon as he had wedded katerina but they would not consent again the devil came to his assistance and whispered how he was to act he consented the next night the division was to be made they met in his cabin he gave them wine and they drank plentifully but the wine was poisoned and they all died before the morning m'clise tied weights to their bodies and sunk them in the deep canal broke open his hatches to make it appear that his vessel had been plundered and then went to the authorities denouncing his crew as having plundered him and escaped immediate search was made but they were not to be found and it was supposed that they had escaped in a boat once more m'clise whose conscience was seared went to the house of vandermaclin counted down his twelve thousand guilders and claimed his bride and vandermaclin who felt that his daughter's happiness was at stake now gave his consent as m'clise stated that he was anxious to return to england and arrange with the merchants whose goods had been plundered in a few days the marriage took place and katerina clasped the murderer in her arms all was apparent joy and revelry but there was anguish in the heart of m'clise who now that he had gained his object felt that it had cost him much too dear for his peace of mind was gone for ever but katerina cared not every spark of feeling was absorbed in her passion and the very guilt of m'clise but rendered him more dear for was it not for her that he had done all this m'clise received her portion and hasted to sail away for the bodies were still in the canal and he trembled every hour lest his crime should be discovered and vandermaclin bade farewell to his daughter and he knew not why but there was a feeling he could not suppress that they never should meet again down down below katerina this is no place for you cried mr m'clise as he stood at the helm of the vessel down dearest down or you will be washed overboard every sea threatens to pour into our decks already have we lost two men down katerina down i tell you i fear not let me remain with you i tell you down cried m'clise in wrath and katerina cast upon him a reproachful look and obeyed the storm was at its height the sun had set black and monstrous billows chased each other and the dismasted vessel was hurried on towards the land the wind howled and whistled sharply at each chink in the bulwarks of the vessel for three days had they fought the gale but in vain now if it continued all chance was over for the shore was on their lee distant not many miles nothing could save them but gaining the mouth of the frith of tay and then they could bear up for dundee and there was a boiling surge and a dark night and roaring seas and their masts were floating far away and m'clise stood at the helm keeping her broadside to the sea his heart was full of bitterness and his guilty conscience bore him down and he looked for death and he dreaded it for was he not a sacrilegious murderer and was there not an avenging god above once more katerina appeared on deck clinging for support to andrew i cannot stay below tell me will it soon be over yes replied m'clise gloomily it will soon be over with all of us how mean you you told me there was no danger i told you falsely there is death soon and damnation afterwards for you i have lost my soul oh say not so i say it leave me leave me woman or i curse thee curse me andrew oh no kiss me andrew and if we are to perish let us expire in each other's arms 'tis as well you have dragged me to perdition leave me i say for you have my bitter curse thus was his guilty love turned to hate now that death was staring him in the face katerina made no reply she threw herself on the deck and abandoned herself to her feeling of bitter anguish and as she lay there and m'clise stood at the helm the wind abated the vessel was no longer borne down as before although the waves were still mountains high the seamen on board rallied some fragments of sail were set on the remnants of the masts and there was a chance of safety m'clise spoke not but watched the helm the wind shifted in their favour and hope rose in every heart the frith of tay was now open and they were saved light was the heart of m'clise when he kept away the vessel and gave the helm up to the mate he hastened to katerina who still remained on the deck raised her up whispered comfort and returning love but she heard not she could not forget and she wept bitterly we are saved dear katerina better that we had been lost replied she mournfully no no say not so with your own andrew pressing you to his bosom your bitter curse 'twas madness nothing i knew not what i said but the iron had entered into her soul her heart was broken you had better give orders for them to look out for the bell rock observed the man at the helm to m'clise the bell rock m'clise shuddered and made no reply onward went the vessel impelled by the sea and wind one moment raised aloft and towering over the surge at another deep in the hollow trough and walled in by the convulsed element m'clise still held his katerina in his arms who responded not to his endearments when a sudden shock threw them on the deck the crashing of the timbers the pouring of the waves over the stern the heeling and settling of the vessel were but the work of a few seconds one more furious shock she separates falls on her beam ends and the raging seas sweep over her m'clise threw from him her whom he had so madly loved and plunged into the wave katerina shrieked as she dashed after him and all was over when the storm rises and the screaming sea gull seeks the land and the fisherman hastens his bark towards the beach there is to be seen descending from the dark clouds with the rapidity of lightning the form of andrew m'clise the heavy bell to which he is attached by the neck bearing him down to his doom and when all is smooth and calm when at the ebbing tide the wave but gently kisses the rock then by the light of the silver moon the occupants of the vessels which sail from the firth of tay have often beheld the form of the beautiful katerina waving her white scarf as a signal that they should approach and take her off from the rock on which she is seated at times she offers a letter for her father vandermaclin and she mourns and weeps as the wary mariners with their eyes fixed on her and with folded arms pursue their course in silence and in dread moonshine those who have visited our west india possessions must have often been amused with the humour and cunning which occasionally appear in a negro more endowed than the generality of his race particularly when the master also happens to be a humourist the swarthy servitor seems to reflect his patron's absurdities and having thoroughly studied his character ascertains how far he can venture to take liberties without fear of punishment one of these strange specimens i once met with in a negro called moonshine belonging to a person equally strange in his own way who had for many years held the situation of harbour master at port royal but had then retired on a pension and occupied a small house at ryde in the isle of wight his name was cockle but he had long been addressed as captain cockle and this brevet rank he retained until the day of his death in person he was very large and fat not unlike a cockle in shape so round were his proportions and so unwieldy that it appeared much easier to roll him along from one place to another than that he should walk indeed locomotion was not to his taste he seldom went much farther than round the small patch of garden which was in front of his house and in which he had some pinks and carnations and chrysanthemums of which he was not a little proud his head was quite bald smooth and shining white his face partook of a more roseate tint increasing in depth till it settled into an intense red at the tip of his nose cockle had formerly been a master of a merchant vessel and from his residence in a warm climate had contracted a habit of potation which became confirmed during the long period of his holding his situation at port royal he had purchased moonshine for three hundred dollars when he was about seven years old and upon his return to england had taken him with him moonshine was very much attached to his master very much attached to having his own way and was farther very much attached to his master's grog bottle the first attachment was a virtue the second human nature and the third in the opinion of old cockle a crime of serious magnitude i very often called upon captain cockle for he had a quaint humour about him which amused and as he seldom went out he was always glad to see any of his friends another reason was that i seldom went to the house without finding some entertainment in the continual sparring between the master and the man i was at that time employed in the preventive service and my station was about four miles from the residence of cockle one morning i stalked in and found him as usual in his little parlour on the ground floor well cockle my boy how are you why to tell you the truth bob i'm all wrong i'm on the stool of repentance to wit on this easy chair doing penance as you perceive in a pair of duck trousers last night i was half seas over and tolerably happy this morning i am high and dry and intolerably miserable carried more sail than ballast last night and lost my head this morning i've found it again with a pig of ballast in it i believe all owing to my good nature how is that cockle why that jack piper was here last night and rather than he should drink all the grog and not find his way home i drank some myself he'd been in a bad way if i had not poor fellow and now you see i'm suffering all from good nature easiness of disposition has been my ruin and has rounded me into this ball by wearing away all my sharp edges bob it certainly was very considerate and very kind of you cockle especially when we know how much you must have acted at variance with your inclinations yes bob yes i am the milk punch of human kindness i often cry when the chimney smokes and sometimes when i laugh too much you see i not only give my money as others will do but as last night i even give my head to assist a fellow creature i could however dispense with it for an hour or two this morning nay don't say that for although you might dispense with the upper part you could not well get on without your mouth cockle very true bob a chap without a mouth would be like a ship without a companion hatch talking about that the combings of my mouth are rather dry what do you say bob shall we call moonshine why it's rather broad daylight for moonshine he's but an eclipse a total eclipse i may say the fact is my head is so heavy that it rolls about on my shoulders and i must have a stiffener down my throat to prop it up so moonshine shine out you black faced rascal the negro was outside cleaning his knives he answered but continued at his work how me shine massa cockle when you neber gib me shiner no but i'll give you a shinner on your lower limb that shall make you feel planet struck if you don't show your ugly face replied cockle massa cockle you full of dictionary dis marning come here sir why you so parsonal dis marning sar replied moonshine

heirs when i've nothing to leave continued cockle addressing me hairs are like rats that quit a ship as soon as she gets old now bob i wonder how long that rascal will make us wait i brought him home and gave him his freedom but give an inch and he takes an ell moonshine i begin to feel angry the tip of my nose is red already come directly massa cockle moonshine gave two more rubs on the board and

there's too much of her and in the next there's too much of me i explained this to the old lady as well as i could and she swelled up as big as a balloon saying that when people were really attached they never attached any weight to such trifling obstacles but you must have been sweet upon her cockle nothing more than a little sugar to take the nauseous taste of my long bill out of her mouth as

what bob i am not quite so good at that as i used to be i've an idea that when my pate became bald my memory oozed away by insensible perspiration never mind you must have something left you can't be quite empty no but my tumbler is so i'll just fill that up and then i'll tell you how it was that i came to go to sea the very thing that i should like to hear above all others well then you must know that like cockles in general i was born on the sea shore just a quarter of a mile out of dover towards shakespeare's cliff my father was a fisherman by profession and a smuggler by practice all was fish that came to his net but his cottage was small he was supposed to be very poor and a very bad fisherman for he seldom brought home many but there was a reason for that he very seldom put his nets overboard his chief business lay in taking out of vessels coming down channel goods which were shipped and bonded for exportation and running them on shore again you know bob that there are many articles which are not permitted to enter even upon paying duty and when these goods such as silks c are seized or taken in prizes they are sold for exportation now it was then the custom for vessels to take them on board in the river and run them on shore as they went down channel and the fishing boats were usually employed for this service my father was a well known hand for this kind of work for not being suspected he was always fortunate of course had he once been caught they would have had their eyes upon him after he had suffered his punishment now the way my father used to manage was this there was a long tunnel drain from some houses used as manufactories about a hundred yards above his cottage which extended out into the sea at low water mark and which passed on one side of our cottage my father had cut from a cellar in the cottage into the drain and as it was large enough for a man to kneel down in he used to come in at low water with his coble and make fast the goods properly secured from the wet and dirt in tarpaulin bags to a rope which led from the cellar to the sea through the drain when the water had flowed sufficiently to cover the mouth of the drain he then threw the bags overboard and securing the boat went to the cottage hauled up the articles and secured them too d'ye understand my father had no one to assist him but my brother who was a stout fellow seven years older than myself and my mother who used to give a helping hand when required and thus did he keep his own counsel and grow rich when all was right he got his boat over into the harbour and having secured her he came home as innocent as a lamb i was then about eight or nine years old and went with my father and brother in the coble for she required three hands at least to manage her properly and like a tin pot although not very big i was very useful now it so happened that my father had notice that a brig lying in dover harbour would sail the next day and that she had on board of her a quantity of lace and silks purchased at the dover custom house for exportation which he was to put on shore again to be sent up to london the sending up to london we had nothing to do with the agent at dover managed all that we only left the articles at his house and then received the money on the nail we went to the harbour where we found the brig hauling out so we made all haste to get away before her it blew fresh from the northward and eastward and there was a good deal of sea running as we were shoving out the london agent a jolly little round faced fellow in black clothes and a bald white head called to us and said that he wanted to board a vessel in the offing and asked whether we would take him this was all a ruse as he intended to go on board of the brig with us to settle matters and then return in the pilot boat well we hoisted our jib drew aft our foresheet and were soon clear of the harbour but we found that there was a devil of a sea running and more wind than we bargained for the brig came out of the harbour with a flowing sheet and we lowered down the foresail to reef it father and brother busy about that while i stood at the helm when the agent said to me 'when do you mean to make a voyage' 'sooner than father thinks for' said i 'for i want to see the world' it was sooner than i thought for too as you shall hear as soon as the brig was well out we ran down to her and with some difficulty my father and the agent got on board for the sea was high and cross the tide setting against the wind my brother and i were left in the boat to follow in the wake of the brig but as my brother was casting off the rope forward his leg caught in the bight and into the sea he went however they hauled him on board leaving me alone in the coble it was not of much consequence as i could manage to follow before the wind under easy sail without assistance so i kept her in the wake of the brig both of us running nearly before it at the rate of five miles an hour waiting till my father should have made up his packages of a proper size to walk through the tunnel drain the channel was full of ships for the westerly winds had detained them for a long time i had followed the brig about an hour when the agent went on shore in a pilot boat and i expected my father would soon be ready then the wind veered more towards the southward with dirt at last it came on foggy and i could hardly see the brig and as it rained hard and blew harder i wished that my father was ready for my arms ached with steering the coble for so long a while i could not leave the helm so i steered on at a black lump as the brig looked through the fog at last the fog was so thick that i could not see a yard beyond the boat and i hardly knew how to steer i began to be frightened tired and cold and hungry i certainly was well i steered on for more than an hour when the fog cleared up a little and then i saw the stern of the brig just before me my little heart jumped with delight and i expected that she would round to immediately and that my father would praise me for my conduct and what was still more to the purpose that i should get something to eat and drink but no she steered on right down channel and i followed for more than an hour more when it came on to blow very hard and i could scarcely manage the boat she pulled my little arms off and i was quite exhausted the weather now cleared up and i could make out the vessel plainly and i immediately discovered that it was not the brig but a bark which i had got hold of in the fog so that i did not know what to do but i did as most boys of nine years old would have done who were frightened i sat down and cried still however keeping the tiller in my hand and steering as well as i could at last i could hold it no longer i ran forward let go the fore and jib haulyards and hauled down the sails drag them into the boat i could not and there i was like a young bear adrift in a washing tub i looked all round me and there were no vessels near the bark had left me two miles astern it was blowing a gale from the se with a heavy sea the gulls and sea birds wheeled and screamed in the storm and as i thought when they came close to me looked at me with their keen eyes as much as to say 'what the devil are you doing there' the boat was as light as a cork and although she was tossed and rolled about so that i was obliged to hold on she shipped no water of any consequence for the jib in the water forward had brought her head to wind and acted as a sort of floating anchor at last there was nothing in sight so i laid down at the bottom of the boat and fell asleep it was daylight before i awoke and then i got up and looked round me it blew harder than ever and although there were some vessels at a distance scudding before the gale they did not mind or perhaps see me i sat very melancholy the whole day the tears ran down my cheeks my eyes were full of salt from the spray i saw at last nothing but the roaring and trembling waves i prayed every prayer i knew that is i said the lord's prayer the belief and as much of the catechism as i could recollect it rained in torrents i was wet starving and miserably cold at night i again fell asleep from exhaustion the morning broke again and the sun shone the gale was breaking off and i felt more cheered but i was now ravenous from hunger as well as choking from thirst and i was so weak that i could scarcely stand i looked round me every now and then and lay down again in the afternoon i saw a large vessel standing right for me this gave me courage and strength i stood up and waved my hat and they saw me the sea was still running very high but the wind had gone down she rounded to so as to bring me under her lee send a boat she could not but the sea bore her down upon me and i was soon close to her men in the chains were ready with ropes and i knew that this was my only chance at last a very heavy sea bore her right down upon the boat lurching over on her beam ends her main chains struck the boat and sent her down while i was seized by the scuff of the neck by two of the seamen and borne aloft by them as the vessel returned to the weather roll they hauled me in and i was safe it was neck or nothing with me then wasn't it bob it was indeed a miraculous escape cockle well as soon as they had given me something to eat i told my story and it appeared that she was an east indiaman running down channel and not likely to meet with anything to send me back again the passengers especially the ladies were very kind to me and as there was no help for it why i took my first voyage to the east indies and your father and your brother why when i met them which i did about six years afterwards i found that they had been in much the same predicament having lost the coble and the weather being so bad that they could not get on shore again as there was no help for it they took their first voyage to the west indies so there was a dispersion of a united family two went west one went east coble went down and mother after waiting a month or two and supposing father dead went off with a soldier all dispersed by one confounded gale of wind from the northward and eastward so that's the way that i went to sea bob and now it's time that moonshine was back but moonshine kept us waiting for some time when he returned it was then quite dark and we had lighted candles anxiously waiting for him for not only was the bottle empty but we were very hungry at last we heard a conversation at the gate and moonshine made his appearance with the two bottles of spirits and appeared himself to be also in high spirits the pork and peas pudding soon were on the table we dined heartily and were sitting over the latter part of the first bottle in conversation it being near upon the eleventh hour when we heard a noise at the gate observed some figures of men who stayed a short time and then disappeared the door opened and moonshine went out in a few seconds he returned bringing in his arms an anker of spirits which he laid on the floor grinning so wide that his head appeared half off without saying a word he left the room and returned with another why what the devil's this cried cockle moonshine made no answer but went out and in until he had brought six ankers in one after another which he placed in a row on the floor he then shut the outside door bolted it came in and seating himself on one of the tubs laughed to an excess which compelled him to hold his sides during which cockle and i were in a state of astonishment and suspense where the devil did all this come from cried cockle actually getting out of his easy chair tell me sir or by i tell you all massa cockle you find me better friend dan missy o'bottom now you ab plenty and nebber need scold moonshine 'pose he take lilly drap i get all dis present to you massa cockle i felt a great degree of anxiety and pressed moonshine to tell his story i tell you all sar when i come back wid de two bottel i meet plenty men wid de tubs dey say 'hollo there who be you' i say 'i come from station bring massa two bottel and i show um' den dey say 'where you massa' and i say 'at um house at ryde' den dey tink dat you my massa massa farren so dey say 'yes we know dat we watch him dere but now you tell so we beat you dead' den i say 'what for dat massa like drink why you no gib massa some tub and den he never say noting only make fuss some time 'cause of admirality' den dey say 'you sure of dat' and i say 'quite sure massa nebber say one word' den dey talk long while last dey come and say 'you come wid us and show massa house' so two men come wid me and when dey come to gate i say 'dis massa house when he live at ryde and dere you see massa' and i point to massa cockle but dey see massa farren so dey say 'all very good tree four hour more you find six tub here tell you massa dat every time run tub he alway hab six' den dey go way den dey come back leave tub dat all massa you rascal exclaimed i rising up so you have compromised me why i shall lose my commission if found out no sar nobody wrong but de smuggler dey make a lilly mistake case you brought to court martial i gib evidence and den i clear you but what must we do with these tubs cockle said i appealing to him do bob why they are a present a very welcome one and a very handsome one into the bargain i shall not keep them i pledge you my word let that satisfy you they shall all be fairly entered upon that condition cockle i replied i shall of course not give information against you i knew full well what he meant by saying he would not keep them how i do massa cockle said moonshine with a grave face i take um to the custom house to night or to morrow marning to morrow moonshine replied cockle at present just put them out of sight i did not think it prudent to make any further inquiries but i afterwards discovered that the smugglers true to their word and still in error continued to leave six tubs in old cockle's garden whenever they succeeded in running a cargo which notwithstanding all our endeavours they constantly did one piece of information i gained from this affair which was the numbers of cargoes which were run compared to those which were seized during the remainder of the time i was on that station and found it to be in the proportion of ten to one the cargoes run were calculated by the observations of old cockle who when i called upon him used to say very quietly i shouldn't wonder if they did not run a cargo last night bob in spite of all your vigilance was it very dark on the contrary replied i looking at the demure face of the negro i suspect it was moonshine the fairy's wand a tale of windsor park in the days of the merry monarch in the time of charles ii windsor park stood just where it stands now and the castle of windsor was very often the abode of royalty as it is now but in those merry but licentious times there was much more fun and feasting going on than perhaps there is at present rochester was master of the revels and the countesses of but i will say nothing about the ladies although some of the highest of our aristocracy are descended from them there were great preparations in the castle for king charles had invited down the mayor of london and a bevy of aldermen not so much with a view of doing honour to the magistrates of the great and ancient city as with the hope to extract some amusement from their peculiarities the fact is that the mayor and aldermen of london had certified to the earl of rochester that they had some complaint to make and some favour to request of his majesty rochester ever willing to procure amusement for his royal master at the same time was equally careful not to allow him to be annoyed and therefore had contrived to ferret out that the complaint against the lords of the court was for their foo great familiarity with the citizens' wives and that the favour to be demanded was a curtailment of the dress ornaments and expensive habits of the city ladies he considered this a very favourable opportunity for procuring some mirth at the expense of the corporation with the consent of the king he had intimated to the mayor and aldermen that they would be received in the evening and honoured with a seat at the royal banquet and at the same time he had privately made known to the lady mayoress what were the demands about to be made by her husband desiring her to communicate the same under a strict promise of secrecy to the wives of all the aldermen and also acquainting them that his majesty would be glad to receive the ladies on the same evening provided that they could come without the knowledge of their husbands which might be done by their setting off for windsor some short time after them it was the intention of the king that when the mayor and corporation should present the address they should be met face to face by their wives and thus issue be joined but mortals were not the only parties who revelled in the beauties of the park of windsor on the evening that this comedy was about to be enacted there reclined under the celebrated oak known as herne's oak in a small clear space between some ferns two of those beings called fairies who had for time immemorial taken up their quarters in that delightful retreat whether they were man and wife is not established but certainly they were male and female and as they appeared to be on the very best understanding it is to be presumed that they were not married elda there will be a scene to night at the castle said the male to the female sprite as he tickled her nose with a blade of grass yes maya how foolish those mortals are i have a mind to create even more mischief rejoined maya but if i did you would want to see it well and suppose i did dearest i do not like that you should be in company with those women elda those duchesses and countesses bless me maya what are you afraid of my virtue oh no dearest i did not mean that then i'll tell you what you did mean you jealous pated fool you meant that you did not like that i should be in the company of the earl of rochester and the king you ought to have more respect for yourself and more respect for me than to be jealous of those mortals nay elda yes yes and your reason for wanting to go alone is to hang over that nasty duchess of portsmouth upon my honour your honour sir you have none there sir you may go oh very well madam just as you please certainly there was something very mortal in this quarrel and may remind the reader of similar scenes in domestic life it ended by maya walking sulkily away in the direction of the castle and of elda following him at a distance determined to watch his motions but if these two lovers had quarrelled there were two other beings who were indulging in a moonlight walk on the terrace linked arm in arm so affectionately so fondly keeping exact pace for pace and occasionally embracing each other every one would have thought that nothing in the world could ever have disunited them they were two young ladies of the court aged about seventeen just clear of their governess and bread and butter and newly appointed maids of honour they were both beautiful and had contracted a friendship as all girls do at that age when love has with them no precise definition they had sworn eternal affection after an acquaintance of eight and forty hours the sun and the moon and all the stars in the firmament heaven above the earth below and everything below that again had all been summoned to register their vows and at the time that they were then walking they would have considered it positive heresy to hint at the idea of a disagreement even in thought but as i have before observed they were only seventeen years old maya who had bent his steps towards the castle perceived these two young damsels parading up and down and although he had not the full power of oberon yet he was still a highly endowed fairy among other powers vested in him he had a wand which when it touched any fairy would change that fairy into mortal size and shape and if it touched any mortal would produce the contrary effect giving them for the time the size and appearance of fairies imps tritons naiads or some of those intermediate creatures which most accorded with their mortal propensities and dispositions this very wand made him much feared by the other fairies as they were often punished by him in this way and it was only oberon the king who had the power of reversing the charm and it is said that this very wand was one cause why his fair elda generally speaking behaved so well as he often threatened to turn her into a dutch milkmaid which as she was of a very beautiful figure would have been a very severe punishment it was with this wand worn like a harlequin's at his side that the fairy maya was walking up the terrace he had changed himself to a handsome young forester dressed in a suit of green with bugle by his side a cap with black feathers hanging down to his right shoulder wearing the appearance of a very handsome young man of about twenty and just the description of person to create a difference between two young ladies who had half an hour before sworn everlasting friendship as he passed he made a very profound obeisance who is he dearest said miss araminta who is he dearest said miss euthanasia both nudging one another at the same moment he bowed to me said araminta no sweetest it was to me he bowed rejoined euthanasia well i declare cried araminta what was to follow is not known for the young forester had retraced his steps and now addressed the young ladies fair maids of honour as i presume you are such said he taking off his cap and displaying such handsome curls that each young lady for the first time thought how much better it had been if she had walked out alone may i inquire the cause of such revelry to night in the royal castle the king entertains said araminta the mayor and aldermen cried euthanasia taking the remainder of the sentence out of her friend's mouth indeed replied the fairy who then entered into conversation with the young ladies dividing his attentions as equally as he could now it so happened that elda who had followed maya at a distance could no longer restrain her jealousy when she perceived him walking and talking so earnestly and as she considered really making love to these fair mortals she took the shape of a big bumble bee and flying to him settled on his back stinging him so severely that he uttered an exclamation of pain and the young ladies were tenderly enquiring where he was hurt when he felt convinced that it was elda who had thus punished him fairies have consciences as well as mortals maya felt that he was or what was quite as bad that he appeared to be guilty he had already repented of his quarrel with elda and after receiving the condolence of the two young ladies who vied in their attentions to him he very suddenly took leave resolving in his own mind that he would seek out elda and make friends with her infinitely preferring her to two young bread and butter maids of honour thus did the fairy prove his good sense and abandon all idea of making mischief at the castle now it so happened that the sting received from the jealous elda was so very severe that in his jump forward maya had allowed his wand to drop out of his belt and when he departed he did not perceive his loss there it lay on the terrace between the two young maids of honour who already had discovered that their eternal friendship was on the wane they both remained silent and watching the receding figure of the handsome young forester for at least a minute and a half at last this unheard of duration of silence between two young ladies who had sworn eternal friendship was broken it proved to be like the calm which precedes the tornado well i am sure cried euthanasia i shouldn't wonder replied araminta courtly manners indeed continued euthanasia yes you may say that no wonder he wouldn't stay responded araminta tossing her head no when you drove him away miss me miss yes you miss no miss yes miss i regret to report the scene which followed after trying hard to drown each other's voices the two young maids of honour who had sworn eternal friendship commenced pushing then spitting then slapping then beating then they pulled each other's hair then yes then araminta perceived the wand lying on the terrace and she seized it with the intention of chastising euthanasia and euthanasia perceiving her intention seized hold of the other end of the wand a struggle took place which ended in the wand breaking in half then they separated araminta throwing her half at her dearest friend her dearest friend returning the compliment after which they both ran home to the castle vowing that nothing should ever induce them even to speak one single word to each other as long as they lived we must leave them to go to their rooms wash their pretty faces and repair the damage done to their dresses while we inform the reader of what is going on in the reception room of the castle the mayor and corporation had duly arrived and had been ushered into a private room until his majesty should be ready to receive them the earl of rochester had detained them there purposely to give time for the arrival of the ladies of the corporation who were by his directions received at a private door the king amused with the scheme allowed rochester to make his arrangements when all was ready the mayor and aldermen who had been very comfortably regaled with sherry and biscuits so that the time did not appear too tedious were requested to enter the presence chamber where the king received them in due form the mayor approaching the throne knelt down and laid at his majesty's feet the petition which he was requested by the king to read the preamble set forth that the young nobility of the day were not content with the pleasures of the court but were in the custom of entering the city on the other side of temple bar creating disturbances and visiting the wives of his majesty's dutiful citizens giving much cause for scandal and requesting that in future his majesty would be pleased to give directions that the nobility should not enter the city without the permission of the corporation as such would prove most advantageous to the morals of the community hah observed his majesty how is this my lord of rochester do our young gallants create disturbances with our good citizens this must be looked to may it please your majesty replied the earl of rochester assertion is not proof here are now twenty five of the wealthiest citizens of london present and on their knees before you they have twenty five wives is there any one who will accuse his wife or his neighbour's wife of listening to the nonsense of these young nobles either they must listen to them or if they do not listen to them there is no harm done very true replied the king say mr mayor where are your proofs of what you have now asserted may it please your majesty women are women replied the mayor i believe we may admit that your majesty rejoined rochester with a smile yes in that point i agree with mr mayor go on what further does this petition contain a request that your majesty will pass some law by which our city dames may be prevented from vying in expense with those of the court to forbid stuffs of gold or genoa velvet to be worn by them and all ornaments of too high price which are not suitable to our condition as simple artisans and very ruinous to our pockets may it please your majesty as any man can legislate for his own household i think this last clause quite unnecessary if the good citizens of london cannot afford to pay for such finery they must prevent their wives from purchasing it that is very true observed his majesty you must prevent it yourselves may it please your majesty we cannot exclaimed the whole deputation with one voice well this is a very serious affair replied the king and it must be laid before a special privy council are you prepared to prove before the council when you are called on that your wives have been guilty of listening to these young gallants have received them and admitted their familiarities say mr mayor and gentlemen are you prepared to prove this all are prepared and ready to swear to it replied the deputation well then mr mayor you will have the goodness to retire for a short time while i consult with my council which i shall immediately summon and if the facts are as you say and you prove them your petition shall be attended to the mayor and aldermen delighted at this gracious reply rose and humbly backed out of the presence chamber as soon as they had retired the lady mayoress and all the aldermen's wives were ushered in requested by his majesty to be seated on chairs ranged round the throne and thus was formed king charles' special council rochester read the petition in a merry way and then his majesty requested the lady mayoress as first in rank to give her opinion may it please your majesty said the mayoress it is very true that many of the young nobility do come within the city walls and prove good customers to our husbands as for disturbances i never heard of any for our husbands are peaceable men and as for their paying attention to the ladies it is in my opinion only paying a compliment to our husbands as well as to ourselves very well argued replied the king your opinion madam on this first point continued the king addressing himself to one of the aldermen's ladies pray does your majesty think it fair replied the lady who was very pretty that our husbands are to leave us all day long to add to their heaps of money which they care for more than they do for us and that we are not to amuse ourselves in some way besides it can't be wrong for the king sets the example and the king can do no wrong may it please your majesty that last argument settles the point observed rochester and i believe i may say that the whole council are of the same opinion the ladies bowed their heads in acquiescence and now as to the other request contained in this petition that the ladies shall not in future dress in gold stuff genoa velvet and rich ornaments what say you ladies may it please your majesty observed an alderman's wife who had been married a week aware of what was to come we have already discussed the point between ourselves it is admitted that our husbands leave us alone and that we are justified in receiving the attentions of the young nobles who so honour us now if our husbands stayed with us and kept us company we would dress to please them but as they do not and we are indebted to others for society why we must dress accordingly courtiers require the splendour of the court and it is our duty to study to please them and our husbands' duty to accede to it as a return for the compliments paid to us this is remarkably good logic sire observed rochester i doubt whether you ever summoned a more wise council a more delightful one never replied the king bowing to the ladies now we will if you please summon in the lord mayor and deputation and if they are willing as they say they are to prove yes if rejoined the lady mayoress and all the other ladies replied yes if in a few minutes the deputation made its appearance the mayor and his colleagues entered the room with joyful anticipations and fully prepared to prove all that their petition asserted but what was their dismay when they all beheld their own wives dressed in stuffs of gold and genoa velvet arranged in a circle round the throne their eyes flashing fire and their fans moving with a rapidity that was ever the precursor of a storm each dame had singled out her husband fixed her eyes upon him and every lord and master had quailed at their lightning flashes they tottered rather than walked up to the throne and when they again went down upon their knees each one involuntarily turned round to the direction where his own wife was seated as if to deprecate her wrath and implore her pardon the king bit his lips to control his laughter rochester stuffed his handkerchief into his mouth mr mayor and gentlemen said the king after he had somewhat recovered himself i have as you perceive summoned a special council to consult on this case and it has been the decision of the council that you should now produce these proofs which you but just now stated you were prepared and willing to do mr mayor you may proceed we are all attention may it please your ladyship stammered the mayor it does not please her ladyship replied the lady mayoress fanning herself furiously i meant his majesty i would have said i have no proofs myself to bring forward but my colleagues are i believe well prepared indeed mr mayor is it possible that i mistook you you have no proofs well then who are the other gentlemen who are to bring forward the proofs the deputation answered not my lord of rochester oblige me by putting the question separately to each of these gentlemen the question was put but not one of the deputation had a proof to bring forward by the mass but this is strange said the king but an hour ago they all had proofs and now they have not one this is trifling with us mr mayor an insult to the throne and council speak sir what means this may it please your majesty it means that we beg pardon of your majesty and of the special council and your petition is withdrawn if it so please your majesty said the mayor looking round to the aldermen yes your majesty is withdrawn for myself mr mayor i accept your excuses and you have my pardon but as for the special council i must leave you to settle with it how you can ladies a banquet is prepared when summoned it will depend upon yourselves whether you come alone or attended by the mayor and deputation come my lord of rochester we will not interfere in the arrangements which will take place better when we are out of the way so saying the king quitted the presence chamber with the earl of rochester leaving the ladies seated and their husbands still kneeling we shall not dwell upon what took place after the departure of the king one thing is certain that the fair sex are very merciful and as their husbands promised them that in future they should have their own way dress as they pleased receive whom they pleased and spend what money they pleased the ladies very kindly and magnanimously forgave their spouses and when they were summoned to the banquet each lady entered the hall hanging on the arm of her husband this happy reconciliation was duly celebrated wine flowed bumper after bumper was drank pledge succeeded to pledge and it was long past midnight before the carouse was over the moon shone bright and heated with the wine rochester proposed to the ladies that they should take a walk on the terrace before they ordered their carriages to go home it must be confessed that the ladies had not been so cautious as they ought to have been and that their steps were not very steady but could a lady refuse to drink wine with a king or an earl of rochester no and the consequence was that they all were merry and some of them more than merry as for the husbands they were reeling and tumbling in all directions and the terrace wall wide as it was was not sufficiently wide for them rochester led the way and all was fun and merry laughter the party had not proceeded far when a little altercation took place between the mayoress and the alderman's wife who had given her opinion after her in the council for it so happened that as they sauntered along the mayoress had picked up one portion of the broken wand and the alderman's lady the other the wand was of ebony and highly polished each would possess herself of the half in the hands of the other and thus commenced the dispute and it ended as all disputes between ladies will end if they happen to have a stick in their hands when they quarrel by their beating each other the mayoress gave the alderman's wife a slap with her part of the wand it was immediately returned when lo and behold it must be here explained that although the wand when entire had the power of changing people as we have described yet when broken its power was divided between the two parts the one end retaining its half power of changing only the upper portion of the figure while the other could only change the lower half the blows were exchanged the mayoress who was a tall woman immediately sank down a foot and a half the upper portion of her plump body was now resting upon the two diminutive legs of a two feet high fairy which could only make a stride of six inches at a time the alderman's lady on the contrary retained her lower portion of her body but instead of her lovely face and graceful neck she carried a little round head and shoulders such as is represented in the figure of puck they must all have been very tipsy for the others thought that they had put on masquerade dresses the sticks were seized one by rochester the other by the king and they struck right and left the lord mayor had the head and beard of a satyr rochester had the feet of a goat the king appeared to have the bust of a beautiful woman with a pair of splendid blue gossamer wings to his shoulders one of the aldermen found himself with a naiad's tail and he fell flat on the terrace with great violence all of them men and women were transformed into some shape or another and the more strange the metamorphosis the louder they all laughed and shouted some indeed were very much alarmed particularly one little woman who whispered to her neighbour that she believed she was a little man but the scene did not end here the two parts of the wand found their way into other hands who as they capered and jumped beat their companions king charles struck by the lower part of the wand found his transformation complete he was now a lovely woman rochester was turned by a blow into a perfect satyr while the mayoress struck by the same portion sank down into a little fairy not two feet high as the sticks were passed round there was no end to the transformations the fat alderman who had fallen down with a fish's tail now became a perfect naiad with long hair and a comb in his hand such was the noise and confusion that the two little maids of honour came out on the terrace to witness this strange revelling rochester seized them and kissed them as they screamed with fright at his shaggy beard the wand was applied to them and they too were transformed the duchess of portsmouth opened her chamber window and perceiving the wild revelling resolved to indulge his majesty with a good curtain lecture but he heard her not to the oak of herne the hunter cried the king away to the oak to the oak to the oak shouted the whole bacchanalian crew and away they flew across the park starting the quiescent deer with their shouts their laughter and their revelry rochester took the naiad under his arm that she might not be left behind and dancing capering tumbling and getting up again led by the merry king who now was a beautiful fairy they arrived there out of breath but before they had reached the oak their noise had disturbed the slumber of one happy pair who had nestled in each other's arms among the fern it was maya and elda who had met and had been reconciled proving that with fairies the quarrels of lovers are but the renewal of love not the case although supposed to be so with us mortals maya had missed his wand but he would not leave elda to return for it he intended to have searched for it the next morning what is all that noise dearest cried elda waking up and resting on her elbow as she listened what can it be but the mad king at his pranks as usual replied maya who had risen on his feet but what is here i see i see how it is they have found my wand and must have broken it for it does not otherwise do things by halves as maya said this the king with his companions arrived under the oak tree elda retired to a distance while maya soon regained the two parts of his wand from the hands of the intoxicated parties who had possession of them i shall have work to night and must repair this mischief said maya elda dearest hasten and bring me poppy juice to seal up the eyes of these mad people in a few minutes elda had executed her commission the whole company were now seated in a circle singing songs hugging one another all merry but the two little maids of honour who not having taken wine were horrified at the transformation they sat together and cried as if their little hearts would break maya pressed the poppy juice on the eyes of each individual and in a few seconds they were all in a profound sleep he then examined the transformations and completed those which were partial above or below till then he could not repair his wand when they were all transformed he put the two parts of his wand together breathed upon them and the wand was reunited he then went round the circle touched each person and the whole company resumed their original forms so far have i done my part observed maya as for colds catarrhs fevers agues they deserve all they may catch now elda let us once more retire to rest the leaves of the old oak tree were gilded with the rays of the morning sun before king charles and his companions awoke and very much astonished they were to find themselves in such a place and at such an hour the ladies blushed and canvassed the affair among themselves they recollected the transformations they remembered their setting off for the hunter's oak but still they were confused the mayor and aldermen were puzzled not so much at finding themselves asleep under the tree but that their wives should be there also the king and rochester were the only two who appeared indifferent come ladies come my lord mayor and gentlemen of the corporation we have had a merry night of it and have slept under the greenwood tree now let us in to the toilet and then to breakfast he offered his arm to the lady mayoress the rest of the company followed they hastened to the toilet they ate their breakfasts and then hastened back to the good city of london well said the king as soon as the company had departed what think you of this rochester were we visited by the fairies last night think you may it please your majesty replied the earl my opinion is that either we were in the hands of the fairies or else else what or else sire we were all most confoundedly drunk a rencontre one evening i was sitting alone in the salle a manger of the couronne d'or at boulogne when colonel g an old acquaintance came in after the first greeting he took a chair and was soon as busily occupied as i was with a cigar which was occasionally removed from our lips as we asked and replied to questions as to what had been our pursuits subsequent to our last rencontre after about half an hour's chit chat he observed as he lighted a fresh cigar when i was last in this room i was in company with a very strange personage male or female inquired i female replied colonel g altogether it's a story worth telling and as it will pass away the time i will relate it you unless you wish to retire as i satisfied him that i was not anxious to go to bed and very anxious to hear his story he narrated it as near as i can recollect in the following words i had taken my place in the diligence from paris and when i arrived at notre dame des victoires it was all ready for a start the luggage piled up as high as an english haystack had been covered over and buckled down and the conducteur was calling out for the passengers i took my last hasty whiff of my cigar and unwillingly threw away more than half of a really good havannah for i perceived that in the interieur for which i had booked myself there was one female already seated and women and cigars are such great luxuries in their respective ways that they are not to be indulged in at one and the same time the world would be too happy and happiness we are told is not for us here below not that i agree with that moral although it comes from very high authority there is a great deal of happiness in this world if you knew how to extract it or rather i should say of pleasure there is a pleasure in doing good there is a pleasure unfortunately in doing wrong there is a pleasure in looking forward ay and in looking backward also there is pleasure in loving and being loved in eating in drinking and though last not least in smoking i do not mean to say that there are not the drawbacks of pain regret and even remorse but there is a sort of pleasure even in them it is pleasant to repent because you know that you are doing your duty and if there is no great pleasure in pain it precedes an excess when it has left you i say again that if you know how to extract it there is a great deal of pleasure and of happiness in this world especially if you have as i have a very bad memory 'allons messieurs' said the conducteur and when i got in i found myself the sixth person and opposite to the lady for all the other passengers were of my own sex having fixed our hats up to the roof wriggled and twisted a little so as to get rid of coat tails etc all of which was effected previous to our having cleared rue notre dame des victoires we began to scrutinise each other our female companion's veil was down and doubled so that i could not well make her out my other four companions were young men all frenchmen apparently good tempered and inclined to be agreeable a few seconds were sufficient for my reconnoitre of the gentlemen and then my eyes were naturally turned towards the lady she was muffled up in a winter cloak so that her figure was not to be made out and the veil still fell down before her face so that only one cheek and a portion of her chin could be deciphered that fragment of her physiognomy was very pretty and i watched in silence for the removal of the veil i have omitted to state that before i got into the diligence i saw her take a very tender adieu of a very handsome woman but as her back was turned to me at the time i did not see her face she had now fallen back in her seat and seemed disposed to commune with her own thoughts that did not suit my views which were to have a view of her face real politeness would have induced me to have left her to herself but pretended politeness was resorted to that i might gratify my curiosity so i inquired if she wished the window up the answer was in the negative and in a very sweet voice and then there was a pause of course so i tried again 'you are melancholy at parting with your handsome sister' observed i leaning forward with as much appearance of interest as i could put into my beautiful phiz 'how could you have presumed that she was my sister' replied she 'from the strong family likeness' rejoined i 'i felt certain of it' 'but she is only my sister in law sir my brother's wife' 'then i presume he chose a wife as like his sister as he could find nothing more natural i should have done the same' 'sir you are very polite' replied the lady who lowered down the window adding 'i like fresh air' 'perhaps you will find yourself less incommoded if you take off your veil' 'i will not ascribe that proposition to curiosity on your part sir' replied the lady 'as you have already seen my face' 'you cannot then be surprised at my wishing to see it once more' 'you are very polite sir' although her voice was soft there was a certain quickness and decision in her manner and language which were very remarkable the other passengers now addressed her and the conversation became general the veiled lady took her share in it and showed a great deal of smartness and repartee in an hour more we were all very intimate as we changed horses i took down my hat to put into it my cigar case which i had left in my pocket upon which the lady observed 'you smoke i perceive and so i dare say do all the rest of the gentlemen now do not mind me i am fond of the smell of tobacco i am used to it' we hesitated 'nay more i smoke myself and will take a cigar with you' this was decisive i offered my cigar case another gentleman struck a light lifting up her veil so as to show a very pretty mouth with teeth as white as snow she put the cigar in her mouth and set us the example in a minute both windows were down and every one had a cigar in his mouth 'where did you learn to smoke madam' was a question put to the incognita by the passenger who sat next to her 'where in the camp africa everywhere i did belong to the army that is my husband was one of the captains of the th he was killed poor man in the last successful expedition to constantine c'etait un brave homme' 'indeed were you at constantine' 'yes i was i followed the army during the whole campaign' the diligence stopped for supper or dinner whichever it might be considered and the conducteur threw open the doors 'now' thought i 'we shall see her face' and so i believe thought the other passengers but we were mistaken the lady went upstairs and had a basin of soup taken to her when all was ready we found her in the diligence with her veil down as before this was very provoking for she was so lively and witty in conversation and the features of her face which had been disclosed were so perfect that i was really quite on a fret that she would leave me without satisfying my curiosity they talk of woman's curiosity but we men have as much after all it became dark the lady evidently avoided further conversation and we all composed ourselves as well as we could it may be as well to state in few words that the next morning she was as cautious and reserved as ever the diligence arrived at this hotel the passengers separated and i found that the lady and i were the only two who took up our quarters there at all events the frenchmen who travelled with us went away just as wise as they came 'you remain here' inquired i as soon as we had got out of the diligence 'yes' replied she 'and you ' 'i remain here certainly but i hope you do not intend to remain always veiled it is too cruel of you' 'i must go to my room now and make myself a little more comfortable after that mons l'anglais i will speak to you you are going over in the packet i presume' 'i am by to morrow's packet' 'i shall put myself under your protection for i am also going to london' 'i shall be most delighted' 'au revoir' about an hour afterwards a message was brought to me by the garcon that the lady would be happy to receive me in no i ascended to the second floor knocked and was told to come in she was now without a veil and what do you think was her reason for the concealment of her person by the beard of mokhanna how can i tell well then she had two of the most beautiful eyes in the world her eyebrows were finely arched her forehead was splendid her mouth was tempting in short she was as pretty as you could wish a woman to be only she had broken her nose a thousand pities for it must once have been a very handsome one well to continue i made my bow 'you perceive now sir' said she 'why i wore my veil down' 'no indeed' replied i 'you are very polite or very blind' rejoined she 'the latter i believe not to be the fact i did not choose to submit to the impertinence of my own countrymen in the diligence they would have asked me a hundred questions upon my accident but you are an englishman and have respect for a female who has been unfortunate' 'i trust i deserve your good opinion madam and if i can be in any way useful to you ' 'you can i shall be a stranger in england i know that in london there is a great man one monsieur lis tong who is very clever' 'very true madam if your nose instead of having been slightly injured as it is had been left behind you in africa mr liston would have found you another' 'if he will only repair the old one i ask no more you give me hopes but the bones are crushed completely as you must see' 'that is of no consequence mr liston has put a new eye in to my knowledge the party was short sighted and saw better with the one put in by mr liston than with the one which had been left him' 'est il possible mais quel homme extraordinaire perhaps you will do me the favour to sit with me monsieur and if i mistake not you have a request to make of me n'est ce pas' 'i feel such interest about you madam that i acknowledge if it would not be too painful to you i should like to ask a question' 'which is how did i break my nose of course you want to know and as it is the only return i can make for past or future obligations to you you shall most certainly be gratified i will not detain you now i shall expect you to supper adieu monsieur' i did not of course fail in my appointment and after supper she commenced 'the question to be answered' said she 'is how did you break your nose is it not well then at least i shall answer it after my own fashion so to begin at the beginning i am now just twenty two years old my father was tambour major in the garde imperiale i was born in the camp brought up in the camp and finally i was married in the camp to a lieutenant of infantry at the time so that you observe i am altogether militaire as a child i was wakened up with the drum and fife and went to sleep with the bugles as a girl i became quite conversant with every military manoeuvre and now that i am a woman grown i believe that i am more fit for the baton than one half of those marshals who have gained it i have studied little else but tactics and have as my poor husband said quite a genius for them but of that hereafter i was married at sixteen and have ever since followed my husband i followed him at last to his grave he quitted my bed for the bed of honour where he sleeps in peace we'll drink to his memory' we emptied our glasses when she continued 'my husband's regiment was not ordered to africa until after the first disastrous attempt upon constantine it fell to our lot to assist in retrieving the honour of our army in the more successful expedition which took place as you of course are aware about three months ago i will not detain you with our embarkation or voyage we landed from a steamer at bona and soon afterwards my husband's company were ordered to escort a convoy of provisions to the army which were collecting at mzez ammar well we arrived safely at our various camps of drean nech meya and amman berda we made a little detour to visit ghelma i had curiosity to see it as formerly it was an important city i must say that a more tenable position i never beheld but i tire you with these details' 'on the contrary i am delighted' 'you are very good i ought to have said something about the travelling in these wild countries which is anything but pleasant the soil is a species of clay hard as a flint when the weather is dry but running into a slippery paste as soon as moistened it is therefore very fatiguing especially in wet weather when the soldiers slip about in a very laughable manner to look at but very distressing to themselves i travelled either on horseback or in one of the waggons as it happened i was too well known and i hope i may add too well liked not to be as well provided for as possible it is remarkable how soon a frenchman will make himself comfortable wherever he may chance to be the camp of mzez ammar was as busy and as lively as if it was pitched in the heart of france the followers had built up little cabins out of the branches of trees with their leaves on interwoven together all in straight lines forming streets very commodious and perfectly impervious to the withering sun there were restaurants cafes debits de vin et eau de vie sausage sellers butchers grocers in fact there was every trade almost and everything you required not very cheap certainly but you must recollect that this little town had sprung up as if by magic in the heart of the desert 'it was in the month of september that damremont ordered a reconnaissance in the direction of constantine and a battalion of my husband's regiment the th was ordered to form a part of it i have said nothing about my husband he was a good little man and a brave officer full of honour but very obstinate he never would take advice and it was nothing but tais toi coralie all day long but no one is perfect he wished me to remain in the camp but i made it a rule never to be left behind we set off and i rode in one of the little carriages called cacolets which had been provided for the wounded it was terrible travelling i was jolted to atoms in the ascent of the steep mountain called the rass el akba but we gained the summit without a shot being fired when we arrived there and looked down beneath us the sight was very picturesque there were about four or five thousand of the arab cavalry awaiting our descent their white bournous as they term the long dresses in which they enfold themselves waving in the wind as they galloped at full speed in every direction while the glitter of their steel arms flashed like lightning upon your eyes we closed our ranks and descended the arabs in parties of forty or fifty charging upon our flanks every minute not coming to close conflict but stopping at pistol shot distance discharging their guns and then wheeling off again to a distance mere child's play sir nevertheless there were some of our men wounded and the little waggon upon which i was riding was ordered up in the advance to take them in unfortunately to keep clear of the troops the driver kept too much on one side of the narrow defile through which we passed the consequence was that the waggon upset and i was thrown out a considerable distance down the precipice ' 'and broke your nose' interrupted i 'no indeed sir i did not i escaped with only a few contusions about the region of the hip which certainly lamed me for some time and made the jolting more disagreeable than ever well the reconnaissance succeeded damremont was however wrong altogether i told him so when i met him but he was an obstinate old fool and his answer was not as polite as it might have been considering that at that time i was a very pretty woman we returned to the camp at mzez ammar a few days afterwards we were attacked by the arabs who showed great spirit and determination in their desultory mode of warfare which however can make no impression on such troops as the french the attack was continued for three days when they decamped as suddenly as they had come but this cannot be very interesting to you monsieur' 'on the contrary do not i beg leave out a single remark or incident' 'you are very good i presume you know how we militaires like to fight our battles over again well sir we remained in camp until the arrival of the duc de nemours a handsome fair lad who smiled upon me very graciously on the st of october we set off on our expedition to constantine that is to say the advanced guard did of which my husband's company formed a portion the weather which had been very fine now changed and it rained hard all the day the whole road was one mass of mud and there was no end to delays and accidents however the weather became fine again and on the th we arrived within two leagues of constantine when the arabs attacked us and i was very nearly taken prisoner' 'indeed' 'yes my husband who as i before observed to you was very obstinate would have me ride on a caisson in the rear whereas i wished to be in the advance where my advice might have been useful the charge of the arabs was very sudden the three men who were with the caisson were sabred and i was in the arms of a chieftain who was wheeling round his horse to make off with me when a ball took him in the neck and he fell with me i disengaged myself seized the horse by the bridle and prevented its escape and i also took possession of the arab's pistols and scimitar' 'indeed' 'my husband sold the horse the next day to one of our generals who forgot to pay for it after my husband was killed as for the scimitar and pistols they were stolen from me that night but what can you expect our army is brave but a little demoralised the next day we arrived before constantine and we had to defile before the enemy's guns at one portion of the road men and horses were tumbled over by their fire the caisson that i was riding upon was upset by a ball and thrown down the ravine dragging the horses after it i lay among the horses' legs they kicking furiously it was a miracle that my life was preserved as it was ' 'you broke your nose' interrupted i 'no sir indeed i did not i only received a kick on the arm which obliged me to carry it in a sling for some days the weather became very bad we had few tents and they were not able to resist the storms of rain and wind we wrapped ourselves up how we could and sat in deep pools of water and the arabs attacked us before we could open the fire of our batteries we were in such a pickle that had the bad weather lasted we must have retreated and happy would those have been who could have once more found themselves safe in the camp of mzez ammar i don't think that i ever suffered so much as i did at that time the weather had even overcome the natural gallantry of our nation and so far from receiving any attention the general remark to me was what the devil do you do here this to be said to a pretty woman' 'it was not till the th that we could manage to open the fire of our batteries it was mud mud and mud again the men and horses were covered with mud up to their necks the feathers of the staff were covered with mud every ball which was fired by the enemy sent up showers of mud even the face of the duc de nemours was disfigured with it i must say that our batteries were well situated all except the great mortar battery this i pointed out to damremont when he passed me and he was very savage great men don't like to be told of their faults however he lost his life three days afterwards from not taking my advice he was going down the hill with rulhieres when i said to him 'mon general you expose yourself too much that which is duty in a subaltern is a fault in a general' he very politely told me to go to where he may chance to be himself now for a cannon ball struck him a few seconds afterwards and he was killed on the spot general perregaux was severely wounded almost at the same time for four days the fighting was awful battery answered to battery night and day while from every quarter of the compass we were exposed to the fierce attacks of the arab cavalry the commander of our army sent a flag of truce to their town commanding them to surrender and what do you think was the reply if you want powder we'll supply you if you are without bread we will send it to you but as long as there is one good mussulman left alive you do not enter the town was not that grand the very reply when made known to the troops filled them with admiration of their enemy and they swore by their colours that if ever they overpowered them they would give them no quarter 'in two days general vallee to whom the command fell upon the death of damremont considered the breach sufficiently wide for the assault and we every hour expected that the order would be given it came at last my poor husband was in the second column which mounted strange to say he was very melancholy on that morning and appeared to have a presentiment of what was to take place coralie said he to me as he was scraping the mud off his trousers with his pocket knife if i fall you will do well i leave you as a legacy to general vallee he will appreciate you do not forget to let him know my testamentary dispositions 'i promised i would not the drums beat he kissed me on both cheeks go my philippe said i go to glory he did for a mine was sprung and he with many others was blown to atoms i had watched the advance of the column and was able to distinguish the form of my dear philippe when the explosion with the vast column of smoke took place when it cleared away i could see the wounded in every direction hastening back but my husband was not among them in the meantime the other columns entered the breach the firing was awful and the carnage dreadful it was more than an hour after the assault commenced before the french tricolor waved upon the minarets of constantine 'it was not until the next day that i could make up my mind to search for my husband's body but it was my duty i climbed up the breach strewed with the corpses of our brave soldiers intermingled with those of the arabs but i could not find my husband at last a head which had been blown off attracted my attention i examined it it was my philippe's blackened and burnt and terribly disfigured but who can disguise the fragment of a husband from the keen eyes of the wife of his bosom i leaned over it my poor philippe exclaimed i and the tears were bedewing my cheeks when i perceived the duc de nemours close to me with all his staff attending him what have we here said he with surprise to those about him a wife looking for her husband's body mon prince replied i i cannot find it but here is his head he said something very complimentary and kind and then walked on i continued my search without success and determined to take up my quarters in the town as i clambered along i gained a battered wall and putting my foot on it it gave with me and i fell down several feet stunned with the blow i remained for some time insensible when i came to i found 'that you had broken your nose' 'no indeed i had sprained my ankle and hurt the cap of my knee but my nose was quite perfect you must have a little patience yet 'what fragments of my husband were found were buried in a large grave which held the bodies and the mutilated portions of the killed and having obtained possession of an apartment in constantine i remained there several days lamenting his fate at last it occurred to me that his testamentary dispositions should be attended to and i wrote to general vallee informing him of the last wishes of my husband his reply was very short it was that he was excessively flattered but press of business would not permit him to administer to the will it was not polite 'on the th i quitted constantine with a convoy of wounded men the dysentery and the cholera made fearful ravages and i very soon had a caisson all to myself the rain again came on in torrents and it was a dreadful funeral procession every minute wretches jolted to death were thrown down into pits by the roadside and the cries of those who survived were dreadful many died of cold and hunger and after three days we arrived at the camp of mzez ammar with the loss of more than one half of our sufferers 'i took possession of one of the huts built of the boughs of the trees which i formerly described and had leisure to think over my future plans and prospects i was young and pretty and hope did not desert me i had recovered my baggage which i had left at the camp and was now able to attend to my toilet the young officers who were in the camp paid me great attention and were constantly passing and repassing to have a peep at the handsome widow as they were pleased to call me and now comes the history of my misfortune 'the cabin built of boughs which i occupied was double one portion was fenced off from the other with a wattling of branches which ran up about seven feet but not so high as the roof in one apartment i was located the other was occupied by a young officer who paid me attention but who was not to my liking i had been walking out in the cool of the evening and had returned when i heard voices in the other apartment i entered softly and they did not perceive my approach they were talking about me and i must say that the expressions were very complimentary at last one of the party observed well she is a splendid woman and a good soldier's wife i hope to be a general by and bye and she would not disgrace a marshal's baton i think i shall propose to her before we leave the camp 'now sir i did not recognise the speaker by his voice and flattered by the remark i was anxious to know who it could be who was thus prepossessed in my favour i thought that if i could climb up on the back of the only chair which was in my apartment i should be able to see over the partition and satisfy my curiosity i did so and without noise and i was just putting my head over to take a survey of the tenants of the other apartment when the chair tilted and down i came on the floor and on my face unfortunately i hit my nose upon the edge of the frying pan with which my poor philippe and i used to cook our meat and now sir you know how it was that i broke my nose' 'what a pity' observed i 'yes a great pity i had gone through the whole campaign without any serious accident and but after all it was very natural the two besetting evils of women are vanity and curiosity and if you were to ascertain the truth you would find that it is upon these two stumbling blocks that most women are upset and break their noses' 'very true madam' replied i 'i thank you for your narrative and shall be most happy to be of any use to you but i will detain you from your rest no longer so wish you a very good night' well colonel said i as he made a sudden stop what occurred after that i took great care of her until we arrived in london saw her safe to the hotel in leicester square and then took my leave whether liston replaced her nose and she is now flanee ing about paris as beautiful as before her
