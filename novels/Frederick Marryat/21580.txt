the pirate by captain marryat the pirate was published in the ninth book to flow from marryat's pen it was created as an ebook in by nick hodson and reformatted in the pirate by captain frederick marryat chapter one the bay of biscay it was in the latter part of the month of june of the year seventeen hundred and ninety something that the angry waves of the bay of biscay were gradually subsiding after a gale of wind as violent as it was unusual during that period of the year still they rolled heavily and at times the wind blew up in fitful angry gusts as if it would fain renew the elemental combat but each effort was more feeble and the dark clouds which had been summoned to the storm now fled in every quarter before the powerful rays of the sun who burst their masses asunder with a glorious flood of light and heat and as he poured down his resplendent beams piercing deep into the waters of that portion of the atlantic to which we now refer with the exception of one object hardly visible as at creation there was a vast circumference of water bounded by the fancied canopy of heaven we have said with the exception of one object for in the centre of this picture so simple yet so sublime composed of the three great elements there was a remnant of the fourth we say a remnant for it was but the hull of a vessel dismasted water logged its upper works only floating occasionally above the waves when a transient repose from their still violent undulation permitted it to reassume its buoyancy but this was seldom one moment it was deluged by the seas which broke as they poured over its gunwale and the next it rose from its submersion as the water escaped from the portholes at its sides how many thousands of vessels how many millions of property have been abandoned and eventually consigned to the all receiving depths of the ocean through ignorance or through fear what a mine of wealth must lie buried in its sands what riches lie entangled amongst its rocks or remain suspended in its unfathomable gulf where the compressed fluid is equal in gravity to that which it encircles there to remain secured in its embedment from corruption and decay until the destruction of the universe and the return of chaos yet immense as the accumulated loss may be the major part of it has been occasioned from an ignorance of one of the first laws of nature that of specific gravity the vessel to which we have referred was to all appearance in a situation of as extreme hazard as that of a drowning man clinging to a single rope yarn yet in reality she was more secure from descending to the abyss below than many gallantly careering on the waters their occupants dismissing all fear and only calculating upon a quick arrival into port the circassian had sailed from new orleans a gallant and well appointed ship with a cargo the major part of which consisted of cotton the captain was in the usual acceptation of the term a good sailor the crew were hardy and able seamen as they crossed the atlantic they had encountered the gale to which we have referred were driven down into the bay of biscay where as we shall hereafter explain the vessel was dismasted and sprang a leak which baffled all their exertions to keep under it was now five days since the frightened crew had quitted the vessel in two of her boats one of which had swamped and every soul that occupied it had perished the fate of the other was uncertain we said that the crew had deserted the vessel but we did not assert that every existing being had been removed out of her had such been the case we should not have taken up the reader's time in describing inanimate matter it is life that we portray and life there still was in the shattered hull thus abandoned to the mockery of the ocean in the caboose of the circassian that is in the cooking house secured on deck and which fortunately had been so well fixed as to resist the force of the breaking waves remained three beings a man a woman and a child the two first mentioned were of that inferior race which have for so long a period been procured from the sultry afric coast to toil but reap not for themselves the child which lay at the breast of the female was of european blood now indeed deadly pale as it attempted in vain to draw sustenance from its exhausted nurse down whose sable cheeks the tears coursed as she occasionally pressed the infant to her breast and turned it round to leeward to screen it from the spray which dashed over them at each returning swell indifferent to all else save her little charge she spoke not although she shuddered with the cold as the water washed her knees each time that the hull was careened into the wave cold and terror had produced a change in her complexion which now wore a yellow or sort of copper hue the male who was her companion sat opposite to her upon the iron range which once had been the receptacle of light and heat but was now but a weary seat to a drenched and worn out wretch he too had not spoken for many hours with the muscles of his face relaxed his thick lips pouting far in advance of his collapsed cheeks his high cheekbones prominent as budding horns his eyes displaying little but their whites he appeared to be an object of greater misery than the female whose thoughts were directed to the infant and not unto herself yet his feelings were still acute although his faculties appeared to be deadened by excess of suffering eh me cried the negro woman faintly after a long silence her head falling back with extreme exhaustion her companion made no reply but roused at the sound of her voice bent forward slided open the door a little and looked out to windward the heavy spray dashed into his glassy eyes and obscured his vision he groaned and fell back into his former position what you tink coco inquired the negress covering up more carefully the child as she bent her head down upon it a look of despair and a shudder from cold and hunger were the only reply it was then about eight o'clock in the morning and the swell of the ocean was fast subsiding at noon the warmth of the sun was communicated to them through the planks of the caboose while its rays poured a small stream of vivid light through the chinks of the closed panels the negro appeared gradually to revive at last he rose and with some difficulty contrived again to slide open the door the sea had gradually decreased its violence and but occasionally broke over the vessel carefully holding on by the door jambs coco gained the outside that he might survey the horizon what you see coco said the female observing from the caboose that his eyes were fixed upon a certain quarter so help me god me tink me see something but ab so much salt water in um eye me no see clear replied coco rubbing away the salt which had crystallised on his face during the morning what you tink um like coco only one bit cloud replied he entering the caboose and resuming his seat upon the grate with a heavy sigh eh me cried the negress who had uncovered the child to look at it and whose powers were sinking fast poor lilly massa eddard him look very bad indeed him die very soon me fear look coco no ab breath the child's head fell back upon the breast of its nurse and life appeared to be extinct judy you no ab milk for piccaninny suppose um ab no milk how can live eh stop judy me put lilly fingers in um mouth suppose massa eddard no dead him pull coco inserted his finger into the child's mouth and felt a slight drawing pressure judy cried coco massa eddard no dead yet try now suppose you ab lilly drop oder side poor judy shook her head mournfully and a tear rolled down her cheek she was aware that nature was exhausted coco said she wiping her cheek with the back of her hand me give me heart blood for massa eddard but no ab milk all gone this forcible expression of love for the child which was used by judy gave an idea to coco he drew his knife out of his pocket and very coolly sawed to the bone of his fore finger the blood flowed and trickled down to the extremity which he applied to the mouth of the infant see judy massa eddard suck him not dead cried coco chuckling at the fortunate result of the experiment and forgetting at the moment their almost hopeless situation the child revived by the strange sustenance gradually recovered its powers and in a few minutes it pulled at the finger with a certain degree of vigour look judy how massa eddard take it continued coco pull away massa eddard pull away coco ab ten finger and take long while suck em all dry but the child was soon satisfied and fell asleep in the arms of judy coco suppose you go see again observed judy the negro again crawled out and again he scanned the horizon so help me god dis time me tink judy yes so help me god me see a ship cried coco joyfully eh screamed judy faintly with delight den massa eddard no die yes so help me god he come dis way and coco who appeared to have recovered a portion of his former strength and activity clambered on the top of the caboose where he sat cross legged waving his yellow handkerchief with the hope of attracting the attention of those on board for he knew that it was very possible that an object floating little more than level with the water's surface might escape notice as it fortunately happened the frigate for such she was continued her course precisely for the wreck although it had not been perceived by the look out men at the mast heads whose eyes had been directed to the line of the horizon in less than an hour our little party were threatened with a new danger that of being run over by the frigate which was now within a cable's length of them driving the seas before her in one widely extended foam as she pursued her rapid and impetuous course coco shouted to his utmost and fortunately attracted the notice of the men who were on the bowsprit stowing away the foretopmast staysail which had been hoisted up to dry after the gale starboard hard was roared out starboard it is was the reply from the quarterdeck and the helm was shifted without inquiry as it always is on board of a man of war although at the same time it behoves people to be rather careful how they pass such an order without being prepared with a subsequent and most satisfactory explanation the topmast studding sail flapped and fluttered the foresail shivered and the jib filled as the frigate rounded to narrowly missing the wreck which was now under the bows rocking so violently in the white foam of the agitated waters that it was with difficulty that coco could by clinging to the stump of the mainmast retain his elevated position the frigate shortened sail hove to and lowered down a quarter boat and in less than five minutes coco judy and the infant were rescued from their awful situation poor judy who had borne up against all for the sake of the child placed it in the arms of the officer who relieved them and then fell back in a state of insensibility in which condition she was carried on board coco as he took his place in the stern sheets of the boat gazed wildly round him and then broke out into peals of extravagant laughter which continued without intermission and were the only replies which he could give to the interrogatories of the quarter deck until he fell down in a swoon and was entrusted to the care of the surgeon chapter two the bachelor on the evening of the same day on which the child and the two negroes had been saved from the wreck by the fortunate appearance of the frigate mr witherington of finsbury square was sitting alone in his dining room wondering what could have become of the circassian and why he had not received intelligence of her arrival mr witherington as we said before was alone he had his port and his sherry before him and although the weather was rather warm there was a small fire in the grate because as mr witherington asserted it looked comfortable mr witherington having watched the ceiling of the room for some time although there was certainly nothing new to be discovered filled another glass of wine and then proceeded to make himself more comfortable by unbuttoning three more buttons of his waistcoat pushing his wig further off his head and casting loose all the buttons at the knees of his breeches he completed his arrangements by dragging towards him two chairs within his reach putting his legs on one while he rested his arm on the other and why was not mr witherington to make himself comfortable he had good health a good conscience and eight thousand a year satisfied with all his little arrangements mr witherington sipped his port wine and putting down his glass again fell back in his chair placed his hands on his breast interwove his fingers and in this most comfortable position recommenced his speculations as to the non arrival of the circassian we will leave him to his cogitations while we introduce him more particularly to our readers the father of mr witherington was a younger son of one of the oldest and proudest families in the west riding of yorkshire he had his choice of the four professions allotted to younger sons whose veins are filled with patrician blood the army the navy the law and the church the army did not suit him he said as marching and counter marching were not comfortable the navy did not suit him as there was little comfort in gales of wind and mouldy biscuit the law did not suit him as he was not sure that he would be at ease with his conscience which would not be comfortable the church was also rejected as it was with him connected with the idea of a small stipend hard duty a wife and eleven children which were anything but comfortable much to the horror of his family he eschewed all the liberal professions and embraced the offer of an old backslider of an uncle who proposed to him a situation in his banking house and a partnership as soon as he deserved it the consequence was that his relations bade him an indignant farewell and then made no further inquiries about him he was as decidedly cut as one of the female branches of the family would have been had she committed a faux pas nevertheless mr witherington senior stuck diligently to his business in a few years was partner and at the death of the old gentleman his uncle found himself in possession of a good property and every year coining money at his bank mr witherington senior then purchased a house in finsbury square and thought it advisable to look out for a wife having still much of the family pride in his composition he resolved not to muddle the blood of the witheringtons by any cross from cateaton street or mincing lane and after a proper degree of research he selected the daughter of a scotch earl who went to london with a bevy of nine in a leith smack to barter blood for wealth mr witherington being so unfortunate as to be the first comer had the pick of the nine ladies by courtesy his choice was light haired blue eyed a little freckled and very tall by no means bad looking and standing on the list in the family bible number four from this union mr witherington had issue first a daughter christened moggy whom we shall soon have to introduce to our readers as a spinster of forty seven and second antony alexander witherington esquire whom we just now have left in a very comfortable position and in a very brown study mr witherington senior persuaded his son to enter the banking house and as a dutiful son he entered it every day but he did nothing more having made the fortunate discovery that his father was born before him or in other words that his father had plenty of money and would be necessitated to leave it behind him as mr witherington senior had always studied comfort his son had early imbibed the same idea and carried his feelings in that respect to a much greater excess he divided things into comfortable and uncomfortable one fine day lady mary witherington after paying all the household bills paid the debt of nature that is she died her husband paid the undertaker's bill so it is to be presumed that she was buried mr witherington senior shortly afterwards had a stroke of apoplexy which knocked him down death who has no feelings of honour struck him when down and mr witherington after having laid a few days in bed was by a second stroke laid in the same vault as lady mary witherington and mr witherington junior our mr witherington after deducting pounds for his sister's fortune found himself in possession of a clear pounds per annum and an excellent house in finsbury square mr witherington considered this a comfortable income and he therefore retired altogether from business during the lifetime of his parents he had been witness to one or two matrimonial scenes which had induced him to put down matrimony as one of the things not comfortable therefore he remained a bachelor his sister moggy also remained unmarried but whether it was from a very unprepossessing squint which deterred suitors or from the same dislike to matrimony as her brother had imbibed it is not in our power to say mr witherington was three years younger than his sister and although he had for some time worn a wig it was only because he considered it more comfortable mr witherington's whole character might be summed up in two words eccentricity and benevolence eccentric he certainly was as most bachelors usually are man is but a rough pebble without the attrition received from contact with the gentler sex it is wonderful how the ladies pumice a man down to a smoothness which occasions him to roll over and over with the rest of his species jostling but not wounding his neighbours as the waves of circumstances bring him into collision with them mr witherington roused himself from his deep reverie and felt for the string connected with the bell pull which it was the butler's duty invariably to attach to the arm of his master's chair previous to his last exit from the dining room for as mr witherington very truly observed it was very uncomfortable to be obliged to get up and ring the bell indeed more than once mr witherington had calculated the advantages and disadvantages of having a daughter about eight years old who could ring bells air the newspapers and cut the leaves of a new novel when however he called to mind that she could not always remain at that precise age he decided that the balance of comfort was against it mr witherington having pulled the bell again fell into a brown study mr jonathan the butler made his appearance but observing that his master was occupied he immediately stopped at the door erect motionless and with a face as melancholy as if he was performing mute at the porch of some departed peer of the realm for it is an understood thing that the greater the rank of the defunct the longer must be the face and of course the better must be the pay now as mr witherington is still in profound thought and mr jonathan will stand as long as a hackney coach horse we will just leave them as they are while we introduce the brief history of the latter to our readers jonathan trapp has served as footboy which term we believe is derived from those who are in that humble capacity receiving a quantum suff of the application of the feet of those above them to increase the energy of their service then as footman which implies that they have been promoted to the more agreeable right of administering instead of receiving the above dishonourable applications and lastly for promotion could go no higher in the family he had been raised to the dignity of butler in the service of mr witherington senior jonathan then fell in love for butlers are guilty of indiscretions as well as their masters neither he nor his fair flame who was a lady's maid in another family notwithstanding that they had witnessed the consequences of this error in others would take warning they gave warning and they married like most butlers and ladies' maids who pair off they set up a public house and it is but justice to the lady's maid to say that she would have preferred an eating house but was overruled by jonathan who argued that although people would drink when they were not dry they never would eat unless they were hungry now although there was truth in the observation this is certain that business did not prosper it has been surmised that jonathan's tall lank lean figure injured his custom as people are but too much inclined to judge of the goodness of the ale by the rubicund face and rotundity of the landlord and therefore inferred that there could be no good beer where mine host was the picture of famine there certainly is much in appearances in this world and it appears that in consequence of jonathan's cadaverous appearance he very soon appeared in the gazette but what ruined jonathan in one profession procured him immediate employment in another an appraiser upholsterer and undertaker who was called in to value the fixtures fixed his eye upon jonathan and knowing the value of his peculiarly lugubrious appearance and having a half brother of equal height offered him immediate employment as a mute jonathan soon forgot to mourn his own loss of a few hundreds in his new occupation of mourning the loss of thousands and his erect stiff statue like carriage and long melancholy face as he stood at the portals of those who had entered the portals of the next world were but too often a sarcasm upon the grief of the inheritors even grief is worth nothing in this trafficking world unless it be paid for jonathan buried many and at last buried his wife so far all was well but at last he buried his master the undertaker which was not quite so desirable although jonathan wept not yet did he express mute sorrow as he marshalled him to his long home and drank to his memory in a pot of porter as he returned from the funeral perched with many others like carrion crows on the top of the hearse and now jonathan was thrown out of employment from a reason which most people would have thought the highest recommendation every undertaker refused to take him because they could not match him in this unfortunate dilemma jonathan thought of mr witherington junior he had served and he had buried mr witherington his father and lady mary his mother he felt that he had strong claims for such variety of services and he applied to the bachelor fortunately for jonathan mr witherington's butler incumbent was just about to commit the same folly as jonathan had done before and jonathan was again installed resolving in his own mind to lead his former life and have nothing more to do with ladies' maids but from habit jonathan still carried himself as a mute on all ordinary occasions never indulging in an approximation to mirth except when he perceived that his master was in high spirits and then rather from a sense of duty than from any real hilarity of heart jonathan was no mean scholar for his station in life and during his service with the undertaker he had acquired the english of all the latin mottoes which are placed upon the hatchments and these mottoes when he considered them as apt he was very apt to quote we left jonathan standing at the door he had closed it and the handle still remained in his hand jonathan said mr witherington after a long pause i wish to look at the last letter from new york you will find it on my dressing table jonathan quitted the room without reply and made his reappearance with the letter it is a long time that i have been expecting this vessel jonathan observed mr witherington unfolding the letter yes sir a long while tempus fugit replied the butler in a low tone half shutting his eyes i hope to god no accident has happened continued mr witherington my poor little cousin and her twins e'en now that i speak they may be all at the bottom of the sea yes sir replied the butler the sea defrauds many an honest undertaker of his profits by the blood of the witheringtons i may be left without an heir and shall be obliged to marry which would be very uncomfortable very little comfort echoed jonathan my wife is dead in caelo quies well we must hope for the best but this suspense is anything but comfortable observed mr witherington after looking over the contents of the letter for at least the twentieth time that will do jonathan i'll ring for coffee presently and mr witherington was again alone and with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling a cousin of mr witherington and a very great favourite for mr witherington having a large fortune and not having anything to do with business was courted by his relations had to a certain degree committed herself that is to say that notwithstanding the injunctions of her parents she had fallen in love with a young lieutenant in a marching regiment whose pedigree was but respectable and whose fortune was anything but respectable consisting merely of a subaltern's pay poor men unfortunately always make love better than those who are rich because having less to care about and not being puffed up with their own consequence they are not so selfish and think much more of the lady than of themselves young ladies also who fall in love never consider whether there is sufficient to make the pot boil probably because young ladies in love lose their appetites and not feeling inclined to eat at that time they imagine that love will always supply the want of food now we will appeal to the married ladies whether we are not right in asserting that although the collation spread for them and their friends on the day of the marriage is looked upon with almost loathing they do not find their appetites return with interest soon afterwards this was precisely the case with cecilia or rather cecilia templemore for she had changed her name the day before it was also the case with her husband who always had a good appetite even during his days of courtship and the consequence was that the messman's account for they lived in barracks was in a few weeks rather alarming cecilia applied to her family who very kindly sent her word that she might starve but the advice neither suiting her nor her husband she then wrote to her cousin antony who sent her word that he would be most happy to receive them at his table and that they should take up their abode in finsbury square this was exactly what they wished but still there was a certain difficulty lieutenant templemore's regiment was quartered in a town in yorkshire which was some trifling distance from finsbury square and to be at mr witherington's dinner table at six pm with the necessity of appearing at parade every morning at nine am was a dilemma not to be got out of several letters were interchanged upon this knotty subject and at last it was agreed that mr templemore should sell out and come up to mr witherington with his pretty wife he did so and found that it was much more comfortable to turn out at nine o'clock in the morning to a good breakfast than to a martial parade but mr templemore had an honest pride and independence of character which would not permit him to eat the bread of idleness and after a sojourn of two months in most comfortable quarters without a messman's bill he frankly stated his feelings to mr witherington and requested his assistance to procure for himself an honourable livelihood mr witherington who had become attached to them both would have remonstrated observing that cecilia was his own cousin and that he was a confirmed bachelor but in this instance mr templemore was firm and mr witherington very unwillingly consented a mercantile house of the highest respectability required a partner who could superintend their consignments to america mr witherington advanced the sum required and in a few weeks mr and mrs templemore sailed for new york mr templemore was active and intelligent their affairs prospered and in a few years they anticipated a return to their native soil with a competence but the autumn of the second year after their arrival proved very sickly the yellow fever raged and among the thousands who were carried off mr templemore was a victim about three weeks after his wife had been brought to bed of twins mrs templemore rose from her couch a widow and the mother of two fine boys the loss of mr templemore was replaced by the establishment with which he was connected and mr witherington offered to his cousin that asylum which in her mournful and unexpected bereavement she so much required in three months her affairs were arranged and with her little boys hanging at the breasts of two negro nurses for no others could be procured who would undertake the voyage mrs templemore with coco as male servant embarked on board of the good ship circassian a bound to liverpool chapter three the gale those who standing on the pier had witnessed the proud bearing of the circassian as she gave her canvas to the winds little contemplated her fate still less did those on board for confidence is the characteristic of seamen and they have the happy talent of imparting their confidence to whomsoever may be in their company we shall pass over the voyage confining ourselves to a description of the catastrophe it was during a gale from the north west which had continued for three days and by which the circassian had been driven into the bay of biscay that at about twelve o'clock at night a slight lull was perceptible the captain who had remained on deck sent down for the chief mate oswald said captain ingram the gale is breaking and i think before morning we shall have had the worst of it i shall lie down for an hour or two call me if there be any change oswald bareth a tall sinewy built and handsome specimen of transatlantic growth examined the whole circumference of the horizon before he replied at last his eyes were steadily fixed to leeward i've a notion not sir said he i see no signs of clearing off to leeward only a lull for relief and a fresh hand at the bellows depend upon it we have now had it three days replied captain ingram and that's the life of a summer gale yes rejoined the mate but always provided that it don't blow back again i don't like the look of it sir and have it back we shall as sure as there's snakes in virginny well so be if so be was the safe reply of the captain you must keep a sharp look out bareth and don't leave the deck to call me send a hand down the captain descended to his cabin oswald looked at the compass in the binnacle spoke a few words to the man at the helm gave one or two terrible kicks in the ribs to some of the men who were caulking sounded the pump well put a fresh quid of tobacco into his cheek and then proceeded to examine the heavens above a cloud much darker and more descending than the others which obscured the firmament spread over the zenith and based itself upon the horizon to leeward oswald's eye had been fixed upon it but a few seconds when he beheld a small lambent gleam of lightning pierce through the most opaque part then another and more vivid of a sudden the wind lulled and the circassian righted from her careen again the wind howled and again the vessel was pressed down to her bearings by its force again another flash of lightning which was followed by a distant peal of thunder had the worst of it did you say captain i've a notion that the worst is yet to come muttered oswald still watching the heavens how does she carry her helm matthew inquired oswald walking aft spoke a weather i'll have the trysail off her at any rate continued the mate aft there my lads and lower down the trysail keep the sheet fast till it's down or the flogging will frighten the lady passenger out of her wits well if ever i own a craft i'll have no women on board dollars shan't tempt me the lightning now played in rapid forks and the loud thunder which instantaneously followed each flash proved its near approach a deluge of slanting rain descended the wind lulled roared again then lulled shifted a point or two and the drenched and heavy sails flapped up with the helm mat cried oswald as a near flash of lightning for a moment blinded and the accompanying peal of thunder deafened those on deck again the wind blew strong it ceased and it was a dead calm the sails hung down from the yards and the rain descended in perpendicular torrents while the ship rocked to and fro in the trough of the sea and the darkness became suddenly intense down there one of you and call the captain said oswald by the lord we shall have it main braces there men and square the yards be smart that topsail should have been in muttered the mate but i'm not captain square away the yards my lads continued he quick quick there's no child's play here owing to the difficulty of finding and passing the ropes to each other from the intensity of the darkness and the deluge of rain which blinded them the men were not able to execute the order of the mate so soon as it was necessary and before they could accomplish their task or captain ingram could gain the deck the wind suddenly burst upon the devoted vessel from the quarter directly opposite to that from which the gale had blown taking her all a back and throwing her on her beam ends the man at the helm was hurled over the wheel while the rest who were with oswald at the main bits with the coils of ropes and every other article on deck not secured were rolled into the scuppers struggling to extricate themselves from the mass of confusion and the water in which they floundered the sudden revulsion awoke all the men below who imagined that the ship was foundering and from the only hatchway not secured they poured up in their shirts with their other garments in their hands to put them on if fate permitted oswald bareth was the first who clambered up from to leeward he gained the helm which he put hard up captain ingram and some of the seamen also gained the helm it is the rendezvous of all good seamen in emergencies of this description but the howling of the gale the blinding of the rain and salt spray the seas checked in their running by the shift of wind and breaking over the ship in vast masses of water the tremendous peals of thunder and the intense darkness which accompanied these horrors added to the inclined position of the vessel which obliged them to climb from one part of the deck to another for some time checked all profitable communication their only friend in this conflict of the elements was the lightning unhappy indeed the situation in which lightning can be welcomed as a friend but its vivid and forked flames darting down upon every quarter of the horizon enabled them to perceive their situation and awful as it was when momentarily presented to their sight it was not so awful as darkness and uncertainty to those who have been accustomed to the difficulties and dangers of a sea faring life there are no lines which speak more forcibly to the imagination or prove the beauty and power of the greek poet than those in the noble prayer of ajax lord of earth and air o king o father hear my humble prayer dispel this cloud that light of heaven restore give me to see and ajax asks no more if greece must perish we thy will obey but let us perish in the face of day oswald gave the helm to two of the seamen and with his knife cut adrift the axes which were lashed round the mizen mast in painted canvas covers one he retained for himself the others he put into the hands of the boatswain and the second mate to speak so as to be heard was almost impossible from the tremendous roaring of the wind but the lamp still burned in the binnacle and by its feeble light captain ingram could distinguish the signs made by the mate and could give his consent it was necessary that the ship should be put before the wind and the helm had no power over her in a short time the lanyards of the mizen rigging were severed and the mizen mast went over the side almost unperceived by the crew on the other parts of the deck or even those near had it not been from blows received by those who were too close to it from the falling of the topsail sheets and the rigging about the mast oswald with his companions regained the binnacle and for a little while watched the compass the ship did not pay off and appeared to settle down more into the water again oswald made his signs and again the captain gave his assent forward sprang the undaunted mate clinging to the bulwark and belaying pins and followed by his hardy companions until they had all three gained the main channels here their exposure to the force of the breaking waves and the stoutness of the ropes yielding but slowly to the blows of the axes which were used almost under water rendered the service one of extreme difficulty and danger the boatswain was washed over the bulwark and dashed to leeward where the lee rigging only saved him from a watery grave unsubdued he again climbed up to windward rejoined and assisted his companions the last blow was given by oswald the lanyards flew through the dead eyes and the tall mast disappeared in the foaming seas oswald and his companions hastened from their dangerous position and rejoined the captain who with many of the crew still remained near the wheel the ship now slowly paid off and righted in a few minutes she was flying before the gale rolling heavily and occasionally striking upon the wrecks of the masts which she towed with her by the lee rigging although the wind blew with as much violence as before still it was not with the same noise now that the ship was before the wind with her after masts gone the next service was to clear the ship of the wrecks of the masts but although all now assisted but little could be effected until the day had dawned and even then it was a service of danger as the ship rolled gunwale under those who performed the duty were slung in ropes that they might not be washed away and hardly was it completed when a heavy roll assisted by a jerking heave from a sea which struck her on the chess tree sent the foremast over the starboard cathead thus was the circassian dismasted in the gale chapter four the leak the wreck of the foremast was cleared from the ship the gale continued but the sun shone brightly and warmly the circassian was again brought to the wind all danger was now considered to be over and the seamen joked and laughed as they were busied in preparing jury masts to enable them to reach their destined port i wouldn't have cared so much about this spree said the boatswain if it warn't for the mainmast it was such a beauty there's not another stick to be found equal to it in the whole length of the mississippi bah man replied oswald there's as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it and as good sticks growing as ever were felled but i guess we'll pay pretty dear for our spars when we get to liverpool but that concerns the owners the wind which at the time of its sudden change to the southward and eastward had blown with the force of a hurricane now settled into a regular strong gale such as sailors are prepared to meet and laugh at the sky was also bright and clear and they had not the danger of a lee shore it was a delightful change after a night of darkness danger and confusion and the men worked that they might get sufficient sail on the ship to steady her and enable them to shape a course i suppose now that we have the trysail on her forward the captain will be for running for it observed one who was busy turning in a dead eye yes replied the boatswain and with this wind on our quarter we shan't want much sail i've a notion well then one advantage in losing your mast you haven't much trouble about the rigging trouble enough though bill when we get in replied another gruffly new lower rigging to parcel and sarve and every block to turn in afresh never mind longer in port i'll get spliced why how often do you mean to get spliced bill you've a wife in every state to my sartin knowledge i ain't got one at liverpool jack well you may take one there bill for you've been sweet upon that nigger girl for these last three weeks any port in a storm but she won't do for harbour duty but the fact is you're all wrong there jack its the babbies i likes i likes to see them both together hanging at the niggers' breasts i always think of two spider monkeys nursing two kittens i knows the women but i never knows the children it's just six of one and half a dozen of the other ain't it bill yes like two bright bullets out of the same mould i say bill did any of your wives ever have twins no nor i don't intend until the owners give us double pay by the bye interrupted oswald who had been standing under the weather bulk head listening to the conversation and watching the work in progress we may just as well see if she has made any water with all this straining and buffeting by the lord i never thought of that carpenter lay down your adze and sound the well the carpenter who notwithstanding the uneasiness of the dismasted vessel was performing his important share of the work immediately complied with the order he drew up the rope yarn to which an iron rule had been suspended and lowered down into the pump well and perceived that the water was dripping from it imagining that it must have been wet from the quantity of water shipped over all the carpenter disengaged the rope yarn from the rule drew another from the junk lying on the deck which the seamen were working up and then carefully proceeded to plumb the well he hauled it up and looking at it for some moments aghast exclaimed seven feet of water in the hold by god if the crew of the circassian the whole of which were on deck had been struck with an electric shock the sudden change of their countenances could not have been greater than was produced by this appalling intelligence heap upon sailors every disaster every danger which can be accumulated from the waves the wind the elements or the enemy and they will bear up against them with a courage amounting to heroism all that they demand is that the one plank between them and death is sound and they will trust to their own energies and will be confident in their own skill but spring a leak and they are half paralysed and if it gain upon them they are subdued for when they find that their exertions are futile they are little better than children oswald sprang to the pumps when he heard the carpenter's report try again abel it cannot be cut away that line hand us here a dry rope yarn once more the well was sounded by oswald and the result was the same we must rig the pumps my lads said the mate endeavouring to conceal his own fears half this water must have found its way in when she was on her beam ends this idea so judiciously thrown out was caught at by the seamen who hastened to obey the order while oswald went down to acquaint the captain who worn out with watching and fatigue had now that danger was considered to be over thrown himself into his cot to obtain a few hours' repose do you think bareth that we have sprung a leak said the captain earnestly she never could have taken in that quantity of water never sir replied the mate but she has been so strained that she may have opened her top sides i trust it is no worse what is your opinion then i am afraid that the wrecks of the masts have injured her you may recollect how often we struck against them before we could clear ourselves of them once particularly the mainmast appeared to be right under her bottom i recollect and she struck very heavy on it well it is god's will let us get on deck as fast as we can when they arrived on deck the carpenter walked up to the captain and quietly said to him seven feet three sir the pumps were then in full action the men had divided by the direction of the boatswain and stripped naked to the waist relieved each other every two minutes for half an hour they laboured incessantly this was the half hour of suspense the great point to be ascertained was whether she leaked through the top sides and had taken in the water during the second gale if so there was every hope of keeping it under captain ingram and the mate remained in silence near the capstan the former with his watch in his hand during the time that the sailors exerted themselves to the utmost it was ten minutes past seven when the half hour had expired the well was sounded and the line carefully measured seven feet six inches so that the water had gained upon them notwithstanding that they had plied the pumps to the utmost of their strength a mute look of despair was exchanged among the crew but it was followed up by curses and execrations captain ingram remained silent with his lips compressed it's all over with us exclaimed one of the men not yet my lads we have one more chance said oswald i've a notion that the ship's sides have been opened by the infernal straining of last night and that she is now taking it in at the top sides generally if so we have only to put her before the wind again and have another good spell at the pumps when no longer strained as she is now with her broadside to the sea she will close all up again i shouldn't wonder if mr bareth is not right replied the carpenter however that's my notion too and mine added captain ingram come my men never say die while there's a shot in the locker let's try her again and to encourage the men captain ingram threw off his coat and assisted at the first spell while oswald went to the helm and put the ship before the wind as the circassian rolled before the gale the lazy manner in which she righted proved how much water there was in the hold the seamen exerted themselves for a whole hour without intermission and the well was again sounded eight feet the men did not assert that they would pump no longer but they too plainly showed their intentions by each resuming in silence his shirt and jacket which had been taken off at the commencement of his exertions what's to be done oswald said captain ingram as they walked aft you see the men will pump no longer nor indeed would it be of any use we are doomed the circassian is sir i am afraid replied the mate pumping is of no avail they could not keep her afloat till day break we must therefore trust to our boats which i believe to be all sound and quit her before night crowded boats in such a sea as this replied captain ingram shaking his head mournfully are bad enough i grant but better than the sea itself all we can do now is to try and keep the men sober and if we can do so it will be better than to fatigue them uselessly they'll want all their strength before they put foot again upon dry land if ever they are so fortunate shall i speak to them do oswald replied the captain for myself i care little god knows but my wife my children my lads said oswald going forward to the men who had waited in moody silence the result of the conference as for pumping any longer it would be only wearing out your strength for no good we must now look to our boats and a good boat is better than a bad ship still this gale and cross running sea are rather too much for boats at present we had therefore better stick to the ship as long as we can let us set to with a will and get the boats ready with provisions water and what may be needful and then we must trust to god's mercy and our own endeavours no boat can stand this sea observed one of the men i'm of opinion as it's to be a short life it may as well be a merry one what d'ye say my lads continued he appealing to the men several of the crew were of the same opinion but oswald stepping forward seized one of the axes which lay at the main bits and going up to the seaman who had spoken looked him steadfastly in the face williams said the mate a short life it may be to all of us but not a merry one the meaning of which i understand very well sorry i shall be to have your blood or that of others on my hands but as sure as there's a heaven i'll cleave to the shoulder the first man who attempts to break into the spirit room you know i never joke shame upon you do you call yourselves men when for the sake of a little liquor now you would lose your only chance of getting drunk every day as soon as we get on shore again there's a time for all things and i've a notion this is a time to be sober as most of the crew sided with oswald the weaker party were obliged to submit and the preparations were commenced the two boats on the booms were found to be in good condition one party was employed cutting away the bulwarks that the boats might be launched over the side as there were no means of hoisting them out the well was again sounded nine feet of water in the hold and the ship evidently settling fast two hours had now passed and the gale was not so violent the sea also which at the change of wind had been cross appeared to have recovered its regular run all was ready the sailors once at work again had in some measure recovered their spirits and were buoyed up with fresh hopes at the slight change in their favour from the decrease of the wind the two boats were quite large enough to contain the whole of the crew and passengers but as the sailors said among themselves proving the kindness of their hearts what was to become of those two poor babbies in an open boat for days and nights perhaps captain ingram had gone down to mrs templemore to impart to her their melancholy prospects and the mother's heart as well as the mother's voice echoed the words of the seamen what will become of my poor babes it was not till nearly six o'clock in the evening that all was ready the ship was slowly brought to the wind again and the boats launched over the side by this time the gale was much abated but the vessel was full of water and was expected soon to go down there is no time in which coolness and determination are more required than in a situation like the one which we have attempted to describe it is impossible to know the precise moment at which a water logged vessel in a heavy sea may go down and its occupants are in a state of mental fever with the idea of their remaining in her so late that she will suddenly submerge and leave them to struggle in the waves this feeling actuated many of the crew of the circassian and they had already retreated to the boats all was arranged oswald had charge of one boat and it was agreed that the larger should receive mrs templemore and her children under the protection of captain ingram the number appointed to oswald's boat being completed he shoved off to make room for the other and laid to to leeward waiting to keep company mrs templemore came up with captain ingram and was assisted by him into the boat the nurse with one child was at last placed by her side coco was leading judy the other nurse with the remaining infant in her arms and captain ingram who had been obliged to go into the boat with the first child was about to return to assist judy with the other when the ship gave a heavy pitch and her forecastle was buried in the wave at the same time the gunwale of the boat was stove by coming in contact with the side of the vessel she's down by god exclaimed the alarmed seamen in the boat shoving off to escape from the vortex captain ingram who was standing on the boat's thwarts to assist judy was thrown back into the bottom of the boat and before he could extricate himself the boat was separated from the ship and had drifted to leeward my child screamed the mother my child pull to again my lads cried captain ingram seizing the tiller the men who had been alarmed at the idea that the ship was going down now that they saw that she was still afloat got out the oars and attempted to regain her but in vain they could not make head against the sea and wind further and further did they drift to leeward notwithstanding their exertions while the frantic mother extended her arms imploring and entreating captain ingram who had stimulated the sailors to the utmost perceived that further attempts were useless my child my child screamed mrs templemore standing up and holding out her arms towards the vessel at a sign from the captain the head of the boat was veered round the bereaved mother knew that all hope was gone and she fell down in a state of insensibility chapter five the old maid one morning shortly after the disasters which we have described mr witherington descended to his breakfast room somewhat earlier than usual and found his green morocco easy chair already tenanted by no less a personage than william the footman who with his feet on the fender was so attentively reading the newspaper that he did not hear his master's entrance by my ancestor who fought on his stumps but i hope you are quite comfortable mr william nay i beg i may not disturb you sir william although as impudent as most of his fraternity was a little taken aback i beg your pardon sir but mr jonathan had not time to look over the paper nor is it required that he should that i know of sir mr jonathan says sir that it is always right to look over the deaths that news of that kind may not shock you very considerate indeed and there is a story there sir about a shipwreck a shipwreck where william god bless me where is it i am afraid it is the same ship you are so anxious about sir the i forget the name sir mr witherington took the newspaper and his eye soon caught the paragraph in which the rescue of the two negroes and child from the wreck of the circassian was fully detailed it is indeed exclaimed mr witherington my poor cecilia in an open boat one of the boats was seen to go down perhaps she's dead merciful god one boy saved mercy on me where's jonathan here sir replied jonathan very solemnly who had just brought in the eggs and now stood erect as a mute behind his master's chair for it was a case of danger if not of death i must go to portsmouth immediately after breakfast shan't eat though appetite all gone people seldom do sir on these melancholy occasions replied jonathan will you take your own carriage sir or a mourning coach a mourning coach at fourteen miles an hour with two pair of horses jonathan you're crazy will you please to have black silk hatbands and gloves for the coachman and servants who attend you sir confound your shop no this is a resurrection not a death it appears that the negro thinks only one of the boats went down mors omnia vincit quoth jonathan casting up his eyes never you mind that mind your own business that's the postman's knock see if there are any letters there were several and amongst the others there was one from captain maxwell of the eurydice detailing the circumstances already known and informing mr witherington that he had despatched the two negroes and the child to his address by that day's coach and that one of the officers who was going to town by the same conveyance would see them safe to his house captain maxwell was an old acquaintance of mr witherington had dined at his house in company with the templemores and therefore had extracted quite enough information from the negroes to know where to direct them by the blood of my ancestors they'll be here to night cried mr witherington and i have saved my journey what is to be done better tell mary to get rooms ready d'ye hear william beds for one little boy and two niggers yes sir replied william but where are the black people to be put put i don't care one may sleep with cook the other with mary very well sir i'll tell them replied william hastening away delighted at the row which he anticipated in the kitchen if you please sir observed jonathan one of the negroes is i believe a man well what then only sir the maids may object to sleep with him by all the plagues of the witheringtons this is true well you may take him jonathan you like that colour not in the dark sir replied jonathan with a bow well then let them sleep together so that affair is settled are they man and wife sir said the butler the devil take them both how should i know let me have my breakfast and we'll talk over the matter by and by mr witherington applied to his eggs and muffin eating his breakfast as fast as he could without knowing why but the reason was that he was puzzled and perplexed with the anticipated arrival and longed to think quietly over the dilemma for it was a dilemma to an old bachelor as soon as he had swallowed his second cup of tea he put himself into his easy chair in an easy attitude and was very soon soliloquising as follows by the blood of the witheringtons what am i an old bachelor to do with a baby and a wet nurse as black as the ace of spades and another black fellow in the bargain send him back again yes that's best but the child woke every morning at five o'clock with its squalling obliged to kiss it three times a day pleasant and then that nigger of a nurse thick lips kissing child all day and then holding it out to me ignorant as a cow if child has the stomach ache she'll cram a pepper pod down its throat west india fashion children never without the stomach ache my poor poor cousin what has become of her and the other child too wish they may pick her up poor dear and then she will come and take care of her own children don't know what to do great mind to send for sister moggy but she's so fussy won't be in a hurry think again here mr witherington was interrupted by two taps at the door come in said he and the cook with her face as red as if she had been dressing a dinner for eighteen made her appearance without the usual clean apron if you please sir said she curtseying i will thank you to suit yourself with another cook oh very well replied mr witherington angry at the interruption and if you please sir i should like to go this very day indeed sir i shall not stay go to the devil if you please replied mr witherington angrily but first go out and shut the door after you the cook retired and mr witherington was again alone confound the old woman what a huff she is in won't cook for black people i suppose yes that's it here mr witherington was again interrupted by a second double tap at the door oh thought better of it i suppose come in it was not the cook but mary the housemaid that entered if you please sir said she whimpering i should wish to leave my situation a conspiracy by heavens well you may go to night sir if you please answered the woman this moment for all i care exclaimed mr witherington in his wrath the housemaid retired and mr witherington took some time to compose himself servants all going to the devil in this country said he at last proud fools won't clean rooms after black people i suppose yes that's it confound them all black and white here's my whole establishment upset by the arrival of a baby well it is very uncomfortable what shall i do send for sister moggy no i'll send for jonathan mr witherington rang the bell and jonathan made his appearance what is all this jonathan said he cook angry mary crying both going away what's it all about why sir they were told by william that it was your positive order that the two black people were to sleep with them and i believe he told mary that the man was to sleep with her confound that fellow he's always at mischief you know jonathan i never meant that i thought not sir as it is quite contrary to custom replied jonathan well then tell them so and let's hear no more about it mr witherington then entered into a consultation with his butler and acceded to the arrangements proposed by him the parties arrived in due time and were properly accommodated master edward was not troubled with the stomach ache neither did he wake mr witherington at five o'clock in the morning and after all it was not very uncomfortable but although things were not quite so uncomfortable as mr witherington had anticipated still they were not comfortable and mr witherington was so annoyed by continual skirmishes with his servants complaints from judy in bad english of the cook who it must be owned had taken a prejudice against her and coco occasional illness of the child et cetera that he found his house no longer quiet and peaceable three months had now nearly passed and no tidings of the boats had been received and captain maxwell who came up to see mr witherington gave it as his decided opinion that they must have foundered in the gale as therefore there appeared to be no chance of mrs templemore coming to take care of her child mr witherington at last resolved to write to bath where his sister resided and acquaint her with the whole story requesting her to come and superintend his domestic concerns a few days afterwards he received the following reply bath august my dear brother antony your letter arrived safe to hand on wednesday last and i must say that i was not a little surprised at its contents indeed i thought so much about it that i revoked at lady betty blabkin's whist party and lost four shillings and sixpence you say that you have a child at your house belonging to your cousin who married in so indecorous a manner i hope what you say is true but at the same time i know what bachelors are guilty of although as lady betty says it is better never to talk or even to hint about these improper things i cannot imagine why men should consider themselves in an unmarried state as absolved from that purity which maidens are so careful to preserve and so says lady betty with whom i had a little conversation on the subject as however the thing is done she agrees with me that it is better to hush it up as well as we can i presume that you do not intend to make the child your heir which i should consider as highly improper and indeed lady betty tells me that the legacy duty is ten per cent and that it cannot be avoided however i make it a rule never to talk about these sort of things as for your request that i will come up and superintend your establishment i have advised with lady betty on the subject and she agrees with me that for the honour of the family it is better that i should come as it will save appearances you are in a peck of troubles as most men are who are free livers and are led astray by artful and alluring females however as lady betty says the least said the soonest mended' i will therefore make the necessary arrangements for letting my house and hope to join you in about ten days sooner i cannot as i find that my engagements extend to that period many questions have already been put to me on this unpleasant subject but i always give but one answer which is that bachelors will be bachelors and that at all events it is not so bad as if you were a married man for i make it a rule never to talk about or even to hint about these sort of things for as lady betty says men will get into scrapes and the sooner things are hushed up the better' so no more at present from your affectionate sister margaret witherington ps lady betty and i both agree that you are very right in hiring two black people to bring the child into your house as it makes the thing look foreign to the neighbours and we can keep our own secrets mw now by all the sins of the witheringtons if this is not enough to drive a man out of his senses confound the suspicious old maid i'll not let her come into this house confound lady betty and all scandal loving old tabbies like her bless me continued mr witherington throwing the letter on the table with a deep sigh this is anything but comfortable but if mr witherington found it anything but comfortable at the commencement he found it unbearable in the sequel his sister moggy arrived and installed herself in the house with all the pomp and protecting air of one who was the saviour of her brother's reputation and character when the child was first brought down to her instead of perceiving at once its likeness to mr templemore which was very strong she looked at it and at her brother's face with her only eye and shaking her finger exclaimed oh antony antony and did you expect to deceive me the nose the mouth exact antony for shame fie for shame but we must hurry over the misery that mr witherington's kindness and benevolence brought upon him not a day passed scarcely an hour without his ears being galled with his sister's insinuations judy and coco were sent back to america the servants who had remained so long in his service gave warning one by one and afterwards were changed as often almost as there was a change in the moon she ruled the house and her brother despotically and all poor mr witherington's comfort was gone until the time arrived when master edward was to be sent to school mr witherington then plucked up courage and after a few stormy months drove his sister back to bath and once more found himself comfortable edward came home during the holidays and was a great favourite but the idea had become current that he was the son of the old gentleman and the remarks made were so unpleasant and grating to him that he was not sorry much as he was attached to the boy when he declared his intention to choose the profession of a sailor captain maxwell introduced him into the service and afterwards when in consequence of ill health and exhaustion he was himself obliged to leave it for a time he procured for his protege other ships we must therefore allow some years to pass away during which time edward templemore pursues his career mr witherington grows older and more particular and his sister moggy amuses herself with lady betty's remarks and her darling game of whist during all this period no tidings of the boats or of mrs templemore and her infant had been heard it was therefore naturally conjectured that they had all perished and they were remembered but as things that had been chapter six the midshipman the weather side of the quarter deck of hm frigate unicorn was occupied by two very great personages captain plumbton commanding the ship who was very great in width if not in height taking much more than his allowance of the deck if it were not that he was the proprietor thereof and entitled to the lion's share captain p was not more than four feet ten inches in height but then he was equal to that in girth there was quite enough of him if he had only been rolled out he walked with his coat flying open his thumbs stuck into the arm holes of his waistcoat so as to throw his shoulders back and increase his horizontal dimensions he also held his head well aft which threw his chest and stomach well forward he was the prototype of pomposity and good nature and he strutted like an actor in a procession the other personage was the first lieutenant whom nature had pleased to fashion in another mould he was as tall as the captain was short as thin as his superior was corpulent his long lanky legs were nearly up to the captain's shoulders and he bowed down over the head of his superior as if he were the crane to hoist up and the captain the bale of goods to be hoisted he carried his hands behind his back with two fingers twisted together and his chief difficulty appeared to be to reduce his own stride to the parrot march of the captain his features were sharp and lean as was his body and wore every appearance of a cross grained temper he had been making divers complaints of divers persons and the captain had hitherto appeared imperturbable captain plumbton was an even tempered man who was satisfied with a good dinner lieutenant markitall was an odd tempered man who would quarrel with his bread and butter quite impossible sir continued the first lieutenant to carry on the duty without support this oracular observation which from the relative forms of the two parties descended as it were from above was replied to by the captain with a very true then sir i presume you will not object to my putting that man in the report for punishment i'll think about it mr markitall this with captain plumbton was as much as to say no the young gentlemen sir i am sorry to say are very troublesome boys always are replied the captain yes sir but the duty must be carried on and i cannot do without them very true midshipmen are very useful but i am sorry to say sir that they are not now sir there's mr templemore i can do nothing with him he does nothing but laugh laugh mr markitall does he laugh at you not exactly sir but he laughs at everything if i send him to the mast head he goes up laughing if i call him down he comes down laughing if i find fault with him he laughs the next minute in fact sir he does nothing but laugh i should particularly wish sir that you would speak to him and see if any interference on your part would make him cry eh better to laugh than cry in this world does he never cry mr markitall yes sir and very unseasonably the other day you may recollect when you punished wilson the marine whom i appointed to take care of his chest and hammock he was crying the whole time almost tantamount at least an indirect species of mutiny on his part as it implied that the boy was sorry that his servant was punished i never flog a man but i'm sorry myself mr markitall well i do not press the question of his crying that i might look over but his laughing sir i must beg that you will take notice of that here he is sir coming up the hatchway mr templemore the captain wishes to speak to you now the captain did not wish to speak to him but forced upon him as it was by the first lieutenant he could do no less so mr templemore touched his hat and stood before the captain we regret to say with such a good humoured sly confiding smirk on his countenance as at once established the proof of the accusation and the enormity of the offence so sir said captain plumbton stopping in his perambulation and squaring his shoulders still more i find that you laugh at the first lieutenant i sir replied the boy the smirk expanding into a broad grin yes you sir said the first lieutenant now drawing up to his full height why you're laughing now sir i can't help it sir it's not my fault and i'm sure it's not yours sir added the boy demurely are you aware edward mr templemore i mean of the impropriety of disrespect to your superior officer i never laughed at mr markitall but once sir that i can recollect and that was when he tumbled over the messenger and why did you laugh at him then sir i always do laugh when any one tumbles down replied the lad i can't help it sir then sir i suppose you would laugh if you saw me rolling in the lee scuppers said the captain oh replied the boy no longer able to contain himself i'm sure i should burst myself with laughing i think i see you now sir do you indeed i'm very glad that you do not though i'm afraid young gentleman you stand convicted by your own confession yes sir for laughing if that is any crime but it's not in the articles of war no sir but disrespect is you laugh when you go to the mast head but i obey the order sir immediately do i not mr markitall yes sir you obey the order but at the same time your laughing proves that you do not mind the punishment no more i do sir i spend half my time at the mast head and i'm used to it now but mr templemore ought you not to feel the disgrace of the punishment inquired the captain severely yes sir if i felt i deserved it i should i should not laugh sir if you sent me to the mast head replied the boy assuming a serious countenance you see mr markitall that he can be grave observed the captain i've tried all i can to make him so sir replied the first lieutenant but i wish to ask mr templemore what he means to imply by saying when he deserves it' does he mean to say that i have ever punished him unjustly yes sir replied the boy boldly five times out of six i am mast headed for nothing and that's the reason why i do not mind it for nothing sir do you call laughing nothing i pay every attention that i can to my duty sir i always obey your orders i try all i can to make you pleased with me but you are always punishing me yes sir for laughing and what is worse making the ship's company laugh they haul and hold' just the same sir i think they work all the better for being merry and pray sir what business have you to think replied the first lieutenant now very angry captain plumbton as this young gentleman thinks proper to interfere with me and the discipline of the ship i beg you will see what effect your punishing may have upon him mr templemore said the captain you are in the first place too free in your speech and in the next place too fond of laughing there is mr templemore a time for all things a time to be merry and a time to be serious the quarter deck is not a fit place for mirth i'm sure the gangway is not shrewdly interrupted the boy no you are right nor the gangway but you may laugh on the forecastle and when below with your messmates no sir we may not mr markitall always sends out if he hears us laughing because mr templemore you're always laughing i believe i am sir and if it's wrong i'm sorry to displease you but i mean no disrespect i laugh in my sleep i laugh when i awake i laugh when the sun shines i always feel so happy but though you do mast head me mr markitall i should not laugh but be very sorry if any misfortune happened to you i believe you would boy i do indeed mr markitall said the captain well sir replied the first lieutenant as mr templemore appears to be aware of his error i do not wish to press my complaint i have only to request that he will never laugh again you hear boy what the first lieutenant says it's very reasonable and i beg i may hear no more complaints mr markitall let me know when the foot of that foretopsail will be repaired i should like to shift it to night mr markitall went down under the half deck to make the inquiry and edward said captain plumbton as soon as the lieutenant was out of ear shot i have a good deal more to say to you upon this subject but i have no time now so come and dine with me at my table you know i allow laughing in moderation the boy touched his hat and with a grateful happy countenance walked away we have introduced this little scene that the reader may form some idea of the character of edward templemore he was indeed the soul of mirth good humour and kindly feelings towards others he even felt kindly towards the first lieutenant who persecuted him for his risible propensities we do not say that the boy was right in laughing at all times or that the first lieutenant was wrong in attempting to check it as the captain said there is a time for all things and edward's laugh was not always seasonable but it was his nature and he could not help it he was joyous as the may morning and thus he continued for years laughing at everything pleased with everybody almost universally liked and his bold free and happy spirit unchecked by vicissitude or hardship he served his time was nearly turned back when he was passing his examination for laughing and then went laughing to sea again was in command of a boat at the cutting out of a french corvette and when on board was so much amused by the little french captain skipping about with his rapier which proved fatal to many that at last he received a pink from the little gentleman himself which laid him on deck for this affair and in consideration of his wound he obtained his promotion to the rank of lieutenant was appointed to a line of battle ship in the west indies laughed at the yellow fever was appointed to the tender of that ship a fine schooner and was sent to cruise for prize money for the admiral and promotion for himself if he could by any fortunate encounter be so lucky as to obtain it chapter seven sleeper's bay on the western coast of africa there is a small bay which has received more than one name from its occasional visitors that by which it was designated by the adventurous portuguese who first dared to cleave the waves of the southern atlantic has been forgotten with their lost maritime pre eminence the name allotted to it by the woolly headed natives of the coast has never perhaps been ascertained it is however marked down in some of the old english charts as sleeper's bay the mainland which by its curvature has formed this little dent on a coast possessing and certainly at present requiring few harbours displays perhaps the least inviting of all prospects offering to the view nothing but a shelving beach of dazzling white sand backed with a few small hummocks beat up by the occasional fury of the atlantic gales arid bare and without the slightest appearance of vegetable life the inland prospect is shrouded over by a dense mirage through which here and there are to be discovered the stems of a few distant palm trees so broken and disjoined by refraction that they present to the imagination anything but the idea of foliage or shade the water in the bay is calm and smooth as the polished mirror not the smallest ripple is to be heard on the beach to break through the silence of nature not a breath of air sweeps over its glassy surface which is heated with the intense rays of a vertical noonday sun pouring down a withering flood of light and heat not a sea bird is to be discovered wheeling on its flight or balancing on its wings as it pierces the deep with its searching eye ready to dart upon its prey all is silence solitude and desolation save that occasionally may be seen the fin of some huge shark either sluggishly moving through the heated element or stationary in the torpor of the mid day heat a site so sterile so stagnant so little adapted to human life cannot well be conceived unless by flying to extremes we were to portray the chilling blast the transfixing cold and close ribbed ice at the frozen poles at the entrance of this bay in about three fathoms water heedless of the spring cable which hung down as a rope which had fallen overboard there floated motionless as death a vessel whose proportions would have challenged the unanimous admiration of those who could appreciate the merits of her build had she been anchored in the most frequented and busy harbour of the universe so beautiful were her lines that you might almost have imagined her a created being that the ocean had been ordered to receive as if fashioned by the divine architect to add to the beauty and variety of his works for from the huge leviathan to the smallest of the finny tribe from the towering albatross to the boding petrel of the storm where could be found among the winged or finned frequenters of the ocean a form more appropriate more fitting than this specimen of human skill whose beautiful model and elegant tapering spars were now all that could be discovered to break the meeting lines of the firmament and horizon of the offing alas she was fashioned at the will of avarice for the aid of cruelty and injustice and now was even more nefariously employed she had been a slaver she was now the far famed still more dreaded pirate schooner the avenger not a man of war which scoured the deep but had her instructions relative to this vessel which had been so successful in her career of crime not a trader in any portion of the navigable globe but whose crew shuddered at the mention of her name and the remembrance of the atrocities which had been practised by her reckless crew she had been everywhere in the east the west the north and the south leaving a track behind her of rapine and of murder there she lay in motionless beauty her low sides were painted black with one small narrow riband of red her raking masts were clean scraped her topmasts her cross trees caps and even running blocks were painted in pure white awnings were spread fore and aft to protect the crew from the powerful rays of the sun her ropes were hauled taut and in every point she wore the appearance of being under the control of seamanship and strict discipline through the clear smooth water her copper shone brightly and as you looked over her taffrail down into the calm blue sea you could plainly discover the sandy bottom beneath her and the anchor which then lay under her counter a small boat floated astern the weight of the rope which attached her appearing in the perfect calm to draw her towards the schooner we must now go on board and our first cause of surprise will be the deception relative to the tonnage of the schooner when viewed from a distance instead of a small vessel of about ninety tons we discover that she is upwards of two hundred that her breadth of beam is enormous and that those spars which appeared so light and elegant are of unexpected dimensions her decks are of narrow fir planks without the least spring or rise her ropes are of manilla hemp neatly secured to copper belaying pins and coiled down on the deck whose whiteness is well contrasted with the bright green paint of her bulwarks her capstern and binnacles are cased in fluted mahogany and ornamented with brass metal stanchions protect the skylights and the bright muskets are arranged in front of the mainmast while the boarding pikes are lashed round the mainboom in the centre of the vessel between the fore and main masts there is a long brass pounder fixed upon a carriage revolving in a circle and so arranged that in bad weather it can be lowered down and housed while on each side of her decks are mounted eight brass guns of smaller calibre and of exquisite workmanship her build proves the skill of the architect her fitting out a judgment in which nought has been sacrificed to although everything has been directed by taste and her neatness and arrangement that in the person of her commander to the strictest discipline there is united the practical knowledge of a thorough seaman how indeed otherwise could she have so long continued her lawless yet successful career how could it have been possible to unite a crew of miscreants who feared not god nor man most of whom had perpetrated foul murders or had been guilty of even blacker iniquities it was because he who commanded the vessel was so superior as to find in her no rivalry superior in talent in knowledge of his profession in courage and moreover in physical strength which in him was almost herculean unfortunately he was also superior to all in villainy in cruelty and contempt of all injunctions moral and divine what had been the early life of this person was but imperfectly known it was undoubted that he had received an excellent education and it was said that he was of an ancient border family on the banks of the tweed by what chances he had become a pirate by what errors he had fallen from his station in society until he became an outcast had never been revealed it was only known that he had been some years employed in the slave trade previous to his seizing this vessel and commencing his reckless career the name by which he was known to the crew of the pirate vessel was cain and well had he chosen this appellation for had not his hand for more than three years been against every man's and every man's hand against his in person he was about six feet high with a breadth of shoulders and of chest denoting the utmost of physical force which perhaps has ever been allotted to man his features would have been handsome had they not been scarred with wounds and strange to say his eye was mild and of a soft blue his mouth was well formed and his teeth of a pearly white the hair of his head was crisped and wavy and his beard which he wore as did every person composing the crew of the pirate covered the lower part of his face in strong waving and continued curls the proportions of his body were perfect but from their vastness they became almost terrific his costume was elegant and well adapted to his form linen trousers and untanned yellow leather boots such as are made at the western isles a broad striped cotton shirt a red cashmere shawl round his waist as a sash a vest embroidered in gold tissue with a jacket of dark velvet and pendant gold buttons hanging over his left shoulder after the fashion of the mediterranean seamen a round turkish skull cap handsomely embroidered a pair of pistols and a long knife in his sash completed his attire the crew consisted in all of men of almost every nation but it was to be remarked that all those in authority were either englishmen or from the northern countries the others were chiefly spaniards and maltese still there were portuguese brazilians negroes and others who made up the complement which at the time we now speak of was increased by twenty five additional hands these were kroumen a race of blacks well known at present who inhabit the coast near cape palmas and are often employed by our men of war stationed on the coast to relieve the english seamen from duties which would be too severe to those who were not inured to the climate they are powerful athletic men good sailors of a happy merry disposition and unlike other africans will work hard fond of the english they generally speak the language sufficiently to be understood and are very glad to receive a baptism when they come on board the name first given them they usually adhere to as long as they live and you will now on the coast meet with a blucher a wellington a nelson etcetera who will wring swabs or do any other of the meanest description of work without feeling that it is discreditable to sponsorials so grand it is not to be supposed that these men had voluntarily come on board of the pirate they had been employed in some british vessels trading on the coast and had been taken out of them when the vessels were burnt and the europeans of the crews murdered they had received a promise of reward if they did their duty but not expecting it they waited for the earliest opportunity to make their escape the captain of the schooner is abaft with his glass in his hand occasionally sweeping the offing in expectation of a vessel heaving in sight the officers and crew are lying down or lounging listlessly about the decks panting with the extreme heat and impatiently waiting for the sea breeze to fan their parched foreheads with their rough beards and exposed chests and their weather beaten fierce countenances they form a group which is terrible even in repose we must now descend into the cabin of the schooner the fittings up of this apartment are simple on each side is a standing bed place against the after bulkhead is a large buffet originally intended for glass and china but now loaded with silver and gold vessels of every size and description collected by the pirate from the different ships which he had plundered the lamps are also of silver and evidently had been intended to ornament the shrine of some catholic saint in this cabin there are two individuals to whom we shall now direct the reader's attention the one is a pleasant countenanced good humoured krouman who had been christened pompey the great most probably on account of his large proportions he wears a pair of duck trousers the rest of his body is naked and presents a sleek glossy skin covering muscle which an anatomist or a sculptor would have viewed with admiration the other is a youth of eighteen or thereabouts with an intelligent handsome countenance evidently of european blood there is however an habitually mournful cast upon his features he is dressed much in the same way as we have described the captain but the costume hangs more gracefully upon his slender yet well formed limbs he is seated on a sofa fixed in the fore part of the cabin with a book in his hand which occasionally he refers to and then lifts his eyes from to watch the motions of the krouman who is busy in the office of steward arranging and cleaning the costly articles in the buffet massa francisco dis really fine ting said pompey holding up a splendidly embossed tankard which he had been rubbing yes replied francisco gravely it is indeed pompey how captain cain came by dis francisco shook his head and pompey put his finger up to his mouth his eyes full of meaning fixed upon francisco at this moment the personage referred to was heard descending the companion ladder pompey recommenced rubbing the silver and francisco dropped his eyes upon the book what was the tie which appeared to bind the captain to this lad was not known but as the latter had always accompanied and lived together with him it was generally supposed that he was the captain's son and he was as often designated by the crew as young cain as he was by his christian name of francisco still it was observed that latterly they had frequently been heard in altercation and that the captain was very suspicious of francisco's movements i beg i may not interrupt your conversation said cain on entering the cabin the information you may obtain from a krouman must be very important francisco made no reply but appeared to be reading his book cain's eyes passed from one to the other as if to read their thoughts pray what were you saying mr pompey me say massa captain me only tell young massa dis very fine ting ask where you get him massa francisco no tell and what might it be to you you black scoundrel cried the captain seizing the goblet and striking the man with it a blow on the head which flattened the vessel and at the same time felled the krouman powerful as he was to the deck the blood streamed as the man slowly rose stupefied and trembling from the violent concussion without saying a word he staggered out of the cabin and cain threw himself on one of the lockers in front of the standing bed place saying with a bitter smile so much for your intimates francisco rather so much for your cruelty and injustice towards an unoffending man replied francisco laying his book on the table his question was an innocent one for he knew not the particulars connected with the obtaining of that flagon and you i presume do not forget them well be it so young man but i warn you again as i have warned you often nothing but the remembrance of your mother has prevented me long before this from throwing your body to the sharks what influence my mother's memory may have over you i know not i only regret that in any way she had the misfortune to be connected with you she had the influence replied cain which a woman must have over a man when they have for years swung in the same cot but that is wearing off fast i tell you so candidly i will not even allow even her memory to check me if i find you continue your late course you have shown disaffection before the crew you have disputed my orders and i have every reason to believe that you are now plotting against me can i do otherwise than show my abhorrence replied francisco when i witness such acts of horror of cruelty cold blooded cruelty as lately have been perpetrated why do you bring me here and why do you now detain me all i ask is that you will allow me to leave the vessel you are not my father you have told me so no i am not your father but you are your mother's son that gives you no right to have power over me even if you had been married to my mother which i was not i thank god for marriage with you would have been even greater disgrace what cried cain starting up seizing the young man by the neck and lifting him off his seat as if he had been a puppet but no i cannot forget your mother cain released francisco and resumed his seat on the locker as you please said francisco as soon as he had recovered himself it matters little whether i am brained by your own hand or launched overboard as a meal for the sharks it will be but one more murder mad fool why do you tempt me thus replied cain again starting up and hastily quitting the cabin the altercation which we have just described was not unheard on deck as the doors of the cabin were open and the skylight removed to admit the air the face of cain was flushed as he ascended the ladder he perceived his chief mate standing by the hatchway and many of the men who had been slumbering abaft with their heads raised on their elbows as if they had been listening to the conversation below it will never do sir said hawkhurst the mate shaking his head no replied the captain not if he were my own son but what is to be done he knows no fear hawkhurst pointed to the entering port when i ask your advice you may give it said the captain turning gloomily away in the meantime francisco paced the cabin in deep thought young as he was he was indifferent to death for he had no tie to render life precious he remembered his mother but not her demise that had been concealed from him at the age of seven he had sailed with cain in a slaver and had ever since continued with him until lately he had been led to suppose that the captain was his father during the years that he had been in the slave trade cain had devoted much time to his education it so happened that the only book which could be found on board of the vessel when cain first commenced teaching was a bible belonging to francisco's mother out of this book he learned to read and as his education advanced other books were procured it may appear strange that the very traffic in which his reputed father was engaged did not corrupt the boy's mind but accustomed to it from his infancy he had considered these negroes as another species an idea fully warranted by the cruelty of the europeans towards them there are some dispositions so naturally kind and ingenuous that even example and evil contact cannot debase them such was the disposition of francisco as he gained in years and knowledge he thought more and more for himself and had already become disgusted with the cruelties practised upon the unfortunate negroes when the slave vessel was seized upon by cain and converted into a pirate at first the enormities committed had not been so great vessels had been seized and plundered but life had been spared in the course of crime however the descent is rapid and as from information given by those who had been released the schooner was more than once in danger of being captured latterly no lives had been spared and but too often the murders had been attended with deeds even more atrocious francisco had witnessed scenes of horror until his young blood curdled he had expostulated to save but in vain disgusted with the captain and the crew and their deeds of cruelty he had latterly expressed his opinions fearlessly and defied the captain for in the heat of an altercation cain had acknowledged that francisco was not his son had any of the crew or officers expressed but a tithe of what had fallen from the bold lips of francisco they would have long before paid the forfeit of their temerity but there was a feeling towards francisco which could not be stifled in the breast of cain it was the feeling of association and habit the boy had been his companion for years and from assuetude had become as it were a part of himself there is a principle in our nature which even when that nature is most debased will never leave us that of requiring something to love something to protect and watch over it is shown towards a dog or any other animal if it cannot be lavished upon one of our own species such was the feeling which so forcibly held cain towards francisco such was the feeling which had hitherto saved his life after having paced up and down for some time the youth took his seat on the locker which the captain had quitted his eye soon caught the head of pompey who looked into the cabin and beckoned with his finger francisco rose and taking up a flagon from the buffet which contained some spirits walked to the door and without saying a word handed it to the krouman massa francisco whispered pompey pompey say all kroumen say suppose they run away you go too pompey say all kroumen say suppose they try to kill you nebber kill you while one krouman alive the negro then gently pushed francisco back with his hand as if not wishing to hear his answer and hastened forward on the berth deck chapter eight the attack in the meantime the sea breeze had risen in the offing and was sweeping along the surface to where the schooner was at anchor the captain ordered a man to the cross trees directing him to keep a good look out while he walked the deck in company with his first mate she may not have sailed until a day or two later said the captain continuing the conversation i have made allowance for that and depend upon it as she makes the eastern passage we must soon fall in with her if she does not heave in sight this evening by daylight i shall stretch out in the offing i know the portuguese well the sea breeze has caught our craft let them run up the inner jib and see that she does not foul her anchor it was now late in the afternoon and dinner had been sent into the cabin the captain descended and took his seat at the table with francisco who ate in silence once or twice the captain whose wrath had subsided and whose kindly feelings towards francisco checked for a time had returned with greater force tried but in vain to rally him to conversation when sail ho was shouted from the mast head there she is by god cried the captain jumping from and then as if checking himself immediately resuming his seat francisco put his hand to his forehead covering his eyes as his elbow leant upon the table a large ship sir we can see down to the second reef of her topsails said hawkhurst looking down the skylight the captain hastily swallowed some wine from a flagon cast a look of scorn and anger upon francisco and rushed on deck be smart lads cried the captain after a few seconds' survey of the vessel through his glass that's her furl the awnings and run the anchor up to the bows there's more silver in that vessel my lads than your chests will hold and the good saints of the churches at goa will have to wait a little longer for their gold candlesticks the crew were immediately on the alert the awnings were furled and all the men stretching aft the spring cable walked the anchor up to the bows in two minutes more the avenger was standing out on the starboard tack shaping her course so as to cut off the ill fated vessel the breeze freshened and the schooner darted through the smooth water with the impetuosity of a dolphin after its prey in an hour the hull of the ship was plainly to be distinguished but the sun was near to the horizon and before they could ascertain what their force might be daylight had disappeared whether the schooner had been perceived or not it was impossible to say at all events the course of the ship had not been altered and if she had seen the schooner she evidently treated her with contempt on board the avenger they were not idle the long gun in the centre had been cleared from the incumbrances which surrounded it the other guns had been cast loose shot handed up and everything prepared for action with all the energy and discipline of a man of war the chase had not been lost sight of the eyes of the pirate captain were fixed upon her through a night glass in about an hour more the schooner was within a mile of the ship and now altered her course so as to range up within a cable's length of her to leeward cain stood upon the gunwale and hailed the answer was in portuguese heave to or i'll sink you replied he in the same language a general discharge from a broadside of carronades and a heavy volley of muskets from the portuguese was the decided answer the broadside too much elevated to hit the low hull of the schooner was still not without effect the foretopmast fell the jaws of the main gaff were severed and a large proportion of the standing as well as the running rigging came rattling down on her decks the volley of musketry was more fatal thirteen of the pirates were wounded some of them severely well done john portuguese cried hawkhurst by the holy poker i never gave you credit for so much pluck which they shall dearly pay for was the cool reply of cain as he still remained in his exposed situation blood for blood if i drink it observed the second mate as he looked at the crimson rivulet trickling down the fingers of his left hand from a wound in his arm just tie my handkerchief round this bill in the interim cain had desired his crew to elevate their guns and the broadside was returned that will do my lads starboard ease off the boom sheet let her go right round hawkhurst we cannot afford to lose our men the schooner wore round and ran astern of her opponent the portuguese on board the ship imagining that the schooner finding she had met with unexpected resistance had sheered off gave a loud cheer the last you will ever give my fine fellows observed cain with a sneer in a few moments the schooner had run a mile astern of the ship now then hawkhurst let her come too and about man the long gun and see that every shot is pitched into her while the rest of them get up a new foretopmast and knot and splice the rigging the schooner's head was again turned towards the ship her position was right astern about a mile distant or rather more the long pounder gun amidships was now regularly served every shot passing through the cabin windows or some other part of the ship's stern raking her fore and aft in vain did the ship alter her course and present her broadside to the schooner the latter was immediately checked in her speed so as to keep the prescribed distance at which the carronades of the ship were useless and the execution from the long gun decisive the ship was at the mercy of the pirate and as may be expected no mercy was shown for three hours did this murderous attack continue when the gun which as before observed was of brass became so heated that the pirate captain desired his men to discontinue whether the ship had surrendered or not it was impossible to say as it was too dark to distinguish while the long gun was served the foretop mast and main gaff had been shifted and all the standing and running rigging made good the schooner keeping her distance and following in the wake of the ship until daylight we must now repair on board of the ship she was an indiaman one of the very few that occasionally are sent out by the portuguese government to a country which once owned their undivided sway but in which at present they hold but a few miles of territory she was bound to goa and had on board a small detachment of troops a new governor and his two sons a bishop and his niece with her attendant the sailing of a vessel with such a freight was a circumstance of rare occurrence and was of course generally bruited about long before her departure cain had for some months received all the necessary intelligence relative to her cargo and destination but as usual with the portuguese of the present day delay upon delay had followed and it was not until about three weeks previous that he had been assured of her immediate departure he then ran down the coast to the bay we have mentioned that he might intercept her and as the event had proved showed his usual judgment and decision the fire of the schooner had been most destructive many of the indiaman's crew as well as of the troops had been mowed down one after another until at last finding that all their efforts to defend themselves were useless most of those who were still unhurt had consulted their safety and hastened down to the lowest recesses of the hold to avoid the raking and destructive shot at the time that the schooner had discontinued her fire to allow the gun to cool there was no one on deck but the portuguese captain and one old weatherbeaten seaman who stood at the helm below in the orlop deck the remainder of the crew and the passengers were huddled together in a small space some were attending to the wounded who were numerous others were invoking the saints to their assistance the bishop a tall dignified person apparently nearly sixty years of age was kneeling in the centre of the group which was dimly lighted by two or three lanterns at one time in fervent prayer at another interrupted that he might give absolution to those wounded men whose spirits were departing and who were brought down and laid before him by their comrades on one side of him knelt his orphan niece a young girl of about seventeen years of age watching his countenance as he prayed or bending down with a look of pity and tearful eyes on her expiring countrymen whose last moments were gladdened by his holy offices on the other side of the bishop stood the governor don philip de ribiera and his two sons youths in their prime and holding commissions in the king's service there was melancholy on the brow of don ribiera he was prepared for and he anticipated the worst the eldest son had his eyes fixed upon the sweet countenance of teresa de silva that very evening as they walked together on the deck had they exchanged their vows that very evening they had luxuriated in the present and had dwelt with delightful anticipation on the future but we must leave them and return on deck the captain of the portuguese ship had walked aft and now went up to antonio the old seaman who was standing at the wheel i still see her with the glass antonio and yet she has not fired for nearly two hours do you think any accident has happened to her long gun if so we may have some chance antonio shook his head we have but little chance i am afraid my captain i knew by the ring of the gun when she fired it that it was brass indeed no schooner could carry a long iron gun of that calibre depend upon it she only waits for the metal to cool and daylight to return a long gun or two might have saved us but now as she has the advantage of us in heels we are at her mercy what can she be a french privateer i trust it may be so and i have promised a silver candlestick to st antonio that it may prove no worse we then may have some chance of seeing our homes again but i fear not what then do you imagine her to be antonio the pirate which we have heard so much of jesu protect us we must then sell our lives as dearly as we can so i intend to do my captain replied antonio shifting the helm a spoke the day broke and showed the schooner continuing her pursuit at the same distance astern without any apparent movement on board it was not until the sun was some degrees above the horizon that the smoke was again seen to envelop her bows and the shot crashed through the timbers of the portuguese ship the reason for this delay was that the pirate waited till the sun was up to ascertain if there were any other vessels to be seen previous to his pouncing on his quarry the portuguese captain went aft and hoisted his ensign but no flag was shown by the schooner again whistled the ball and again did it tear up the decks of the unfortunate ship many of those who had re ascended to ascertain what was going on now hastily sought their former retreat mind the helm antonio said the portuguese captain i must go down and consult with the governor never fear my captain as long as these limbs hold together i will do my duty replied the old man exhausted as he was by long watching and fatigue the captain descended to the orlop deck where he found the major part of the crew and passengers assembled my lords said he addressing the governor and the bishop the schooner has not shown any colours although our own are hoisted i am come down to know your pleasure defence we can make none and i fear that we are at the mercy of a pirate a pirate ejaculated several beating their breasts and calling upon their saints silence my good people silence quietly observed the bishop as to what it may be best to do continued he turning to the captain i cannot advise i am a man of peace and unfit to hold a place in a council of war don ribiera i must refer the point to you and your sons tremble not my dear teresa are we not under the protection of the almighty holy virgin pity us come my sons said don ribiera we will go on deck and consult let not any of the men follow us it is useless risking lives which may yet be valuable don ribiera and his sons followed the captain to the quarter deck and with him and antonio they held a consultation we have but one chance observed the old man after a time let us haul down our colours as if in submission they will then range up alongside and either board us from the schooner or from their boats at all events we shall find out what she is and if a pirate we must sell our lives as dearly as we can if when we haul down the colours she ranges up alongside as i expect she will let all the men be prepared for a desperate struggle you are right antonio replied the governor go aft captain and haul down the colours let us see what she does now down my boys and prepare the men to do their duty as antonio had predicted so soon as the colours were hauled down the schooner ceased firing and made sail she ranged up on the quarter of the ship and up to her main peak soared the terrific black flag her broadside was poured into the indiaman and before the smoke had cleared away there was a concussion from the meeting sides and the bearded pirates poured upon her decks the crew of the portuguese with the detachment of troops still formed a considerable body of men the sight of the black flag had struck ice into every heart but the feeling was resolved into one of desperation knives men knives roared antonio rushing on to the attack followed by the most brave blood for blood cried the second mate aiming a blow at the old man you have it replied antonio as his knife entered the pirate's heart while at the same moment he fell and was himself a corpse the struggle was deadly but the numbers and ferocity of the pirates prevailed cain rushed forward followed by hawkhurst bearing down all who opposed them with one blow from the pirate captain the head of don ribiera was severed to the shoulder a second struck down the eldest son while the sword of hawkhurst passed through the body of the other the portuguese captain had already fallen and the men no longer stood their ground a general massacre ensued and the bodies were thrown overboard as fast as the men were slaughtered in less than five minutes there was not a living portuguese on the bloody decks of the ill fated ship chapter nine the capture pass the word for not a man to go below hawkhurst said the pirate captain i have sir and sentries are stationed at the hatchways shall we haul the schooner off no let her remain the breeze is faint already we shall have a calm in half an hour have we lost many men only seven that i can reckon but we have lost wallace the second mate a little promotion will do no harm replied cain take a dozen of our best men and search the ship there are others alive yet by the by send a watch on board of the schooner she is left to the mercy of the kroumen and one who is better out of her replied hawkhurst and those we find below continued the mate alive true we may else be puzzled where to find that portion of her cargo which suits us said hawkhurst going down the hatchway to collect the men who were plundering on the main deck and in the captain's cabin here you maltese up there and look well round if there is anything in sight said the captain walking aft before hawkhurst had collected the men and ordered them on board of the schooner as usual in those latitudes it had fallen a perfect calm where was francisco during this scene of blood he had remained in the cabin of the schooner cain had more than once gone down to him to persuade him to come on deck and assist at the boarding of the portuguese but in vain his sole reply to the threats and solicitations of the pirate was do with me as you please i have made up my mind you know i do not fear death as long as i remain on board of this vessel i will take no part in your atrocities if you do respect my mother's memory suffer her son to seek an honest and honourable livelihood the words of francisco were ringing in the ears of cain as he walked up and down on the quarter deck of the portuguese vessel and debased as he was he could not help thinking that the youth was his equal in animal and his superior in mental courage he was arguing in his own mind upon the course he should pursue with respect to francisco when hawkhurst made his appearance on deck followed by his men who dragged up six individuals who had escaped the massacre these were the bishop his niece a portuguese girl her attendant the supercargo of the vessel a sacristan and a servant of the ecclesiastic they were hauled along the deck and placed in a row before the captain who cast his eye upon them in severe scrutiny the bishop and his niece looked round the one proudly meeting the eye of cain although he felt that his hour was come the other carefully avoiding his gaze and glancing round to ascertain whether there were any other prisoners and if so if her betrothed was amongst them but her eye discovered not what she sought it was met only by the bearded faces of the pirate crew and the blood which bespattered the deck she covered her face with her hands bring that man forward said cain pointing to the servant who are you a servant of my lord the bishop and you continued the captain a poor sacristan attending upon my lord the bishop and you cried he to a third the supercargo of this vessel put him aside hawkhurst do you want the others inquired hawkhurst significantly no hawkhurst gave a signal to some of the pirates who led away the sacristan and the servant a stifled shriek and a heavy plunge in the water were heard a few seconds after during this time the pirate had been questioning the supercargo as to the contents of the vessel and her stowage when he was suddenly interrupted by one of the pirates who in a hurried voice stated that the ship had received several shot between wind and water and was sinking fast cain who was standing on the side of the carronade with his sword in his hand raised his arm and struck the pirate a blow on the head with the hilt which whether intended or not fractured his skull and the man fell upon the deck take that babbler for your intelligence if these men are obstinate we may have worked for nothing the crew who felt the truth of their captain's remark did not appear to object to the punishment inflicted and the body of the man was dragged away what mercy can we expect from those who show no mercy even to each other observed the bishop lifting his eyes to heaven silence cried cain who now interrogated the supercargo as to the contents of the hold the poor man answered as well as he could the plate the money for the troops where are they the money for the troops is in the spirit room but of the plate i know nothing it is in some of the cases belonging to my lord the bishop hawkhurst down at once into the spirit room and see to the money in the mean time i will ask a few questions of this reverend father and the supercargo do you want him any more no he may go the poor man fell down on his knees in thankfulness at what he considered his escape he was dragged away by the pirates and it is scarcely necessary to add that in a minute his body was torn to pieces by the sharks who scenting their prey from a distance were now playing in shoals around the two vessels the party on the quarter deck were now unperceived by the captain joined by francisco who hearing from the krouman pompey that there were prisoners still on board and amongst them two females had come over to plead the cause of mercy most reverend father observed cain after a short pause you have many articles of value in this vessel none replied the bishop except this poor girl she is indeed beyond price and will i trust soon be an angel in heaven yet is this world if what you preach be true a purgatory which must be passed through previous to arriving there and that girl may think death a blessing compared to what she may expect if you refuse to tell me what i would know you have good store of gold and silver ornaments for your churches where are they they are among the packages intrusted to my care how many may you have in all a hundred if not more will you deign to inform me where i may find what i require the gold and silver are not mine but are the property of that god to whom they have been dedicated replied the bishop answer quickly no more subterfuge good sir where is it to be found i will not tell thou blood stained man at least in this instance there shall be disappointment and the sea shall swallow up those earthly treasures to obtain which thou hast so deeply imbrued thy hands pirate i repeat it i will not tell seize that girl my lads cried cain she is yours do with her as you please save me oh save me shrieked teresa clinging to the bishop's robe the pirates advanced and laid hold of teresa francisco bounded from where he stood behind the captain and dashed away the foremost are you men cried he as the pirates retreated holy sir i honour you alas i cannot save you continued francisco mournfully yet will i try on my knees by the love you bore my mother by the affection you once bore me do not commit this horrid deed my lads continued francisco appealing to the pirates join with me and entreat your captain ye are too brave too manly to injure the helpless and the innocent above all to shed the blood of a holy man and of this poor trembling maiden there was a pause even the pirates appeared to side with francisco though none of them dared to speak the muscles of the captain's face quivered with emotion but from what source could not be ascertained at this moment the interest of the scene was heightened the girl who attended upon teresa crouched on her knees with terror had been casting her fearful eyes upon the men who composed the pirate crew suddenly she uttered a scream of delight as she discovered among them one that she well knew he was a young man about twenty five years of age with little or no beard he had been her lover in his more innocent days and she for more than a year had mourned him as dead for the vessel in which he sailed had never been heard of it had been taken by the pirate and to save his life he had joined the crew filippo filippo screamed the girl rushing into his arms mistress it is filippo and we are safe filippo instantly recognised her the sight of her brought back to his memory his days of happiness and of innocence and the lovers were clasped in each other's arms save them spare them by the spirit of my mother i charge you repeated francisco again appealing to the captain may god bless thee thou good young man said the bishop advancing and placing his hand upon francisco's head cain answered not but his broad expanded chest heaved with emotion when hawkhurst burst into the group we are too late for the money captain the water is already six feet above it we must now try for the treasure this intelligence appeared to check the current of the captain's feelings now in one word sir said he to the bishop where is the treasure trifle not or by heaven name not heaven replied the bishop you have had my answer the captain turned away and gave some directions to hawkhurst who hastened below remove that boy said cain to the pirates pointing to francisco separate those two fools continued he looking towards filippo and the girl who were sobbing in each other's arms never cried filippo throw the girl to the sharks do you hear am i to be obeyed cried cain raising his cutlass filippo started up disengaged himself from the girl and drawing his knife rushed towards the captain to plunge it in his bosom with the quickness of lightning the captain caught his uplifted hand and breaking his wrist hurled him to the deck indeed cried he with a sneer you shall not separate us said filippo attempting to rise i do not intend it my good lad replied cain lash them both together and launch them overboard this order was obeyed for the pirates not only quailed before the captain's cool courage but were indignant that his life had been attempted there was little occasion to tie the unhappy pair together they were locked so fast in each other's arms that it would have been impossible almost to separate them in this state they were carried to the entering port and cast into the sea monster cried the bishop as he heard the splash thou wilt have a heavy reckoning for this now bring these forward said cain with a savage voice the bishop and his niece were led to the gangway what dost thou see good bishop said cain pointing to the discoloured water and the rapid motion of the fins of the sharks eager in the anticipation of a further supply i see ravenous creatures after their kind replied the bishop who will in all probability soon tear asunder those poor limbs but i see no monster like thyself teresa dearest fear not there is a god an avenging god as well as a rewarding one but teresa's eyes were closed she could not look upon the scene you have your choice first torture and then your body to those sharks for your own portion and as for the girl this moment i hand her over to my crew never shrieked teresa springing from the deck and plunging into the wave there was a splash of contention the lashing of tails until the water was in a foam and then the dark colour gradually cleared away and nought was to be seen but the pure blue wave and the still unsatisfied monsters of the deep the screws the screws quick we'll have the secret from him cried the pirate captain turning to his crew who villains as they were had been shocked at this last catastrophe seize him touch him not cried francisco standing on the hammock netting touch him not if you are men boiling with rage cain let go the arm of the bishop drew his pistol and levelled it at francisco the bishop threw up the arm of cain as he fired saw that he had missed his aim and clasping his hands raised his eyes to heaven in thankfulness at francisco's escape in this position he was collared by hawkhurst whose anger overcame his discretion and who hurled him through the entering port into the sea officious fool muttered cain when he perceived what the mate had done then recollecting himself he cried seize that boy and bring him here one or two of the crew advanced to obey his orders but pompey and the kroumen who had been attentive to what was going on had collected round francisco and a scuffle ensued the pirates not being very determined nor very anxious to take francisco allowed him to be hurried away in the centre of the kroumen who bore him safely to the schooner in the meantime hawkhurst and the major part of the men on board of the ship had been tearing up the hold to obtain the valuables but without success the water had now reached above the orlop deck and all further attempts were unavailing the ship was settling fast and it became necessary to quit her and haul off the schooner that she might not be endangered by the vortex of the sinking vessel cain and hawkhurst with their disappointed crew returned on board the schooner and before they had succeeded in detaching the two vessels a cable's length the ship went down with all the treasure so coveted the indignation and rage which were expressed by the captain as he rapidly walked the deck in company with his first mate his violent gesticulation proved to the crew that there was mischief brewing francisco did not return to the cabin he remained forward with the kroumen who although but a small portion of the ship's company were known to be resolute and not to be despised it was also observed that all of them had supplied themselves with arms and were collected forward huddled together watching every motion and manoeuvre and talking rapidly in their own language the schooner was now steered to the north westward under all press of sail the sun again disappeared but francisco returned not to the cabin he went below surrounded by the kroumen who appeared to have devoted themselves to his protection once during the night hawkhurst summoned them on deck but they obeyed not the order and to the expostulation of the boatswain's mate who came down they made no reply but there were many of the pirates in the schooner who appeared to coincide with the kroumen in their regard for francisco there are shades of villainy in the most profligate of societies and among the pirate's crew some were not yet wholly debased the foul murder of a holy man the cruel fate of the beautiful teresa and the barbarous conduct of the captain towards filippo and his mistress were deeds of an atrocity to which even the most hardened were unaccustomed francisco's pleadings in behalf of mercy were at least no crime and yet they considered that francisco was doomed he was a general favourite the worst disposed of the pirates with the exception of hawkhurst if they did not love him could not forbear respecting him although at the same time they felt that if francisco remained on board the power even of cain himself would soon be destroyed for many months hawkhurst who detested the youth had been most earnest that he should be sent out of the schooner now he pressed the captain for his removal in any way as necessary for their mutual safety pointing out to cain the conduct of the kroumen and his fears that a large proportion of the ship's company were equally disaffected cain felt the truth of hawkhurst's representation and he went down to his cabin to consider upon what should be done it was past midnight when cain worn out with the conflicting passions of the day fell into an uneasy slumber his dreams were of francisco's mother she appeared to him pleading for her son and cain babbled in his sleep at this time francisco with pompey had softly crawled aft that they might obtain if they found the captain asleep the pistols of francisco with some ammunition pompey slipped in first and started back when he heard the captain's voice they remained at the cabin door listening no no murmured cain he must die useless plead not woman i know i murdered thee plead not he dies in one of the sockets of the silver lamp there was a lighted wick the rays of which were sufficient to afford a dim view of the cabin francisco overhearing the words of cain stepped in and walked up to the side of the bed boy plead not continued cain lying on his back and breathing heavily plead not woman to morrow he dies a pause ensued as if the sleeping man was listening to a reply yes as i murdered thee so will i murder him wretch said francisco in a low solemn voice didst thou kill my mother i did i did responded cain still sleeping and why continued francisco who at this acknowledgment on the part of the sleeping captain was careless of discovery in my mood she vexed me answered cain fiend thou hast then confessed it cried francisco in a loud voice which awoke the captain who started up but before his senses were well recovered or his eyes open so as to distinguish their forms pompey struck out the light and all was darkness he then put his hand to francisco's mouth and led him out of the cabin who's there who's there cried cain the officer in charge of the deck hastened down did you call sir call repeated the captain i thought there was some one in the cabin i want a light that's all continued he recovering himself as he wiped the cold perspiration from his forehead in the meantime francisco with pompey had gained his former place of refuge with the kroumen the feelings of the young man changed from agony to revenge his object in returning to the cabin to recover his weapons had been frustrated but his determination now was to take the life of the captain if he possibly could the following morning the kroumen again refused to work or go on deck and the state of affairs was reported by hawkhurst to his chief the mate now assumed another tone for he had sounded not the majority but the most steady and influential men on board who like himself were veterans in crime it must be sir or you will no longer command this vessel i am desired to say so indeed replied cain with a sneer perhaps you have already chosen my successor hawkhurst perceived that he had lost ground and he changed his manner i speak but for yourself if you do not command this vessel i shall not remain in her if you quit her i quit also and we must find another cain was pacified and the subject was not renewed turn the hands up at last said the captain the pirate crew assembled aft my lads i am sorry that our laws oblige me to make an example but mutiny and disaffection must be punished i am equally bound as yourselves by the laws which we have laid down for our guidance while we sail together and you may believe that in doing my duty in this instance i am guided by a sense of justice and wish to prove to you that i am worthy to command francisco has been with me since he was a child he has lived with me and it is painful to part with him but i am here to see that our laws are put in force he has been guilty of repeated mutiny and contempt and he must die death death cried several of the pirates in advance death and justice no more murder said several voices from behind who's that that speaks too much murder yesterday no more murder shouted several voices at once let the men come forward who speak cried cain with a withering look no one obeyed this order down then my men and bring up francisco the whole of the pirate crew hastened below but with different intentions some were determined to seize francisco and hand him over to death others to protect him a confused noise was heard the shouts of down and seize him opposed to those of no murder no murder both parties had snatched up their arms those who sided with francisco joined the kroumen whilst the others also hastened below to bring him on deck a slight scuffle ensued before they separated and ascertained by the separation the strength of the contending parties francisco perceiving that he was joined by a large body desired his men to follow him went up the fore ladder and took possession of the forecastle the pirates on his side supplied him with arms and francisco stood forward in advance hawkhurst and those of the crew who sided with him had retreated to the quarter deck and rallied round the captain who leaned against the capstern they were then able to estimate their comparative strength the number on the whole preponderated in favour of francisco but on the captain's side were the older and more athletic of the crew and we may add the more determined still the captain and hawkhurst perceived the danger of their situation and it was thought advisable to parley for the present and wreak their vengeance hereafter for a few minutes there was a low consultation between both parties at last cain advanced my lads said he addressing those who had rallied round francisco i little thought that a fire brand would have been cast in this vessel to set us all at variance it was my duty as your captain to propose that our laws should be enforced tell me now what is it that you wish i am only here as your captain and to take the sense of the whole crew i have no animosity against that lad i have loved him i have cherished him but like a viper he has stung me in return instead of being in arms against each other ought we not to be united i have therefore one proposal to make to you which is this let the sentence go by vote or ballot if you please and whatever the sentence may be i shall be guided by it can i say more my lads replied francisco when the captain had done speaking i think it better that you should accept this proposal rather than that blood should be shed my life is of little consequence say then will you agree to the vote and submit to those laws which as the captain says have been laid down to regulate the discipline of the vessel the pirates on francisco's side looked round among their party and perceiving that they were the most numerous consented to the proposal but hawkhurst stepped forward and observed of course the kroumen can have no votes as they do not belong to the vessel this objection was important as they amounted to twenty five and after that number was deducted in all probability francisco's adherents would have been in the minority the pirates with francisco objected and again assumed the attitude of defence one moment said francisco stepping in advance before this point is settled i wish to take the sense of all of you as to another of your laws i ask you hawkhurst and all who are now opposed to me whether you have not one law which is blood for blood yes yes shouted all the pirates then let your captain stand forward and answer to my charge if he dares cain curled his lip in derision and walked within two yards of francisco well boy i'm here and what is your charge first i ask you captain cain who are so anxious that the laws should be enforced whether you acknowledge that blood for blood' is a just law most just and when shed the party who revenges is not amenable 'tis well then villain that thou art answer didst thou not murder my mother cain at this accusation started answer the truth or lie like a recreant repeated francisco did you not murder my mother the captain's lips and the muscles of his face quivered but he did not reply blood for blood cried francisco as he fired his pistol at cain who staggered and fell on the deck hawkhurst and several of the pirates hastened to the captain and raised him she must have told him last night said cain speaking with difficulty as the blood flowed from the wound he told me so himself said francisco turning round to those who stood by him cain was taken down into the cabin on examination his wound was not mortal although his loss of blood had been rapid and very great in a few minutes hawkhurst joined the party on the quarter deck he found that the tide had turned more in francisco's favour than he had expected the law of blood for blood was held most sacred indeed it was but the knowledge that it was solemnly recognised and that if one pirate wounded another the other was at liberty to take his life without punishment which prevented constant affrays between parties whose knives would otherwise have been the answer to every affront it was a more debased law of duelling which kept such profligate associates on good terms finding therefore that this feeling predominated even among those who were opposed to francisco on the other question hawkhurst thought it advisable to parley hawkhurst said francisco i have but one request to make which if complied with will put an end to this contention it is that you will put me on shore at the first land that we make if you and your party engage to do this i will desire those who support me to return to their obedience i grant it replied hawkhurst and so will the others will you not my men agreed agreed upon all sides cried the pirates throwing away their weapons and mingling with each other as if they had never been opposed there is an old saying that there is honour amongst thieves and so it often proves every man in the vessel knew that this agreement would be strictly adhered to and francisco now walked the deck with as much composure as if nothing had occurred hawkhurst who was aware that he must fulfil his promise carefully examined the charts when he went down below came up and altered the course of the schooner two points more to the northward the next morning he was up at the mast head nearly half an hour when he descended and again altered the course by nine o'clock a low sandy island appeared on the lee bow when within half a mile of it he ordered the schooner to be hove to and lowered down the small boat from the stern he then turned the hands up my lads we must keep our promise to put francisco on shore at the first land which we made there it is and a malicious smile played on the miscreant's features as he pointed out to them the barren sand bank which promised nothing but starvation and a lingering death several of the crew murmured but hawkhurst was supported by his own party and had moreover taken the precaution quietly to remove all the arms with the exception of those with which his adherents were provided an agreement is an agreement it is what he requested himself and we promised to perform send for francisco i am here hawkhurst and i tell you candidly that desolate as is that barren spot i prefer it to remaining in your company i will bring my chest up immediately no no that was not a part of the agreement cried hawkhurst every man here has a right to his own property i appeal to the whole of the crew true true replied the pirates and hawkhurst found himself again in the minority be it so the chest of francisco was handed into the boat is that all cried hawkhurst my lads am i to have no provisions or water inquired francisco no replied hawkhurst yes yes cried most of the pirates hawkhurst did not dare put it to the vote he turned sulkily away the kroumen brought up two breakers of water and some pieces of pork here massa said pompey putting into francisco's hand a fishing line with hooks thank you pompey but i had forgot that book in the cabin you know which i mean pompey nodded his head and went below but it was some time before he returned during which hawkhurst became impatient it was a very small boat which had been lowered down it had a lug sail and two pair of sculls in it and was quite full when francisco's chest and the other articles had been put in come i have no time to wait said hawkhurst in the boat francisco shook hands with many of the crew and wished all of them farewell indeed now that they beheld the poor lad about to be cast on the desolate island even those most opposed to him felt some emotions of pity although they acknowledged that his absence was necessary yet they knew his determined courage and with them that quality was always a strong appeal who will row this lad ashore and bring the boat off not i replied one it would haunt me ever afterwards so they all appeared to think for no one volunteered francisco jumped into the boat there is no room for any one but me and i will row myself on shore cried he farewell my lads farewell stop not so he must not have the boat he may escape from the island cried hawkhurst and why shouldn't he poor fellow replied the men let him have the boat yes yes let him have the boat and hawkhurst was again overruled here massa francisco here de book what's that sir cried hawkhurst snatching the book out of pompey's hand him massa bible francisco waited for the book shove off cried hawkhurst give me my book mr hawkhurst no replied the malignant rascal tossing the bible over the taffrail he shall not have that i've heard say that there is consolation in it for the afflicted francisco shoved off his boat and seizing his sculls pushed astern picked up the book which still floated and laid it to dry on the after thwart of the boat he then pulled in for the shore in the meantime the schooner had let draw her fore sheet and had already left him a quarter of a mile astern before francisco had gained the sand bank she was hull down to the northward chapter ten the sand bank the first half hour that francisco was on this desolate spot he watched the receding schooner his thoughts were unconnected and vague wandering through the various scenes which had passed on the decks of that vessel and recalling to his memory the different characters of those on board of her much as he had longed to quit her disgusted as he had been with those with whom he had been forced to associate still as her sails grew fainter and fainter to his view as she increased her distance he more than once felt that even remaining on board of her would have been preferable to his present deserted lot no no exclaimed he after a little further reflection i had rather perish here than continue to witness the scenes which i have been forced to behold he once more fixed his eyes upon her white sails and then sat down on the loose sand and remained in deep and melancholy reverie until the scorching heat reminded him of his situation he afterwards rose and turned his thoughts upon his present situation and to what would be the measures most advisable to take he hauled his little boat still farther on the beach and attached the painter to one of the oars which he fixed deep in the sand he then proceeded to survey the bank and found that but a small portion was uncovered at high water for trifling as was the rise of the tide the bank was so low that the water flowed almost over it the most elevated part was not more than fifteen feet above high water mark and that was a small knoll of about fifty feet in circumference to this part he resolved to remove his effects he returned to the boat and having lifted out his chest the water the provisions with the other articles which he had obtained he dragged them up one by one until they were all collected at the spot he had chosen he then took out of the boat the oars and little sail which fortunately had remained in her his last object to haul the little boat up to the same spot was one which demanded all his exertion but after considerable fatigue he contrived by first lifting round her bow and then her stern to effect his object tired and exhausted he then repaired to one of the breakers of water and refreshed himself the heat as the day advanced had become intolerable but it stimulated him to fresh exertion he turned over the boat and contrived that the bow and stern should rest upon two little hillocks so as to raise it above the level of the sand beneath it two or three feet he spread out the sail from the keel above with the thole pins as pegs so as to keep off the rays of the sun dragging the breakers of water and the provisions underneath the boat he left his chest outside and having thus formed for himself a sort of covering which would protect him from the heat of the day and the damp of the night he crept in to shelter himself until the evening although francisco had not been on deck he knew pretty well whereabouts he then was taking out a chart from his chest he examined the coast to ascertain the probable distance which he might be from any prospect of succour he calculated that he was on one of a patch of sand banks off the coast of loango and about seven hundred miles from the isle of st thomas the nearest place where he might expect to fall in with a european face from the coast he felt certain that he could not be more than forty or fifty miles at the most but could he trust himself among the savage natives who inhabited it he knew how ill they had been treated by europeans for at that period it was quite as common for the slave trader to land and take away the inhabitants as slaves by force as to purchase them in the more northern territories still he might be fortunate enough to fall in with some trader on the coast as there were a few who still carried on a barter for gold dust and ivory we do not know we cannot conceive a situation much more deplorable than the one we have just described to have been that of francisco alone without a chance of assistance with only a sufficiency of food for a few days and cut off from the rest of his fellow creatures with only so much terra firma as would prevent his being swallowed up by the vast unfathomable ocean into which the horizon fell on every side around him and his chance of escape how small hundreds of miles from any from whom he might expect assistance and the only means of reaching them a small boat a mere cockleshell which the first rough gale would inevitably destroy such indeed were the first thoughts of francisco but he soon recovered from his despondency he was young courageous and buoyant with hope and there is a feeling of pride of trust in our own resources and exertions which increases and stimulates us in proportion to our danger and difficulty it is the daring of the soul proving its celestial origin and eternal duration so intense was the heat that francisco almost panted for sufficient air to support life as he lay under the shade of the boat during the whole of that day not a breath of wind disturbed the glassy wave all nature appeared hushed into one horrible calm it was not until the shades of night were covering the solitude that francisco ventured forth from his retreat but he found little relief there was an unnatural closeness in the air a suffocation unusual even in those climes francisco cast his eyes up to the vault of heaven and was astonished to find that there were no stars visible a grey mist covered the whole firmament he directed his view downwards to the horizon and that too was not to be defined there was a dark bank all around it he walked to the edge of the sand bank there was not even a ripple the wide ocean appeared to be in a trance in a state of lethargy or stupor he parted the hair from his feverish brow and once more surveying the horrible lifeless stagnant waste his soul sickened and he cast himself upon the sand there he lay for many hours in a state bordering upon wild despair at last he recovered himself and rising to his knees he prayed for strength and submission to the will of heaven when he was once more upon his feet and had again scanned the ocean he perceived that there was a change rapidly approaching the dark bank on the horizon had now risen higher up the opaqueness was everywhere more dense and low murmurs were heard as if there was wind stirring aloft although the sea was still glassy as a lake signs of some movement about to take place were evident and the solitary youth watched and watched and now the sounds increased and here and there a wild thread of air whence coming who could tell and as rapidly disappearing would ruffle for a second a portion of the stagnant sea then came whizzing sounds and moans and then the rumbling noise of distant thunder loud and louder yet still louder a broad black line is seen sweeping along the expanse of water fearful in its rapidity it comes and the hurricane burst at once and with all its force and all its terrific sounds upon the isolated francisco the first blast was so powerful and so unexpected that it threw him down and prudence dictated to him to remain in that position for the loose sand was swept off and whirled in such force as to blind and prevent his seeing a foot from him he would have crawled to the boat for security but he knew not in which direction to proceed but this did not last for now the water was borne up upon the strong wings of the hurricane and the sand was rendered firm by its saturation with the element francisco felt that he was drenched and he raised his head all he could discover was that the firmament was mantled with darkness horrible from its intensity and that the sea was in one extended foam boiling everywhere and white as milk but still smooth as if the power of the wind had compelled it to be so but the water had encroached and one half the sand bank was covered with it while over the other the foam whirled each portion chasing the other with wild rapidity and now the windows of heaven were opened and the rain mingled with the spray caught up by the hurricane was dashed and hurled upon the forlorn youth who still lay where he had been first thrown down but of a sudden a wash of water told him that he could remain there no longer the sea was rising rising fast and before he could gain a few paces on his hands and knees another wave as if it chased him in its wrath repeated the warning of his extreme danger and he was obliged to rise on his feet and hasten to the high part of the sand bank where he had drawn up his boat and his provisions blinded as he was by the rain and spray he could distinguish nothing of a sudden he fell violently he had stumbled over one of the breakers of water and his head struck against a sea chest where then was the boat it was gone it must have been swept away by the fury of the wind alas then all chance was over and if not washed away by the angry waters he had but to prolong his existence but a few days and then to die the effect of the blow he had received on his forehead with the shock of mind occasioned by the disappearance of the boat overpowered him and he remained for some time in a state of insensibility when francisco recovered the scene was again changed the wide expanse was now in a state of wild and fearful commotion and the water roared as loud as did the hurricane the whole sand bank with the exception of that part on which he stood was now covered with tumultuous foam and his place of refuge was occasionally invaded when some vast mass o'erlording the other waves expended all its fury even to his feet francisco prepared to die but gradually the darkness of the heavens disappeared and there was no longer a bank upon the horizon and francisco hoped alas hoped what that he might be saved from the present impending death to be reserved for one still more horrible to be saved from the fury of the waves which would swallow him up and in a few seconds remove him from all pain and suffering to perish for want of sustenance under a burning sun to be withered to be parched to death calling in his agony for water and as francisco thought of this he covered his face with his hands and prayed oh god thy will be done but in thy mercy raise still higher raise the waters but the waters did not rise higher the howling of the wind gradually decreased and the foaming seas had obeyed the divine injunction they had gone so far but no farther and the day dawned and the sky cleared and the first red tints announcing the return of light and heat had appeared on the broken horizon when the eyes of the despairing youth were directed to a black mass on the tumultuous waters it was a vessel with but one mast standing rolling heavily and running before the gale right on for the sand bank where he stood her hull one moment borne aloft and the next disappearing from his view in the hollow of the agitated waters she will be dashed to pieces thought francisco she will be lost they cannot see the bank and he would have made a signal to her if he had been able to warn her of her danger forgetting at the time his own desolate situation as francisco watched the sun rose bright and joyous over this scene of anxiety and pain on came the vessel flying before the gale while the seas chased her as if they would fain overwhelm her it was fearful to see her scud agonising to know that she was rushing to destruction at last he could distinguish those on board he waved his hand but they perceived him not he shouted but his voice was borne away by the gale on came the vessel as if doomed she was within two cables' length of the bank when those on board perceived their danger it was too late they had rounded her to another and another wave hurled her towards the sand she struck her only remaining mast fell over the side and the roaring waves hastened to complete their work of destruction and of death chapter eleven the escape francisco's eyes were fixed upon the vessel over which the sea now broke with terrific violence there appeared to be about eight or nine men on her deck who sheltered themselves under the weather bulwarks each wave as it broke against her side and then dashed in foam over her threw her with a convulsive jerk still further on the sand bank at last she was so high up that their fury was partly spent before they dashed against her frame had the vessel been strong and well built had she been a collier coasting the english shores there was a fair chance that she might have withstood the fury of the storm until it had subsided and that by remaining on board the crew might have survived but she was of a very different mould and as francisco justly surmised an american brig built for swift sailing very sharp and moreover very slightly put together francisco's eyes as may easily be supposed were never removed from the only object which could now interest him the unexpected appearance and imminent danger of his fellow creatures at this desolate spot he perceived that two of the men went to the hatches and slid them over to leeward they then descended and although the seas broke over the vessel and a large quantity of water must have poured into her the hatches were not put on again by those who remained on deck but in a few minutes this mystery was solved one after another at first and then by dozens poured forth out of the hold the kidnapped africans who composed her cargo in a short time the decks were covered with them the poor creatures had been released by the humanity of two english sailors that they might have the same chance with themselves of saving their lives still no attempt was made to quit the vessel huddled together like a flock of sheep with the wild waves breaking over them there they all remained both european and african and as the heavy blows of the seas upon the sides of the vessel careened and shook her they were seen to cling in every direction with no distinction between the captured and their oppressors but this scene was soon changed the frame of the vessel could no longer withstand the violence of the waves and as francisco watched of a sudden it was seen to divide a midships and each portion to turn over then was the struggle for life hundreds were floating on the raging element and wrestling for existence and the white foam of the ocean was dotted by the black heads of the negroes who attempted to gain the bank it was an awful terrible scene to witness so many at one moment tossed and dashed about by the waves so many fellow beings threatened with eternity at one moment they were close to the beach forced on to it by some tremendous wave at the next the receding water and the undertow swept them all back and of the many who had been swimming one half had disappeared to rise no more francisco watched with agony as he perceived that the number decreased and that none had yet gained the shore at last he snatched up the haulyards of his boat's sail which were near him and hastened down to the spot to afford such succour as might be possible nor were his efforts in vain as the seas washed the apparently inanimate bodies on shore and would then have again swept them away to return them in mockery he caught hold of them and dragged them safe on the bank and thus did he continue his exertions until fifteen of the bodies of the negroes were spread upon the beach although exhausted and senseless they were not dead and long before he had dragged up the last of the number many of those previously saved had without any other assistance than the heat of the sun recovered from their insensibility francisco would have continued his task of humanity but the parted vessel had now been riven into fragments by the force of the waves and the whole beach was strewed with her timbers and her stores which were dashed on shore by the waters and then swept back again by the return in a short time the severe blows he received from these fragments disabled him from further exertion and he sank exhausted on the sand indeed all further attempts were useless all on board the vessel had been launched into the sea at the same moment and those who were not now on shore were past all succour francisco walked up to those who had been saved he found twelve of them were recovered and sitting on their hams the rest were still in a state of insensibility he then went up to the knoll where his chest and provisions had been placed and throwing himself down by them surveyed the scene the wind had lulled the sun shone brightly and the sea was much less violent the waves had subsided and no longer hurried on by the force of the hurricane broke majestically and solemnly but not with the wildness and force which but a few hours before they had displayed the whole of the beach was strewed with the fragments of the vessel with spars and water casks and at every moment was to be observed the corpse of a negro turning round and round in the froth of the wave and then disappearing for an hour did he watch and reflect and then he walked again to where the men who had been rescued were sitting not more than thirty yards from him they were sickly emaciated forms but belonging to a tribe who inhabited the coast and who having been accustomed from their infancy to be all the day in the water had supported themselves better than the other slaves who had been procured from the interior or the european crew of the vessel all of whom had perished the africans appeared to recover fast by the heat of the sun so oppressive to francisco and were now exchanging a few words with each other the whole of them had revived but those who were most in need of aid were neglected by the others francisco made signs to them but they understood him not he returned to the knoll and pouring out water into a tin pan from the breaker brought it down to them he offered it to one who seized it eagerly water was a luxury seldom obtained in the hold of a slave vessel the man drank deeply and would have drained the cup but francisco prevented him and held it to the lips of another he was obliged to refill it three times before they had all been supplied he then brought them a handful of biscuit and left them for he reflected that without some precautions the whole sustenance would be seized by them and devoured he buried half a foot deep and covered over with sand the breakers of water and the provisions and by the time he had finished this task unperceived by the negroes who still squatted together the sun had sunk below the horizon francisco had already matured his plans which were to form a raft out of the fragments of the vessel and with the assistance of the negroes attempt to gain the mainland he lay down for the second night on this eventful spot of desolation and commending himself to the almighty protection was soon in a deep slumber it was not until the powerful rays of the sun blazed on the eyes of the youth that he awoke so tired had he been with the anxiety and fatigue of the preceding day and the sleepless harrowing night which had introduced it he rose and seated himself upon his sea chest how different was the scene from that of yesterday again the ocean slept the sky was serene and not a cloud to be distinguished throughout the whole firmament the horizontal line was clear even and well defined a soft breeze just rippled over the dark blue sea which now had retired to its former boundary and left the sand bank as extended as when first francisco had been put on shore but here the beauty of the landscape terminated the foreground was horrible to look upon the whole of the beach was covered with the timbers of the wreck with water casks and other articles in some parts heaped and thrown up one upon another and among them lay jammed and mangled the bodies of the many who had perished in other parts there were corpses thrown up high and dry or still rolling and turning to the rippling wave it was a scene of desolation and of death the negroes who had been saved were all huddled up together apparently in deep sleep and francisco quitted his elevated position and walked down to the low beach to survey the means which the disaster of others afforded him for his own escape to his great joy he found not only plenty of casks but many of them full of fresh water provisions also in sufficiency and indeed everything that could be required to form a raft as well as the means of support for a considerable time for himself and the negroes who had survived he then walked up to them and called to them but they answered not nor even moved he pushed them but in vain and his heart beat quick for he was fearful that they were dead from previous exhaustion he applied his foot to one of them and it was not until he had used force which in any other case he would have dispensed with that the negro awoke from his state of lethargy and looked vacantly about him francisco had some little knowledge of the language of the kroumen and he addressed the negro in that tongue to his great joy he was answered in a language which if not the same had so great an affinity to it that communication became easy with the assistance of the negro who used still less ceremony with his comrades the remainder of them were awakened and a palaver ensued francisco soon made them understand that they were to make a raft and go back to their own country explaining to them that if they remained there the water and provisions would soon be exhausted and they would all perish the poor creatures hardly knew whether to consider him a supernatural being or not they talked among themselves they remarked at his having brought them fresh water the day before they knew that he did not belong to the vessel in which they had been wrecked and they were puzzled whatever might be their speculations they had one good effect which was that they looked upon the youth as a superior and a friend and most willingly obeyed him he led them up to the knoll and desiring them to scrape away the sand supplied them again with fresh water and biscuit perhaps the very supply and the way in which it was given to them excited their astonishment as much as anything francisco ate with them and selecting from his sea chest the few tools in his possession desired them to follow him the casks were collected and rolled up the empty ones arranged for the raft the spars were hauled up and cleared of the rigging which was carefully separated for lashings the one or two sails which had been found rolled up on the spars were spread out to dry and the provisions and articles of clothing which might be useful laid together on one side the negroes worked willingly and showed much intelligence before the evening closed everything which might be available was secured and the waves now only tossed about lifeless forms and the small fragments of timber which could not be serviceable it would occupy too much time were we to detail all the proceedings of francisco and the negroes for the space of four days during which they laboured hard necessity is truly the mother of invention and many were the ingenious resources of the party before they could succeed in forming a raft large enough to carry them and their provisions with a mast and sail well secured at length it was accomplished and on the fifth day francisco and his men embarked and having pushed clear of the bank with poles they were at last able to hoist their sail to a fine breeze and steer for the coast before the wind at the rate of about three miles an hour but it was not until they had gained half a mile from the bank that they were no longer annoyed by the dreadful smell arising from the putrefaction of so many bodies for to bury them all would have been a work of too great time the last two days of their remaining on the island the effluvia had become so powerful as to be a source of the greatest horror and disgust even to the negroes but before night when the raft was about eight leagues from the sand bank it fell calm and continued so for the next day when a breeze sprang up from the south east to which they trimmed their sail with their head to the northward this wind and the course steered sent them off from the land but there was no help for it and francisco felt grateful that they had such an ample supply of provisions and water as to enable them to yield to a few days' contrary wind without danger of want but the breeze continued steady and fresh and they were now crossing the bight of benin the weather was fine and the sea smooth the flying fish rose in shoals and dropped down into the raft which still forced its way through the water to the northward thus did francisco and his negro crew remain for a fortnight floating on the wide ocean without any object meeting their view day after day it was the same dreary sky and water and by the reckoning of francisco they could not be far from the land when on the fifteenth day they perceived two sails to the northward francisco's heart bounded with joy and gratitude to heaven he had no telescope to examine them but he steered directly for them and about dark he made them out to be a ship and a schooner hove to as francisco scanned them surmising what they might be the sun set behind the two vessels and after it had sunk below the horizon their forms were for a few minutes delineated with remarkable precision and clearness there could be no mistake francisco felt convinced that the schooner was the avenger and his first impulse was to run to the sweep with which they were steered and put the head of the raft again to the northward a moment's reflection determined him to act otherwise he lowered down his sail that he might escape observation and watched the motions of the vessels during the few minutes of light which remained that the ship had been captured and that her capture had been attended with the usual scene of outrage and violence he had no doubt he was now about four miles from them and just as they were vanishing from his straining eyes he perceived that the schooner had made all sail to the westward francisco feeling that he was then secure from being picked up by her again hoisted his sail with the hope of reaching the ship which if not scuttled he intended to remove on board of and then make sail for the first port on the coast but hardly had the raft regained her way when the horizon was lighted up and he perceived that the pirates had set fire to the vessel then it was useless to proceed towards her and francisco again thought of putting the head of the raft to the northward when the idea struck him knowing the character and cruelty of the pirates that there might be some unfortunate people left on board to perish in the flames he therefore continued his course watching the burning vessel the flames increased in violence mounting up to the masts and catching the sails one after another the wind blew fresh and the vessel was kept before the wind a circumstance that assured francisco that there were people on board at first she appeared to leave the raft but as her sails one after another were consumed by the element so did she decrease her speed and francisco in about an hour was close to her and under her counter the ship was now one mass of fire from her bows to her mainmast a volume of flame poured from her main hold rising higher than her lower masts and ending in a huge mass of smoke carried by the wind ahead of her the quarter deck was still free from fire but the heat on it was so intense that those on board were all collected at the taffrail and there they remained some violent others in mute despair for the avenger's people in their barbarity had cut away and destroyed all the boats to prevent their escape from the light thrown round the vessel those on board had perceived the approach of francisco to their rescue and immediately that it was under the counter and the sail lowered almost all of them had descended by ropes or the stern ladder and gained a place in her in a few minutes without scarcely an exchange of a word they were all out of the brig and francisco pushed off just as the flames burst from the cabin windows darting out in a horizontal line like the tongues of fiery serpents the raft now encumbered with twelve more persons was then steered to the northward and as soon as those who had been saved had been supplied with some water which they so much needed francisco obtained the intelligence which he desired the ship was from carthagena south america had sailed from thence to lisbon with a don cumanos who had large property up the magdalen river he had wished to visit a part of his family at lisbon and from thence had sailed to the canary isles where he also had property in their way from lisbon to south america they had been beaten by stress of weather to the southward and afterwards had been chased by the avenger being a very fast sailer she had run down several degrees before she had been captured when the pirate took possession and found that she had little or no cargo of value to them for her hold was chiefly filled with furniture and other articles for the use of don cumanos angry at their disappointment they had first destroyed all their boats and then set fire to the vessel taking care not to leave her until all chance of the fire being put out was hopeless and thus had these miscreants left innocent and unfortunate people to perish francisco heard the narrative of don cumanos and then informed him in what manner he had left the schooner and his subsequent adventures francisco was now very anxious to make the land or obtain succour from some vessel the many who were now on board and the time that he had already been at sea obliged him to reduce the allowance of water fortune favoured him after all his trials on the third day a vessel hove in sight and they were seen by her she made sail for them and took them all on board it was a schooner trafficking on the coast for gold dust and ivory but the magnificent offers of don cumanos induced them to give up their voyage and run across the atlantic to carthagena to francisco it was of little moment where he went and in don cumanos he had found a sincere friend you have been my preserver said the spaniard allow me to return the obligation come and live with me as francisco was equally pleased with don cumanos he accepted the offer they all arrived safely at carthagena and from thence proceeded to his estate on the magdalen river chapter twelve the lieutenant when we last mentioned edward templemore we stated that he was a lieutenant of the admiral's ship on the west india station commanding the tender now the name of the tender was the enterprise and it was singular that she was one of two schooners built at baltimore remarkable for their beauty and good qualities yet how different were their employments both had originally been built for the slave trade now one hoisted the english pennant and cruised as the enterprise the other threw out the black flag and scoured the seas as the avenger the enterprise was fitted much in the same way as we have already described her sister vessel that is with one long brass gun amidships and smaller ones for her broadside but in the numbers of their crew there was a great disparity the enterprise not being manned with more than sixty five english sailors belonging to the admiral's ship she was employed as most admirals' tenders usually were sometimes carrying a tender made for a supply of provisions or a tender of services if required from the admiral or if not particularly wanted with the important charge of a tender billet doux to some fair friend but this is a tender subject to touch upon in the meantime it must be understood that she had the same commission to sink burn and destroy as all other of his majesty's vessels if anything came in her way but as she usually carried despatches the real importance of which were of course unknown she was not to go out of her way upon such service edward templemore did however occasionally go a little out of his way and had lately captured a very fine privateer after a smart action for which he anticipated his promotion but the admiral thought him too young and therefore gave the next vacancy to his own nephew who the admiral quite forgot was much younger edward laughed when he heard of it upon his arrival at port royal and the admiral who expected that he would make his appearance pouting with disappointment when he came up to the penn to report himself was so pleased with his good humour that he made a vow that templemore should have the next vacancy but this he also quite forgot because edward happened to be at the time it occurred on a long cruise and out of sight out of mind is a proverb so well established that it may be urged as an excuse for a person who had so many other things to think of as the admiral entrusted with the command of the west india station lieutenant templemore had in consequence commanded the enterprise for nearly two years and without grumbling for he was of a happy disposition and passed a very happy sort of life mr witherington was very indulgent to him and allowed him to draw liberally he had plenty of money for himself or for a friend who required it and he had plenty of amusement amongst other diversions he had fallen most desperately in love for in one of his trips to the leeward isles so called from their being to windward he had succoured a spanish vessel which had on board the new governor of porto rico with his family and had taken upon himself to land them on that island in safety for which service the english admiral received a handsome letter concluding with the moderate wish that his excellency might live a thousand years and edward templemore an invitation to go and see them whenever he might pass that way which like most general invitations was as much a compliment as the wish which wound up the letter to the admiral it did however so happen that the spanish governor had a very beautiful and only daughter carefully guarded by a duenna and a monk who was the depository of all the sins of the governor's establishment and it was with this daughter that edward templemore fell into the heresy of love she was indeed very beautiful and like all her countrywomen was ardent in her affection the few days that she was on board the schooner with her father during the time that the enterprise convoyed the spanish vessel into port were quite sufficient to ignite two such inflammable beings as clara d'alfarez and edward templemore the monk had been left on board of the leaky vessel there was no accommodation in the schooner for him or the duenna and don felix de maxos de cobas de manilla d'alfarez was too busy with his cigar to pay attention to his daughter when they were landed edward templemore was asked to their residence which was not in the town but at a lovely bay on the south side of the island the town mansion was appropriated to business and the ceremony of the court it was too hot for a permanent abode and the governor only went there for a few hours each day edward templemore remained a short time at the island and at his departure received the afore mentioned letter from the father to the english admiral and an assurance of unalterable fidelity from the daughter to the english lieutenant on his return he presented the letter and the admiral was satisfied with his conduct when ordered out to cruise which he always was when there was nothing else to do he submitted to the admiral whether if he should happen to be near porto rico he could not leave an answer to the spanish governor's letter and the admiral who knew the value of keeping up a good understanding with foreign relations took the hint and gave him one to deliver if convenient the second meeting was as may be supposed more cordial than the first on the part of the young lady not so however on the part of the duenna and holy friar who soon found out that their charge was in danger from heretical opinions caution became necessary and as secrecy adds a charm to an amour clara received a long letter and a telescope from edward the letter informed her that whenever he could he would make his appearance in his schooner off the south of the island and await a signal made by her at a certain window acknowledging her recognition of his vessel on the night of that signal he would land in his boat and meet her at an appointed spot this was all very delightful and it so happened that edward had four or five times contrived during the last year to meet clara without discovery and again and again to exchange his vows it was agreed between them that when he quitted the station she would quit her father and her home and trust her future happiness to an englishman and a heretic it may be a matter of surprise to some of our readers that the admiral should not have discovered the frequent visits of the enterprise to porto rico as edward was obliged to bring his log for examination every time that he returned but the admiral was satisfied with edward's conduct and his anxiety to cruise when there was nothing else for him to do his logs were brought on shore to the admiral's secretary carefully rolled and sealed up the admiral's secretary threw the packages on one side and thought no more of the matter and edward had always a ready story to tell when he took his seat at the admiral's dinner table besides he is a very unfit person to command a vessel who does not know how to write a log that will bear an investigation a certain latitude is always allowed in every degree of latitude as well as longitude the enterprise had been despatched to antigua and edward thought this an excellent opportunity to pay a visit to clara d'alfarez he therefore upon his return hove to off the usual headland and soon perceived the white curtain thrown out of the window there it is sir said one of the midshipmen who was near him for he had been there so often that the whole crew of the enterprise were aware of his attachment she has shown her flag of truce a truce to your nonsense mr warren replied edward laughing how came you to know anything about it i only judge by cause and effect sir and i know that i shall have to go on shore and wait for you tonight that's not unlikely but let draw the foresheet we must now get behind the headland the youngster was right that evening a little before dark he attended his commander on shore the enterprise lying to with a lantern at her peak once more dearest clara said edward as he threw off her long veil and pressed her in his arms yes edward once more but i am afraid only once more for my maid inez has been dangerously ill and has confessed to friar ricardo i fear much that in her fright for she thought that she was dying she has told all she is better now why should you imagine so clara oh you know not what a frightened fool that inez is when she is ill our religion is not like yours no dear it is not but i will teach you a better hush edward you must not say that holy virgin if friar ricardo should hear you i think that inez must have told him for he fixes his dark eyes upon me so earnestly yesterday he observed to me that i had not confessed tell him to mind his own business that is his business and i was obliged to confess to him last night i told him a great many things and then he asked if that was all his eyes went through me i trembled as i uttered an untruth for i said it was i confess my sins but to my maker clara and i confess my love but to you follow my plan dearest i will half obey you edward i will not tell my love and sins you have none clara so you will obey me in all hush edward you must not say that we all have sins and oh what a grievous sin they say it is to love you who are a heretic holy virgin pardon me but i could not help it if that is your only sin dearest i can safely give you absolution nay edward don't joke but hear me if inez has confessed they will look for me here and we must not meet again at least not in this place you know the little bay behind the rock it is not much farther off and there is a cave where i can wait another time it must be there it shall be there dearest but is it not too near the beach will you not be afraid of the men in the boat who must see you but we can leave the beach it is ricardo alone that i am in dread of and the donna maria merciful heaven should my father know all we should be lost be separated for ever and clara laid her forehead on edward's shoulder as her tears fell fast there is nought to fear clara hush i heard a rustling in those orange trees listen yes yes whispered clara hastily there is some one away dear edward away clara sprang from his side and hastened up the grove edward made his retreat and flying down the rocky and narrow path through the underwood was soon on the beach and into his boat the enterprise arrived at head quarters and edward reported himself to the admiral i have work for you mr templemore said the admiral you must be ready to proceed on service immediately we've found your match i hope i may find her sir replied the lieutenant i hope so too for if you give a good account of her it will put another swab on your shoulder the pirate schooner which has so long infested the atlantic has been seen and chased off barbadoes by the amelia but it appears that there is not a vessel in the squadron which can come near her unless it be the enterprise she has since captured two west indiamen and was seen steering with them towards the coast of guiana now i am going to give you thirty additional hands and send you after her thank you sir replied edward his countenance beaming with delight how soon will you be ready inquired the admiral to morrow morning sir very good tell mr hadley to bring me the order for the men and your sailing orders and i will sign them but recollect mr templemore you will have an awkward customer be prudent brave i know you to be edward templemore promised everything as most people do in such cases and before the next evening the enterprise was well in the offing under a heavy press of sail chapter thirteen the landing the property of don cumanos to which he had retired with his family accompanied by francisco extended from the mouth of to many miles up the magdalen river it was a fine alluvial soil forming one vast strip of rich meadow covered with numerous herds of cattle the house was not a hundreds yards from the bank of the magnificent stream and a small but deep creek ran up to the adjacent buildings for don cumanos had property even more valuable being proprietor of a gold mine near the town of jambrano about eight miles farther up and which mine had latterly become exceedingly productive the ore was brought down the river in boats and smelted in the outhouses near the creek to which we have just referred it will be necessary to observe that the establishment of the noble spaniard was numerous consisting of nearly one hundred persons employed in the smelting house or attached to the household for some time francisco remained here happy and contented he had become the confidential supervisor of don cumanos' household proved himself worthy of a trust so important and was considered as one of the family one morning as francisco was proceeding down to the smelting house to open the hatches of the small deck boats which had arrived from jambrano with ore and which were invariably secured with a padlock by the superintendent above to which don cumanos had a corresponding key one of the chief men informed him that a vessel had anchored off the mouth of the river the day before and weighed again early that morning and that she was now standing off and on from carthagena probably beating up replied francisco valga me dios if i know that sir said diego i should have thought nothing about it but giacomo and pedro who went out to fish last night as usual instead of coming back before midnight have not been heard of since indeed that is strange did they ever stay so long before never sir and they have fished together now for seven years francisco gave the key to the man who opened the locks of the hatches and returned it there she is cried the man the head sails making their appearance as the vessel opened to their view from the projecting point distant about four miles francisco directed his eye towards her and without further remark hastened to the house well francisco said don cumanos who was stirring a small cup of chocolate what's the news this morning the nostra senora del carmen and the aguilla have arrived and i have just unlocked the hatches there is a vessel off the point which requires examination and i have come for the telescope requires examination why francisco because giacomo and pedro who went fishing last night have not returned and there are no tidings of them that is strange but how is this connected with the vessel that i will explain as soon as i have had an examination of her replied francisco who had taken up the telescope and was drawing out the tube francisco fixed the glass against the sill of the window and examined the vessel some time in silence yes by the living god it is the avenger and no other exclaimed he as he removed the telescope from his eye eh cried don cumanos it is the pirate vessel the avenger i'll forfeit my life upon it don cumanos you must be prepared i know that they have long talked of a visit to this quarter and anticipate great booty and they have those on board who know the coast well the disappearance of your two men convinces me that they sent up their boats last night to reconnoitre and have captured them torture will extract the information which the pirates require and i have little doubt but that the attack will be made when they learn how much bullion there is at present on your premises you may be right replied don cumanos thoughtfully that is provided you are sure that it is the pirate vessel sure don cumanos i know every timber and plank in her there is not a rope nor a block but i can recognise at the distance of four miles with such a glass as this i can discover every little variety in her rigging from other craft i will swear to her repeated francisco once more looking through the telescope and if they attack francisco we must defend ourselves and i trust beat them off they will come in their boats and at night if they were to run in the schooner by daylight and anchor abreast of us we should have but a poor chance but they little think that i am here and that they are recognised they will attack this night i rather think and what do you then propose francisco that we should send all the females away to don teodoro's it is but five miles and call the men together as soon as possible we are strong enough to beat them off if we barricade the house they cannot land more than from ninety to one hundred men as some must remain in charge of the schooner and we can muster quite as many it may be as well to promise our men a reward if they do their duty that is all right enough and the bullion we have here here we had better let it remain it will take too much time to remove it and besides will weaken our force by the men who must be in charge of it the out houses must be abandoned and everything which is of consequence taken from them fire them they will in all probability at all events we have plenty of time before us if we begin at once well francisco i shall make you commandant and leave the arrangements to you while i go and speak to donna isidora send for the men and speak to them promise them rewards and act as if you were ordering upon your own responsibility i trust i shall prove myself worthy of your confidence sir replied francisco carambo exclaimed the old don as he left the room but it is fortunate you are here we might all have been murdered in our beds francisco sent for the head men of the establishment and told them what he was convinced they would have to expect and he then explained to them his views the rest were all summoned and francisco pointed out to them the little mercy they would receive if the pirates were not repulsed and the rewards which were promised by don cumanos if they did their duty spaniards are individually brave and encouraged by francisco they agreed that they would defend the property to the last the house of don cumanos was well suited to resist an attack of this description in which musketry only was expected to be employed it was a long parallelogram of stone walls with a wooden veranda on the first floor for it was only one story high the windows on the first story were more numerous but at the basement there were but two and no other opening but the door in the whole line of building it was of a composite architecture between the morisco and the spanish if the lower part of the house which was of stone could be secured from entrance the assailants would of course fight under a great disadvantage the windows below were the first secured by piling a heavy mass of stones in the interior of the rooms against them rising to the ceiling from a base like the segment of a pyramid extending to the opposite side of the chamber and every preparation was made for effectually barricading the door before night ladders were then fixed to ascend to the veranda which was rendered musket proof nearly as high as its railings to protect the men the donna isidora and the women of the establishment were in the afternoon despatched to don teodoro's and at the request of francisco joined to the entreaties of donna isidora don cumanos was persuaded to accompany them the don called his men and telling them that he left francisco in command expected them to do their duty and then shaking hands with him the cavalcade was soon lost in the woods behind the narrow meadows which skirted the river there was no want of muskets and ammunition some were employed casting bullets and others in examining the arms which had long been laid by before evening all was ready every man had received his arms and ammunition the flints had been inspected and francisco had time to pay more attention to the schooner which had during the day increased her distance from the land but was now again standing in for the shore half an hour before dusk when within three miles she wore round and put her head to the offing they'll attack this night said francisco i feel almost positive their yards and stay tackles are up all ready for hoisting out the long boat let them come senor we will give them a warm reception replied diego the second in authority it was soon too dark to perceive the vessel francisco and diego ordered every man but five into the house the door was firmly barricaded and some large pieces of rock which had been rolled into the passage piled against it francisco then posted the five men down the banks of the river at a hundred yards' distance from each other to give notice of the approach of the boats it was about ten o'clock at night when francisco and diego descended the ladder and went to examine their outposts senor said diego as he and francisco stood on the bank of the river at what hour is it your idea that these villains will make their attempt that is difficult to say if the same captain commands them who did when i was on board of her it will not be until after the moon is down which will not be till midnight but should it be any other who is in authority they may not be so prudent holy virgin senor were you ever on board of that vessel yes diego i was and for a long while too but not with my own good will had i not been on board i never should have recognised her very true senor then we may thank the saints that you have once been a pirate i hope that i never was that diego replied francisco smiling but i have been a witness to dreadful proceedings on board of that vessel at the remembrance of which even now my blood curdles to pass away the time francisco then detailed many scenes of horror to diego which he had witnessed when on board of the avenger and he was still in the middle of a narrative when a musket was discharged by the farthermost sentinel hark diego another and another nearer and nearer to them gave the signal that the boats were close at hand in a few minutes the men all came in announcing that the pirates were pulling up the stream in three boats and were less than a quarter of a mile from the landing place diego go to the house with these men and see that all is ready said francisco i will wait here a little longer but do not fire till i come to you diego and the men departed and francisco was left on the beach alone in another minute the sound of the oars was plainly distinguishable and francisco's ears were directed to catch if possible the voices yes thought he you come with the intentions of murder and robbery but you will through me be disappointed as the boats approached he heard the voice of hawkhurst the signal muskets fired had told the pirates that they were discovered and that in all probability they would meet with resistance silence was therefore no longer of any advantage oars my lads oars cried hawkhurst one boat ceased rowing and soon afterwards the two others the whole of them were now plainly seen by francisco at the distance of about one cable's length from where he stood and the clear still night carried the sound of their voices along the water here is a creek sir said hawkhurst leading up to those buildings would it not be better to land there as if they are not occupied they will prove a protection to us if we have a hard fight for it very true hawkhurst replied a voice which francisco immediately recognised to be that of cain he is alive then thought francisco and his blood is not yet upon my hands give way my lads cried hawkhurst the boats dashed up the creek and francisco hastened back to the house now my lads said he as he sprang up the ladder you must be resolute we have to deal with desperate men i have heard the voices of the captain and the chief mate so there is no doubt as to its being the pirate the boats are up the creek and will land behind the out buildings haul up these ladders and lay them fore and aft on the veranda and do not fire without taking a good aim silence my men silence here they come the pirates were now seen advancing from the out buildings in strong force in the direction in which they came it was only from the side of the veranda at which not more than eight or ten men could be placed that the enemy could be repulsed francisco therefore gave orders that as soon as some of the men had fired they should retreat and load their muskets to make room for others when the pirates had advanced halfway to the house on the clear space between it and the outbuildings francisco gave the word to fire the volley was answered by another and a shout from the pirates who with hawkhurst and cain at their head now pressed on but not until they had received a second discharge from the spaniards and the pirates had fired in return as the spaniards could not at first fire a volley of more than a dozen muskets at a time their opponents imagined their force to be much less than it really was they now made other arrangements they spread themselves in a semicircle in front of the veranda and kept up a continued galling fire this was returned by the party under francisco for nearly a quarter of an hour and as all the muskets were now called into action the pirates found out that they had a more formidable enemy to cope with than they had anticipated it was now quite dark and not a figure was to be distinguished except by the momentary flashing of the fire arms cain and hawkhurst leaving their men to continue the attack had gained the house and a position under the veranda examining the windows and door there appeared but little chance of forcing an entrance but it immediately occurred to them that under the veranda their men would not be exposed and that they might fire through the wooden floor of it upon those above hawkhurst hastened away and returned with about half the men leaving the others to continue their attack as before the advantage of this manoeuvre was soon evident the musket balls of the pirates pierced the planks and wounded many of the spaniards severely and francisco was at last obliged to order his men to retreat into the house and fire out of the windows but even this warfare did not continue for the supporting pillars of the veranda being of wood and very dry they were set fire to by the pirates gradually the flames wound round them and their forked tongues licked the balustrade at last the whole of the veranda was in flames this was a great advantage to the attacking party who could now distinguish the spaniards without their being so clearly seen themselves many were killed and wounded the smoke and heat became so intense in the upper story that the men could no longer remain there and by the advice of francisco they retreated to the basement of the house what shall we do now senor said diego with a grave face do replied francisco they have burnt the veranda that is all the house will not take fire it is of solid stone the roof indeed may but still here we are i do not see that they are more advanced than they were before as soon as the veranda has burnt down we must return above and commence firing again from the windows hark sir they are trying the door they may try a long while they should have tried the door while the veranda protected them from our sight as soon as it is burnt we shall be able to drive them away from it i will go up again and see how things are no senor it is of no use why expose yourself now that the flames are so bright i must go and see if that is the case diego put all the wounded men in the north chamber it will be the safest and more out of the way francisco ascended the stone staircase and gained the upper story the rooms were filled with smoke and he could distinguish nothing an occasional bullet whistled past him he walked towards the windows and sheltered himself behind the wall between them the flames were not so violent and the heat more bearable in a short time a crash and then another told him that the veranda had fallen in he looked through the window the mass of lighted embers had fallen down in front of the house and had for a time driven away the assailants nothing was left of the veranda but the burning ends of the joists fixed in the wall above the windows and the still glowing remains of the posts which once supported it but the smoke from below now cleared away and the discharge of one or two muskets told francisco that he was perceived by the enemy the roof is safe thought he as he withdrew from the window and now i do not know whether the loss of the veranda may not prove a gain to us what were the intentions of the pirates it was difficult to ascertain for a time they had left off firing and francisco returned to his comrades the smoke had gradually cleared away and they were able to resume their position above but as the pirates did not fire they of course could do nothing as it was only by the flashing of the muskets that the enemy was to be distinguished no further attempts were made at the door or windows below and francisco in vain puzzled himself as to the intended plans of the assailants nearly half an hour of suspense passed away some of the spaniards were of opinion that they had retreated to their boats and gone away but francisco knew them better all he could do was to remain above and occasionally look out to discover their motions diego and one or two more remained with him the other men were kept below that they might be out of danger holy francis but this has been a dreadful night senor how many hours until daylight said diego two hours at least i should think replied francisco but the affair will be decided before that the saints protect us see senor are they not coming francisco looked through the gloom in the direction of the outbuildings and perceived a group of men advancing a few moments and he could clearly make them out yes truly diego and they have made ladders which they are carrying they intend to storm the windows call them up and now we must fight hard indeed the spaniards hastened up and filled the room above which had three windows in the front looking towards the river and which had been sheltered by the veranda shall we fire now senor no no do not fire till your muzzles are at their hearts they cannot mount more than two at a time at each window recollect my lads that you must now fight hard for your lives will not be spared they will show no quarter and no mercy the ends of the rude ladders now made their appearance above the sill of each window they had been hastily yet firmly constructed and were nearly as wide as the windows a loud cheer was followed by a simultaneous mounting of the ladders francisco was at the centre window when hawkhurst made his appearance sabre in hand he struck aside the musket aimed at him and the ball whizzed harmless over the broad water of the river another step and he would have been in when francisco fired his pistol the ball entered the left shoulder of hawkhurst and he dropped his hold before he could regain it a spaniard charged at him with a musket and threw him back he fell bearing down with him one or two of his comrades who had been following him up the ladder francisco felt as if the attack at that window was of little consequence after the fall of hawkhurst whose voice he had recognised and he hastened to the one on the left as he had heard cain encouraging his men in that direction he was not wrong in his conjecture cain was at the window attempting to force an entrance but was opposed by diego and other resolute men but the belt of the pirate captain was full of pistols and he had already fired three with effect diego and the two best men were wounded and the others who opposed him were alarmed at his giant proportions francisco rushed to attack him but what was the force of so young a man against the herculean power of cain still francisco's left hand was at the throat of the pirate and the pistol was pointed in his right when a flash of another pistol fired by one who followed cain threw its momentary vivid light upon the features of francisco as he cried out blood for blood it was enough the pirate captain uttered a yell of terror at the supposed supernatural appearance and he fell from the ladder in a fit among the still burning embers of the veranda the fall of their two chiefs and the determined resistance of the spaniards checked the impetuosity of the assailants they hesitated and they at last retreated bearing away with them their wounded the spaniards cheered and led by francisco followed them down the ladders and in their turn became the assailants still the pirates' retreat was orderly they fired and retired rank behind rank successively they kept the spaniards at bay until they had arrived at the boats when a charge was made and a severe conflict ensued but the pirates had lost too many men and without their commander felt dispirited hawkhurst was still on his legs and giving his orders as coolly as ever he espied francisco and rushing at him while the two parties were opposed muzzle to muzzle seized him by his collar and dragged him in amongst the pirates secure him at all events cried hawkhurst as they slowly retreated and gained the out houses francisco was overpowered and hauled into one of the boats all of which in a few minutes afterwards were pulling with all their might to escape from the muskets of the spaniards who followed the pirates by the banks of the river annoying them in their retreat chapter fourteen the meeting the pirates returned to their vessel discomfited those on board who were prepared to hoist in ingots of precious metal had to receive nought but wounded men and many of their comrades had remained dead on the shore their captain was melancholy and downcast hawkhurst was badly wounded and obliged to be carried below as soon as he came on board the only capture which they had made was their former associate francisco who by the last words spoken by hawkhurst as he was supported to his cabin was ordered to be put in irons the boats were hoisted in without noise and a general gloom prevailed all sail was then made upon the schooner and when day dawned she was seen by the spaniards far away to the northward the report was soon spread through the schooner that francisco had been the cause of their defeat and this was only a surmise still as they considered that had he not recognised the vessel the spaniards would not have been prepared they had good grounds for what had swelled into an assertion he became therefore to many of them an object of bitter enmity and they looked forward with pleasure to his destruction which his present confinement they considered but the precursor of hist massa francisco said a low voice near to where francisco sat on the chest francisco turned round and beheld the krouman his old friend ah pompey are you all still on board said francisco all no replied the man shaking his head some die some get away only four kroumen left massa francisco how you come back again everybody tink you dead i say no not dead ab charm with him ab book if that was my charm i have it still replied francisco taking the bible out of his vest for strange to say francisco himself had a kind of superstition relative to that bible and had put it into his bosom previous to the attack made by the pirates dat very good massa francisco den you quite safe here come johnson he very bad man i go away in the meantime cain had retired to his cabin with feelings scarcely to be analysed he was in a bewilderment notwithstanding the wound he had received by the hand of francisco he would never have sanctioned hawkhurst putting him on shore on a spot which promised nothing but a lingering and miserable death irritated as he had been by the young man's open defiance he loved him loved him much more than he was aware of himself and when he had recovered sufficiently from his wound and had been informed where francisco had been sent on shore he quarrelled with hawkhurst and reproached him bitterly and sternly in language which hawkhurst never forgot or forgave the vision of the starving lad haunted cain and rendered him miserable his affection for him now that he was as he supposed lost for ever increased with tenfold force and since that period cain had never been seen to smile he became more gloomy more ferocious than ever and the men trembled when he appeared on deck the apparition of francisco after so long an interval and in such an unexpected quarter of the globe acted as we have before described upon cain when he was taken to the boat he was still confused in his ideas and it was not until they were nearly on board that he perceived that this young man was indeed at his side he could have fallen on his neck and kissed him for francisco had become to him a capture more prized than all the wealth of the indies but one pure good feeling was unextinguished in the bosom of cain stained with every crime with his hands so deeply imbrued in blood at enmity with all the rest of the world that one feeling burnt bright and clear and was not to be quenched it might have proved a beacon light to steer him back to repentance and to good works but there were other feelings which also crowded upon the mind of the pirate captain he knew francisco's firmness and decision by some inscrutable means which cain considered as supernatural francisco had obtained the knowledge and had accused him of his mother's death would not the affection which he felt for the young man be met with hatred and defiance he was but too sure that it would and then his gloomy cruel disposition would reassume its influence and he thought of revenging the attack upon his life his astonishment at the reappearance of francisco was equally great and he trembled at the sight of him as if he were his accusing and condemning spirit thus did he wander from one fearful fancy to another until he at last summoned up resolution to send for him a morose dark man whom francisco had not seen when he was before in the schooner obeyed the commands of the captain the irons were unlocked and francisco was brought down into the cabin the captain rose and shut the door i little thought to see you here francisco said cain probably not replied francisco boldly but you have me again in your power and may now wreak your vengeance i feel none francisco nor would i have suffered you to have been put on shore as you were had i known of it even now that our expedition has failed through your means i feel no anger towards you although i shall have some difficulty in preserving you from the enmity of others indeed francisco i am glad to find that you are alive and i have bitterly mourned your loss and cain extended his hand but francisco folded his arms and was silent are you then so unforgiving said the captain you know that i tell the truth i believe that you state the truth captain cain for you are too bold to lie and as far as i am concerned you have all the forgiveness you may wish but i cannot take that hand nor are our accounts yet settled what would you more cannot we be friends again i do not ask you to remain on board you are free to go where you please come francisco take my hand and let us forget what is past the hand that is imbrued with my mother's blood perhaps exclaimed francisco never not so by god exclaimed cain no no not quite so bad as that in my mood i struck your mother i grant it i did not intend to injure her but i did and she died i will not lie that is the fact and it is also the fact that i wept over her francisco for i loved her as i do you it was a hasty bitter blow that continued cain soliloquising with his hand to his forehead and unconscious of francisco's presence at the moment it made me what i am for it made me reckless francisco said cain raising his head i was bad but i was no pirate when your mother lived there is a curse upon me that which i love most i treat the worst of all the world i loved your mother most yet did she from me receive much injury and at last i caused her death next to your mother whose memory i at once revere and love and tremble when i think of and each night does she appear to me i have loved you francisco for you like her have an angel's feelings yet have i treated you as ill you thwarted me and you were right had you been wrong i had not cared but you were right and it maddened me your appeals by day your mother's in my dreams francisco's heart was softened if not repentance there was at least contrition indeed i pity you replied francisco you must do more francisco you must be friends with me said cain again extending his hand i cannot take that hand it is too deeply dyed in blood replied francisco well well so would have said your mother but hear me francisco said cain lowering his voice to a whisper lest he should be overheard i am tired of this life perhaps sorry for what i have done i wish to leave it have wealth in plenty concealed where others know not tell me francisco shall we both quit this vessel and live together happily and without doing wrong you shall share all francisco say now does that please you yes it pleases me to hear that you will abandon your lawless life captain cain but share your wealth i cannot for how has it been gained it cannot be returned francisco i will do good with it i will indeed francisco i will repent and again the hand was extended francisco hesitated i do so help me god i do repent francisco exclaimed the pirate captain and i as a christian do forgive you all replied francisco taking the still extended hand may god forgive you too amen replied the pirate solemnly covering his face up in his hands in this position he remained some minutes francisco watching him in silence at last the face was uncovered and to the surprise of francisco a tear was on the cheek of cain and his eyes suffused with moisture francisco no longer waited for the hand to be extended he walked up to the captain and taking him by the hand pressed it warmly god bless you boy god bless you said cain but leave me now francisco returned on deck with a light and grateful heart his countenance at once told those who were near him that he was not condemned and many who dared not before take notice of him now saluted him the man who had taken him out of irons looked round he was a creature of hawkhurst and he knew not how to act francisco observed him and with a wave of the hand ordered him below that francisco was again in authority was instantly perceived and the first proof of it was that the new second mate reported to him that there was a sail on the weather bow francisco took the glass to examine her it was a large schooner under all sail not wishing that any one should enter the cabin but himself he went down to the cabin door and knocked before he entered and reported the vessel thank you francisco you must take hawkhurst's duty for the present it shall not be for long and fear not that i shall make another capture i swear to you i will not francisco but this schooner i know very well what she is she has been looking after us some time and a week ago francisco i was anxious to meet her that i might shed more blood now i will do all i can to avoid her and escape i can do no more francisco i must not be taken there i cannot blame you to avoid her will be easy i should think the avenger outsails everything except i believe the enterprise which is a sister vessel by heaven it's a fair match continued cain his feelings of combativeness returning for a moment and it will look like a craven to refuse the fight but fear not francisco i have promised you and i shall keep my word cain went on deck and surveyed the vessel through the glass yes it must be her said he aloud so as to be heard by the pirates she has been sent out by the admiral on purpose full of his best men what a pity we are short handed there's enough of us sir observed the boatswain yes replied cain if there was anything but hard blows to be got but that is all and i cannot spare more men ready about continued he walking aft the enterprise for she was the vessel in pursuit was then about five miles distant steering for the avenger who was on a wind as soon as the avenger tacked the enterprise took in her topmast studding sail and hauled her wind this brought the enterprise well on the weather quarter of the avenger who now made all sail the pirates who had had quite enough of fighting and were not stimulated by the presence of hawkhurst or the wishes of their captain now showed as much anxiety to avoid as they usually did to seek a combat at the first trial of sailing between the two schooners there was no perceptible difference for half an hour they both continued on a wind and when edward templemore examined his sextant a second time he could not perceive that he had gained upon the avenger one cable's length we will keep away half a point said edward to his second in command we can afford that and still hold the weather gage the enterprise was kept away and increased her speed they neared the avenger more than a quarter of a mile they are nearing us observed francisco we must keep away a point away went the avenger and would have recovered her distance but the enterprise was again steered more off the wind thus did they continue altering their course until the studding sails below and aloft were set by both and the position of the schooners was changed the enterprise now being on the starboard instead of the larboard quarter of the avenger the relative distance between the two schooners was however nearly the same that is about three miles and a half from each other and there was every prospect of a long and weary chase on the part of the enterprise who again kept away a point to near the avenger both vessels were now running to the eastward it was about an hour before dark that another sail hove in sight right a head of the avenger and was clearly made out to be a frigate the pirates were alarmed at this unfortunate circumstance as there was little doubt but that she would prove a british cruiser and if not they had equally reason to expect that she would assist in their capture she had evidently perceived the two schooners and had made all sail tacking every quarter of an hour so as to keep her relative position the enterprise who had also made out the frigate to attract her attention although not within range of the avenger commenced firing with her long gun this is rather awkward observed cain it will be dark in less than an hour observed francisco and that is our only chance cain reflected a minute get the long gun ready my lads we will return her fire francisco and hoist american colours that will puzzle the frigate at all events and the night may do the rest the long gun of the avenger was ready i would not fire the long gun observed francisco it will show our force and will give no reason for our attempt to escape now if we were to fire our broadside guns the difference of report between them and the one of large calibre fired by the other schooner would induce them to think that we are an american vessel very true replied cain and as america is at peace with all the world that our antagonist is a pirate hold fast the long gun there and unship the starboard ports see that the ensign blows out clear the avenger commenced firing an occasional gun from her broadside the reports of which were hardly to be heard by those on board of the frigate while the long gun of the enterprise reverberated along the water and its loud resonance was swept by the wind to the frigate to leeward such was the state of affairs when the sun sank down in the wave and darkness obscured the vessels from each other's sight except with the assistance of the night telescopes what do you propose to do captain cain said francisco i have made up my mind to do a bold thing i will run down to the frigate as if for shelter tell him that the other vessel is a pirate and claim his protection leave me to escape afterwards the moon will not rise till nearly one o'clock that will be a bold ruse indeed but suppose you are once under her broadside and she suspects you then i will show her my heels i should care nothing for her and her broadside if the schooner was not here in an hour after dark the avenger was close to the frigate having steered directly for her she shortened sail gradually as if she had few hands on board and keeping his men out of sight cain ran under the stern of the frigate schooner ahoy what schooner is that eliza of baltimore from carthagena replied cain rounding to under the lee of the man of war and then continuing that vessel in chase is a pirate shall i send a boat on board no keep company with us ay ay sir replied cain hands about ship now resounded with the boatswain's whistle on board of the frigate and in a minute they were on the other tack the avenger also tacked and kept close under the frigate's counter in the meantime edward templemore and those on board of the enterprise who by the course steered had gradually neared them perceiving the motions of the two other vessels were quite puzzled at one time they thought they had made a mistake and that it was not the pirate vessel at another they surmised that the crew had mutinied and surrendered to the frigate edward hauled his wind and steered directly for them to ascertain what the real facts were the captain of the frigate who had never lost sight of either vessel was equally astonished at the boldness of the supposed pirate surely the rascal does not intend to board us said he to the first lieutenant there is no saying sir you know what a character he has and some say there are three hundred men on board which is equal to our ship's company or perhaps sir he will pass to windward of us and give us a broadside and be off in the wind's eye again at all events we will have a broadside ready for him replied the captain clear away the starboard guns and take out the tompions pipe starboard watch to quarters the enterprise closed with the frigate to windward intending to run round her stern and bring to on the same tack he does not shorten sail yet sir said the first lieutenant as the schooner appeared skimming along about a cable's length on their weather bow and she is full of men sir said the master looking at her through the night glass fire a gun at her said the captain bang the smoke cleared away and the schooner's foretopsail which she was in the act of clewing up lay over side the shot had struck the foremast of the enterprise and cut it in two below the catharpings the enterprise was for the time completely disabled schooner ahoy what schooner is that his majesty's schooner enterprise send a boat on board immediately ay ay sir turn the hands up shorten sail the top gallant and courses of the frigate were taken in and the mainsail hove to the mast signalman whereabouts is that other schooner now the schooner sir on the quarter replied the signalman who with everybody else on board was so anxious about the enterprise that they had neglected to watch the motions of the supposed american the man had replied at random and he now jumped upon the signal chests abaft to look for her but she was not to be seen cain who had watched all that passed between the other two vessels and had been prepared to slip off at a moment's warning as soon as the gun was fired at the other schooner had wore round and made all sail on a wind the night glass discovered her half a mile astern and the ruse was immediately perceived the frigate filled and made sail leaving edward to return on board for there was no time to stop for the boat tacked and gave chase but the avenger was soon in the wind's eye of her and at daylight was no longer to be seen in the meantime edward templemore had followed the frigate as soon as he could set sail on his vessel indignant at his treatment and vowing that he would demand a court martial about noon the frigate rejoined him when matters were fully explained annoyed as they all felt at not having captured the pirate it was unanimously agreed that by his audacity and coolness he deserved to escape it was found that the mast of the enterprise could be fished and scarfed so as to enable her to continue her cruise the carpenters of the frigate were sent on board and in two days the injury was repaired and edward templemore once more went in pursuit of the avenger chapter fifteen the mistake the avenger stood under a press of sail to the northward she had left her pursuers far behind and there was not a speck on the horizon when on the second morning francisco who had resumed his berth in the captain's cabin went up on deck notwithstanding the request of cain francisco refused to take any part in the command of the schooner considering himself as a passenger or prisoner on parole he had not been on deck but a few minutes when he observed the two spanish fishermen belonging to the establishment of don cumanos conversing together forward their capture had quite escaped his memory and he went forward to speak to them their surprise at seeing him was great until francisco informed them of what had passed they then recounted what had occurred to them and showed their thumbs which had been put into screws to torture from them the truth francisco shuddered but consoled them by promising that they should soon be at liberty and return to their former master as francisco returned from forward he found hawkhurst on the deck their eyes met and flashed in enmity hawkhurst was pale from loss of blood and evidently suffering but he had been informed of the apparent reconciliation between francisco and the captain and he could no longer remain in his bed he knew also how the captain had avoided the combat with the enterprise and something told him that there was a revolution of feeling in more than one point suffering as he was he resolved to be a spectator of what passed and to watch narrowly for both francisco and cain he had imbibed a deadly hatred and was watching for an opportunity to wreak his revenge at present they were too powerful but he felt that the time was coming when he might be triumphant francisco passed hawkhurst without speaking you are at liberty again i see observed hawkhurst with a sneer i am not at all events indebted to you for it replied francisco haughtily nor for my life either no indeed but i believe that i am indebted to you for this bullet in my shoulder replied the mate you are replied francisco coolly and depend upon it the debt shall be repaid with usury i have no doubt of it if ever it is in your power but i fear you not as francisco made this reply the captain came up the ladder hawkhurst turned away and walked forward there is mischief in that man francisco said the captain in an under tone i hardly know whom to trust but he must be watched he is tampering with the men and has been for some time not that it is of much consequence if he does but remain quiet for a little while the command of this vessel he is welcome to very soon but if he attempts too early i have those i can trust to replied francisco let us go below francisco sent for pompey the krouman and gave him his directions in the presence of the captain that night to the surprise of all hawkhurst kept his watch and notwithstanding the fatigue appeared every day to be rapidly recovering from his wound nothing occurred for several days during which the avenger still continued her course what the captain's intentions were did not transpire they were known only to francisco we are very short of water sir reported hawkhurst one morning shall we have enough to last us to where we are going how many days of full allowance have we on board not above twelve at the most then we must go on half allowance replied cain the ship's company wish to know where we are going sir have they deputed you to ask the question not exactly sir but i wish to know myself replied hawkhurst with an insolent air turn the hands up replied cain as one of the ship's company under my orders you will with the others receive the information you require the crew of the pirate collected aft my lads said cain i understand from the first mate that you are anxious to know where you are going in reply i acquaint you that having so many wounded men on board and so much plunder in the hold i intend to repair to our rendezvous when we were formerly in this part of the world the caicos is there any other question you may wish to ask of me yes replied hawkhurst we wish to know what your intentions are relative to that young man francisco we have lost immense wealth we have now thirty men wounded in the hammocks and nine we left dead on the shore and i have a bullet through my body all of which has been occasioned by him we demand justice here hawkhurst was supported by several of the pirates and there were many voices which repeated the cry of justice my men you demand justice and you shall have it replied cain this lad you all know well i have brought him up from a child he has always disliked our mode of life and has often requested to leave it but has been refused he challenged me by our own laws blood for blood' he wounded me but he was right in his challenge and therefore i bear no malice had i been aware that he was to have been sent on shore to die with hunger i would not have permitted it what crime had he committed none or if any it was against me he was then sentenced to death for no crime and you yourselves exclaimed against it is it not true yes yes replied the majority of the pirates by a miracle he escapes and is put in charge of another man's property he is made a prisoner and now you demand justice you shall have it allowing that his life is forfeit for this offence you have already sentenced him and left him to death unjustly and therefore are bound in justice to give his life in this instance i ask it my men not only as his right but as a favour to your captain agreed it's all fair exclaimed the majority of the pirate's crew my men i thank you replied cain and in return as soon as we arrive at the caicos my share of the plunder on board shall be divided among you this last observation completely turned the tables in favour of the captain and those who had joined hawkhurst now sided with the captain hawkhurst looked like a demon let those who choose to be bought off take your money replied he but i will not blood for blood i will have and so i give you warning that lad's life is mine and have it i will prevent me if you can continued the mate holding up his clenched hand and shaking it almost in the pirate captain's face the blood mantled even to the forehead of cain one moment he raised himself to his utmost height then seizing a hand spike which lay near he felled hawkhurst to the deck take that for your mutiny exclaimed cain putting his foot on hawkhurst's neck my lads i appeal to you is this man worthy to be in command as mate is he to live no no cried the pirates death francisco stepped forward my men you have granted your captain one favour grant me another which is the life of this man recollect how often he has led you to conquest and how brave and faithful he has been until now recollect that he is suffering under his wound which has made him irritable command you he cannot any longer as he will never have the confidence of your captain but let him live and quit the vessel be it so if you agree replied cain looking at the men i do not seek his life the pirates consented hawkhurst rose slowly from the deck and was assisted below to his cabin the second mate was then appointed as the first and the choice of the man to fill up the vacancy was left to the pirate crew for three days after this scene all was quiet and orderly on board of the pirate cain now that he had more fully made up his mind how to act imparted to francisco his plans and his giving up to the men his share of the booty still on board was to francisco an earnest of his good intentions a cordiality even a kind of feeling which never existed before was created between them but of francisco's mother and the former events of his own life the pirate never spoke francisco more than once put questions on the subject the answer was you shall know some of these days francisco but not yet you would hate me too much the avenger was now clear of the english isles and with light winds running down the shores of porto rico in the evening of the day on which they had made the land the schooner was becalmed about three miles from the shore and the new first mate proposed that he should land in the boat and obtain a further supply of water from a fall which they had discovered with the glasses as this was necessary cain gave his consent and the boat quitted the vessel full of breakers now it happened that the avenger lay becalmed abreast of the country seat of don d'alfarez the governor of the island clara had seen the schooner and as usual had thrown out the white curtain as a signal of recognition for there was no perceptible difference even to a sailor at that distance between the avenger and the enterprise she had hastened down to the beach and hurried into the cave awaiting the arrival of edward templemore the pirate boat landed at the very spot of rendezvous and the mate leaped out of the boat clara flew to receive her edward and was instantly seized by the mate before she discovered her mistake holy virgin who and what are you cried she struggling to disengage herself one who is very fond of a pretty girl replied the pirate still detaining her unhand me wretch cried clara are you aware whom you are addressing not i nor do i care replied the pirate you will perhaps sir when you learn that i am the daughter of the governor exclaimed clara pushing him away yes by heavens you are right pretty lady i do care for a governor's daughter will fetch a good ransom at all events so come my lads a little help here for she is as strong as a young mule never mind the water throw the beakers into the boat again we have a prize worth taking clara screamed but she was gagged with a handkerchief and lifted into the boat which immediately rowed back to the schooner when the mate came on board and reported his capture the pirates were delighted at the prospect of addition to their prize money cain could not of course raise any objections it would have been so different from his general practice that it would have strengthened suspicions already set afloat by hawkhurst which cain was most anxious just then to remove he ordered the girl to be taken down into the cabin hoisted in the boat and the breeze springing up again made sail in the mean time francisco was consoling the unfortunate clara and assuring her that she need be under no alarm promising her the protection of himself and the captain the poor girl wept bitterly and it was not until cain came down into the cabin and corroborated the assurances of francisco that she could assume any degree of composure but to find friends when she had expected every insult and degradation for francisco had acknowledged that the vessel was a pirate was some consolation the kindness and attention of francisco restored her to comparative tranquillity the next day she confided to him the reason of her coming to the beach and her mistake with regard to the two vessels and francisco and cain promised her that they would themselves pay her ransom and not wait until she heard from her father to divert her thoughts francisco talked much about edward templemore and on that subject clara could always talk every circumstance attending the amour was soon known to francisco but the avenger did not gain her rendezvous as soon as she expected when to the northward of porto rico an english frigate bore down upon her and the avenger was obliged to run for it before the wind is always a schooner's worst point of sailing and the chase was continued for three days before a fresh wind from the southward until they had passed the bahama isles the pirates suffered much from want of water as it was necessary still further to reduce their allowance the frigate was still in sight although the avenger had dropped her astern when the wind became light and at last it subsided into a calm which lasted two days more the boats of the frigate were hoisted out on the eve of the second day to attack the schooner then distant five miles when a breeze sprang up from the northward and the schooner being then to windward left the enemy hull down it was not until the next day that cain ventured to run again to the southward to procure at one of the keys the water so much required at last it was obtained but with difficulty and much loss of time from the scantiness of the supply and they again made sail for the caicos but they were so much impeded by contrary winds and contrary currents that it was not until three weeks after they had been chased from porto rico that they made out the low land of their former rendezvous we must now return to edward templemore in the enterprise whom we left off the coast of south america in search of the avenger which had so strangely slipped through their fingers edward had examined the whole coast ran through the passage and round trinidad and then started off to the leeward isles in his pursuit he had spoken every vessel he met with without gaining any information and had at last arrived off porto rico this was no time to think of clara but as it was not out of his way he had run down the island and as it was just before dark when he arrived off that part of the coast where the governor resided he had hove to for a little while and had examined the windows but the signal of recognition was not made and after waiting till dark he again made sail mad with disappointment and fearing that all had been discovered by the governor whereas the fact was that he had only arrived two days after the forcible abduction of clara once more he directed his attention to the discovery of the pirate and after a fortnight's examination of the inlets and bays of the island of st domingo without success his provisions and water being nearly expended he returned in no very happy mood to port royal in the mean time the disappearance of clara had created the greatest confusion in porto rico and upon the examination of her attendant who was confronted by the friar and the duenna the amour of her mistress was confessed the appearance of the avenger off the coast on that evening confirmed their ideas that the donna clara had been carried off by the english lieutenant and don alfarez immediately despatched a vessel to jamaica complaining of the outrage and demanding the restoration of his daughter this vessel arrived at port royal a few days before the enterprise and the admiral was very much astonished he returned a very polite answer to don alfarez promising an investigation immediately upon the arrival of the schooner and to send a vessel with the result of the said investigation this is a pretty business said the admiral to his secretary young madcap i sent him to look after a pirate and he goes after the governor's daughter by the lord harry mr templemore but you and i shall have an account to settle i can hardly believe it sir replied the secretary and yet it does look suspicious but on so short an acquaintance who knows that mr hadley send for his logs and let us examine them he may have been keeping up the acquaintance the logs of the enterprise were examined and there were the fatal words porto rico porto rico bearing in every division of the compass and in every separate cruise nay even when the schooner was charged with despatches plain enough said the admiral confounded young scamp to embroil me in this way not that his marrying the girl is any business of mine but i will punish him for disobedience of orders at all events try him by a court martial by heavens the secretary made no reply he knew very well that the admiral would do no such thing the enterprise anchored at daylight sir reported the secretary as the admiral sat down to breakfast and where's mr templemore he is outside in the veranda they have told him below of what he has been accused and he swears it is false i believe him sir for he appears half mad at the intelligence stop a moment have you looked over his log yes sir it appears that he was off porto rico on the th but the spanish governor's letter says that he was there on the th and again made his appearance on the th i mentioned it to him and he declares upon his honour that he was only there on the th as stated in his log well let him come in and speak for himself edward came in in a state of great agitation well mr templemore you have been playing pretty tricks what is all this sir where is the girl sir the governor's daughter where she is sir i cannot pretend to say but i feel convinced that she has been carried off by the pirates pirates poor girl i pity her and i pity you too edward come sit down here and tell me all that has happened edward knew the admiral's character so well that he immediately disclosed all that had passed between him and clara he then stated how the avenger had escaped him by deceiving the frigate and the agreement made with clara to meet for the future on the beach and his conviction that the pirate schooner so exactly similar in appearance to the enterprise must have preceded him at porto rico and have carried off the object of his attachment although edward might have been severely taken to task yet the admiral pitied him and therefore said nothing about his visits to porto rico when breakfast was over he ordered the signal to be made for a sloop of war to prepare to weigh and the enterprise to be revictualled by the boats of the squadron now edward you and the comus shall sail in company after this rascally pirate and i trust you will give me a good account of her and also of the governor's daughter cheer up my boy depend upon it they will try for ransom before they do her any injury that evening the enterprise and comus sailed on their expedition and having run by porto rico and delivered a letter to the governor they steered to the northward and early the next morning made the land of the caicos just as the avenger had skirted the reefs and bore up for the narrow entrance there she is exclaimed edward there she is by heavens making the signal for the enemy which was immediately answered by the comus chapter sixteen the caicos the small patch of islands called the caicos or cayques is situated about two degrees to the northward of saint domingo and is nearly the southernmost of a chain which extends up to the bahamas most of the islands of this chain are uninhabited but were formerly the resort of piratical vessels the reefs and shoals with which they are all surrounded afforded them protection from their larger pursuers and the passages through this dangerous navigation being known only to the pirates who frequented them proved an additional security the largest of the caicos islands forms a curve like an opened horseshoe to the southward with safe and protected anchorage when once in the bay on the southern side but previous to arriving at the anchorage there are coral reefs extending upwards of forty miles through which it is necessary to conduct a vessel this passage is extremely intricate but was well known to hawkhurst who had hitherto been pilot cain was not so well acquainted with it and it required the greatest care in taking in the vessel as on the present occasion hawkhurst could not be called upon for this service the islands themselves for there were several of them were composed of coral rock a few cocoa trees raised their lofty heads where there was sufficient earth for vegetation and stunted brush wood rose up between the interstices of the rocks but the chief peculiarity of the islands and which rendered them suitable to those who frequented them was the numerous caves with which the rocks were perforated some above high water mark but the majority with the sea water flowing in and out of them in some cases merely rushing in and at high water filling deep pools which were detached from each other when the tide receded in others with a sufficient depth of water at all times to allow you to pull in with a large boat it is hardly necessary to observe how convenient the higher and dry caves were as receptacles for articles which were intended to be concealed until an opportunity occurred for disposing of them in our last chapter we stated that just as the avenger had entered the passage through the reefs the comus and enterprise hove in sight and discovered her but it will be necessary to explain the positions of the vessels the avenger had entered the southern channel with the wind from the southward and had carefully sounded her way for about four miles under little or no sail the enterprise and comus had been examining turk's island to the eastward of the caicos and had passed to the northward of it on the larboard tack standing in for the northern point of the reef which joined on to the great caicos island they were therefore in a situation to intercept the avenger before she arrived at her anchorage had it not been for the reefs that barred their passage the only plan which the english vessels could act upon was to beat to the southward so as to arrive at the entrance of the passage when the enterprise would of course find sufficient water to follow the avenger for as the passage was too narrow to beat through and the wind was from the southward the avenger could not possibly escape she was caught in a trap and all that she had to trust to was the defence which she might be able to make in her stronghold against the force which could be employed in the attack the breeze was fresh from the southward and appeared inclined to increase when the comus and enterprise made all sail and worked in short tacks outside the reef on board the avenger the enemy and their motions were clearly distinguished and cain perceived that he was in an awkward dilemma that they would be attacked he had no doubt and although at any other time he would almost have rejoiced in such an opportunity of discomfiting his assailants yet now he thought very differently and would have sacrificed almost everything to have been able to avoid the rencontre and be permitted quietly to withdraw himself from his associates without the spilling of more blood francisco was equally annoyed at this unfortunate collision but no words were exchanged between him and the pirate captain during the time that they were on deck it was about nine o'clock when having safely passed nearly half through the channel that cain ordered the kedge anchor to be dropped and sent down the people to their breakfast francisco went down into the cabin and was explaining their situation to clara when cain entered he threw himself on the locker and appeared lost in deep and sombre meditation what do you intend to do said francisco i do not know i will not decide myself francisco replied cain if i were to act upon my own judgment probably i should allow the schooner to remain where she is they can only attack in the boats and in such a case i do not fear whereas if we run right through we allow the other schooner to follow us without defending the passage and we may be attacked by her in the deep water inside and overpowered by the number of men the two vessels will be able to bring against us on the other hand we certainly may defend the schooner from the shore as well as on board but we are weak handed i shall however call up the ship's company and let them decide god knows if left to me i would not fight at all is there no way of escape resumed francisco yes we might abandon the schooner and this night when they would not expect it run with the boats through the channel between the great island and the north cayque but that i daren't propose and the men would not listen to it indeed i very much doubt if the enemy will allow us the time i knew this morning long before we saw those vessels that my fate would be decided before the sun went down what do you mean i mean this francisco said cain that your mother who always has visited me in my dreams whenever anything dreadful now to think of was about to take place appeared to me last night and there was sorrow and pity in her sweet face as she mournfully waved her hand as if to summon me to follow her yes thank god she no longer looked upon me as for many years she has done francisco made no answer and cain again seemed to be lost in meditation after a little while cain rose and taking a small packet from one of the drawers put it into the hands of francisco preserve that said the pirate captain should any accident happen to me it will tell you who was your mother and it also contains directions for finding treasure which i have buried i leave everything to you francisco it has been unfairly obtained but you are not the guilty party and there are none to claim it do not answer me now you may find friends whom you will make after i am gone of the same opinion as i am i tell you again be careful of that packet i see little chance of it availing me replied francisco if i live shall i not be considered as a pirate no no you can prove the contrary i have my doubts but god's will be done yes god's will be done said cain mournfully i dared not have said that a month ago and the pirate captain went on deck followed by francisco the crew of the avenger were summoned aft and called upon to decide as to the measures they considered to be most advisable they preferred weighing the anchor and running into the bay where they would be able to defend the schooner in their opinion much better than by remaining where they were the crew of the pirate schooner weighed the anchor and continued their precarious course the breeze had freshened and the water was in strong ripples so that they could no longer see the danger beneath her bottom in the meantime the sloop of war and enterprise continued to turn to windward outside the reef by noon the wind had considerably increased and the breakers now turned and broke in wild foam over the coral reefs in every direction the sail was still more reduced on board the avenger and her difficulties increased from the rapidity of her motion a storm jib was set and the others hauled down yet even under this small sail she flew before the wind cain stood at the bowsprit giving his directions to the helmsman more than once they had grazed the rocks and were clear again spars were towed astern and every means resorted to to check her way they had no guide but the breaking of the wild water on each side of them why should not hawkhurst who knows the passage so well be made to pilot us said the boatswain to those who were near him on the forecastle to be sure let's have him up cried several of the crew and some of them went down below in a minute they reappeared with hawkhurst whom they led forward he did not make any resistance and the crew demanded that he should pilot the vessel and suppose i will not said hawkhurst coolly then you lose your passage that's all replied the boatswain is it not so my lads continued he appealing to the crew yes either take us safe in or overboard replied several i do not mind that threat my lads replied hawkhurst you have all known me as a good man and true and it's not likely that i shall desert you now well since your captain there cannot save you i suppose i must but exclaimed he looking about him how's this we are out of the passage already yes and whether we can get into it again i cannot tell we are not out of the passage said cain you know we are not well then if the captain knows better than i he had better take you through rejoined hawkhurst but the crew thought differently and insisted that hawkhurst who well knew the channel should take charge cain retired aft as hawkhurst went out on the bowsprit i will do my best my lads said hawkhurst but recollect if we strike in trying to get into the right channel do not blame me starboard a little starboard yet steady so there's the true passage my lads cried he pointing to some smoother water between the breakers port a little steady but hawkhurst who knew that he was to be put on shore as soon as convenient had resolved to lose the schooner even if his own life were forfeited and he was now running her out of the passage on the rocks a minute after he had conned her she struck heavily again and again the third time she struck she came broadside to the wind and heeled over a sharp coral rock found its way through her slight timbers and planking and the water poured in rapidly during this there was a dead silence on the part of the marauders my lads said hawkhurst i have done my best and now you may throw me overboard if you please it was not my fault but his continued he pointing to the captain it is of little consequence whose fault it was mr hawkhurst replied cain we will settle that point by and by at present we have too much on our hands out boats men as fast as you can and let every man provide himself with arms and ammunition be cool the schooner is fixed hard enough and will not go down we shall save everything by and by the pirates obeyed the orders of the captain the three boats were hoisted out and lowered down in the first were placed all the wounded men and clara d'alfarez who was assisted up by francisco as soon as the men had provided themselves with arms francisco to protect clara offered to take charge of her and the boat shoved off the men of war had seen the avenger strike on the rocks and the preparations of the crew to take to their boats they immediately hove to hoisted out and manned their own boats with the hopes of cutting them off before they could gain the island and prepare for a vigorous defence for although the vessels could not approach the reefs there was sufficient water in many places for the boats to pass over them shortly after francisco in the first boat had shoved off from the avenger the boats of the men of war were darting through the surf to intercept them the pirates perceived this and hastened their arrangements a second boat soon left her and into that hawkhurst leaped as it was shoving off cain remained on board going round the lower decks to ascertain if any of the wounded men were left he then quitted the schooner in the last boat and followed the others being about a quarter of a mile astern of the second in which hawkhurst had secured his place at the time that cain quitted the schooner it was difficult to say whether the men of war's boats would succeed in intercepting any of the pirate's boats both parties exerted themselves to their utmost and when the first boat with francisco and clara landed the headmost of the assailants was not much more than half a mile from them but shallow water intervening there was a delay which was favourable to the pirate hawkhurst landed in his boat as the launch of the comus fired her eighteen pound carronade the last boat was yet two hundred yards from the beach when another shot from the comus's launch which had been unable hitherto to find a passage through the reef struck her on the counter and she filled and went down he is gone exclaimed francisco who had led clara to a cave and stood at the mouth of it to protect her they have sunk his boat no he is swimming to the shore and will be here soon long before the english seamen can land this was true cain was breasting the water manfully making for a small cove nearer to where the boat was sunk than the one in which francisco had landed with clara and the wounded men and divided from the other by a ridge of rocks which separated the sandy beach and extended some way into the water before they were submerged francisco could easily distinguish the pirate captain from the other men who also were swimming for the beach for cain was far ahead of them and as he gained nearer to the shore he was shut from francisco's sight by the ridge of rocks francisco anxious for his safety climbed up the rocks and was watching cain was within a few yards of the beach when there was the report of a musket the pirate captain was seen to raise his body convulsively half out of the water he floundered the clear blue wave was discoloured he sank and was seen no more francisco darted forward from the rocks and perceived hawkhurst standing beneath them with the musket in his hand which he was recharging villain exclaimed francisco you shall account for this hawkhurst had reprimed his musket and shut the pan not to you replied hawkhurst levelling his piece and taking aim at francisco the ball struck francisco on the breast he reeled back from his position staggered across the sand gained the cave and fell at the feet of clara oh god exclaimed the poor girl are you hurt who is there then to protect me i hardly know replied francisco faintly and at intervals i feel no wound i feel stronger and francisco put his hand to his heart clara opened his vest and found that the packet given to francisco by cain and which he had deposited in his breast had been struck by the bullet which had done him no injury further than the violent concussion of the blow notwithstanding he was faint from the shock and his head fell upon clara's bosom but we must relate the proceedings of those who were mixed up in this exciting scene edward templemore had watched from his vessel with an eager and painful curiosity the motions of the schooner her running on the rocks and the subsequent actions of the intrepid marauders the long telescope enabled him to perceive distinctly all that passed and his feelings were increased into a paroxysm of agony when his straining eyes beheld the white and fluttering habiliments of a female for a moment at the gunwale of the stranded vessel her descent as it appeared to him nothing loth into the boat the arms held out to receive and the extension of hers to meet those offered could it be clara where was the reluctance the unavailing attempts at resistance which should have characterised her situation excited by feelings which he dared not analyse he threw down his glass and seizing his sword sprang into the boat which was ready manned alongside desiring the others to follow him for once and the only time in his existence when approaching the enemy did he feel his heart sink within him a cold tremor ran through his whole frame and as he called to mind the loose morals and desperate habits of the pirates horrible thoughts entered his imagination as he neared the shore he stood up in the stern sheets of the boat pale haggard and with trembling lips and the intensity of his feelings would have been intolerable but for a more violent thirst for revenge he clenched his sword while the quick throbs of his heart seemed at every pulsation to repeat to him his thoughts of blood blood blood he approached the small bay and perceived that there was a female at the mouth of the cave nearer and nearer and he was certain that it was his clara her name was on his lips when he heard the two shots fired one after another by hawkhurst he saw the retreat and fall of francisco when madness to behold he perceived clara rush forward and there lay the young man supported by her and with his head on her bosom could he believe what he saw could she really be his betrothed yes there she was supporting the handsome figure of a young man and that man a pirate she had even put her hand into his vest and was now watching over his reviving form edward could bear no more he covered his eyes and now maddened with jealousy in a voice of thunder he called out give way my lads for your lives give way the gig was within half a dozen strokes of the oar from the beach and clara unconscious of wrong had just taken the packet of papers from francisco's vest when hawkhurst made his appearance from behind the rocks which separated the two little sandy coves francisco had recovered his breath and perceiving the approach of hawkhurst he sprang upon his feet to recover his musket but before he could succeed hawkhurst had closed in with him and a short and dreadful struggle ensued it would soon have terminated fatally to francisco for the superior strength of hawkhurst had enabled him to bear down the body of his opponent with his knee and he was fast strangling him by twisting his handkerchief round his throat while clara shrieked and attempted in vain to tear the pirate from him as the prostrate francisco was fast blackening into a corse and the maiden screamed for pity and became frantic in her efforts for his rescue the boat dashed high up on the sand and with the bound of a maddened tiger edward sprang upon hawkhurst tearing him down on his back and severing his wrist with his sword blade until his hold of francisco was relaxed and he wrestled in his own defence seize him my lads said edward pointing with his left hand to hawkhurst as with his sword directed to the body of francisco he bitterly continued this victim is mine but whatever were his intentions they were frustrated by clara's recognition who shrieked out my edward sprang into his arms and was immediately in a state of insensibility the seamen who had secured hawkhurst looked upon the scene with curious astonishment while edward waited with mingled feelings of impatience and doubt for clara's recovery he wished to be assured by her that he was mistaken and he turned again and again from her face to that of francisco who was fast recovering during this painful suspense hawkhurst was bound and made to sit down edward dear edward said clara at last in a faint voice clinging more closely to him and am i then rescued by thee dearest edward felt the appeal but his jealousy had not yet subsided who is that clara said he sternly it is francisco no pirate edward but my preserver ha ha laughed hawkhurst with a bitter sneer for he perceived how matters stood edward templemore turned towards him with an inquiring look ha ha continued hawkhurst why he is the captain's son no pirate eh well what will women not swear to to save those they dote upon if the captain's son said edward why were you contending because just now i shot his scoundrel father edward said clara solemnly this is no time for explanation but as i hope for mercy what i have said is true believe not the villain yes said francisco who was now sitting up believe him when he says that he shot the captain for that is true but sir if you value your own peace of mind believe nothing to the prejudice of that young lady i hardly know what to believe muttered edward templemore but as the lady says this is no time for explanation with your permission madam said he to clara my coxswain will see you in safety on board of the schooner or the other vessel if you prefer it my duty will not allow me to accompany you clara darted a reproachful yet fond look on edward as with swimming eyes she was led by the coxswain to the boat which had been joined by the launch of the comus the crew of which were with their officers wading to the beach the men of the gig remained until they had given hawkhurst and francisco in charge of the other seamen and then shoved off with clara for the schooner edward templemore gave one look at the gig as it conveyed clara on board and ordering hawkhurst and francisco to be taken to the launch and a guard to be kept over them went up with the remainder of the men in pursuit of the pirates during the scene we have described the other boats of the men of war had landed on the island and the avenger's crew deprived of their leaders and scattered in every direction were many of them slain or captured in about two hours it was supposed that the majority of the pirates had been accounted for and the prisoners being now very numerous it was decided that the boats should return with them to the comus the captain of which vessel as commanding officer would then issue orders as to their future proceedings the captured pirates when mustered on the deck of the comus amounted to nearly sixty out of which number one half were those who had been sent on shore wounded and had surrendered without resistance of killed there were fifteen and it was conjectured that as many more had been drowned in the boat when she was sunk by the shot from the carronade of the launch although by the account given by the captured pirates the majority were secured yet there was reason to suppose that some were still left on the island concealed in the caves as the captain of the comus had orders to return as soon as possible he decided to sail immediately for port royal with the prisoners leaving the enterprise to secure the remainder if there were any and recover anything of value which might be left in the wreck of the avenger and then to destroy her with the usual celerity of the service these orders were obeyed the pirates among whom francisco was included were secured the boats hoisted up and in half an hour the comus displayed her ensign and made all sail on a wind leaving edward templemore with the enterprise at the back of the reef to perform the duties entailed upon him and clara who was on board of the schooner to remove the suspicion and jealousy which had arisen in the bosom of her lover chapter seventeen the trial in a week the comus arrived at port royal and the captain went up to the penn to inform the admiral of the successful result of the expedition thank god said the admiral we have caught these villains at last a little hanging will do them no harm the captain you say was drowned so it is reported sir replied captain manly he was in the last boat which left the schooner and she was sunk by a shot from the launch i am sorry for that the death was too good for him however we must make an example of the rest they must be tried by the admiralty court which has the jurisdiction of the high seas send them on shore manly and we wash our hands of them very good sir but there are still some left on the island we have reason to believe and the enterprise is in search of them by the by did templemore find his lady oh yes sir and all's right i believe but i had very little to say to him on the subject humph replied the admiral i am glad to hear it well send them on shore manly to the proper authorities if any more be found they must be hung afterwards when templemore brings them in i am more pleased at having secured these scoundrels than if we had taken a french frigate about three weeks after this conversation the secretary reported to the admiral that the enterprise had made her number outside but that she was becalmed and would not probably be in until the evening that's a pity replied the admiral for the pirates are to be tried this morning he may have more of them on board very true sir but the trial will hardly be over to day the judge will not be in court till one o'clock at the soonest it's of little consequence certainly as it is there are so many that they must be hanged by divisions however as he is within signal distance let them telegraph pirates now on trial' he can pull on shore in his gig if he pleases it was about noon on the same day that the pirates and among them francisco escorted by a strong guard were conducted to the court house and placed at the bar the court house was crowded to excess for the interest excited was intense many of them who had been wounded in the attack upon the property of don cumanos and afterwards captured had died in their confinement still forty five were placed at the bar and their picturesque costume their bearded faces and the atrocities which they had committed created in those present a sensation of anxiety mingled with horror and indignation two of the youngest amongst them had been permitted to turn king's evidence they had been on board of the avenger but a few months still their testimony as to the murder of the crews of three west india ships and the attack upon the property of don cumanos was quite sufficient to condemn the remainder much time was necessarily expended in going through the forms of the court in the pirates answering to their various names and lastly in taking down the detailed evidence of the above men it was late when the evidence was read over to the pirates and they were asked if they had anything to offer in their defence the question was repeated by the judge when hawkhurst was the first to speak to save himself he could scarcely hope his only object was to prevent francisco pleading his cause successfully and escaping the same disgraceful death hawkhurst declared that he had been some time on board the avenger but that he had been taken out of a vessel and forced to serve against his will as could be proved by the captain's son who stood there pointing to francisco who had been in the schooner since her first fitting out that he had always opposed the captain who would not part with him because he was the only one on board who was competent to navigate the schooner that he had intended to rise against him and take the vessel having often stimulated the crew so to do and that as the other men as well as the captain's son could prove if they chose he actually was in confinement for that attempt when the schooner was entering the passage to the caicos and that he was only released because he was acquainted with the passage and threatened to be thrown overboard if he did not take her in that at every risk he had run her on the rocks and aware that the captain would murder him he had shot cain as he was swimming to the shore as the captain's son could prove for he had taxed him with it and he was actually struggling with him for life when the officers and boat's crew separated them and made them both prisoners that he hardly expected that francisco the captain's son would tell the truth to save him as he was his bitter enemy and in the business at the magdalen river which had been long planned for francisco had been sent on shore under the pretence of being wrecked but in fact to ascertain where the booty was and to assist the pirates in their attack francisco had taken the opportunity of putting a bullet through his shoulder which was well known to the other pirates and francisco could not venture to deny he trusted that the court would order the torture to francisco and then he would probably speak the truth at all events let him speak now when hawkhurst had ceased to address the court there was an anxious pause for some minutes the day was fast declining and most parts of the spacious court house were already deeply immersed in gloom while the light sober solemn and almost sad gleamed upon the savage and reckless countenances of the prisoners at the bar the sun had sunk down behind a mass of heavy yet gorgeous clouds fringing their edges with molten gold hawkhurst had spoken fluently and energetically and there was an appearance of almost honesty in his coarse and deep toned voice even the occasional oaths with which his speech was garnished but which we have omitted seemed to be pronounced more in sincerity than in blasphemy and gave a more forcible impression to his narrative we have said that when he concluded there was a profound silence and amid the fast falling shadows of the evening those who were present began to feel for the first time the awful importance of the drama before them the number of lives which were trembling upon the verge of existence depending upon the single word of guilty this painful silence this harrowing suspense was at last broken by a restrained sob from a female but owing to the obscurity involving the body of the court her person could not be distinguished the wail of a woman so unexpected for who could there be of that sex interested in the fate of these desperate men touched the heart of its auditors and appeared to sow the first seeds of compassionate and humane feeling among those who had hitherto expressed and felt nothing but indignation towards the prisoners the judge upon the bench the counsel at the bar and the jury impannelled in their box felt the force of the appeal and it softened down the evil impression created by the address of hawkhurst against the youthful francisco the eyes of all were now directed towards the one doubly accused accused not only by the public prosecutor but even by his associate in crime and the survey was favourable they acknowledged that he was one whose personal qualities might indeed challenge the love of woman in his pride and her lament in his disgrace and as their regard was directed towards him the sun which had been obscured now pierced through a break in the mass of clouds and threw a portion of his glorious beams from a window opposite upon him and him alone while all the other prisoners who surrounded him were buried more or less in deep shadow it was at once evident that his associates were bold yet commonplace villains men who owed their courage their only virtue perhaps to their habits to their physical organisation or the influence of those around them they were mere human butchers with the only adjunct that now that the trade was to be exercised upon themselves they could bear it with sullen apathy a feeling how far removed from true fortitude even hawkhurst though more commanding than the rest with all his daring mien and scowl of defiance looked nothing more than a distinguished ruffian with the exception of francisco the prisoners had wholly neglected their personal appearance and in them the squalid and sordid look of the mendicant seemed allied with the ferocity of the murderer francisco was not only an exception but formed a beautiful contrast to the others and as the evening beams lighted up his figure he stood at the bar if not with all the splendour of a hero of romance certainly a most picturesque and interesting personage elegantly if not richly attired the low sobs at intervals repeated as if impossible to be checked seemed to rouse and call him to a sense of the important part which he was called upon to act in the tragedy there and then performing his face was pale yet composed his mien at once proud and sorrowful his eye was bright yet his glance was not upon those in court but far away fixed like an eagle's upon the gorgeous beams of the setting sun which glowed upon him through the window that was in front of him at last the voice of francisco was heard and all in that wide court started at the sound deep full and melodious as the evening chimes the ears of those present had in the profound silence but just recovered from the harsh deep toned and barbarous idiom of hawkhurst's address when the clear silvery yet manly voice of francisco riveted their attention the jury stretched forth their heads the counsel and all in court turned anxiously round towards the prisoner even the judge held up his forefinger to intimate his wish for perfect silence my lord and gentlemen commenced francisco when i first found myself in this degrading situation i had not thought to have spoken or to have uttered one word in my defence he that has just now accused me has recommended the torture to be applied he has already had his wish for what torture can be more agonising than to find myself where i now am so tortured indeed have i been through a short yet wretched life that i have often felt that anything short of self destruction which would release me would be a blessing but within these few minutes i have been made to acknowledge that i have still feelings in unison with my fellow creatures that i am not yet fit for death and all too young too unprepared to die for who would not reluctantly leave this world while there is such a beauteous sky to love and look upon or while there is one female breast who holds him innocent and has evinced her pity for his misfortunes yes my lord mercy and pity and compassion have not yet fled from earth and therefore do i feel i am too young to die god forgive me but i thought they had for never have they been shown in those with whom by fate i have been connected and it has been from this conviction that i have so often longed for death and now may that righteous god who judges us not here but hereafter enable me to prove that i do not deserve an ignominious punishment from my fellow sinners men my lord i know not the subtleties of the laws nor the intricacy of pleadings first let me assert that i have never robbed but i have restored unto the plundered i have never murdered but i have stood between the assassin's knife and his victim for this have i been hated and reviled by my associates and for this is my life now threatened by those laws against which i never had offended the man who last addressed you has told you that i am the pirate captain's son it is the assertion of the only irreclaimable and utterly remorseless villain among those who now stand before you to be judged the assertion of one whose glory whose joy whose solace has been blood shedding my lord i had it from the mouth of the captain himself previous to his murder by that man that i was not his son his son thank god not so connected with him and in his power i was most certainly and most incomprehensibly before he died he delivered me a packet that would have told me who i am but i have lost it and deeply have i felt the loss one only fact i gained from him whom they would call my father which is that with his own hand he slew yes basely slew my mother the address of francisco was here interrupted by a low deep groan of anguish which startled the whole audience it was now quite dark and the judge ordered the court to be lighted previous to the defence being continued the impatience and anxiety of those present were shown in low murmurs of communication until the lights were brought in the word silence from the judge produced an immediate obedience and the prisoner was ordered to proceed francisco then continued his address commencing with the remembrances of his earliest childhood as he warmed with his subject he became more eloquent his action became energetical without violence and the pallid and modest youth gradually grew into the impassioned and inspired orator he recapitulated rapidly yet distinctly and with terrible force all the startling events in his fearful life there was truth in the tones of his voice there was conviction in his animated countenance there was innocence in his open and expressive brow all who heard believed and scarcely had he concluded his address when the jury appeared impatient to rise and give their verdict in his favour but the judge stood up and addressing the jury told them that it was his most painful duty to remind them that as yet they had heard but assertion beautiful and almost convincing assertion truly but still it was not proof alas observed francisco what evidence can i bring forward except the evidence of those around me at the bar which will not be admitted can i recall the dead from the grave can i expect those who have been murdered to rise again to assert my innocence can i expect that don cumanos will appear from distant leagues to give evidence on my behalf alas he knows not how i am situated or he would have flown to my succour no no not even can i expect that the sweet spanish maiden the last to whom i offered my protection will appear in such a place as this to meet the bold gaze of hundreds she is here replied a manly voice and a passage was made through the crowd and clara supported by edward templemore dressed in his uniform was ushered into the box for the witnesses the appearance of the fair girl who looked round her with alarm created a great sensation as soon as she was sufficiently composed she was sworn and gave her evidence as to francisco's behaviour during the time that she was a prisoner on board of the avenger she produced the packet which had saved the life of francisco and substantiated a great part of his defence she extolled his kindness and his generosity and when she had concluded every one asked of himself can this young man be a pirate and a murderer the reply was it is impossible my lord said edward templemore i request permission to ask the prisoner a question when i was on board of the wreck of the avenger i found this book floating in the cabin i wish to ask the prisoner whether as that young lady has informed me it is his and edward templemore produced the bible it is mine replied francisco may i ask you by what means it came into your possession it is the only relic left of one who is now no more it was the consolation of my murdered mother it has since been mine give it to me sir i may probably need its support now more than ever was your mother murdered say you cried edward templemore with much agitation i have already said so and i now repeat it the judge again rose and recapitulated the evidence to the jury evidently friendly to francisco he was obliged to point out to them that although the evidence of the young lady had produced much which might be offered in extenuation and induce him to submit it to his majesty in hopes of his gracious pardon after condemnation yet that many acts in which the prisoner had been involved had endangered his life and no testimony had been brought forward to prove that he had not at one time acted with the pirates although he might since have repented they would of course remember that the evidence of the mate hawkhurst was not of any value and must dismiss any impression which it might have made against francisco at the same time he had the unpleasant duty to point out that the evidence of the spanish lady was so far prejudicial that it pointed out the good terms subsisting between the young man and the pirate captain much as he was interested in his fate he must reluctantly remind the jury that the evidence on the whole was not sufficient to clear the prisoner and he considered it their duty to return a verdict of guilty against all the prisoners at the bar my lord said edward templemore a few seconds after the judge had resumed his seat may not the contents of this packet the seal of which i have not ventured to break afford some evidence in favour of the prisoner have you any objection that it should be opened previous to the jury delivering their verdict none replied the judge but what are its supposed contents the contents my lord replied francisco are in the writing of the pirate captain he delivered that packet into my hands previous to our quitting the schooner stating that it would inform me who were my parents my lord in my present situation i claim that packet and refuse that its contents should be read in court if i am to die an ignominious death at least those who are connected with me shall not have to blush at my disgrace for the secret of my parentage shall die with me nay nay be ruled by me replied edward templemore with much emotion in the narrative the handwriting of which can be proved by the king's evidence there may be acknowledgment of all you have stated and it will be received as evidence will it not my lord if the handwriting is proved i should think it may replied the judge particularly as the lady was present when the packet was delivered and heard the captain's assertion will you allow it to be offered as evidence young man no my lord replied francisco unless i have permission first to peruse it myself i will not have its contents divulged unless i am sure of an honourable acquittal the jury must deliver their verdict the jury turned round to consult during which edward templemore walked to francisco accompanied by clara to entreat him to allow the packet to be opened but francisco was firm against both their entreaties at last the foreman of the jury rose to deliver the verdict a solemn and awful silence prevailed throughout the court the suspense was painful to a degree my lord said the foreman of the jury our verdict is stop sir said edward templemore as he clasped one arm round the astonished francisco and extended the other towards the foreman stop sir harm him not for he is my brother and my preserver cried clara kneeling on the other side of francisco and holding up her hands in supplication the announcement was electrical the foreman dropped into his seat the judge and whole court were in mute astonishment the dead silence was followed by confusion to which after a time the judge in vain attempted to put a stop edward templemore clara and francisco continued to form the same group and never was there one more beautiful and now that they were together every one in court perceived the strong resemblance between the two young men francisco's complexion was darker than edward's from his constant exposure from infancy to a tropical sun but the features of the two were the same it was some time before the judge could obtain silence in the court and when it had been obtained he was himself puzzled how to proceed edward and francisco who had exchanged a few words were now standing side by side my lord said edward templemore the prisoner consents that the packet shall be opened i do said francisco mournfully although i have but little hope from its contents alas now that i have everything to live for not that i cling to life i feel as if every chance was gone the days of miracles have passed and nothing but the miracle of the reappearance of the pirate captain from the grave can prove my innocence he reappears from the grave to prove thine innocence francisco said a deep hollow voice which startled the whole court and most of all hawkhurst and the prisoners at the bar still more did fear and horror distort their countenances when into the witness box stalked the giant form of cain but it was no longer the figure which we have described in the commencement of this narrative his beard had been removed and he was pale wan and emaciated his sunken eyes his hollow cheek and a short cough which interrupted his speech proved that his days were nearly at a close my lord said cain addressing the judge i am the pirate cain and was the captain of the avenger still am i free i come here voluntarily that i may attest the innocence of that young man as yet my hand has not known the manacle nor my feet the gyves i am not a prisoner nor included in the indictment and at present my evidence is good none know me in this court except those whose testimony as prisoners is unavailing and therefore to save that boy and only to save him i demand that i may be sworn the oath was administered with more than usual solemnity my lord and gentlemen of the jury i have been in court since the commencement of the trial and i declare that every word which francisco has uttered in his own defence is true he is totally innocent of any act of piracy or murder the packet would indeed have proved as much but in that packet there are secrets which i wished to remain unknown to all but francisco and rather than it should be opened i have come forward myself how that young officer discovered that francisco is his brother i know not but if he also is the son of cecilia templemore it is true but the packet will explain all and now my lords that my evidence is received i am content i have done one good deed before i die and i surrender myself as a pirate and a foul murderer to justice true my life is nearly closed thanks to that villain there but i prefer that i should meet that death i merit as an expiation of my many deeds of guilt cain then turned to hawkhurst who was close to him but the mate appeared to be in a state of stupor he had not recovered from his first terror and still imagined the appearance of cain to be supernatural villain exclaimed cain putting his mouth close to hawkhurst's ear doubly damned villain thou'lt die like a dog and unrevenged the boy is safe and i'm alive art thou really living said hawkhurst recovering from his fear yes living yes flesh and blood feel wretch feel this arm and be convinced thou hast felt the power of it before now continued cain sarcastically and now my lord i have done francisco fare thee well i loved thee and have proved my love hate not then my memory and forgive me yes forgive me when i'm no more said cain who then turned his eyes to the ceiling of the court house yes there she is francisco there she is and see cried he extending both arms above his head she smiles upon yes francisco your sainted mother smiles and pardons the sentence was not finished for hawkhurst when cain's arms were upheld perceived his knife in his girdle and with the rapidity of thought he drew it out and passed it through the body of the pirate captain cain fell heavily on the floor while the court was again in confusion hawkhurst was secured and cain raised from the ground i thank thee hawkhurst said cain in an expiring voice another murder thou hast to answer for and you have saved me from the disgrace not of the gallows but of the gallows in thy company francisco boy farewell and cain groaned deeply and expired thus perished the renowned pirate captain who in his life had shed so much blood and whose death produced another murder blood for blood the body was removed and it now remained but for the jury to give their verdict all the prisoners were found guilty with the exception of francisco who left the dock accompanied by his newly found brother and the congratulations of every individual who could gain access to him chapter eighteen conclusion our first object will be to explain to the reader by what means edward templemore was induced to surmise that in francisco whom he considered as a rival he had found a brother and also to account for the reappearance of the pirate cain in pursuance of his orders edward templemore had proceeded on board of the wreck of the avenger and while his men were employed in collecting articles of great value which were on board of her he had descended into the cabin which was partly under water he had picked up a book floating near the lockers and on examination found it to be a bible surprised at seeing such a book on board of a pirate he had taken it with him when he returned to the enterprise and had shown it to clara who immediately recognised it as the property of francisco the book was saturated with the salt water and as edward mechanically turned over the pages he referred to the title page to see if there was any name upon it there was not but he observed that the blank or fly leaf next to the binding had been pasted down and that there was writing on the other side in its present state it was easily detached from the cover and then to his astonishment he read the name of cecilia templemore his own mother he knew well the history how he had been saved and his mother and brother supposed to be lost and it may readily be imagined how great was his anxiety to ascertain by what means her bible had come into the possession of francisco he dared not think francisco was his brother that he was so closely connected with one he still supposed to be a pirate but the circumstance was possible and although he had intended to have remained a few days longer he now listened to the entreaties of clara whose peculiar position on board was only to be justified by the peculiar position from which she had been rescued and returning that evening to the wreck he set fire to her and then made all sail for port royal fortunately he arrived as we have stated on the day of the trial and as soon as the signal was made by the admiral he immediately manned his gig and taking clara with him in case her evidence might be of use arrived at the court house when the trial was about half over in our last chapter but one we stated that cain had been wounded by hawkhurst when he was swimming on shore and had sunk the ball had entered his chest and passed through his lungs the contest between hawkhurst and francisco and their capture by edward had taken place on the other side of the ridge of rocks in the adjacent cove and although francisco had seen cain disappear and concluded that he was dead it was not so he had again risen above the water and dropping his feet and finding bottom he contrived to crawl out and wade into a cave adjacent where he lay down to die but in this cave there was one of the avenger's boats two of the pirates mortally wounded and the four kroumen who had concealed themselves there with the intention of taking no part in the conflict and as soon as it became dark of making their escape in the boat which they had hauled up dry into the cave cain staggered in recovered the dry land and fell pompey the krouman perceiving his condition went to his assistance and bound up his wound and the stanching of the blood soon revived the pirate captain the other pirates died unaided although the island was searched in every direction this cave from the water flowing into it escaped the vigilance of the british seamen and when they re embarked with the majority of the pirates captured cain and the kroumen were undiscovered as soon as it was dark cain informed them of his intentions and although the kroumen would probably have left him to his fate yet as they required his services to know how to steer to some other island he was assisted into the stern sheets and the boat was backed out of the cave by the direction of cain they passed through the passage between the great island and the northern caique and before daylight were far away from any chance of capture cain had now to a certain degree recovered and knowing that they were in the channel of the small traders he pointed out to the kroumen that if supposed to be pirates they would inevitably be punished although not guilty and that they must pass off as the crew of a small coasting vessel which had been wrecked he then with the assistance of pompey cut off his beard as close as he could and arranged his dress in a more european style they had neither water nor provisions and were exposed to a vertical sun fortunately for them and still more fortunately for francisco on the second day they were picked up by an american brig bound to antigua cain narrated his fictitious disasters but said nothing about his wound the neglect of which would certainly have occasioned his death a very few days after he appeared at the trial had he not fallen by the malignity of hawkhurst anxious to find his way to port royal for he was indifferent as to his own life and only wished to save francisco he was overjoyed to meet a small schooner trading between the islands bound to port royal in that vessel he obtained a passage for himself and the kroumen and had arrived three days previous to the trial and during that time had remained concealed until the day that the admiralty court assembled it may be as well here to remark that cain's reason for not wishing the packet to be opened was that among the other papers relative to francisco were directions for the recovery of the treasure which he had concealed and which of course he wished to be communicated to francisco alone we will leave the reader to imagine what passed between francisco and edward after the discovery of their kindred and proceed to state the contents of the packet which the twin brothers now opened in the presence of clara alone we must however condense the matter which was very voluminous it stated that cain whose real name was charles osborne had sailed in a fine schooner from bilboa for the coast of africa to procure a cargo of slaves and had been out about twenty four hours when the crew perceived a boat apparently with no one in her about a mile ahead of them the water was then smooth and the vessel had but little way as soon as they came up with the boat they lowered down their skiff to examine her the men sent in the skiff soon returned towing the boat alongside lying at the bottom of the boat were found several men almost dead and reduced to skeletons and in the stern sheets a negro woman with a child at her breast and a white female in the last state of exhaustion osborne was then a gay and unprincipled man but not a hardened villain and murderer as he afterwards became he had compassion and feeling they were all taken on board the schooner some recovered others were too much exhausted among those restored was cecilia templemore and the infant who at first had been considered quite dead but the negro woman exhausted by the demands of her nursling and her privations expired as she was being removed from the boat a goat that fortunately was on board proved a substitute for the negress and before osborne had arrived off the coast the child had recovered its health and vigour and the mother her extreme beauty we must now pass over a considerable portion of the narrative osborne was impetuous in his passions and cecilia templemore became his victim he had indeed afterwards quieted her qualms of conscience by a pretended marriage when he arrived at the brazils with his cargo of human flesh but that was little alleviation of her sufferings she who had been indulged in every luxury who had been educated with the greatest care was now lost for ever an outcast from the society to which she could never hope to return and associating with those she both dreaded and despised she passed her days and her nights in tears and had soon more cause for sorrow from the brutal treatment she received from osborne who had been her destroyer her child was her only solace but for him and the fear of leaving him to the demoralising influence of those about him she would have laid down and died but she lived for him for him attempted to recall osborne from his career of increasing guilt bore meekly with reproaches and with blows at last osborne changed his nefarious life for one of deeper guilt he became a pirate and still carried with him cecilia and her child this was the climax of her misery she now wasted from day to day and grief would soon have terminated her existence had it not been hastened by the cruelty of cain who upon an expostulation on her part followed up with a denunciation of the consequences of his guilty career struck her with such violence that she sank under the blow she expired with a prayer that her child might be rescued from a life of guilt and when the then repentant cain promised what he never did perform she blessed him too before she died such was the substance of the narrative as far as it related to the unfortunate mother of these two young men who when they had concluded sat hand in hand in mournful silence this however was soon broken by the innumerable questions asked by edward of his brother as to what he could remember of their ill fated parent which were followed up by the history of francisco's eventful life and the treasure edward said francisco i cannot take possession of it no nor shall you either replied edward it belongs to the captors and must be shared as prize money you will never touch one penny of it but i shall i trust pocket a very fair proportion of it however keep this paper as it is addressed to you the admiral had been made acquainted with all the particulars of the eventful trial and had sent a message to edward requesting that as soon as he and his brother could make it convenient he would be happy to see them at the penn as well as the daughter of the spanish governor whom he must consider as being under his protection during the time that she remained at port royal this offer was gladly accepted by clara and on the second day after the trial they proceeded up to the penn clara and francisco were introduced and apartments and suitable attendance provided for the former templemore said the admiral i'm afraid i must send you away to porto rico to assure the governor of his daughter's safety i would rather you would send some one else sir and i'll assure her happiness in the meantime what by marrying her humph you've a good opinion of yourself wait till you're a captain sir i hope i shall not have to wait long sir replied edward demurely by the bye said the admiral did you not say you have notice of treasure concealed in those islands my brother has i have not we must send for it i think we must send you edward mr francisco you must go with him with pleasure sir replied francisco laughing but i think i'd rather wait till edward is a captain his wife and his fortune ought to come together i think i shall not deliver up my papers until the day of his marriage upon my word said captain manly i wish templemore you had your commission for there seems so much depending on it the young lady's happiness my share of the prize money and the admiral's eighth really admiral it becomes a common cause and i'm sure he deserves it so do i manly replied the admiral and to prove that i have thought so here comes mr hadley with it in his hand it only wants one little thing to complete it which is your signature admiral i presume replied captain manly taking a pen full of ink and presenting it to his senior officer exactly replied the admiral scribbling at the bottom of the paper and now it does not want that captain templemore i wish you joy edward made a very low obeisance as his flushed countenance indicated his satisfaction i cannot give commissions admiral said francisco presenting a paper in return but i can give information and you will find it not unimportant for the treasure appears of great value god bless my soul manly you must start at daylight exclaimed the admiral why there is enough to load your sloop there read it and then i will write your orders and enclose a copy of it for fear of accident that was to have been my fortune said francisco with a grave smile but i would not touch it very right boy a fine principle but we are not quite so particular said the admiral now where's the young lady let her know that dinner's on the table a fortnight after this conversation captain manly returned with the treasure and the enterprise commanded by another officer returned from porto rico with a letter from the governor in reply to one from the admiral in which the rescue of his daughter by edward had been communicated the letter was full of thanks to the admiral and compliments to edward and what was of more importance it sanctioned the union of the young officer with his daughter with a dozen boxes of gold doubloons about six weeks after the above mentioned important conversation mr witherington who had been reading a voluminous packet of letters in his breakfast room in finsbury square pulled his bell so violently that old jonathan thought his master must be out of his senses this however did not induce him to accelerate his solemn and measured pace and he made his appearance at the door as usual without speaking why don't that fellow answer the bell cried mr witherington i am here sir said jonathan solemnly well so you are but confound you you come like the ghost of a butler but who do you think is coming here jonathan i cannot tell sir but i can you solemn old edward's coming here coming home directly is he to sleep in his old room sir replied the imperturbable butler no the best bedroom why jonathan he is married he is made a captain captain templemore yes sir and he has found his brother jonathan his twin brother yes sir his brother francis that was supposed to be lost but it's a long story jonathan and a very wonderful one his poor mother has long been dead in caelo quies said jonathan casting up his eyes but his brother has turned up again resurgam said the butler they will be here in ten days so let everything be in readiness jonathan god bless my soul continued the old gentleman i hardly know what i'm about it's a spanish girl jonathan what is sir what is sir who captain templemore's wife and he was tried as a pirate who sir who sir why francis his brother jonathan you're a stupid old fellow have you any further commands sir no no there that'll do go away and in three weeks after this conversation captain and mrs templemore and his brother frank were established in the house to the great delight of mr witherington for he had long been tired of solitude and old jonathan the twin brothers were a comfort to him in his old age they closed his eyes in peace they divided his blessing and his large fortune and thus ends our history of the pirate
